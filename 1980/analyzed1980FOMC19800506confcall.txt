I think we should proceed, even thoughsome of the Board members have not yet arrived, because I have verylittle time myself. Mr. Axilrod, why don't you proceed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that they should proceed with the discussion due to limited time.


Passage number 3.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, [as the Committee knows], ofcourse, we have had continued very weak money supply data since thelast get-together. And total reserves for the four-week intermetingperiod, estimated from what we can tell about the amount of requiredreserves and the excess reserves that would be held at roughly currentinterest rate levels, seem to be running about $800 million below thetarget path. And that's with borrowing coming down very close tonominal levels. In the current week, borrowing ex First Pennsylvaniais now down to about $500 million. Our projection and expectation isthat in the next two weeks it will run around $250 million ex FirstPennsylvania. Thus, if any more reserves were put in to try to attainthe total reserve path, they would have to go into excess reserves,which would cause a very sharp drop in the funds rate from the recentlevel. The funds rate has been moving down toward the 13 percentbottom limit of the Committee's range and yesterday was below it.Thus, effectively now, the funds rate is a constraint on theadjustments we would make to the total reserve path. We won't haveany additional data on the aggregates until tomorrow, but I would notexpect them to change substantially enough to indicate that the fundsrate would not remain a constraint in adjustments to the reserve path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing factual information and discussing the current state of money supply and reserves.


Passage number 4.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The general question we face here, towhich no one knows the answer, is how forceably we have to push inreserves to get the money supply turned around or what influence thathas on the federal funds rate. We are operating in an area in whichwe haven't operated before under the present technique. But it seemsquite clear that if we do not change the federal funds rateconstraint, we will simply be operating at a 13 percent level of thefederal funds rate indefinitely without any assurance, and with aprobability, that that will not in the short run turn the money supplyaround. The question in my mind is how much additional leeway shouldbe given. I suspect that 12 percent [as a lower limit] will mean thatwe will operate with a 12 percent federal funds rate, so I wouldpropose going somewhat below that. My own hope would be that thefunds rate won't necessarily decline all that much further with thenecessary injection of reserves. But we don't know, and I think weought to give ourselves a little more leeway. I would suggest 11percent as a possibility, but people could talk about other numbers aswell. We meet in two weeks; whether that kind of adjustment will holdus until then I do not know. It all depends upon what happens to thedata, what happens to reserves, and what happens to interest ratesduring that period. We could have a little more leeway if we moved itdown to 10 percent, which is still consistent more or less with thepresent level of market rates for instruments other than federalfunds. But that presumably would also be consistent withfurther declines in those rates. It would give us more opportunity tobe sure that the reserve base was performing the way it's supposed toperform. But that's a matter of choice. I think we have to make somereduction, and it's a question of how much. I will stop right there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Although there is a discussion about the appropriate level of the federal funds rate, there is no clear contention or disagreement among the speakers. The passage is more focused on considering different options and uncertainty about the outcome.


Passage number 5.
MR. MAYO. Bob Mayo here, Paul. Just to put it on the table5/6/80I move that we go to a 10 to 17 percent tolerance range [for the fundsrate]. That's 3 perentage points off on both ends. The symmetry withremoving the 3 percent surcharge is purely coincidental. But I thinkthat would give us the flexibility we need.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It appears to be a suggestion or proposal being made by Mr. Mayo.


Passage number 6.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Other comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

"Other comments" does not indicate contention or disagreement in itself. It simply suggests that there are additional comments or opinions to be mentioned.


Passage number 7.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Paul, this is Tony Solomon. I thinkwe ought to move the funds rate as gradually as we feel we can. Eventhough I feel that we will end up with 11 percent, I would hope thatwe could operate for the next week or so at slightly above 11 percent.So I would like to recommend that we put the floor at 11 percent. Idon't have any strong feeling on the ceiling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Paul and Tony Solomon seem to be in agreement about gradually moving the funds rate and setting the floor at 11 percent. Tony Solomon also mentions that he doesn't have any strong feeling on the ceiling, which implies that there is no disagreement on that aspect either.


Passage number 8.
MR. BALLES. Paul, this is John Balles. I would go alongwith moving the floor down to 11 percent; I think we have to take[whatever steps] we have to take to get the money supply turnedaround. But, having said that, I do want to convey to you the strongfeeling that was expressed to me over the past week when I met withseveral members of our board of directors. I've written you a letter,which probably hasn't landed on your desk yet, hoping and urging thatyou would find an appropriate occasion to make a strong publicstatement as to why we have not resisted this decline of interestrates. [I'd urge you to say] that it does not mean we're [abandoningour] anti-inflation fight and to explain that it's to head off theunexpected and undesired absolute shrinking of the money supply. Inshort, these directors feel that there's a great danger of a broad-based public misunderstanding of what we're up to that may beinterpreted as an easing of our anti-inflation policy and may resultin some bad effects on inflation psychology.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing a suggestion and conveying the feeling of some directors regarding the need for a strong public statement.


Passage number 9.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm aware of that [risk]. We've beenpretty lucky in escaping it so far. I think we've fairly largelyescaped it. I do not have a lot of time, so I hope the comments canbe kept fairly brief. Maybe we could hear from the members first.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply acknowledges the risk and mentions that they have been fortunate in avoiding it so far. They express a preference for brief comments and suggest hearing from the members first.


Passage number 10.
MR. MORRIS. Paul, this is Frank Morris. I would supportmoving [the lower limit] to 10 percent. I think 11 percent is alittle tight, even for the [short] interval because the commercialpaper rate is already below 11 percent. So if we have to catch upwith the rest of the money market structure, it seems to me that 10percent is consistent with the rest of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Morris is merely expressing his opinion and suggesting a different percentage.


Passage number 11.
MR. GUFFEY. Paul, Roger Guffey. I would reluctantly accept11 percent but would be happier with 12 percent. I would hope thatthe move down would be very cautious and that [we] will catch up withthe market someplace around [that] level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Guffey is stating his preferred interest rate, but there is no opposing viewpoint presented.


Passage number 12.
MS. TEETERS. Funds are already trading at around 12 percent,aren't they, Steve.

Passage number 13.
MR. AXILROD. Peter may wish to speak to where the funds rateis this morning. Yesterday it averaged 12-1/4 percent. I think it'saround there this morning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Axilrod mentions the funds rate at 12-1/4 percent, and he suggests that it is around the same level that morning.


Passage number 14.
MR. STERNLIGHT. The last I heard it was 11-7/8 percent. Themarket is really waiting to see what actions the Desk might takebecause there is a sense of reserves being available today.

Passage number 16.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I think it depends on the Committee'sdecision, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Sternlight is simply stating his opinion, acknowledging that the decision ultimately rests with the Committee.


Passage number 17.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I thought it depended upon the reservebase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
The given passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a thought about something depending on the reserve base.


Passage number 18.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, compared with our interim nonborrowedreserves objective, we're looking at a need to take out something like$500 to $700 million. But one might say that there isn't a great needto take that out, given how far below we're running on total reserves,as Steve has outlined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 19.
MS. TEETERS. If you left the $500 to $700 million in, whatwould happen, Peter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any elements of contention or disagreement. It is a simple conversation where one person, Ms. Teeters, is asking Peter for his thoughts on what would happen if they left a certain amount of money in.


Passage number 20.
MR. STERNLIGHT. The funds rate presumably would soften, downto whatever lower bound the Committee agrees on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 21.
MS. TEETERS. All the way to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement made by someone named Ms. Teeters about going "all the way to 10 percent."


Passage number 22.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I think it could, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Sternlight is simply expressing his opinion that something is possible.


Passage number 23.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're not talking about a lower bound thatis necessarily binding every day. Who else has a comment. I'll justgo down the list. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is simply requesting comments or input from individuals on a list.


Passage number 24.
MR. RICE. I don't think it makes a great deal of differencewhether we lower it to 11 or 10 percent. I would go along witheither. It's a matter of [what level] we expect the funds rate toreach if we continue to follow our objectives. So, either 11 or 10percent [is acceptable to me]; I don't think it makes much differenceat this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Rice, is expressing agreement and flexibility by stating that it doesn't make much difference whether the interest rate is lowered to 11 or 10 percent.


Passage number 25.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roos. Is there no Mr. Roos.SPEAKER(.). He's coming in a second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Schultz.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage only mentions Governor Schultz without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 27.
MR. SCHULTZ. Well, given what appears to be extreme weaknessin the economy, I would favor 10 percent. I had been afraid thatperhaps we could get some surge in either the economy or the moneysupply but the chances of that at this point seem slim or none. So, Iwould agree with Frank Morris that we ought to go down to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 28.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unable to come to a decision, Governor Teeters called a meeting with his advisors to discuss the best course of action.


Passage number 29.
MS. TEETERS. I suppose I'd go to 10 percent if the market isas weak as it sounds. If we settle on 11 percent, I think we will beback here pretty quickly, probably before the end of the week orcertainly the early part of next week. We might as well giveourselves the leeway and let the market sort of find its own level atthis point. So, I would favor going to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Teeters, is expressing her opinion about what interest rate to set and suggesting that they go with a lower rate (10 percent) to allow the market to stabilize.


Passage number 30.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage about Governor Wallich.


Passage number 31.
5/6/80MR. WALLICH. I think we're in danger of making a greatmistake. The real policy action is on interest rates, not on themoney supply. Whatever happens to the money supply over a period of amonth has next to no effect on the economy. But these interest rates--not only internationally but domestically--convey an impression of adrastic shift in policy and create expectations that we're all forinflation as soon as we work out of this difficulty. So, I'd stickwith 13 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: While there is a difference in opinion being expressed by Mr. Wallich, there is no contention or disagreement as he is the sole speaker in the passage.


Passage number 32.
MR. ROOS. This is Larry Roos. I would strongly recommendthe 10 percent figure. I think we've got to be willing to letinterest rates move fairly freely, both upward and downward. And 10percent would be my position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their personal recommendation and position, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 33.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do others want to make a quick comment.

MR. BAUGHMAN. I would prefer the 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Baughman simply states his preference for the 10 percent.


Passage number 35.
MR. WINN. In Cleveland we would prefer the 10 percent, too;we need the flexibility.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There does not seem to be any contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Eastburn is simply stating that Philadelphia would support the statement made by John Balles.


Passage number 38.
MR. WILLES. Minneapolis prefers 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states that Minneapolis prefers a 10 percent option without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 39.
MR. FORRESTAL. Atlanta prefers the higher number, but we'dbe willing to go with 10 percent. However, we still think, as doesGovernor Wallich, that inflation is the major problem and that twomonths of decline in the money supply should not cause us tooverreact. So, I would prefer a number higher than 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Forrestal, states that Atlanta prefers a higher number, but they are willing to go with 10 percent. They believe inflation is the major problem and that two months of decline in the money supply should not cause overreaction. Mr. Forrestal personally prefers a number higher than 10 percent but does not express any disagreement with the others mentioned.


Passage number 40.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we obviously have a somewhat splitview. Does anybody have any further comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage indicates that there may be different opinions or perspectives, but it does not explicitly mention any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 41.
MR. MAYO. My support of 10 percent, Mr. Chairman, is reallyto give the Desk the flexibility that I think it badly needs. I'm notsaying that we ought to go to 10 percent; we should do what comesnaturally in terms of the way the market responds. But I see noparticular point to moving [the lower limit] to 11 percent and thenhaving to come back in another week or so and move it to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Mayo is expressing his support for a 10 percent limit and advocating for flexibility in the decision-making process.


Passage number 42.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I really feel that it's not aquestion of catching up with the market. Whatever action we take willinfluence the market. We have to be perceived as moving fairlygradually and prudently. And I would hope that everybody feels aswell that we want to retain the perception that the Fed is notchanging its policy [of fighting inflation]. So it's really importantto show a sense of prudence and gradualism in this [so as] not toprecipitate further sharp declines in the market rates by peopleseeing us move so abruptly to a level as low as 10 percent. I wouldhope we would move down to 12 or 11-1/2 percent in the next week or soand maybe stay there for a week, and then move to 11 percent ifnecessary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and hoping that everyone else agrees as well. They are emphasizing the importance of being perceived as cautious and gradual in their actions to avoid causing further declines in the market rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 43.
5/6/80MR. ROOS. There are [several] points I would like to make.First of all, we have announced that the foundation of our policy isto permit money to grow at 5.5 percent. Secondly, we have announcedthat we have abandoned the policy of attempting to stabilize interestrates. And thirdly, I think we recognize that the most importantobjective of the Federal Reserve today is to restore credibility inour willingness and our ability to stick with a long-range policy andnot change course the minute any short-term phenomenon occurs. So inaddition to what Tony Solomon said [regarding] our objectives, I thinkthe most important objective is consistency and re-establishing ourcredibility. And I know of no way to destroy that credibility morequickly than to start dancing back toward the stabilization ofinterest rates, after you and all the rest of us have said that we'reno longer targeting on the fed funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that they have abandoned the policy of attempting to stabilize interest rates, suggesting a difference in opinion or approach from previous policies.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 44.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think there is some question as tohow credibility gets defined in these circumstances, which I supposeis what the argument is about. In my mind, the one thing that bearsupon this a little is that whatever we decide is going to be publishedfairly quickly. I don't know what way that cuts, but it leads me tobe a little more conservative than I would otherwise be. And thatlends some support to the 11 percent number. On the other hand, Idon't like the idea of just going to 11 percent and sitting there on afloor for too long, because I think it might be inconsistent--thoughwe don't know what the money supply figures will be--in getting [moneygrowth] turned around. So I'm left in a bit of dilemma. But we canalways meet again. And if it makes [Committee members] more happy orif we maximize the satisfaction and minimize the risk by taking aninterim step to 11 percent, recognizing that we may have to come backnext week, that's okay with me, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes 

Explanation: The speaker expresses uncertainty and conflicting views in the passage. They question how credibility is defined, express conservative tendencies but also concerns about the long-term effects of sitting on a floor at 11 percent. They acknowledge being left in a dilemma and suggest the possibility of meeting again or taking an interim step. This indicates that there is some contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 45.
MS. TEETERS. You know, Paul, I'm a little disturbed by thefact that when [the funds rate was] going up nobody was concernedabout the speed at which it went up. It ratcheted up over a period ofabout six weeks. And if we are really going to follow this policy,then we're going to have to let the market determine how rapidly itcomes down. It seems to me we should give ourselves some leeway andif we're wrong, the market will turn the rates around and they will goback up again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and concerns about the speed at which the funds rate went up and the need to give themselves some leeway in bringing it down. There is no counter argument or disagreement presented in the passage.


Passage number 46.
MR. SCHULTZ. I would hate to see that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement expresses a negative emotion ("hate") but does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 47.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We may be in a situation where literallyin order to get the [money supply] turned around [the funds rate] hasto go very low and then go right up again, which bothers some people,including me. But I don't know how to avoid that either. If we wereonly talking about the funds rate, it would be one thing. But we'retalking about dragging the whole structure [of interest rates],probably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker states that the funds rate may need to go very low and then go right up again, which bothers some people, including the speaker. This indicates disagreement or dissatisfaction with the suggested approach of lowering and then raising the funds rate.


Passage number 48.
MS. TEETERS. Well, with the prime rate at 17-1/2 percent, itdoesn't bother me very much to drag it down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply expresses the speaker's personal opinion or perspective on the matter.


Passage number 49.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That I don't think there'd be any argumentwith. Well, the choice is between 10 and 11 percent, I think; and Idon't know that anybody wants to change his or her mind basically. Itcomes out with a slight majority for 10 percent, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their own opinion and acknowledging that there may not be any argument against it. They also mention that there is a slight majority in favor of 10 percent, suggesting that there is agreement among the majority.


Passage number 50.
 Well,maybe--5/6/80MS. TEETERS. Could we settle for 10-1/2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a short message or note and does not express any clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 51.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement followed by an expression of uncertainty.


Passage number 53.
MR. MORRIS. Paul, this is Frank Morris. I wouldn't objectto adopting 11 percent, with the proviso that we have another meetinga week from today. I just don't think that 11 percent is going to doit. But if you want to proceed on that basis, that would beacceptable to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Morris is suggesting adopting 11 percent with the proviso of having another meeting to discuss it further. He expresses his uncertainty about whether 11 percent will work but says he is willing to proceed on that basis if others agree.


Passage number 54.
MR. ROOS. This is Larry Roos. I feel that setting up ameeting a week from now could be bad practice, if we were to toleratea further withdrawal of reserves. Our big problem right now is thatthe aggregates are undershooting our targets. If, for example, forfour or five days the Desk had to withdraw reserves in order to keepthe funds rate at 11 percent, that would further exacerbate ourundershooting problems. And I think we'd end up being accused ofhaving once again been procyclical in making the prospects for arecession even more real.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and concerns about the potential negative effects of setting up a meeting a week from now.
