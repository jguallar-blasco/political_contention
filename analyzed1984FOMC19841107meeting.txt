That's really what theirprinciple is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a list of attendees at a meeting.


Passage number 2.
MR. CROSS. Well, they don't sell only on those celebratedoccasions when they have come in and hit the market, of course. Theydo put some of this in over time. For a long period of time they hadfollowed, in varying degrees, the practice of putting these amounts induring periods when it seemed sensible to them or when they wanted todo it. They don't follow and have not followed, as far as I know, thepractice of consistently putting these amounts in the market on aregular basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of factual information regarding the practice of putting certain amounts into the market over time.


Passage number 3.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If I remember correctly--Ted Trumanmight know--when I was at the Treasury the amount of the two itemsthat Henry mentioned was $1 to $2 billion a year. And we did not urgethem to follow a policy, Henry, of immediately selling it out as theygot it in, but they did try to follow an overall, longer-term policyof averaging out that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply recalling their experience at the Treasury and discussing a policy recommendation.


Passage number 4.
MR. CROSS. They've been doing this for many years and havealways done it in this way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the pattern of behavior.


Passage number 5.
 The amounts I think are larger than--MR. TRUMAN. It sticks in my mind that troop payments weresomewhat less than $100 million a month. That would be somewhat morethan $1 billion just on that score alone in a calendar year and thenthey would have a couple of hundred million in income.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 6.
MR. CROSS. Troop costs certainly used to be at least thatmuch; that may have declined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is not expressing any form of disagreement or contention. It is simply stating a fact or observation about troop costs potentially declining.


Passage number 7.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other discussion. Well, I take itthat there is a willingness to renegotiate all the swaps or to renewthem for another year. There is not much renegotiation involved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a hypothetical situation in which there may be a willingness to renegotiate or renew certain swaps.

Passage number 10.
MR. CROSS. I will assume the Committee agrees and willproceed accordingly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker assumes that the committee agrees with his statement and will act accordingly.


Passage number 11.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll approve them when they are done. Wehave to ratify the transactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.

Explanation: The statement "So moved" indicates agreement or approval of a motion, rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 13.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Mr. Sternlight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This phrase indicates that there is no disagreement or objection among the participants.


Passage number 14.
MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix.

Passage number 15.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is just stating that there are questions without providing any opposition or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 16.
MR. WALLICH. On this foreign issue: If the spread firstwent down and then went back up to where it was at the time of theissue, is there any justification for any bank to say that they wouldhave lost money had they gone in on that and that they were smart notto go in on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there may be disagreement or contention regarding whether there is any justification for a bank to claim they would have lost money by investing in the issue.


Passage number 17.
11/7/84MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I think some who went in on it feltthat it was worth something, just for the prestige or the advertisingfactor. One had that sense on the bids that came in, and I think thatsome modest losses probably were taken in the course of doing that.Certainly, one hears that the next time around the spread is notlikely to be as large as that 32 basis points--that maybe half thatwould be justifiable. That was the feeling I was getting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 18.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The Japanese felt an obligation tocooperate. I think that was a significant factor that wouldn'tnecessarily be there in the future to such a degree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a personal opinion ("I think that was a significant factor"), but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement with anyone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 19.
MR. GUFFEY. I would like to inquire, Peter: When did wedrop the borrowing level from $750 to $700 million. I must tell youas a preface that I was surprised. The first time I realized it wasfrom the Bluebook, which I thought was a mistake; I went back to thedaily wires and there was no indication that I could find that theborrowing level had been dropped.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Guffey is stating that he was surprised to learn about the change in borrowing level, but he does not express any disagreement or contention with the decision.


Passage number 20.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Just a week ago, I believe. I am confidentit was mentioned. Well, I can't say I read the wire of the call. Iknow that it certainly was reviewed at the conference call.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply mentions a conversation that took place and the speaker's awareness of it. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 21.
MR. AXILROD. If it wasn't in the wire, it should have been.It must have been an oversight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It suggests that something should have been included in "the wire" but might have been unintentionally overlooked.


Passage number 22.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Last Thursday or Friday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: N/A


Passage number 23.
MR. GUFFEY. I think I went back over [the wires of] the lastweek.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they reviewed the wires from the previous week.


Passage number 24.
MR. AXILROD. It was right after that first week of the two-week period. We ended up at $700 million right about that time forthe average borrowing level and it seemed sensible to make it $700million, given all that had happened. It should have been in thememorandum of the call. If it wasn't, it was certainly an oversight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing a logical decision and a possible oversight.


Passage number 25.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, I could be mistaken, but I don't think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker is stating their opinion about being mistaken, but there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 26.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It has been an interesting market. Ithink that the range of short-term interest rates is predicated moreon a market anticipation of a fed funds rate closer to 9-1/2 percentthan the 10 or 9-7/8 percent that it has been averaging lately. So,there is a question--not that we're getting into that now--butassuming there's some further easing, the question is whether marketswill assume that's the last; I doubt that they will. They'll probablyassume there will be a discount rate cut later on and the markets willthen take it even further and we may continue to get some lower ratesthan the projections.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the following passage. The speaker states that the range of short-term interest rates is predicated more on a market anticipation of a fed funds rate closer to 9-1/2 percent, while it has been averaging at 10 or 9-7/8 percent. This suggests a disagreement between market expectations and the actual average rate. Additionally, the speaker expresses doubt that markets will assume that any further easing will be the last, implying a difference in opinions regarding future interest rate cuts.


Passage number 27.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comments. We have to ratify thetransactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  The statement "We have to ratify the transactions" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the transactions need to be ratified.


Passage number 28.
MR. MARTIN. So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "So moved" indicates agreement and a lack of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 29.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Mr. Kichline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "without objection" indicates agreement or unanimity among the individuals involved.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 30.
MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the use of the word "Statement" in brackets, indicating that Mr. Kichline's response may challenge or contradict the previous statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 31.
]11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say the economy was expanding morerapidly in September and October. This is what the employment figuresfor October show as I understand it. That does not seem to be matchedby industrial production or by consumption necessarily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, there is contention or disagreement. The author questions the claim that the economy was expanding more rapidly in September and October. They argue that this assertion is not supported by the industrial production or consumption figures.


Passage number 32.
MR. KICHLINE. We said more rapidly in October than inSeptember.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states that something happened at a faster pace in October compared to September.


Passage number 33.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In employment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention related to employment.


Passage number 34.
MR. KICHLINE. That's true. The gains in employment inOctober were rather spectacular; it's the highest increase in over ayear. I think that's unsustainable. It looks a little odd.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kichline is expressing a perspective that the high increase in employment in October is unsustainable, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument presented in the passage.


Passage number 35.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand the number. How do youinterpret the unemployment claims figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply asks for an interpretation of the unemployment claims figure, there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 36.
MR. KICHLINE. To start out I mentioned conflicting signs,and that indeed is one of them. Initial claims for unemploymentinsurance have been edging higher, including those for the week afterthe labor market reports were taken. We are estimating, as I noted,that industrial production was up about a quarter of a percent inOctober and that's better than a 0.6 percent decline. But the Octoberlevel of production is still below what we saw in the summer. Thereare many what I would view as conflicting indicators of what ishappening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions conflicting signs and indicators, which suggests that there is not a clear consensus or agreement on what is happening in the economy.


Passage number 37.
MR. PARTEE. Well, a lot of that increase in employment inOctober was in nonmanufacturing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the increase in employment in October.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 38.
MR. KICHLINE. The bulk of it. I think industrial productionis related [more] to the manufacturing employment. But for somereason, people are going out and hiring lots of new employees inservices and trades.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates disagreement or contention because the speaker mentions that they believe industrial production is more related to manufacturing employment, while other people are hiring new employees in services and trades. This suggests a difference in perspective or opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 39.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. To unload the imports and sell them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 40.
MR. PARTEE. To get them off the docks. Well, that could be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 41.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions a person's name without providing any information or context.


Passage number 42.
MR. MORRIS. I met yesterday with the chairman of theI asked him about the October retail sales. He saidthat their sales were lower than they expected and as a consequencethat their inventories are up about 5 percent from where they thoughtthey would be. He attributes it largely to the fact that Octoberweather was unusually warm and that people just don't buy winterclothing until the weather turns cold. He is expecting a very strongChristmas selling season. That, for whatever it's worth, is theview.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 43.
MR. PARTEE. He does recognize that he had a very softOctober.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a statement made by Mr. Partee, acknowledging that someone recognized or admitted to having a soft October.


Passage number 44.
MR. MORRIS. Yes. But he thinks he knows why--the weatherfactor. It wasn't something that alarms him.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that Mr. Morris believes he knows why something does not alarm him.


Passage number 45.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 46.
11/7/84MR. MARTIN. I just want to underline some of the mixedsignals, Jim. I note that the Michigan consumer confidence measurewas off a little in October. I don't put a big weight on that. Thehours worked quantum always puzzles me a bit, but I notice the hoursworked were down in October according to the Labor Department. TheChairman has mentioned that initial claims for unemployment were up.The purchasing agents survey is not a good quantitative measure--itwas revised three times ex post out of the [unintelligible] data--butfor whatever it's worth it shows reductions in new orders, deliveryspeed, inventories, and payrolls, and less price increases. I thinkperhaps more important were the preliminary indications that thethird-quarter real GNP may be revised downward due to the merchandisetrade deficit number. If that is 1.7, not 2.7 percent, it may requirea rethinking of some of the inventory changes. It already has beenrevised down once from 3.6 percent. I don't know what a soft landingis, but an 80 percent decline from the first half, when we had GNPgrowth of 8.4 percent--I don't know how soft that landing is. Theundercarriage of the vehicle may be slightly bent in that kind of[scenario].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply noting various economic indicators and expressing uncertainty about their implications.


Passage number 47.
MR. PARTEE. Well, it's still above the runway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee is simply stating a fact, that "it's still above the runway."


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 48.
MR. MARTIN. It's above the runway but perhaps without anywheels. At any rate, your comment with regard to oil prices, foodprices, and other indications of inflation out there in the future isreassuring. Imports are still soaring--I'm tying onto the Chairman'scomments as usual here--but those imports are having employment andincome effects in U.S. firms. We know that. It seems to me thatthere is a risk of a growth recession in the first and second quartersof next year. I too have talked to retailers who feel they will getthrough the holiday selling season well and then have very quiet firstand second quarters. And I see the risk of a growth recession, withrising unemployment and very low real growth taking off from that 1.7or 1.5 percent. I saw one model's output that had 1.2 percent for thethird quarter, which I don't believe, but it begins to get yourattention, I think. The consumer comes into the first and secondquarters with all those new cars bought on credit and all those otherconsumer durables and is paying the kinds of real interest rates onepays today, and I don't know whether that adds up to a snapback ornot. It doesn't to me. I think that the risk is so high that weshould be very concerned about it. If we get your [projected] 3.5percent real [GNP] for the fourth quarter and run along at about 3 or3-1/2 percent for 1985--given the margin of error, no disrespectintended--it seems to me that again gets to be a precarious positionto be in with a substantial downside risk. If we get one or twoexogenous factors in there when the economy is hovering around a 3percent level, unemployment can get started up again. The foreigncompetitor is still cutting into those employment rolls. So, I thinkthe margin of error is substantial. I would hate to see the Congresscome back into this town, this font of all the wisdom in the universe,facing a 1 percent real growth figure and rising unemployment. Wewould just get some dandy decisions in the fiscal area in thatcircumstance. I think we are facing an increasing downside risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, expresses concern about the risk of a growth recession in the first and second quarters of next year, while also criticizing the potential decisions that Congress might make in response to such a situation.


Passage number 49.
MR. PARTEE. Jim, the last time you talked some about theprobabilities. May I ask whether you have anything new to say aboutthat. That is, have you increased the probability of something aroundzero compared with six weeks ago or whenever we met last.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply asking if there have been any updates or changes in the probability discussed previously.


Passage number 50.
11/7/84MR. KICHLINE. There is a probability of negative growth inthe fourth quarter of 19 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a probability of negative growth in the fourth quarter, without any conflicting views or objections being presented.


Passage number 51.
MR. BLACK. Are you rounding, or is that--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 52.
MR. MARTIN. Jim, what about the probabilities in the firstand second quarters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply appears to be a question about the probabilities in the first and second quarters.


Passage number 53.
MR. KICHLINE. This comes out of the econometric modelexercises we performed. The model said 19 percent for the fourthquarter and 15 percent for the first quarter; then it drifts in therange of 25 or 30 percent, let's say, in the latter part of 1985.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the results of the model without any contradictory statements or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 54.
MR. BALLES. Have you checked it with [Jimmy] the Greek.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 55.
MR. KICHLINE. No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple statement where Mr. Kichline responds with a "No" answer. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 56.
MR. GRAMLEY. What is the probability of two consecutivequarters of negative growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states a question without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 57.
MR. KICHLINE. Two consecutive quarters is very low--1 to 2percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 58.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The passage only mentions Governor Rice, but it does not provide enough information to determine whether there is any contention or disagreement surrounding the governor.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 59.
MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, Governor Martin said a good part ofwhat I had in mind except that I don't expect a growth recession inthe first half of next year. I don't have any major argument with thestaff forecast. But I am more comfortable with the longer-term partof the forecast than I am with the forecast for the current quarter.As was pointed out in the briefing, the performance of the currentquarter is very sensitive to the increase in consumer expenditures; wehave to get a substantial increase--on the order of 5 percent plus inthis quarter--in order to get the projected growth for this quarter.In addition, even if we get this substantial increase in consumptionexpenditures, the stimulus to GNP depends on the distribution of theseconsumer expenditures between imports and the rundown of inventory.So, the net stimulus to real GNP may not be as strong as projected.On the other hand, it may well work out that output does increase inthe range of 3-1/2 percent. My only point is that for this quarter weshould be prepared to see an increase in real GNP of significantlyless than 3-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Rice expresses skepticism and disagrees with the forecast for the current quarter, stating that he is not as comfortable with it as he is with the longer-term forecast. He argues that the projected growth for the current quarter is dependent on a substantial increase in consumer expenditures, which may not happen as expected. He also suggests that even if there is an increase in consumer expenditures, the net stimulus to real GNP may not be as strong as projected due to the allocation of these expenditures between imports and inventory. Overall, Mr. Rice disagrees with the projection of a 3-1/2 percent increase in real GNP for the current quarter.


Passage number 60.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 61.
MR. KEEHN. Perhaps in line with previous comments, I'mbeginning to sense what I think is quite a different tone in our areathan what I reported at the previous meeting. I have suggested in thepast that the Middle West has not participated very fully in therecovery and expansion, and that continues to be the case. But somethings may be developing that signal broader problems. The badbusiness has continued to be bad. The backlogs of orders are runningdown. But those businesses that have done better than others arebeginning to feel the slowdown. One CEO that I talked with who workswith what he calls pressure curves, which are some kind of regressionanalysis on the rate of incoming orders, says those are beginning toindicate to him that we are heading into a downturn. Specifically:The appliance business is noticeably weaker; heavy trucks, which were11/7/84very strong early in the year, are now turning down; and the trucktrailer business market was up because of a legislative change but isclearly turning around and slowing down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Keehn, suggests that there are broader problems developing and signals a possible downturn in the economy. However, it is not clear if everyone in the meeting agrees with his assessment.


Passage number 62.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What business.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 63.
MR. KEEHN. Truck trailer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it only mentions "Truck trailer" without any indication of conflict or opposing views.


Passage number 64.
MR. PARTEE. That means double trailers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that "MR. PARTEE" mentions the term "double trailers." It does not indicate any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 65.
MR. KEEHN. There was a legislative change that provided fordouble bottoms and that really ballooned the market. That is comingdown.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information about a legislative change that had a significant impact on the market.


Passage number 66.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just interrupt for a second. I hadthe impression that heavy trucks were doing well--that they had gonedown and then gone up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 67.
MR. KEEHN. Orders booked for very heavy trucks, Class 8trucks, are down substantially and their production is down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply providing information about the decrease in orders and production of Class 8 trucks.


Passage number 68.
 A largeretailer--which is frankly a euphemism forMR. MARTIN. Let's see if they told you the same thing theytold me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 69.
MR. KEEHN. We had a meeting of [local] economists a week orso ago and their representative, who had been quite optimistic aboutthe Christmas outlook, is now a lot less optimistic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker states that the representative's optimism has decreased, indicating a disagreement or change in opinion among the economists.


Passage number 70.
MR. MARTIN. They did.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: not have any official opposition in the election.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 71.
MR. KEEHN. They are expressing some doubts about the outlookfor retail sales. This suggests that while we thought the softlanding--or the reduction from the very high first and secondquarters--was a welcome thing, it may be something a bit morefundamental. I'm beginning to wonder about that. I don't disagreewith the staff forecast, but it tends to be a little on the high side,to me at least. The GNP numbers look high both for this quarter andfor next year. Housing starts and auto sales look a little high. So,consistent with [the views of] Governor Rice and Governor Martin, Ithink there is an increasing risk of low or perhaps even negativegrowth rates.I just can't let the moment go by without commenting thatconditions in the agricultural sector are continuing to deteriorate.What has been a very difficult situation has only gotten worse withthe passage of time. The rains are now complicating the harvestseason; commodity prices are down; meat prices are down; and landvalues are continuing to decline. [The latter] is particularly truein Iowa where admittedly they have come down from pretty high levels,but they are in a decline that's very significant. This is beginningto back up even more with regard to nonperforming loans in theagricultural banks. The banks keep saying that their problems aremanageable; nonetheless, these are the kinds of things that can turnaround pretty rapidly. Based on the calendar we are at a time of theyear when for the next few months things [should] only get better.They ought to be better now than they are. And the fact that they arebad would indicate that in the next few months things are going to get11/7/84worse. Agricultural equipment manufacturers are continuing to gothrough just a very dismal period. The outlook is poor and they arepulling down their production schedules very significantly. There isplenty of tractor and combine equipment at the retail level, soproduction is going to be very weak well into 1985. Our agriculturaleconomist, who is a pretty conservative guy not given to extremes,said that in his view we are facing the worst set of circumstances inthis area that he has known in his whole experience at the Bank. Idon't think that we are at a turning point here, but I would certainlythink that the odds have changed significantly and that theprobability of going into a period of lower rates of growth than wethought in the past is increasing. It is certainly higher than it wasat the past meeting or two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Keehn expresses doubts about the outlook for retail sales and disagrees with the staff forecast, suggesting that there is an increasing risk of low or negative growth rates. He also mentions the deteriorating conditions in the agricultural sector, while others may argue that the problems are manageable.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 73.
MR. BOEHNE. In my District if you talk to people who arerunning companies, they still have fairly good expectations for 1985but are less sure. Some doubts are beginning to creep in and I thinkwe're in a period where expectations could change. The currentresults are quite mixed. Manufacturing tends to be flatter. Inretailing, I find that we talk to one retailer and things look good inOctober and we talk to another retailer and things were pretty flat.So, the current indicators are rather mixed. I do think, however,that if we continue to get these mixed current indicators, the longer-term expectations are going to shift. If you start out with reallygood feelings about 1985, I think uncertainty tends to undermine them.So I think, as has been said around the table starting with GovernorMartin, that there has been a change. I don't think it is a definiteturning point but it's a period of increasing doubts. And if we don'tbegin to see some pickup very soon, attitudes about 1985 will shiftsignificantly. If you felt strongly a month ago that we were having asnapback, you have to be a lot less sure about that now. If lastmonth you were leaning toward [an expectation of] a growth recession,you have to be leaning more in that direction. My own view is thatI'm fairly uncertain. There is a high degree of uncertainly aboutwhere things are going, but I think the risks have shifted toward aslower economy than I, at least, would have thought a month ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker mentions that there are mixed indicators in the current economy, with some industries doing well and others performing poorly. This suggests a lack of consensus or agreement on the state of the economy. Additionally, the speaker mentions that some individuals have shifted their expectations for the future, with some becoming less optimistic and others becoming more concerned about a potential slowdown. This further demonstrates the presence of disagreement or contention.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I cannot answer that question without the passage you are referring to.


Passage number 75.
MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, I approach this with alittle different view from the other speakers this morning. That'sprimarily, I suppose, because of where I live and work. To be sure,economic activity in the Atlanta District did go through a period ofmoderation in the summer but we have seen some pickup. Generallyspeaking, I think that economic activity is fairly healthy. Most ofthe indicators show strength, although there are some weak areas. Wehave heavy defense spending, particularly in the electronic andaerospace industries; oil and gas [activity] is even picking up in theLouisiana area; and the carpet industry, construction, and housing arepicking up. In fact, housing surged by about 52 percent in theSoutheast in the month of September. Tourism continues to be good.The weak spots are forest products and textiles and other export-related areas. Now, retail sales have been off even in our area; theypicked up in September and fell off again a little in October. All ofthe retailers I speak to are experiencing downturns from theirprojections; their sales are not up to plan. They attribute this, as11/7/84others have said, to the unusually warm weather in October. They area bit cautious about Christmas, although I think most of them arefairly confident that they are going to have a good Christmas season.Agriculture is a mixed bag because of a number of factors, includingdrought followed by very heavy rain in early November.Looking beyond the Southeast, which is perhaps not typical[of the nation], I tend to agree with the staff forecast of renewedgrowth in the fourth quarter and in 1985, particularly because I thinkthat we have not yet seen the effects working through the economy ofthe lower interest rates that we've recently experienced. On theinflation side, I am a little less confident about the staff'sprojection. I still think that is a problem that we really have tokeep our eye on. I think the dollar is going to come off although,like everybody else, I won't be very quick to say when that willhappen. But I think we are going to see the dollar coming off, withits implications for inflation. Also, the numbers that I have seensuggest that wage settlements in the service sector have not beennearly as low as they have been in manufacturing. And, of course, wehave the fiscal stimulus, which I don't see being removed very quicklywhen Congress comes back. So, on balance, Mr. Chairman, I think wecan expect reasonably good growth in 1985. I view the risk not as oneof negative growth but rather of renewed inflation. Even if we didn'tget 3-1/2 percent real GNP in 1985, I think that even 2-1/2 to 3percent growth would still be fairly decent and not anything to beterribly worried about. At this point, I am not concerned aboutrecession or any kind of negative growth in 1985.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering their own perspective and analysis of the economic situation, but they do not dispute or contradict the views of others.


Passage number 76.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 77.
MR. BLACK. Well, the staff's projection for the fourthquarter is about in line with what most private forecasters have beensaying; it's certainly plausible and maybe even the most likelyforecast. But I have to agree with Preston Martin and Emmett Rice andEd Boehne and Si Keehn: I believe the risk has shifted to the lowside since we last met. As Jim Kichline pointed out, there arecertainly some statistics that suggest that growth picked up inSeptember--the employment figures and the figures on retail sales.But I think we have to bear in mind that given the export/importpicture, even if final demand strengthens, that doesn't necessarilymean that we are going to have equivalent strength in domesticemployment and demand. People may, as you said, Mr. Chairman, belining up to unload those imports. Moreover, the lack of growth in M1since midyear certainly makes it less likely that there will be anysustained resumption in growth any time soon. In short, I see someserious risks in the near-term economic future and I think we ought tokeep those in mind as we address policy today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents differing opinions on the risk to the economy. While the staff's projection is in line with private forecasters, Mr. Black believes that the risk has shifted to the low side since their last meeting. He presents concerns about the export/import picture and the lack of growth in M1, suggesting that there are serious risks in the near-term economic future.


Passage number 78.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The given passage "Governor Wallich" does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 79.
MR. WALLICH. Well, I am agnostic on the outlook. I think ithas deteriorated somewhat. I made a list for myself of strong andweak factors and I stopped when I reached 12 on each side and had anumber more. But I think the nature of the choices that we have is alittle different. Expansions don't go on forever; at some point therewill be a pause--a growth recession, hopefully not a real recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker acknowledges that the outlook has deteriorated somewhat but does not express any disagreement or contention. The statement is more of an observation and personal opinion.


Passage number 80.
If we had the choice of a growth recession in the near future or areal recession a year later, for instance--11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What's a growth recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is posing a hypothetical situation by presenting two options and asking for clarification on the term "growth recession."


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 81.
MR. WALLICH. When unemployment rises but GNP still rises--inother words, growth below potential. If we had that and it werereversed subsequently, that to me would be a less ominous thing than anew real recession. And that might well be a choice because thethings one would have to do in order to make sure that there is nogrowth recession may very well generate imbalances or maladjustmentsand set in motion [forces] that a year or two later might produce areal recession. They might also, of course, get us back intoinflation. Starting from 5 percent inflation, it seems to me oneought to use special caution in dealing with that prospect. It's notas though we were starting from close to zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, expresses his view that it would be less concerning to have unemployment rise while GNP still rises, compared to a new real recession. However, he acknowledges that taking actions to prevent a growth recession could potentially lead to imbalances, maladjustments, and inflation in the future. This suggests a potential disagreement between Mr. Wallich and others who may prioritize avoiding a growth recession over potential long-term consequences.


Passage number 82.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not exactly at 5 percent either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement simply provides an explanation that the actual value is not exactly 5 percent. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 83.
MR. WALLICH. I think the underlying inflation rate is ofthat order if one removes all the temporary [influences]. If we lookat the probabilities of what is going to happen, they may be evenlybalanced between a resumption of the expansion or a growth recession.I doubt that it would be a real recession. If we look at the risksthat lie beyond that, action to keep [the economy] growing at allcosts might produce a much worse situation later and might conceivablyrelaunch us into inflation. I think those possible costs are muchhigher than if the economy wants to take a short pause and then resume[growth] again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 84.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage. The passage only mentions Governor Gramley without providing any conflicting viewpoints or debates.


Passage number 85.
MR. GRAMLEY. As I look at the numbers coming in, I aminclined to agree with the staff that they do suggest there is someimprovement in activity going on. When I think of how the numberswere coming in a month or two ago, the recent figures look to me a lotmore optimistic. The last figure on new orders for nondefense capitalgoods was up after a couple of months of decline. Shipments were upquite strongly. The last figure we had for retail sales was up; wedon't know what October will bring. I read the Beigebook and Ithought it was saying that the gains we had in September seemed to besustained in October even though that doesn't seem to be confirmed bydepartment store sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is agreeing with the staff's interpretation of the numbers and expressing optimism about the recent figures.


Passage number 86.
MR. PARTEE. Nor by the comments around here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It represents a straightforward statement without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 87.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, we haven't heard from everybody yet. Butcertainly, the comments in the Beigebook did not reflect what we'rehearing today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the comments in the Beigebook did not reflect what they are currently hearing.


Passage number 88.
MR. PARTEE. I think somebody else wrote the Beigebook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee simply states his belief that someone else wrote the Beigebook.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 89.
MR. GRAMLEY. We're now looking at a period of rising autoproduction--increasing availability of models instead of the reversethat was going on in the summer. The last figures on housing startsand new home sales were up in contrast to earlier weakness. TheOctober employment data were considerably stronger than the datacoming in during the summer; indeed, we had a turnaround inmanufacturing employment from a rather sizable decline in September toan increase in October. In a period like this there is bound to beuncertainty. As Henry mentioned, you can list a dozen factors on the-10-11/7/84positive side and a dozen on the negative side, and there is room fordoubt among reasonable people as to where things are going. We'vebeen through this sort of pause many, many times in periods ofeconomic expansion. If you asked what basic factors were driving theeconomy during the first six quarters of recovery--strong fiscalstimulus, a lot of consumer confidence, low inflation, the technologydriving business fixed investment--I think those factors are stillthere. And I'm about 75 percent certain, personally, that theincoming figures a month and two months from now will show a morepositive trend. I do not worry about the possibility that third-quarter GNP growth will be revised downward. I don't doubt that atall. That is what happened in the past. Indeed, if it turns out thatthe downward revision reflects a lower rate of inventory investment,that would be on balance a plus and not a minus. I agree with thestaff forecast. I think we will see some strengthening in activity.I don't know whether it is going to be in the fourth quarter and Idon't really care. It's a question of whether or not it comes alongsoon enough, as I think it will, to generate the kind of growth thatthe staff is forecasting for 1985. And I think they are about righton the button.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is uncertainty and room for doubt about the future direction of the economy despite listing positive factors. However, the speaker ultimately agrees with the staff forecast and believes that there will be strengthening in activity, while also expressing some uncertainty about the timing of this growth.


Passage number 90.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context that suggests contention or disagreement. It merely states "Mr. Balles," which does not indicate any conflicting opinions or perspectives.


Passage number 91.
MR. BALLES. In the Twelfth District, the pace of economicexpansion really has slowed dramatically. We just haven't seen thebounceback in sales that is reported in some Districts. One thingthat is going quite strongly in our District is nonresidentialconstruction; in some of our leading cities it's almost of boomproportions. But it's certainly clear that the reduction we've seenso far in mortgage rates has been insufficient to prevent both theconstruction and the sale of new homes from falling further. That's aweak area. And as I've been reporting for a long time now, the strongdollar and the situation with foreign imports are hurting a good partof Western industries such as forest products and primary metals, andthat is reducing the overall growth of manufacturing employment to acrawl. The agricultural situation is pretty grim in a good many ofour states. In sum, I think the balance has changed toward the enginestalling here. If the plane is still in the air, it's about to makesomething worse than a soft landing. I agree with much of what wassaid by Governors Martin and Rice and Presidents Keehn, Boehne, andothers. Monetary policy is supposed to be flexible and I think thetime has come to err a bit on the side of ease unless the situationclarifies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Balles, is expressing his own observations and opinions about the state of the economy in his district. He agrees with the viewpoints expressed by other governors and presidents, suggesting that there is consensus among them.


Passage number 92.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage, as no specific passage or context is provided.


Passage number 93.
MR. CORRIGAN. My own view is that the staff forecast isprobably about on the mark. In fact, I still very much lean to theview that in the next two or three quarters as a whole, there is agood chance that the economy will be stronger than the staff forecastrather than weaker. I may be a little less certain about that nowthan I was six weeks ago, as are other people; nevertheless, that'sstill where I'd put the probabilities. The uncertainty factor clearlydoes reflect the very, very near-term outlook. What is this mishmashof statistics and anecdotes really telling us. On the retail salesside, we had meetings last week with the CEOs of all the big companiesin Minneapolis--and there are two very sizable retailers headquarteredthere--and they,-11-11/7/84remain extremely bullish about the outlook for retailsales in the near term notwithstanding this pronounced slowing in thelast two weeks of October.On the other side of the picture, a couple of the companiesin the Twin Cities that are major manufacturers and suppliers ofelectronic gear and happen to be thought of as computer companies--infact, they make lots of components that go into both commercial andresidential construction--reported a surge in industrial bookings inOctober. That was the word that they used. Insofar as the equipmentthat they manufacture and sell is associated with housing, they don'tknow whether it's related to new housing or renovation, of course.But in October, or I should say the 30 days ending last Thursday, theyhad an all-time record 30-day pace of activity for bookings andshipments of electronic components that go into residential units.Maybe that's consistent with the view that the decline in interestrates that we've seen is beginning to take hold a little. While thehousing sales figures in the last set of numbers were somewhat mixedgeographically, there was some spark at least for one month evident inthose statistics as well. When I put it together, again, I wouldagree with many of the comments that the immediate situation is harderthan usual to read. I personally do not see a recession in sight oranything that would remotely qualify as a recession.I have two quick comments on imports and agriculture. Thisimport phenomenon, as I think I said once before, is really off thechart. There is no doubt that that makes it extremely difficult tofigure out where the driving forces are, but I will just try to putthat in perspective with a couple of concrete examples. For example,one of these companies told me that just in the past six or sevenmonths they have started buying disk drives for floppy disks forsmaller computers from a Taiwanese supplier. They are delivered inMinneapolis for $60 a unit whereas the cheapest they can make themwith no markup--the cheapest they can-manufacture them themselvesanyplace in the United States--is $140 a unit. Another very largehigh-tech company reported to me that within the time frame of thisyear they started buying transformers for their medium size main framecomputers from Far Eastern sources. Again, the price delivered tothem in the United States is one-third of the cheapest price they canmanufacture that type of component. Indeed, one of these companiesreported to me that the situation has reached a point where, no matterwhat one assumes about exchange rates or anything else, from the pointof view of their corporate long-term strategic planning they have nowfound themselves forced for the first time to consider seriously goinginto off-shore supply in a major way through their own facilities.They find that very distasteful but the economics of it are such thatthey find themselves compelled to think in those terms.On the agricultural situation, I would just echo what SiKeehn has said. It is not pretty. And I think it is now starting toback up in a way that you can see the implications of it on the smallbanks--all these darn small one-bank holding companies that aresitting out there and are leveraged to the hilt. It could be verytroubling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their own views and observations, but there is no indication of disagreement or contradiction with others.


Passage number 94.
-12-11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Horn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple description or introduction of Mrs. Horn on a specific date.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 95.
MS. HORN. The situation from the vantage point of theCleveland District isn't much different from what has been expressedby a number of people around the table. The Fourth District'sdifficulties are probably due to a [concurrence] of circumstances.First, there are the ongoing structural problems and the intenseimport competition, which we feel so strongly, together with the pausein economic activity. Most of our capital goods industries, excludingmachine tools, have noted a flattening in orders and shipments. Insteel we've had a few more furnace shutdowns. Housing in the Districthas been flat at best for several months and our bankers continue tocomment on the difficult income situation that farmers find themselvesin and the problems they will have servicing their debts. The result,as has been pointed out, is increased uncertainty about the outlookfor next year. In our District we still have the basic view that theconsumer will lift the economy into growth next year; around theDistrict a strong Christmas is widely expected. Expectations are alsofor a continued thrust from business investment, although presumablyat a slower pace. We have a basically positive outlook but a lot ofconcern is expressed; I think the concerns of many people arise inpart because of how discouraged they are with the very strong importcompetition. Others focus on the long-term problems of the economy:the need for fiscal policy changes, the inflation problems, and soforth. Also, expectations are generally damped by the pause that wesee. Although expectations are for growth next year, they are veryshaky, and sometimes I wonder if they are held with enough confidenceto get us over a few disappointments that we might see in the comingmonths.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Horn, acknowledges that there are differing views and concerns expressed by people around the table. Some focus on import competition and long-term economic problems, while others have a more positive outlook but express concern. This indicates a disagreement or differing perspectives on the current economic situation and future outlook.


Passage number 96.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 97.
MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, I think it is fair to characterizethe situation in the Eleventh District as one where we are continuingto see some improvement. Employment is increasing, industrialproduction is still moving up, and retail sales look fairly good. Iwill say that we have had slowdowns from earlier in the year.Weakness, of course, continues in the energy industry, and that mightbe getting a little worse. We also have had a downturn inconstruction but, as I indicated last time, I really don't thinkthat's all that bad. I would pretty well agree with the Board staff'sforecast. I would expect the fourth quarter obviously to look alittle better than the third quarter. At least from the people I'vetalked to down our way, I have not picked up any real concern about arecession on the horizon as we go into 1985. The confidence factor,at least my own confidence factor, is not quite as strong as it wasearlier. So, I'm not really complacent. On the other hand, my degreeof discomfort, if you will, is probably not as great as that expressedby a number of people here. It seems to me that we're just cominginto a period when there is uncertainty and when decisions become verydifficult. I think there is an awfully great risk of overreacting towhat might or might not happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their own perspective on the economic situation in the Eleventh District and stating their agreement with the Board staff's forecast. They also express some uncertainty and caution about the future.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Ms. Seger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 99.
MS. SEGER. I have been somewhat concerned about slowingbusiness conditions for several months and I still am. I won't repeatall the signs; I heard them earlier and you have also. I will just-13-11/7/84add two things that I haven't heard mentioned so far. One is that intalking with a number of business economist friends who are neitherkooks nor politicians I sense a big change in their attitudes in thelast six weeks or so. In general their confidence in their forecastsfor next year seems to have diminished. Frankly, if I had to point myfinger at one factor that is responsible for this, it would be thesignals that we have been sending from this building. They arelooking at the slower monetary growth in the last four months and as agroup are not interpreting that as poor marksmanship or the inabilityto hit our targets. They are interpreting these numbers as an actualtightening, particularly when they saw the fed funds rate shoot backup in August. So, I think that has led to some of the changes inattitude. Secondly, I was talking to a top economist for one of theBig Three auto companies who said that when they were doing theirmodeling and trying to forecast auto sales for next year they lookedat the usual relationships among employment, income growth, creditavailability and all the things that they know influence auto sales.They came up with a particular forecast, yet because of their lack offaith in that number, they peeled off about 300 to 400 thousand unitsfrom that because in the pit of their stomachs they didn't think theycould hit the number that came out of their model. I am mentioningthis to suggest that if there is a risk, I think it is that thesenumbers [forecast] for the fourth quarter and for 1985 will be toohigh rather than too low. I am not saying that there is a recessionaround the corner; I am not that good a forecaster. But I think thereis the risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions that there has been a change in attitudes among business economists and there is a risk that the forecasted numbers for the fourth quarter and 1985 will be too high. This suggests disagreement or contention about the state of the economy and the accuracy of forecasts.


Passage number 100.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Please provide the specific passage or context in order to make a judgment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 101.
MR. PARTEE. One thing that worries a person who looks at thebusiness statistics all the time is a situation that can't very wellbe explained on the basis of past experience. And I can't very wellexplain why business is as weak as it has been in the last few months.That makes for considerable discomfort in a professional economist. Iam very nervous at the present time. I felt confident that therewould be a resurgence in the economy this fall because, like Lyle, Ithought that we had just a temporary spell of reduced consumption. Ithought the economy would come along in the fall because incomes andexpectations and confidence and the real financial value of assetswere all there to support strong consumer spending. I guess I stillfeel that. I am closer in view to the guy from than I am tothe guy from in thinking that we're going to have a goodChristmas. Nevertheless, there is no real indication of such aresurgence in attitudes of manufacturers and business peoplegenerally. The one thing that I have never dealt with is the problemof a steadily rising proportion of total markets being taken up withimports. Because we haven't had that in the 35 years that I have beenan economist, it does occur to me that it's possible that retail salescan look good and strong and that plant and equipment spending canlook good and strong and it won't do anything for the domestic economyif an important increment of that demand is going into imported goods.Therefore, it is quite possible that we could have strength in theindicators of the kind that Bob Forrestal talked about--retail salesand so forth--but weakness in the underlying performance of theeconomy. I think that's a big change from the past, and it seems tobe a trend that is still persisting.-14-11/7/84The other thing that may have occurred--and it's very, veryhard to know--is that, in fact, inflation expectations may havesubsided over the last six months. We are getting some indications ofthat from these horseback surveys that people do on inflation. But Idon't think they are much good; they really just reflect what hashappened most recently. But it may be that we've had a period of lowincreases in wages and low increases in profit margins for a longenough time that people are now beginning to believe that by gollyinflation isn't going to go back to 7 or 8 or 9 percent. You mayremember in the spring that it wasn't hard to find outliers likeMilton Friedman who thought that inflation would be at double digitsby the end of this year. That has disappeared entirely. That also issomething that could affect attitudes and the speed with which plansare put in place in order to beat price increases, because now peopledon't expect the price to increase whereas before they did.I would point out that the staff forecast is nothing to writehome about in terms of great strength. The forecast is for a littleover 3 percent real growth over the next five quarters. That's not ahigh number. I would also point out to you that there is an importantpresumption in that forecast and that is that real imports go nohigher than they are now--that the whole import thrust is behind us.In the Greenbook, if you look at constant dollar net imports on a GNPbasis, there has been a deterioration of $35 billion over the pastfour quarters. Over the next four quarters there will be nonewhatsoever, if that forecast is accurate. And that goes into the GNPforecast. If you don't believe that the import surge has ended, thenyou can't really believe a forecast as strong as the one the staff hasshown. I don't know what you think, but I think that imports arestill rising pretty darn rapidly and that the growth in imports willnot be over until we can change the terms of trade in which the UnitedStates deals. So, the forecast of a little over 3 percent assumesthat net imports stopped growing as of the third quarter, which isalready behind us. That's not such a very strong forecast.Henry speaks about inflation. He says a base rate of 5percent; I would say 4 percent. It is [not] zero. But unemploymentisn't zero either. As a matter of fact, we have 7-1/2 percentunemployment; it has been hanging at that number, Henry, and I wouldargue that a 7-1/2 percent unemployment rate gives us room for furthergrowth in the economy in the sense of looking at the performancecompared with some kind of norm--what we would like to see ideally.The unemployment rate is about as distressingly above where it oughtto be as the inflation rate is above what it ought to be. As I seeit, it's a situation in which one can say inflation has done betterthan one would expect based on recent track performance. Unemploymentis worse than it ought to be at this stage of a cyclical recovery.Therefore, although I'm not sure what is going to happen in theimmediate future, I think that the economy is not going to go into agreat resurgence in terms of output and employment and I think thereis room for some more growth than seems in prospect in the numbersthat we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage contains disagreement and different viewpoints. Mr. Partee expresses concern and uncertainty about the weak economy and the reasons behind it. He mentions a possible trend of increasing imports affecting the domestic economy. He also questions the staff forecast and believes that imports are still rising rapidly. On the other hand, he acknowledges the potential for growth due to the unemployment rate not being at its ideal level.

May I just correct one comment on the forecast.I don't want to dispute the basic thrust of your argument, but on theimport side we have identified a couple of areas--textiles and steel--where it is pretty clear that there was a buildup in imports inanticipation of trade policy actions that did occur and are going to,-15-11/7/84at a minimum, put us back toward the trend of where those imports wererelative to GNP. It is partly because we have taken out that smallpiece--$2-1/2 billion in 1972 dollars--which is not trivial in termsof the numbers we are looking at. It's 2 or 2-1/2 percent,essentially, in current dollars. We have taken that piece out andallowed some payback of it so that we get the absolutely flat picturethat you so accurately described. So we do have a continued rise inimports at least to the middle of next year absent that factor, whichtells us the dollar's depreciation, putative depreciation, takeseffect. But the reason you get the picture in the Greenbook islargely because we have that offsetting payback in the short run onimports.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Truman, is disagreeing with the forecast by pointing out that there is a buildup in imports in anticipation of trade policy actions. He corrects this by stating that if this factor is removed, there would still be a rise in imports.


Passage number 103.
MR. PARTEE. Well, am I looking at this table correctly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is simply asking for clarification on how to interpret or view the table.


Passage number 104.
MR. TRUMAN. No, that's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident from the use of affirmative statements and agreement between the speaker (Mr. Truman) and an unidentified person.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 105.
MR. PARTEE. A year ago you had a plus $12 billion; in thethird quarter of this year it's a minus $22.6 billion. That's achange of $34-35 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is highlighting a significant change in the financial situation, pointing out the difference of $34-35 billion between two time periods.


Passage number 106.
MR. TRUMAN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context that would suggest contention or disagreement involving Mr. Truman.


Passage number 107.
 No, no--MR. PARTEE. And now, with this little $2 billion difference,you have essentially stability from now on out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is stability as a result of a $2 billion difference.


Passage number 108.
MR. GRAMLEY. Is this imports of goods or goods and services.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage is a single sentence and provides no context or information that would suggest any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking for clarification on whether the imports referred to are limited to goods or include both goods and services.


Passage number 109.
MR. PARTEE. The only one they have in constant dollars isgoods and services. I am looking at page 1-21.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 110.
MR. GRAMLEY. But I think the staff's forecast is for someincrease in the constant dollar value of goods counterbalanced by adecline in the services component, which largely reflects reducedinvestment income.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley acknowledges the staff's forecast and provides additional information without expressing disagreement or arguing against it.


Passage number 111.
MR. TRUMAN. Well, but the basic story is correct. Third-quarter [imports] of goods were something around $100 billion 1972dollars, which is close to $20 billion higher than it was a year ago.[Unintelligible] another $3 or $4 billion in goods because you haveoil in there over the forecast period. So, imports of servicesdecline somewhat and that gives you the flat number on a GNP basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 112.
MR. PARTEE. And that is in the GNP forecast. Am I right,Jim.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply confirming his understanding and seeking clarification from Jim.


Passage number 113.
MR. KICHLINE. Correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply confirms the correctness of something.


Passage number 114.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The excerpt does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 115.
MR. ROBERTS. I am seeing in my District some of the changein attitude that has been commented on by others. I had a meetingwith about a dozen chief executive officers of large companies lastweek and their consensus was that business had turned toward the softside. They were generally concerned about inventory levels; it wasnot that inventories had gotten out of control, but the focus of theseCEOs had moved to the control of inventories. The retailers spoke ofa good Christmas instead of their previous very optimistic-16-11/7/84expectations about the Christmas season. They are reassessing theirprospects in the retail area, and this group included four nationalretailers who had a pretty good feel of conditions nationally. Theywere focusing particularly on [sales in] recent weeks. In themanufacturing sector, one thing that struck me was that withoutexception, none of them sees any inflation anywhere either in whatthey buy or in their ability to change prices of what they sell. Theyrelate this principally to the import competition, which seems to bepervasive. All of them one way or another seem to be experiencingthat across the board. The other thing that impressed me was thatthey all felt that wages were under complete control--that settlementsthat had occurred were very modest indeed, and their expectationsabout wage settlements were of the same variety.The housing area has been fairly stable; we have had somesoftness in single-family starts offset by multifamily starts. In theappliance manufacturing area, we have seen specific reductions. Forexample, the GE manufacturing facility in Louisville has justannounced another 1400 layoffs, including about 300 white collarworkers. In the textile area, where import competition has a bigeffect, four plants in Arkansas have just been closed involving about22,000 workers. The shoe industry in Missouri is in extremis, as theysay, in terms of import competition. Agriculture in particular ishurting now because of rains that are delaying harvesting and causingsome problems. We are getting reports that harvesting of animals isincluding breeding stock and that is an indication of problems there.So, when I put the whole thing together, I see a change of attitudeand conditions from a slowing in the economy to an economy that hasflattened out. My judgment is that the staff forecast is probablyoptimistic for the fourth quarter and for next year as well. My bestguess is that, absent a significant change of policy soon, the nextmove in the economy will be down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a description of various observations and opinions about the state of the economy from different individuals.


Passage number 116.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage.


Passage number 117.
MR. GUFFEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 118.
 On the other side of Missouri--MR. ROBERTS. It's a very thin edge.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that "On the other side of Missouri" followed by an interruption from someone mentioned as "Mr. Roberts" adding his input by saying "It's a very thin edge". These statements do not indicate a disagreement or contention.


Passage number 119.
MR. GUFFEY. But an important thin edge. In the TenthDistrict there has been no improvement in those areas that I haveexpressed concern about before--principally agriculture, energy, andthe aircraft manufacturing industry. There are a couple of factors,however, that may influence the future. One, in the agriculturalsector, is the Administration's program that was announced a month orso ago for delaying or setting aside some of the debt of theproducers. That is now being put into place and they hope to have itoperational by January 1. For your information, it involves amongother things setting aside 25 percent of a producer's total debt up to$200,000 and delaying that for a period of 5 years with no interestand no payback. It is a guarantee program also with respect to thecommercial banks that are financing agriculture, if that comes about.It's a pilot program in five states--Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska,Minnesota, and Iowa. There is some mixed reaction from theagricultural sector, but it is something positive and they are tryingto assess what the impact will be. After it is in place in these fivestates, they expect to expand it nationwide.-17-11/7/84With respect to the energy area, OPEC and the lowering ofcrude prices have damped the enthusiasm, which was not very great, inenergy discovery. Another factor that has come to pass most recentlywas the announcement by Canada that they were going to reduce theprice of natural gas imported into the United States by 25 percent. Alot of the Tenth District is very heavily engaged in natural gasproduction, so that could further depress any interest in discovery orexploration in that area. There is a fairly large segment of theDistrict involved in high-tech business, particularly on the easternslope of the Rockies. Most recently there have been rathersubstantial layoffs--about 2,000 people--in that area who were engagedin the production of semi-conductors. I'm told that the demand forsemi-conductors worldwide has diminished but it has impacted thisparticular area more dramatically than I think any of us realizes. Onthe positive side, auto assembly [activity], in which we have a verylarge number employed, is going full out. Everybody is back andemployed. Nonresidential construction is experiencing boom conditionsin several areas in our District. Recreational activity is very high,with tourism and the ski industry looking forward to a very good year.I'd just note that in New Mexico, which is a very small part [of ourDistrict] population-wise but very important in the defense industry,is experiencing a boom particularly in the Albuquerque area simplybecause they are deeply involved in the production of defenseequipment.With respect to the outlook, I would agree with those whothink the Greenbook is about right or maybe not optimistic enough. Idon't see the dangers that everybody expressed around the table thatwe are going to drop into a growth recession, if you will, in thefourth quarter and the first quarter of 1985--or even if we did, thatthat would be all bad. In other words, I don't see the potential ofrecession as a very high probability or any probability at all. Onthe national level, I would accept the staff forecast as being aboutright. And if we get it, I would be delighted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is just providing information about various sectors and industries.


Passage number 120.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions Mr. Morris without providing any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 121.
MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to associate myselfwith the Lyle Gramley school of predicting where we are. I think it'svery typical toward the second year of an expansion to run into aslower rate of growth in the economy as the economy shifts to a lowerrate of inventory accumulation. And I think that is exactly what isgoing on right now. I would assess the risks of a recession as closeto zero. I think the underpinnings of the economy are very strong.The most surprising statistic of the last month was the 440,000increase in employment. That--particularly the 55,000 increase indurable goods manufacturing employment--was much bigger than I hadexpected. These are not the kinds of numbers that one sees associatedwith an early stage of going into a recession. Furthermore, we havehad a big decline in interest rates. I think this economy is going tobe very responsive to that. We haven't had enough time yet to assessthe impact the interest rate decline that has already taken place willhave. We see one sign in the increase in new home sales and anothersign in the strength of the stock market. Another sign is[unintelligible]. But I think we haven't yet seen the full effect onthe real economic activity of the rate declines that have alreadytaken place. So, I find the pessimism that I have heard around thetable from many sources hard to understand. And I don't think this11/7/84comes from the fact that I am living in a state that has anunemployment rate of 3.7 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Morris, expresses his opinion about the state of the economy and provides evidence to support his view.


Passage number 122.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without knowing its content.


Passage number 123.
]VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I am living in a state which hasdouble that rate of unemployment and yet I share your view, Frank. Idon't quite understand the level of concern that I hear other thanthat it is the inherent nature of central bankers always to look atthe gloomy side. And I think the sense of balance would be not amajor shift of policy as Ted Roberts is saying, but some modest thoughlimited easing. I won't repeat the reasons why I think the staffforecast for next year is on balance probably as reasonable as one canexpect. In our view it might be somewhat weaker in the fourth quarterbecause of inventory adjustment. But the general feeling in myDistrict--what I hear from business leaders and from members of ourboard--is that there will be good Christmas retail sales and thatmanufacturing is not showing the earlier growth but is not showing anysignificant softening either. I also share Henry Wallich's view--Idon't always agree with Henry, but I must say I do this time--that thebusiness cycle is still with us and we should not be excessivelyalarmed about some tapering off and moderation. And even though 3percent isn't high, Chuck, it seems to me that that is a veryappropriate level--if that is what we actually get next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the view expressed by Frank and also shares the view expressed by Henry Wallich.


Passage number 124.
MR. PARTEE. Well, we could easily afford more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee is simply making a statement about their ability to afford more.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 125.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I tend to assume that thedollar is going to come off more and I assume there will beinflationary pressures that will result from that--although they won'tshow up too immediately, I suppose. And I would be concerned aboutmuch more than a 3 percent growth rate. I think our capacity isgrowing around 3 percent and it may very well be that the structure ofthe economy and our comparative advantage has changed in the world andthat we cannot expect to go back to a level of unemployment as low aswe had in previous recoveries. Also, in those previous recoveries wegot to double-digit inflation so we then tended to overreact the otherway. It seems to me that a steadier, more prudent, balanced, calmerpolicy would be in the direction of easing which does not reflect asmuch concern about the economy as I heard around the table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their own assumptions and concerns, which may not align with the opinions or beliefs of others present at the table.


Passage number 126.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, why don't we hear from Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is simply suggesting that the speaker would like to hear from Mr. Axilrod.


Passage number 127.
MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage as the statement in question is not provided in the prompt.


Passage number 128.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are there any more or less technicalquestions or comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage is not provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 129.
MR. BOEHNE. I have a technical question. As you try to sortout what is behind the weakness in M1 and whether it's from the demandside or from the supply side, if you look at reserves over the lastcouple of months--which is on the supply side and can be viewed insome rough way as a [base] for creating money--reserve growth, as youpointed out, has been quite weak. I wonder, as we go into Novemberand December and try to guard against the continuation of thisweakness, if there's any value in looking through the nonborrowedtarget more to reserve growth to try to reduce the odds of continuedslow growth. Now, that presumes that part of the problem comes from-19-11/7/84the supply side. I just wondered technically if you have anyreactions to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question asked by Mr. Boehne for clarification and possible technical insight.


Passage number 130.
MR. AXILROD. Well, President Boehne, say the Committeewanted to achieve something like the alternative B path or, say, 7percent growth in total reserves in November. [While] it'stechnically not impossible to conduct operations in an effort toachieve that if the Committee wanted it, it is impossible to tell youwith any certainty, other than the way we do it in the Bluebook, whatis likely to happen to the level of member bank borrowing. If thedemand for those reserves doesn't happen to be there, we would have tokeep throwing nonborrowed reserves out there until we force the demandon them--force the banks to create the required reserves. And thatcould take a very substantial drop in interest rates if the demanddoesn't happen to be there. Our best guess, as is in the Bluebookimplicitly, is that it would not take a substantial drop in interestrates, though I would [modulate] that a bit if the latest money supplyfigures I have seen hold up after a day or so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement describing a hypothetical scenario and discussing the potential challenges and uncertainties associated with achieving a specific outcome.


Passage number 131.
MR. BOEHNE. I guess I am just getting at this supply/demanddivision that you mentioned. Does that give you any reading as towhether more of the problem lies with the supply side or the demandside.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show contention or disagreement. Mr. Boehne is simply asking a question to gain more information and understanding.


Passage number 132.
MR. AXILROD. No, I think you have to look at therelationship between interest rates and velocity. Obviously, therewould be more money out there, if we put in more reserves and therewould be less money, vice versa. The way I would look at it would beto try to explain velocity. That is what I was trying to do. Doesthe fourth-quarter rise in velocity indicate that people didn't reallywant the money and that they are quite happy. Or does it indicatethat people simply didn't get the money they really wanted and we hada temporary --in effect, arithmetic--rise in velocity and we're goingto see that reflected later in income as they have to adjust to thefact that they don't have as much money as they want. I don't thinkjust looking at the reserve-to-money relationship can tell you muchabout that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different factors and possibilities related to the relationship between interest rates, reserves, and velocity. They are offering different perspectives and explanations without directly disagreeing with any other person or viewpoint.


Passage number 133.
MR. MARTIN. Steve, you commented on the possible impact ofthe MMDA alternative to less interest [on] transaction balances. Itake it you were referring to the surprise in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that Steve made a comment about the possible impact of the MMDA alternative.


Passage number 134.
MR. AXILROD. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The answer is yes. There is contention or disagreement indicated by the statement "Yes." This indicates that there is a disagreement or difference of opinion between the speaker and another person or group mentioned earlier in the passage.


Passage number 135.
MR. MARTIN. But why wouldn't that kind of impact occur whenthe rates first dropped.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only consists of one statement and there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 136.
MR. AXILROD. MMDAs were rising in the first four months ofthe year at a slightly faster rate than they were rising in October.And then they stopped rising as market rates went up and banks didn'tfollow them all the way up. Then, with this recent very sharp drop inshort rates, banks have lagged in the extent to which their MMDA rateshave dropped. And, according to the figures we have for MMDAs, afterdeclining for several months they started rising. At the same time weare observing in the figures--although we have problems with seasonaladjustments because we don't have them seasonally adjusted--a drop inNOW accounts and in the very recent figures also a drop in Super NOWaccounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting a series of observations and trends without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 137.
-20-11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How big are Super NOW accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage is a simple question asking about the size of Super NOW accounts. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 138.
MR. AXILROD. The level. The level of NOW accounts is $140billion approximately.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 139.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Super NOWs are what level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It provides a statement of fact without any conflicting perspectives or opinions.


Passage number 140.
MR. ROBERTS. $43 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The passage simply states a figure ($43 billion) without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 141.
MR. AXILROD. I think I have that number. They're about $45billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states their belief that they have the correct number, which is approximately $45 billion.


Passage number 142.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is that included in that $140 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is asking for clarification or confirmation regarding whether something is included in the $140 billion mentioned previously.


Passage number 143.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. However, without the actual passage provided, it is impossible to give a more accurate response.


Passage number 144.
 That's included; so there is $100 and some oddbillion--MR. ROBERTS. Steve, are you saying that as the differentialbetween NOW accounts and MMDAs declines, there's a percentage thatshifts [to MMDAs] instead of the contrary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact and then asking for clarification or confirmation from Steve.


Passage number 145.
MR. AXILROD. Well, [we were] reaching for hypotheses toexplain this back in the second half of 1982 when interest ratesdropped sharply and there was a sharp rise in NOW accounts. At thattime there were no MMDAs. MMDAs have a lower reserve requirement thanNOW accounts by a lot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the facts about interest rates, NOW accounts, and MMDAs without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 146.
MR. ROBERTS. But that's an interesting thesis: that someonewho accepts a lower-than-market rate gets more interested in changingto the market rate as the spread declines instead of as it widens.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating an interesting thesis without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 147.
MR. AXILROD. Well, I was thinking of these as monies thatare in the market now that shift back into bank deposits as rates godown. And what bank deposits do they shift back into.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement explaining the movement of money from the market back into bank deposits as interest rates decrease.


Passage number 148.
MR. ROBERTS. Not from NOWs to MMDAs but from the market toMMDAs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that the movement is from the market to MMDAs.


Passage number 149.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without providing the actual passage or context.


Passage number 150.
 And instead of going back into NOWs, as weexperienced in 1982--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why would that make NOW accounts go down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is a hypothetical statement suggesting an alternative scenario.


Passage number 151.
MR. AXILROD. Well, there are other things going on at thesame time, obviously. But I was thinking mainly of shifts from themarket and not using NOW accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Axilrod, is simply stating his thoughts and clarifying that there are other factors involved in addition to shifts from the market.


Passage number 152.
MR. PARTEE. It keeps them from going up. I see the point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges the point being made and agrees with it.


Passage number 153.
MR. MARTIN. But my question is: Why wouldn't that haveoccurred earlier than October. I am trying to figure out October andI can't.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not show any disagreement or contention. It simply states Mr. Martin's question and his attempt to understand the timing of an event.


Passage number 154.
MR. AXILROD. Well, that I really can't give an answer to.The banks' MMDA figures were running negative between 5 and 6 percentand then minus 1 percent in September. Then they rose to an 8.8percent rate of growth in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is simply stating a progression of figures without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 155.
11/7/84MR. ROBERTS. For a while the money market funds were moreattractive than the bank funds and that spread has declined morerecently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the decline in the spread between money market funds and bank funds. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 156.
MR. AXILROD. But why banks have chosen to lag their rates atthis point is hard to answer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that it is difficult to answer why banks have chosen to lag their rates at this point.


Passage number 157.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey, did you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. Mr. Guffey is simply asking a question.


Passage number 158.
MR. GUFFEY. Yes. With respect to the October number--and Iknow this won't make a great difference--do I remember correctly thatlast year when we did the seasonal adjustment those figures for thefourth quarter, including October, were revised up substantially.Would you not expect a similar event this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement followed by a question related to a previous year's data.


Passage number 159.
MR. AXILROD. What I have readily in mind is that for thesecond half of last year the rate of growth of M1 was raised 1-3/4percentage points at an annual rate, of which 1 percentage point wasseasonal and .7 was benchmark figures. This year, we've run throughit assuming that money grew 7 percent in November and December andthat changes the configuration somewhat in that the slowdown occursmore gradually over the course of the year. But you still would get,of course, a much slower growth in the latter months of the year thanin the first several months of the year. But it will raise July,August, and September and make October less negative, say, by 4percentage points depending on November-December. There's no doubtabout that; it goes in that direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining the rate of growth of M1 and how it will affect different months of the year.


Passage number 160.
MR. GUFFEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 161.
 That's making a substantial--MR. PARTEE. What if November-December were less than 7percent. If, say, November and December were at 4 percent rather than7 percent, would that have changed the seasonal distribution and inwhich direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee presents a hypothetical scenario in which November and December are at 4 percent instead of 7 percent. This is in response to someone else's statement about making a substantial change. The disagreement arises from the different viewpoints or interpretations of the potential impact of this change in the seasonal distribution.


Passage number 162.
MR. AXILROD. I assume it would. I assume a lower growthrate would tilt a little more of the growth into the second half. ButI didn't run it for that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 163.
MR. GRAMLEY. I have a question about the contention that theincrease in velocity in the fourth quarter might be explained by asupply side phenomenon rather than a demand side phenomenon. I knowthere are differences in speeds of adjustments, depending on themodels, but if you had a stable money demand function and arestriction of supply and the short-run elasticities of demand withrespect to interest rates were a lot less, what you would have is aphenomenon in which interest rates rose much more than they would haveto to equate money demand to money supply. Well, that's not theproblem we are looking at now. Interest rates are going down, not up.It seems to me you have to argue that if we have not had a downwardshift in money demand either we don't really understand the factorsaffecting money demand, which is possible, or that our estimatednominal GNP figure for the fourth quarter is way too high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is raising a question and pointing out that the problem at hand is interest rates going down instead of up. They are suggesting two possibilities for explaining the situation.


Passage number 164.
MR. AXILROD. The only thing I would add to that, GovernorGramley, is that apart from the fact that the model [unintelligible]relationships, one could also argue that interest rates are higher-22-11/7/84than they otherwise would have been, obviously, if you had reallyforced in the money now. That's pretty much what I had in mind.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is adding to the previous statement and sharing their own perspective.


Passage number 165.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you have something to say, Mr.Sternlight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 166.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I was going to add a comment on the questionSteve was raising earlier about why the banks have lagged in bringingdown their rates on MMDA accounts. I think one reason might be thatthey see that as a rather easy way to get in some more retail moneyand lessen their dependence on day-to-day liability managed funds. Ithink some of them are conscious of the problems the big banks havehad and wanted to strengthen their deposit base that way. That couldhave been a factor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply expressing a possible reason for the banks lagging in bringing down their rates on MMDA accounts.


Passage number 167.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without any specific information or context provided.


Passage number 168.
MR. BALLES. I'd just like to ask Steve a question about theuse of his phrase "searching for hypotheses" here in view of theunexpected and unwelcomed decline in M1 in October, which seems to begetting worse. If there had not been a downward shift in moneydemand, are there alternative plausible explanations such as that wedidn't provide enough reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked by one person to another.


Passage number 169.
MR. AXILROD. Well, that's what I was trying to deal with.Reserves did drop somewhere around 15 to 18 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply stating a fact about reserves dropping by a certain percentage. There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the statement.


Passage number 170.
MR. WALLICH. Then interest rates would have had to rise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 171.
MR. AXILROD. Or drop a lot more to get the money in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement by MR. AXILROD is a suggestion or a proposal, rather than a point of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 172.
MR. WALLICH. I mean if you didn't supply enough money anddemand was constant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 173.
MR. AXILROD. The other hypothesis that I tried to [test] wasthat if the demand was weakening in any event and if you supplied moremoney, interest rates would go down even more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating another hypothesis they tried to test.


Passage number 174.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've had enough hypotheses. We will goand drink some coffee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the speaker has had enough hypotheses and wants to go drink some coffee. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 175.
[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me express a few thoughts afterlistening to this conversation this morning, which I thought had quitea different tone than a month ago. The big surge theory seems to havedisappeared or has strongly dissipated at least. Similarly, theeconomy has not been expanding very rapidly in recent months. We hadthat very large--and confusing to me--figure on employment in October.I would emphasize one point that a lot of people have emphasizedalready: The impact of imports on the manufacturing sector of theeconomy is pervasive. I won't go on at great lengths because it wasexplored earlier. But there are signs that what was happening earlierwas that the expansion in demand was so great you could knock off 2percent of it for imports and nobody felt the difference. Now, whendomestic demand goes down, it makes a big difference. And I guess theimports actually have surged. You do get a sense of spreading layoffsamong some pretty big areas in manufacturing industries right in the-23-11/7/84middle of this expansion. You mentioned textiles, shoes, lumber, andsome others. And I think that affects the manufacturers' moodsanyway--not just in terms of the current competition but I think theyare looking at some of their investment plans. Some shoe businessesare going out of business, for instance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and observations after listening to a conversation. They mention that the big surge theory seems to have disappeared, the economy has not been expanding rapidly, and there are signs of spreading layoffs in the manufacturing sector. They also mention that imports have had an impact on the manufacturing sector, but this is not a source of disagreement.


Passage number 176.
MR. PARTEE. Textiles too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply mentions that textiles are also included, without any conflicting opinions or arguments stated.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 177.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And it is leading to some moderationthere. But enough was said about that. As I look at the businesspicture, I think we have a rapid rate of inventory accumulation. Thatdidn't look so bad when the economy was rising rapidly, but as soon asthe economy stops rising so rapidly that rate of inventoryaccumulation has to come down. One senses that that's whatbusinessmen feel. And I think the short-run question we have is: Howwill that happen. If retail sales are strong in the next few months,we can get a declining rate of inventory accumulation in a very smoothway and have a good setting for business next year. If retail salesdon't pick up in the next few months, I think we have a quitedifferent kind of problem. The GNP figure for the fourth quarter maynot be a bit different in total but it's going to include moreinventories and less sales, and that has quite different implicationsfor next year. And I don't think we know. Everybody reports ontalking to retailers who seem to change their minds every two weeksabout their feelings about sales--for good reason, I suspect, becausethere is some instability in them. I surely don't know, but if I hadto guess I'd say the retail sales figure in October is probably goingto be weak because autos presumably were down. The explanation thatthere are not enough cars [in dealer inventories] is beginning to weara little thin on me. Maybe it's all true; there is something curiousin that industry. I don't think the industry wants to produce manymore cars. I am beginning to think they get a nice profit marginwhere they are. The dealers like it, manufacturers like it, and solong as they have the Japanese shut off why take on another workerwith all the pension obligations and everything else. Although we'llget some expansion in production there, I guess it will not be verymuch. We are in a period of great uncertainty, particularly aboutwhat retail sales are going to do. I think plant and equipment[spending] is holding up fairly well. I feel more comfortable abouthousing than I did a while ago simply because interest rates are goingdown. I would comment that I don't have any particular quarrel withthe forecast, but I think we ought to put a good deal of uncertaintyaround any forecast. I would point out that the forecast level hasbeen successively lowered in recent meetings at the same time thatinterest rates have been declining fairly precipitously. We have alower forecast now for economic activity for the next year than we hadin August or in previous meetings, with interest rates 2 percentagepoints lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents differing views and uncertainties about the future of retail sales and economic activity.


Passage number 178.
MR. GRAMLEY. Is that right. I thought the level of real GNPat the end of 1985 was almost exactly what it was in the previousforecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It states a fact about the level of real GNP at the end of 1985 and indicates that it matched the previous forecast.


Passage number 179.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage either does not provide any statements or arguments that would suggest contention or disagreement among different parties, or it is a neutral statement that does not involve any conflicting opinions.


Passage number 180.
 I don't know what the previous--MR. KICHLINE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 181.
 It was, but the near term--24-11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But two forecasts ago we had a 5 percentincrease in the third-quarter GNP and we're now going to have 1-1/2 to2 percent. That's a difference of almost 1 percent [in level terms]in the estimate of one quarter's change. I think it was still higherin an earlier estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is highlighting the difference in estimates for the third-quarter GNP and stating that the earlier estimate was higher. This suggests a disagreement or discrepancy between different forecasts or sources.


Passage number 182.
MR. PARTEE. Then it has been coming down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee is simply stating a fact that something has been coming down.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 183.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It has been coming down by whatever theright amount is. In a perverse kind of way, maybe compared to thecomments that I heard from a lot of people earlier, I feel morecomfortable about the forecast this month than I did last month,partly because interest rates are down and I think the housingforecast is better based. We have the exchange rate at least movingin the other direction; we are not under the same pressure. We havehad some--it is so brief it is hard to tell--firming of commodityprices in recent weeks which is quite in contrast to the trend we hadfor several months prior to that. And we do have that surprisinglygood employment figure in services and retail trade in October, whichI don't understand.Last month I saw no danger, frankly, that we could overeasewithin the practical scope of whatever we were going to do. This timeI am not so sure. Beginning at the level of interest rates that wehave and given the feeling I have about the economy, I could conceivethat we would get overly enthusiastic in terms of easing, whereas Ididn't think that was possible last month. In terms of generallyposturing ourselves, I think we are in a far better position for avariety of reasons, given all the risks that exist, to not be too farbehind the curve in easing if that is the way things develop. That'spartly because we have the risks of the dollar; I would hate to haveto do a lot of aggressive easing in a situation where the dollar isalready declining more than one would like to see. I would rather bein a position where, if anything, we have the easing done and are in aposition to tighten up a little if the dollar does get in real troubleat some point. But in terms of our general posture, it's partly--andthe point has been made--that there is room, obviously, for theeconomy to grow more than 3 percent next year. I am talking about theprobabilities.The inflation picture looks under enough control so that Idon't think we have to worry about an explosion on that side apartfrom anything that would develop on the exchange rate end itself. Itis not a current concern but could be a concern almost at any timelooking to the future depending upon how things develop. And giventhe experience we have had, I don't feel any great sense of inabilityto prevent the economy from bursting out on the up side in theforeseeable future. If we had to tighten some down the road, so beit. I don't have the feeling that it would be an impossible job tokeep the economy from an unfortunate and overextended surge ofactivity if we faced that possibility rather than the opposite one ofcumulating excessive weakness in the economy, given all the risks anduncertainties that I see. And one factor I might mention in thatconnection is that in the rest of the world I still do not see manysigns of ebullient economic activity, to say the least. The Europeaneconomy still seems to me to be in a very sluggish phase. I guess thelatest information from Japan is not so bad, but it's on the slowerside rather than on the stronger side. And that has been the one-25-11/7/84economy that has been showing a pretty good rate of advance. Theproblems in the developing world are obvious enough.Where that all leaves us, I don't quite know. But I think wemay have room for a little more formal easing here if that's what youwant to do. But I don't know that we want to go overboard about it.I might say that in view of the monetary developments, I think theonly question in the past few weeks was whether we should have beeneasier and put in more reserves and reduced the borrowing level. Thereason that was not done was simply because I judged that the tone ofthe discussion and the instructions last time clearly reflected someconcern if interest rates--and the federal funds rate in particular--were to go down around the 10 percent level or below and other rateswere declining rapidly. There wasn't much eagerness for being veryaggressive, so we weren't very aggressive. In fact, interest ratesobviously did get to those levels and in those conditions it didn'tseem all that urgent. But I don't know that I personally had thefeeling that the interest rate developments were disastrously rapid interms of lower rates, given all the conditions. And I am not sure Iwould want to conduct a policy that I thought would actively back themup again as a deliberate matter of policy. But with that muchdiscussion, let us proceed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses uncertainty about the direction of the economy and the appropriate course of action, stating that they feel more comfortable with the forecast this month compared to last month, but they are not convinced that easing is the right move. They also mention that there are risks and uncertainties that they see, indicating that there is contention or disagreement about the best approach.


Passage number 184.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I would like to propose that we moveto an area between alternatives A and B. I think we get halfway thereif we only bring the borrowing level down to $600 million. If the fedfunds rate is running now at, say, 9-7/8 percent on average and wereduce the borrowing level by $100 million, the rate is likely to comedown to 9-1/2 percent or a shade above. I think the markets then willexpect a discount rate cut at some point following that; and if thatwere a 1/2 point reduction, that would bring [the funds rate] down to9 percent. It seems to me that to go all the way to alternative Bwould be a great mistake. Therefore, borrowing somewhere in the areaof $600 million makes the most sense. We probably ought to adjust thefed funds range. I forget what it is now--8 to 12 percent. Maybe weought to make that 7 to 11 percent. For the monetary target figures Iwould probably take numbers halfway between the [A and Balternatives]. I don't have a clear view on M1; it seems to me lessreliable than it has at other times. But the target figure is there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is proposing a specific plan and presenting their reasoning for it, without mentioning any conflicting opinions or alternative options.


Passage number 185.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. By going halfway in between you are makinga final judgment of 1/2 percentage point on a figure that we may comewithin 5 percentage points of if we are lucky.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a belief or opinion about making a final judgment on a figure.


Passage number 186.
MR. PARTEE. We did this past time; it was within 5.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a straightforward statement about a past action.


Passage number 187.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The word "okay" does not express any disagreement or contention. It is a neutral and generally agreeable term.


Passage number 188.
MR. MARTIN. Within 10.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 189.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I am pretty limited by 10.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement given does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states that the speaker is limited by a certain number.


Passage number 190.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 191.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's all I have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement simply implies that the speaker has nothing more to contribute or share.


Passage number 192.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You mentioned something about reducing thediscount rate; I have a comment on that. That may be a market-26-11/7/84expectation, but I don't think there is anything technical that wouldraise the question of a decline in the discount rate if the funds ratewere 9-1/4 or 9-3/4 percent or so. We can do it if we want to, but Idon't see any dynamic in the situation that forces that decision.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion about reducing the discount rate and stating that they don't see a compelling reason to do so based on the current situation.


Passage number 193.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But if the Board were to take themove and cut it by 1/2 point--I'm not saying that it would--the fedfunds rate would go down by 1/2 point with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The sentence simply presents a hypothetical scenario without expressing any conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 194.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might mention: Somebody tells me thatCitibank reduced the prime rate by 1/4 point--a small move on the downside, considering.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no expression of disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply stating information they have received about Citibank reducing the prime rate.


Passage number 195.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. They're trying to influence thesedeliberations here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It simply states that someone is trying to influence the deliberations.


Passage number 196.
MR. CORRIGAN. They'll [unintelligible] one way or the otherhere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the provided passage. It is difficult to determine without knowing the full context and the content of the unintelligible part of the sentence.


Passage number 197.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 198.
MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to put too muchemphasis in our discussion on M1 in a single month, despite themagnitude of that surprise decline of 7 or 7-1/2 percent--I thinkthat's what I heard Steve say--in October. If it carries over intothis month, though, I think it deserves some weight given that thereare so many uncertainties from the real economy that we've all beensharing with one another here. It's so difficult to forecast not onlythe fourth quarter but the first and second quarters of next year whenI think there is a high probability of some difficulties. Yes, eventhe third quarter is still [uncertain].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker acknowledges that there are uncertainties and difficulties in forecasting the economy, indicating some disagreement or contention.


Passage number 199.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just say a word about that M1number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they want to mention something about a specific number.


Passage number 200.
 If I understand it, given the fragmentary information we nowhave for the beginning of the month, we would have to get a bigincrease in the second week of the month--MR. MARTIN. I realize that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their understanding and realizing the information given.


Passage number 201.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will make an empirical comment that bigincreases don't ordinarily come in the second week of a month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of fact or observation and does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 202.
MR. AXILROD. Even before these figures, we had beenforecasting a fairly big increase in the second week of the month.But that is an unusual time for that to occur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about forecasting a big increase in the second week of the month, which is unusual.


Passage number 203.
MR. PARTEE. You have a 7 percent projection for November.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 204.
MR. AXILROD. That's what we had before the very latestfigures. I feel confident it will be lower now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses confidence that the figures will be lower.


Passage number 205.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. A figure that pulls down growth forthe month of October at the end of the month by 1 percentage pointmeans that November is starting appreciably lower than what they wereassuming.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a straightforward explanation of the potential impact of a figure that lowers growth for October.


Passage number 206.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, the level is roughly $3-1/2 [billion]lower than we were assuming.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the level is roughly $3-1/2 billion lower than previously assumed.


Passage number 207.
-27-11/7/84MR. MARTIN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 208.
 So the 7 percent for November in alternative A--MR. PARTEE. It's not going to happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident from the use of the word "not," which indicates a lack of agreement or disagreement with the statement.


Passage number 209.
MR. MARTIN. Of course, it is now way out on the curvesomewhere. I take it so is the 7 percent in alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a statement about the location of certain percentages.


Passage number 210.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it is harder to get those figures inNovember. I don't think there is any question about it. Of course,if we get some momentum, it's not hard to get a big one-month figure.December could be anything. But it's going to be hard to get a bigfigure in November.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and providing reasoning for why it may be harder to achieve a high figure in November.


Passage number 211.
MR. MARTIN. If it were a perfect world--which it isn't, ofcourse--the ideal targeting would be something around the midpoint forM1 and M2. We're getting somewhat different information from M2.Maybe it is a relief in that we are not getting quite the same messageas from M1. But [the midpoint] obviously is not a potential in eitherof the alternatives as regards what could be done the rest of the yearand beginning in the first quarter in terms of getting levels up to apoint that would be consonant with a reasonable rate of real growth inthe economy. There is no point in belaboring the lessons from thereal side of the economy. And you are tired of hearing me talk aboutrisks in the financial system--in thrift institutions, agriculturalbanks, and all the rest. I won't make my usual [comments] and take upyour time--all this overhead sitting around the room--with that. Butstill, it seems to me that we can pay some more attention valuably tothe aggregates, particularly M1 and M2, now. I am not clear withregard to M3. The risk of a growth recession is greatly enhanced ifM1 is allowed to decelerate sharply for the whole fourth quarter. Andeven if we were to set an operating procedure and some short-termtargets in which we overshot the midpoint, I don't see under thesecircumstances--with inflation being under control, the low M1 figurewe have had, and the uncertainties in the economy--that that's asubstantial risk.So, I come down for alternative A. Given what Steve and theChairman have just discussed with regard to the growth of M1 and M2for the fourth quarter, those are not modest figures but they're along way from getting us to the midpoint [of our long-run targets].As I understand it, very temporarily--hopefully very temporarily--theM1 figure is almost at the bottom of the range; it is within $400 to$600 million of the bottom. So, it seems to me that alternative Adoesn't produce any kind of configuration vis-a-vis the midpoint ofeither of those two ranges to have any implication of overstimulationor the revival of inflation. Given what Steve and his colleagues havelaid out here in terms of borrowing getting down considerably belowTony's number, it seems to me it would be well to go for the $400 to$500 million level. If that results in a fed funds rate rate below 9percent or in the 9 to 9-1/2 percent range, that doesn't seem to me aproblem. It was well said that we don't know what the implicationsare of the decline in interest rates that has already occurred. Iagree with that. We also don't know the implications of 4 or maybe 5months of decline in the growth of M1 particularly and to a lesserdegree of M2. We don't know what the aggregates track will turn outto be going into the first quarter, so it seems to me that we are in aposition of being able to change our targeting in an accommodativedirection without any substantial risk of reigniting inflationary-28-11/7/84factors. I say again, at the risk of turning you all off, that if afiscal policy question is going to confront the nation early nextyear, I would hate to see that confrontation with 1 percent realgrowth and unemployment heading for 8 percent or something of thatsort. I vote for "A," Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 212.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 213.
MR. ROBERTS. I would like to reinforce what Governor Martinsaid. I think we are testing our luck by having had no growth in M1for five months. And based on our inability to meet our past targetsfor M1 growth, I have no confidence that the projected November andDecember increases will occur unless we refocus our policy on reservegrowth instead of interest rates, which is what I think we should havedone. I think the reason M1 has not expanded is that we have beenwilling through our policy of targeting borrowing to resist thenatural market declines in interest rates that otherwise would haveoccurred. I noticed that the growth in total reserves and M1 from thefourth quarter [of 1983] to October are essentially the same, forexample. But in recent times we have had this precipitous drop inreserves. So my view would be that this is a time to effect asignificant easing and to accomplish a growth in reserves that willresult in a growth in money--without concern about the level of marketrates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts disagrees with the current policy of targeting interest rates and suggests refocusing on reserve growth instead. He believes that resisting market declines in interest rates has hindered the expansion of M1.


Passage number 214.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I can't provide the answer you're looking for.


Passage number 215.
MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a comment onour operating procedure. It seems to me that the events of thissummer uncovered a significant defect in our current operatingprocedure in that, as a consequence of the Continental situation, thebanks' borrowing behavior was very much different than we had assumedat the time of our meeting. They had a propensity to bid up thefederal funds rate rather than come into the discount window and as aconsequence we had a higher level of interest rates, which also fedinto long-term bond yields, than the Committee had expected at thetime of the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 216.
 If we have an excessively--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What meeting are you talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information given in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 217.
MR. MORRIS. Well, it was the July meeting [or perhaps] twomeetings ago. You recall we were not contemplating a federal fundsrate that would go up to the 11-1/2 to 11-3/4 percent area. I don'tthink anyone around the table was talking about that high a level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is recalling a past meeting and discussing the interest rate that was not expected to be as high as it eventually became.


Passage number 218.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My memory is that that happened beforethat meeting or very close to it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the author's memory of when the event occurred.


Passage number 219.
MR. MORRIS. I would have to look back and find out whichmeeting it was. But I think it is clear that there was a meeting inwhich as a consequence of this change in behavior we got a tighterfederal funds market than any member of the Committee had talkedabout. And it seems to me that if we have a slower economy than wewant now, perhaps part of it at least could have been produced by thathigher level of interest rates than we contemplated. It seems to methat is the fact, and there may be a recurrence of this kind ofsituation in times to come. I just wonder whether we shouldn't takethat into account in how we structure the directive. Since the-29-11/7/84borrowing [level] is not a key factor in the implementation ofmonetary policy, if that borrowing [level] produces unexpected resultsin interest rates, it seems to me that perhaps we ought to have theCommittee take a look at the situation by conference call rather thanjust staying with it and accepting whatever rate comes out of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and suggesting a possible course of action.


Passage number 220.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Frank, one of the problems was thatnobody could be sure how long that unpredictable behavior was going tocontinue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage states a problem without any indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 221.
 We didn't know how long that reluctance to borrow wouldcontinue and we certainly didn't want to take care of it in thedirective because then we would have ended up [targeting] the fedfunds rate more narrowly than I think--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. After hearing the discussion last month, Iwas almost tempted to raise the question on the agenda: Do you wantto target the federal funds rate. That is what most people seemed towant to do last meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses a different opinion from what most people seemed to want to do in the previous meeting.


Passage number 222.
 I wouldn't recommend it, but that's--MR. MORRIS. I recognize that there are a lot of hazards intargeting the federal funds rate. I think the question is whether weought to have a procedure under which, if the borrowing level isproducing a significantly different level of rates than the Committeeexpected, the Committee should at least take a look at it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It discusses a recognition of hazards in targeting the federal funds rate and suggests considering a procedure to address significantly different rate levels.


Passage number 223.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you're misreading this history abit, if I may say so. There is no doubt that the funds rate gothigher than was anticipated, given any particular level of borrowings.But this happened over a period of 4 or 5 months; we had severalmeetings when the interest rate was higher than we expected it to beand there was a deliberate decision not to do anything about it. Whenit first happened, the money supply was rising very rapidly in May andJune and the economy was going along very rapidly and we had quiteebullient forecasts that people weren't objecting to as to the rate ofeconomic growth. So, under those conditions people sat there andsaid, rightly or wrongly: "The interest rate is higher than weexpected it to be but it looks all right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing a clarification and explanation of a particular event or situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 224.
"MR. MORRIS. Sure. That's precisely the point. If it'scoming from a strong economy and is expected, that's one thing. Ifit's coming from a deviant behavior on the part of the banks, that'sanother thing. It seems to me that our procedures ought to be able todifferentiate these.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests a disagreement or contention between two perspectives: one that argues for the impact of a strong economy on the subject being discussed, and another that emphasizes deviant behavior of banks. The speaker, Mr. Morris, implies that there should be a way to differentiate between these two factors in order to address them appropriately.


Passage number 225.
MR. PARTEE. If we can distinguish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: between two types of objection here. One is the objection that the IRS has been dilatory and abusive in the way it has done these audits.  The other objection is that the IRS is not entitled to do these audits at all.  Is the objection that the IRS has been dilatory and abusive accurate or not? Do the arguments presented in the passage support the objection that the IRS is not entitled to do these audits at all?

No. The passage presents two different objections to the actions of the IRS: one regarding their behavior and another questioning their entitlement to conduct audits. However, it does not provide arguments or evidence to support either objection. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 226.
MR. WALLICH. Well, the economy was visibly strong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 227.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know whether you have a particularproposal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express contention or disagreement. It is simply stating uncertainty about whether the person being addressed has a specific proposal.


Passage number 228.
MR. MORRIS. I have a proposal that we ask the staff to takea look at this problem--if you agree that it is one--and to design aproposal for dealing with it in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Morris is suggesting that the staff examine a problem and come up with a proposal, but he does not express any disagreement or argument with anyone else.


Passage number 229.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is not operative for today's meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage states a fact or statement that the mentioned thing is not applicable or relevant to today's meeting. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 230.
MR. MORRIS. No, I'm not talking about today's meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Morris is not referring to the current meeting.


Passage number 231.
-30-11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, perhaps we can return to that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement suggesting the possibility of returning to a previous point of discussion.


Passage number 232.
MR. MORRIS. Beyond that, in line with my previous comments,I would prefer to stand back at the moment with alternative B until weget further information. I would be perfectly willing to support amove to a still further lowering of interest rates if the incomingevidence suggests continued weakening in the economy. But it seems tome that we ought to stop and take a reading with respect to whatimpact the rate declines we have already seen will have on the economybefore we go further.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 233.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How long a time period are you talkingabout.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply seeking clarity by asking for the specific time period being referred to.


Passage number 234.
MR. MORRIS. A few weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflict or disagreement between individuals or ideas. It simply states that Mr. Morris will speak in a few weeks.


Passage number 235.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What information are we going to get inthe next few weeks. We know roughly what industrial production isgoing to be. The big information we're going to get is retail salesfigures; there's nothing else of any significance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing what information they expect to receive in the upcoming weeks, stating that retail sales figures are the most significant data.


Passage number 236.
MR. KICHLINE. Next Wednesday we will get the retail sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the retail sales will be discussed the following Wednesday.


Passage number 237.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is there anything else. When are durablegoods orders. Is there anything else big coming out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 238.
MR. KICHLINE. No. We have personal income on November 19th;housing starts on the 20th; revised GNP figures on the 20th; anddurable goods orders on the 21st, which will be the following week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply provides a list of upcoming economic data releases.


Passage number 239.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So we get retail sales and durable goodsorders two weeks from now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a future event and does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opposing ideas.


Passage number 240.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We are pretty sure that retail saleswill be somewhat on the weak side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is expressing a subjective opinion but there is no clear contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 241.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think the retail sales figure isgoing to tell us much unless it is quite strong. If it is, I wouldthink it significant. Myself, I think it is likely to be weak.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the retail sales figure, stating that unless it is strong, it won't provide much information. They further speculate that it is likely to be weak. There is no contradictory viewpoint or disagreement presented.


Passage number 242.
MR. PARTEE. And the GNP revision is likely to be downward.So the first possible good-size plus number we could get would be ondurable goods. That's hanging an awful lot on durable goods orders.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that the first potential positive number they could receive is on durable goods orders, but does not express any conflicting viewpoints or disagreement.


Passage number 243.
MR. MARTIN. And if the purchasing agents are right, we'renot going to get a plus number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Martin about the potential outcome if the purchasing agents are correct.


Passage number 244.
MR. MORRIS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage involving Mr. Morris.


Passage number 245.
 [Unintelligible] initial claims, basic commodityprices--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We get commodity prices and initialclaims, yes. Are you finished.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement evident in the passage. The speaker seems to be seeking confirmation or agreement from the listener about obtaining commodity prices and initial claims.


Passage number 246.
MR. MORRIS. Yes sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only includes a simple response from Mr. Morris without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 247.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. It simply mentions the name "Mr. Black."


Passage number 248.
-31-11/7/84MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think it is important that we tryto get M1 back on a moderate growth path as quickly as we can. Unlesssomeone is prepared to make pretty heroic assumptions [about] shiftsin demands for money, then it strikes me that a zero rate of growthover a four-month period is just about the maximum that we ought totolerate. But I think we have to be very careful here and inparticular take account of these lagged relationships thattraditionally have existed between short-term rates and M1. We havepushed short-term rates down some 200 basis points, and in the pastsuch a move usually has led to a very sharp spurt in money growth. Itcould be that this lagged response to the rate reductions we havealready had will produce a fairly good pickup in M1 in November andDecember. I think it would be very desirable if we could finish withM1 close to the 6 percent midpoint at the end of the year. But at thesame time, we have to keep in mind that the actions we take now affectreserve pressures over the next few weeks and are going to affect M1in the early part of next year. I can see a danger that an overlydetermined effort to try to get near that midpoint could start us offin 1985 with an unacceptably rapid rate of money growth. But if youlook at the quarterly rates of growth in M1 or the other aggregatesfor 1984 and see how much M1 in particular has decelerated, a fairlyrapid growth in the first quarter of next year would not look all thatbad to me. The bottom line is that I think our reactions should berather cautious and measured.I prefer the aggregate outcomes anticipated by "A," but atthe same time I am not at all sure that it's necessary to push theborrowing target immediately down to $400 million with whateverreduction in the federal funds rate that might imply. I would feelmore comfortable if we moved somewhat more slowly with a higherborrowing target initially for the next couple of weeks or so; if itbecomes clear at that point that M1 is still below path, then I wouldbe prepared to reduce the borrowing target accordingly. I would favor[the language in the Bluebook under] alternative Roman numeral II withcertain changes in the second sentence for the wording of that and Istrongly endorse Frank Morris' suggestion that it really is time forus to look at our procedures. I think everybody wants to get themoney supply growing again, but we have no earthly idea how much wewill have to reduce the borrowing target or how much the federal fundsrate will have to come down to accomplish that. And I think thatmeans that our procedures are pretty faulty. I doubt that I would endup with the same recommendation as Frank but I certainly do endorsehis idea. In view of all these unexpected things that have happenedthis year, our control mechanism leaves a lot to be desired and Ithink we can improve it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct statements of disagreement or contention. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and concerns about the importance of getting M1 back on a moderate growth path, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument presented.


Passage number 249.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information or context about Mr. Corrigan to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 250.
MR. CORRIGAN. From my perspective what we have seen hereover the past several weeks, and indeed months, has been somethingthat I would consider an orderly adjustment in policy and interestrates and so on. There was at least a fleeting moment when I thoughtit might become a little messy but that did not materialize. In thebroad context of the situation that we are looking at, I would not betroubled if interest rates went down a bit more in a context notunlike what Tony spoke about earlier. But let me turn to that in aminute. My view of the economy is a little different from manyothers. That is a factor in my thinking. But I would also caution11/7/84against too much of a reaction to M1. We have been through M1problems and we are going to go through them again. It seems to methat all of these fine arguments that Mr. Axilrod and others makeabout M1 really come down to the question of how many angels can danceon the head of a pin. I don't know how many. I do know that seasonaladjustment factors alone can make a big difference. We have looked atthese data using a seasonal adjustment technique that's veryrespectable--I don't think it's any better than any others but it'svery respectable--and it produces almost a $7 billion increase in themoney supply from the first week of June to the second week of Octoberrather than a decline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct disagreement or contention. It mainly consists of the speaker presenting their perspective on the economy and cautioning against overreacting to certain factors.


Passage number 251.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Better use that seasonal, Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement or suggestion to use something seasonal.


Passage number 252.
MR. PARTEE. We need to have several seasonals and we can usethe one that fits best.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states the need for several seasonals and the intention to choose the most appropriate one.


Passage number 253.
MR. AXILROD. 50 seasonals.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement about someone named Mr. Axilrod and his seasonals, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 254.
MR. CORRIGAN. The point isn't that any one is better thanany other. The point is that this series is notoriously noisy and wedon't really understand it in the short run, and I think to pretendthat we do is a mistake. The only thing we can be sure about in termsof M1 is that if it's surprising us on the down side right now, it'sgoing to be surprising us on the up side at some point in the not toodistant future. So, while I recognize the very special psychologicalif not political significance of M1, I must say I would be verycautious about going too far too fast in response to it even in thecontext of everything else that is going on. My thoughts on specificswould be somewhere between "A" and "B." I have no great concern aboutthe money specifications themselves. Borrowing of $550 to $600million wouldn't bother me. I would prefer, at least for now, toleave the federal funds range at 8 to 12 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is sharing their thoughts and cautioning against making hasty decisions based on the M1 series, but there is no clear disagreement or argument presented.


Passage number 255.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 256.
MR. PARTEE. Well, no one can take first place away from mein recognizing the volatility of the M1 numbers. And I agree, Jerry,that the best thing to expect when we get a decline is a rise in thenext month. But we have been sitting here looking at surprisinglyweak numbers for quite a while and I think there is a cumulativeeffect that most people do feel has a significance. I think enough ofM1 as an indicator that I am inclined to be considerably impressed bythat or I presume that I am going to be impressed by it unless someonegives me very good evidence as to why I shouldn't be. As I review it,M1 has been surprisingly weak over a period of time and probablyerratically weak in October. I just don't see how we could have suchan economy that would produce a 7-1/2 percent decline in money as anindication of the future. But when you put it all together, it doesamount to quite a bit. Because of that and the great damage thatthat's going to do us, as well as what I said earlier about theeconomy falling short and having room for further growth, I would notbe opposed to alternative A as the way to go. I think it's time for afairly pronounced further adjustment. And it won't hurt us; I agreewith Paul that if it turns out to be wrong, we can tighten up a littlelater on.-33-11/7/84But right now it seems to me that the risks are such that weought to be guided to a degree by this weakness in the M1 numbers.One advantage of a Wednesday meeting--maybe it isn't an advantage--isthat at least we get the most recent figures that way. And I wouldpoint out that Steve has indicated that with these most recent figuresit seems very improbable that we could get the M1 specs of alternativeA. So, we ought to use something like the specs of alternative Bsince we already have fallen well short of what was put in theBluebook for us last Friday. I also think that means we have to go toa different kind of description of our policy than just a repetitionof the past one--focusing on what we would hope to see and would beprepared to tolerate in November-December following the surprisingOctober weakness. I guess the Roman numeral II [draft] directive is areasonable thing to be talking about. I would reduce the federalfunds rate range from 8 to 12 percent to 7 to 11 percent, as Tonysuggested; and I would regard the midpoint of that range, 9 percent,as entirely acceptable for the funds rate. [On borrowing], $400million seems a rather marked change in operational targeting. Iwould put it at $500 million but I would not be prepared to accept afigure as high as $600 million, as I think Tony suggested. It is timefor a little "oomph" to get into monetary policy. One final point:If in fact it is true that it is becoming the very general view outthere that the inflation rate is going to be much calmer than waspreviously expected, that, of course means that nominal rates have todrop at least as much as the expected inflation rate--maybe a littlemore--in order to offset the deflating effect of that change inexpectations. So, I don't know that we have gone too far at all interms of the indicative real rates that would be associated with thedeclines we have had in nominal rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker seems to be expressing their thoughts and opinions without directly contradicting or arguing with anyone else.


Passage number 257.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 258.
MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, given what I said earlierthis morning, it's probably not difficult to predict where I come out.Of course, this behavior of M1 throws up some red flags and doessuggest a cautionary attitude. But there are a couple of mitigatingfactors that I would like to put on the table. One, the debt numberis still relatively high and that ameliorates my concern about the M1decline a bit. Secondly, I really don't think that M1 is yet showingthe influence of the lower rates that we've had in the past severalweeks. Indeed, M1 might still be reacting to the higher rates that wehad during the summer. So, given those lags and my view of theeconomy--which is that it's basically coming down to a sustainablelevel and we're going to get some pickup in the fourth quarter andinto 1985 as suggested by the staff--I think we just ought to pause,rest on our oars, and let the easing that has occurred filter throughto the economy and the money supply. M2 and M3 are behaving quiterespectably and I am not at all uncomfortable with adopting a policythat would allow M1 to be in the lower end of the range for thebalance of 1984. I would be very cautious about continuing to easetoo much or pushing too hard in the direction of ease at this point.With respect to the directive, I would prefer alternative B,which as I interpret it is a status quo, wait-and-see alternative; andI would keep borrowing at $700 million with the funds range where itis. As for the directive [language] I would prefer the secondalternative in the Bluebook, although in the second sentence of thatalternative there is reference to M1 being in the lower end of the-34-11/7/84range and I'm not sure that it's necessary to flag that for the publicgenerally. The bottom line for me, Mr. Chairman, is that I think wehave time and I would stay where we are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is an individual expressing their viewpoint and preferences.


Passage number 259.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unfortunately, the passage you provided does not contain enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 260.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, Bob has given my speech; I am with him.I would like to suggest that there is a case that we could look at,Chuck, where the money numbers were giving us the same kind ofmisinformation they are now and that was in the late spring and earlysummer of 1980. Now, the situation was quite different. But we werelooking at very, very large declines in real GNP and so we wereexperiencing weak growth of money because we were moving down themoney demand function. And at the same time the money demand functionwas dropping a ton. Signs that the economy was going to come out ofrecession were beginning to emerge but that was very uncertain. Sowhat we did--and I have to say that I participated in this--is that wekept pushing the interest rates down far enough so that finally we gotthe money growth that we had been contemplating; but when we got it wefound that the economy was roaring upward. So money growth began totake place at horrendous rates and we pushed interest rates way, wayup again and got involved in a situation of volatility of money growthand of interest rates which I think was neither necessary nordesirable. Now, this is a totally different situation than that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing a historical example and discussing their own participation in a decision that ultimately had unintended consequences.


Passage number 261.
MR. PARTEE. You can get whipsawed. There's no questionabout that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. The statement made by Mr. Partee is a simple observation or statement of fact, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions mentioned.


Passage number 262.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes, and that's my point. I am optimistic thatthe economy is going to turn around; the signs of emerging strengthare there. I am not certain, but I am reasonably confident thatthat's going to take place. I would not, therefore, want to seeinterest rates drop much further from where they are now. In thisconnection I would note that the staff forecast implies a federalfunds rate for the end of 1985 in the 10-1/4 percent plus range and ifwe let the rate drop too much further, we are going to be looking atthe need for a significant increase in interest rates to keep both theeconomy and money growth under reasonable control. One point I wantto make is a more or less technical one: The staff has been tellingus that seasonal borrowing is a very, very large part of the totaladjustment plus seasonal borrowing. I think the number for theseasonal component is $300 to $350 million. If we adopted a borrowingtarget of $400 million, we are talking about $50 to $100 million ofpure adjustment borrowing. I don't know where the federal funds rateis going to go but it could go down a lot further than to the 9percent number that the staff is talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 263.
MR. PARTEE. I would assume that we are dealing with a timewhen seasonal borrowing would drop.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply making an assumption about a specific time period.


Passage number 264.
MR. AXILROD. Well, my thought would be that some of it woulddrop. Seasonal borrowing is running well ahead of where it runs witheven much more total borrowing. We don't know for sure how much of itis going to stay because it is seasonal or distress borrowing and howmuch really represents the response to the rate. I think it will endup a little higher than one would normally think in any event.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and uncertainty about the amount of borrowing and its response to the rate.


Passage number 265.
-35-11/7/84MR. ROBERTS. A good part of the seasonal is arbitraging thediscount rate. That was certainly true in my District. People justtook advantage of the opportunity and they will stop doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about their District without expressing any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 266.
MR. AXILROD. That [borrowing] will drop.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The quote simply states a fact or prediction without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions being presented.


Passage number 267.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The conduct of monetary policy wouldbe better, I think, with a mix of a partial movement in the fed fundsrate and a cut in the discount rate in order not to get the borrowinglevels too low. If the borrowing level gets too low, I think thereare complications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 268.
MR. PARTEE. I interrupted Lyle. I really was just thinkingthat we are at the time of the year when we ought to get a drop in theseasonal. That is all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Partee's interruption and his thoughts about a drop in the seasonal time of the year.


Passage number 269.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, that could happen. I think the problemswith the agricultural banks make it less clear that most of them havebeen playing the rate spread and that what we're likely to see is thenormal seasonal decline. In any event, I would stick with alternativeB. If we wanted to shave the borrowing level down to $650 million orso, that would be fine. I would want the federal funds rate to stickin the range of 9-1/2 percent plus or minus a little and wait and seewhat happens.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the speaker's opinion and preference.


Passage number 270.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions Governor Rice without providing any further information or context, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 271.
MR. RICE. As has been pointed out several times here, we'veseen a good deal of easing since the last meeting. As a matter offact, the easing is just about the amount that I had hoped for at thelast meeting, so what has been taking place in the easing of policy isgetting very close to my comfort level. I think it is important notto allow short-term interest rates to fall too far too fast. In thissense, I share Bob Black's feeling of the need for some caution in therate at which we ease policy. Having said that, I think we have to dobetter than alternative B. I would hope for something between "A" and"B" and I am not uncomfortable as we move toward "A." I would be veryhappy to go along with Tony Solomon's recommendation of borrowing at$600 million and adjusting the fed funds rate range down to 7 to 11percent and hope that the aggregates show some improvement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Rice expresses his comfort with the amount of easing that has occurred but also expresses caution about allowing short-term interest rates to fall too quickly. He mentions that he would prefer something between options A and B, indicating a disagreement or difference of opinion about the appropriate level of easing.


Passage number 272.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 273.
MR. BALLES. In view of what I perceive to be the weak spotsin business that could be spreading rather than about to improve, andgiven the sustained undershoot in M1 since the middle of the year, Iam getting quite concerned about that problem. The well knownvolatility of M1 on a monthly basis begins to wash out when it has hada weak performance for four months. I take no comfort in the factthat M2 has been rising steadily because it did so preceding the lastmajor recession that we had. I would be ready to err on the side ofease for a while and if that proves to be too much, we can alwayscorrect it later. By and large the one alternative that to me atleast would be unwise is alternative B, since that anticipates aborrowing level of $700 million and an expected federal funds rate of10 percent. In sum, I would be happy to see alternative A or possiblyhalfway between "A" and "B." And if we were to go for "A," I would bea little cautious in going down to a borrowing level as low as $400-36-11/7/84million right away; I would prefer to start at about $500 million formuch the same reasons Governor Partee has already set forth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their concerns about the weak spots in business and their preference for a more cautious approach to borrowing, but there is no clear disagreement with any other viewpoint or position.


Passage number 274.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context or a specific passage provided involving Governor Wallich to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 275.
MR. WALLICH. On cyclical grounds, I really find it very hardto make an argument for any kind of easing. I see the risks of makingthe same old mistake of easing in the latter stages of an expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, is expressing his personal opinion that he finds it hard to argue for any kind of easing on cyclical grounds. He does not mention any opposing viewpoints or engage in a debate.


Passage number 276.
But the discussion of M1 may provide a justification for how I canperhaps get myself off the hook of being--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I didn't know we had that problem ofeasing too late in an expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The language used is impartial and descriptive, without expressing conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 277.
MR. WALLICH. I think that has been what has often happened.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 278.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We always got accused of the opposite.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This statement suggests that the speaker and their group consistently faced accusations of doing the opposite of something. The presence of accusations implies a potential disagreement or contention between the speaker's group and others who hold a different belief or perspective.


Passage number 279.
MR. WALLICH. Cyclically, I see--maybe it's inadequatetightening. But your remark, Mr. Chairman, that if we overshoot onthe down side we could catch it again and tighten, does encourage me alittle in a different interpretation of the situation. We obviouslyhave very high real interest rates. As Chuck said, each timeinflation expectations come down real interest rates go up. Over timewe have to bring these down. The main way of bringing them down is toreduce the budget deficit. But I think it also has something to dowith monetary policy in the sense that there isn't enough money in theeconomy to allow interest rates to be lower. Now, the difficulty isgetting that money into the economy without going to a very highgrowth rate of the aggregates--which looks terrible, sends the wrongsignal, and may never be caught up with and never be stopped. Whenyou have a temporary reduction in demand for M1, or maybe a permanentreduction, that does provide an opportunity without seeming to gun theaggregates to increase the amount of money in the economy in a limitedway and thereby put pressure on real rates. So, with that analysis, Icould go somewhere between "A" and "B." I think $600 million would bethe maximum, given the danger that borrowing could become too low andthe funds rate might be destabilized.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the author's interpretation of the situation and potential actions to be taken.


Passage number 280.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [You mean] $600 million would be theminimum.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states the minimum amount to be $600 million.


Passage number 281.
MR. PARTEE. That's as far as you would go.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward statement that does not involve any conflicting opinions or opposition.


Passage number 282.
MR. WALLICH. That would be as far as I would want to go.And for the funds rate range, if this is an effort to bring rates downby increasing the stock of money and not the rate of growth of moneyin the economy, 7 to 11 percent would be acceptable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, is expressing their opinion and stating that a funds rate range of 7 to 11 percent would be acceptable if the goal is to bring rates down by increasing the stock of money without increasing the rate of growth of money in the economy.


Passage number 283.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information given to answer whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 284.
MR. KEEHN. Although there is some uncertainty as to wherethe economy is going, from the earlier comments it does seem to methat on balance the tone has changed very substantially from our pastmeeting and that we are in an environment where some easing is areasonable expectation. I wouldn't make too much of the M1 number forone month but, as has been pointed out, this [weakness] has beenpersisting for some period of time now and just maybe it's telling us-37-11/7/84something. I would not in turn overreact, but as I look at the dotson the charts it seems to me that neither alternative A noralternative B is an overreaction. Rather, I would think we ought tobe aiming toward the middle of the range over a longer period of timeas we look into the next year. And that leads me to alternative A. Iwould reduce the federal funds range to recognize a reduction that hastaken place in the market--not so much because I think that 7 percentwould be an operative rate. But if the federal funds rate were to getback into the 11 percent area with any persistence, I certainly thinkthat would be an opportunity for a telephone call. With regard to theborrowings, I think going down to the level suggested in the Bluebookunder alternative A is pretty severe; therefore, I would think aborrowing level of, say, $500 to $550 million would be appropriate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Keehn expressing his thoughts and suggestions.


Passage number 285.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Seger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 286.
MS. SEGER. I am voting for alternative A for two basicreasons. One, of course, is what I see as the slowing in the economyand the sobering of the moods out there in the business world.Secondly, although I am not obsessed with what happens to M1, I amdepressed with what has happened to M1 growth in the four months fromJuly to October. In fact, what is shown even under alternative A forthe final quarter this year does not look like red hot growth. Also,looking at M2, whose expected growth in the fourth quarter is 7-1/2percent, which would be the midpoint of the long-term range, thatdoesn't seem excessive either. And then getting to where this wouldput us at year-end, we would be below the midpoint though within thelong-term ranges for both M1 and M2. So, this doesn't strike me aseasing irresponsibly. Also, when I look at the reserve figures, I amnot surprised that monetary growth was as slow as it was in October.I guess I am surprised it wasn't slower when I see the dive innonborrowed reserves and total reserves. So, I would vote foralternative A. In terms of the directive, I would use the number IIalternative. I don't feel that the relationship between borrowing andthe fed funds rate is clear enough to me to know what kind ofborrowing numbers would come through. It seems to me this is somewhatof a crap shoot; there is obviously a number out there some place thatis the right one, whatever that is, and it will give us fed funds inthe range of 7 to 11 percent and would satisfy me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their own reasons and opinions for voting for alternative A, but there is no direct disagreement or contention with anyone else.


Passage number 287.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Horn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage because only one person is mentioned and there is no indication of any conflicting opinions or ideas.


Passage number 288.
MS. HORN. In my opinion the pause in the economy and severalmonths of flatness in the money supply argue for active support ofgrowth in the money supply. Both "A" and "B" accept a shortfall inmoney, which I favor, but of the two I would favor moving towardalternative A. I would like to see that kind of growth rate inNovember and December. I think we ought to move carefully toward that.I wouldn't want to jump to a $400 million borrowing level. And as wetest borrowing levels below $700 million, I would like to see a 9percent plus federal funds rate and something around 9 percenttriggering a call. I am assuming something quite far towardalternative A. In that assumption I assume no change in the discountrate. I am sympathetic with the people who have said that we havecome a long way with regard to interest rates; they are downconsiderably and we ought to wait and see [the impact of] what we havealready done. In addition, I still believe that the long-termunderlying problem in the economy, and our top priority, is inflation.-38-11/7/84So, if we adopt something toward alternative A, we may have to reverseour actions if the recovery comes on as strongly as I think it mightor if the growth in money resumes. But I prefer to take the risk ofthe reversal to the risk of waiting. That's where I come out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their own opinion and preferences, but there is no conflicting viewpoint being presented or argued against.


Passage number 289.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not provide any information about Mr. Guffey to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 290.
MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to thedifference between alternatives A and B, given the money numbers thatwe have looked at, clearly a move to alternative A would suggest somefurther easing immediately after this meeting. We don't have a lot ofhope, judging from the comments around the table and from the staff,that we will reach the level of money growth that is incorporated inalternative B; therefore, if we move to alternative A, we are going tobe easing more aggressively immediately after this meeting. Thesecond point is that in accordance with the staff's projection,alternative B suggests a federal funds rate in the neighborhood of 10percent with a $700 million borrowing level. I think there is fairlygood evidence that there has been some shift in the demand forborrowing and, therefore, the relationship between the borrowing leveland the federal funds rate is perhaps less precise than in the past.Let me just make two points in that regard. One is that, clearly, theunwillingness of large banks to borrow following the Continentalsituation has reversed itself. They don't seem to be experiencingthat unwillingness and as a result have come back to the discountwindow. The second and more important thing is what Lyle Gramley hasspoken of and that is the relationship of the borrowing level to thefederal funds rate when you incorporate seasonal borrowing into thatborrowing level. Traditionally, seasonal borrowing has commencedgrowing around the first of the year, grows through August, and thendeclines to almost zero by the end of the year. This particular yearthat pattern did hold, but at a much higher level. Seasonal borrowinghas been much higher than in the past. And there has been little orno decline from August forward, as we would have experienced in thepast. We're now in the $300 to $325 million range for seasonalborrowing; if you consider that that has become less sensitive tointerest rates, there is very little room. If you take that away fromthe total borrowing level of $700 million, we are at a frictionallevel, it seems to me; adjustment borrowing would be virtuallynonexistent if we go to the $400 million level and at the frictionallevel if we remain at the [current] level.The conclusion that I would draw from all of this is that Iwould opt for alternative B because we don't know what relationshipswill come to pass as the result of the interest rate drops that havealready taken place. I would consider those fairly aggressive--1-1/2to 2 percentage points over the last five weeks. Secondly, I wouldalso anticipate that if we adopted "B" as specified in the Bluebookwith a $700 million level of borrowing, we would see some furthereasing in interest rate levels, maybe to the 9, 9-1/4 or 9-1/2 percentarea. It would seem quite appropriate to me that we get to that 9 to9-1/2 percent area, but I think we can achieve it with a $700 millionborrowing level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 291.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Why do you say that, Roger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the given passage, there is a question asked but no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 292.
MR. GUFFEY. Simply because a good part of the seasonal isinelastic now or unresponsive to interest rate levels, which I think-39-11/7/84the record would reflect. Then you're really operating on a borrowingfunction of something in the neighborhood of $400 million and that iscloser to a 9 percent federal funds rate than a 9-1/2 percent rate, assuggested by the Bluebook. Alternative A would get you there with a$400 million borrowing level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing the borrowing function and interest rate levels, but there is no explicit contention or disagreement.


Passage number 293.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I agree with you on the $400million. I am just a little surprised that you said to continue the$700 million level would bring fed funds down to about 9-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker starts by expressing agreement with the other person's statement about $400 million, and then expresses surprise at the other person's statement about the $700 million level. However, this surprise does not indicate a disagreement or argument.


Passage number 294.
MR. GUFFEY. I think fed funds right now are probably at the9-1/2 percent level or thereabouts. If we don't do anything, I thinkwe will see them come on down to that level. The last point I want tomake is that if I were running policy by my own prescription, I wouldrather take "B" and a $700 million borrowing level for the reasons Ihave just expressed--expecting fed funds to come down to the 9-1/2percent area. Then, if we saw a need for further easing, I would doit with a discount rate decrease rather than letting the fed fundsrate run down to 9 percent or maybe even below 9 percent and thenmaking a 1/4 or 1/2 point cut in the discount rate, which could push[rates] down to a level that I would not want to see occur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 295.
MR. PARTEE. May I just ask Roger a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no mention of contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks if they can ask Roger a question.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 296.
MR. GUFFEY. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the fact that Mr. Guffey responds with "Yes" to a question or statement that presumably opposes or contradicts his own viewpoint or stance.


Passage number 297.
MR. PARTEE. Roger, I've never looked all that closely atthese seasonal borrowing arrangements. Do they have a terminal date.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee simply states that he hasn't looked closely at the seasonal borrowing arrangements.


Passage number 298.
MR. GUFFEY. Yes, there should be a terminal date on seasonalborrowing; it can run out as far as 11 months, Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Guffey expressing his opinion about having a terminal date on seasonal borrowing.


Passage number 299.
MR. PARTEE. And you said it started in April.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that someone said something started in April.


Passage number 300.
MR. GUFFEY. Historically, such borrowings start at the firstof the year. Just to give you the figures from '81 to '83: Onaverage, they would go up to a $250 million peak level in July andthen decline back down to about $60 million in December. The patternthis year was that they started out at about $80 million in January,progressed up to a $350 million peak in August and are currently inthe $310 to $325 million range; we don't see that falloff in the lasthalf of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This passage is simply providing information and data about borrowings over a period of time.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 301.
MR. PARTEE. That was why I asked that question. I justwondered whether there would come a point where you would want toclean up and call them off and say the year is over.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee wonders if there will come a point where someone will want to clean up and call off the year, suggesting that he disagrees with continuing the current course of action.


Passage number 302.
MR. GUFFEY. If you consider that it is inelastic and thatthere has been a shift in demand for borrowing, then those banks thatrun out of their seasonal privilege are going to come back in foradjustment credit or they are going to be illiquid.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a hypothetical situation and the potential actions of banks in response to changes in borrowing demand.


Passage number 303.
MR. PARTEE. Then it will be adjustment credit at that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 304.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the following passage.


Passage number 305.
MR. BOEHNE. I came into this meeting with a lot ofuncertainty about the economy and the outlook and, as it draws to a-40-11/7/84close, I really don't feel as though I have been overwhelmed by anabundance of clear vision.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses the speaker's own uncertainty and lack of clarity about the economy and outlook.


Passage number 306.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The clearest vision we may have is thatwe're uncertain.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating that the clearest vision we may have is uncertainty, suggesting that there is agreement on the idea that uncertainty is the most certain aspect of our vision.


Passage number 307.
MR. BOEHNE. I think we are all pretty much in the same boatof uncertainty. It really comes down, then, to how you postureyourself when you aren't sure and where you have more room for error.I think there is considerably more room for error on the expansionside than on the slowdown side. So, for all the reasons that havebeen given in support of that position, I come down on the side ofalternative A. I think it is easier to undo a mistake on thestimulative side at this point than to undo a mistake of not beingstimulative enough. I do think $400 million on borrowing is a littlelow; $500 million makes sense to me. Initially, my main concern isthat it is a long time between now and the next meeting. If we tackon to the four months or so of slow growth in the economy and slowgrowth of the money supply, we could end up with six months of thewrong kinds of numbers. I am not a great fan of money but I think itdoes tell us something when it begins to cumulate like this. So, Ithink we ought to be awfully careful as we go through the intermeetingperiod. And if it turns out that the incoming figures on the economyare weaker and money continues to be weak and we don't have any reallygood reasons to explain it other than a weak economy, then I think wemay have to become increasingly aggressive as we head toward the endof the year. I don't have strong feelings on the directive language;I have a slight preference for alternative I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not appear to contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses personal views and preferences but does not encounter any opposing viewpoints or engage in a debate.


Passage number 308.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided to analyze and determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 309.
MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, as I indicated a little earlier,my view of the economic outlook is not quite as pessimistic as some.I find myself in a dilemma because I find myself agreeing with thelast speaker regardless of what he has said. Intuitively, theuncertainty that we all share, which is obvious, tells me that weshouldn't do very much that is different from what we are doing atthis point. I really agreed with Karen Horn's description of thesituation except that I come to a different conclusion about what todo about it. I would remain where we are, alternative B asprescribed, and then as events unfold move to a little more ease ifnecessary as opposed to going the other way to a bit more ease now inthe recognition that we could move policy back. I would not go thatway. On the borrowing assumption, however, I would not feel asstrongly that it has to remain at $700 million. I rather agree withRoger: Alternative B as prescribed but with an initial borrowingassumption of $600 million would be all right with me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges that there are differing views on the economic outlook but states their agreement with the last speaker on the need for caution. They express their own opinion on what actions should be taken but also indicate agreement with a different borrowing assumption.


Passage number 310.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Since I have not looked at thesedirectives very closely, the first one is just like last time, right.We would have to put in different numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply making an observation and a question about the directives.


Passage number 311.
MR. PARTEE. We are going to have to put in a lower Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It only mentions a decision to "put in a lower Ml" without any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 312.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I ordinarily have a strong bias toward notchanging these directives in mid-quarter, but this time we are so faroff on M1 that maybe it would be better to change the whole thing thanto put in a funny number, which leads me to alternative II. A number-41-11/7/84of people, but not everybody, mentioned II. Let me ask whether weshould work from II. I am not saying every dot and tittle of it, butthe difference is that it involves saying something special about M1.That's the substance of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges their bias towards not changing directives in the middle of the quarter but suggests making an exception due to the discrepancy in M1. They then mention that some people mentioned alternative II and ask for opinions on whether they should work from it. The speaker also clarifies that they are not suggesting following alternative II exactly but mentions the difference it would make in terms of addressing M1 specifically.


Passage number 313.
MR. WALLICH. I see a case for alternative I because I don'tthink we want to show a very high rate of money growth. If we do easesome, we would be doing enough. I don't think one would want tosignal on top of that that something is being done that is reallyirrelevant [to our decisions], which is the sense [of the difference]between alternative I and alternative II.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. Mr. Wallich is simply expressing his opinion on the matter at hand.


Passage number 314.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I am a little concerned also aboutthe market speculating as to why we gave two-month instead of three-month growth rates. A lot of [market observers] will presume thereare reasons; and if so, I wonder if they're worthy ones. If thenumbers add up to what they add up to, then I don't see why we shouldput ourselves in the position of treating M1 specially in order tocome up with a higher-sounding number when anybody who really is a Fedwatcher is going to know exactly what it will mean and that it willsay the same thing for the quarter as a whole. I have a mildpreference for alternative I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 315.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have not really examined this closelybut the thought just occurred to me: Suppose we combine alternative Iand II and avoid the two-month number. It may be a bad precedentsince we haven't the vaguest idea whether we are going to come closeto it for two months and part of the two months is already over. Butsuppose we said something like: "This action is expected to beconsistent with growth of M2 and M3" at whatever [rates we decide].Those rates are not changed in substance or even not changed at all.Maybe we could even say "as indicated last month." However, then we'dput in a special sentence about M1. "In view of the shortfall in M1in October it is anticipated that the quarterly figure would be"--whatever. And then maybe we should pick up this part "More rapidgrowth would be acceptable in M1 in view of the substantial decline ofM1 in October which brought that aggregate in the bottom half of itslong-term range." Or we could leave that last part off. Maybe that'sthe way to do it: Just put in a quarterly figure and a sentence on M1and then say, just as you say here, that more rapid growth would beacceptable in view of the substantial decline. Make that the thirdsentence of alternative I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The writer is exploring different options and possibilities for combining alternative I and II. They are considering different ways of phrasing and presenting the information, but there is no argument or opposition presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 316.
MR. PARTEE. My objection to leaving it the way it is isthis: It seems to me that either we make a mockery of having hadtargets or we have to ease an awfully lot more to get growth up to 6percent. How can you reduce it from 6 percent to 2-1/2 percent justbecause you have had a bad month. Paul's way of dealing with that atleast makes it understandable, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, MR. PARTEE, is stating his objection to leaving something the way it is. He believes that either they are disregarding the previously set targets or they need to make significant adjustments to achieve the desired growth. He disagrees with the idea of reducing the target from 6 percent to 2-1/2 percent solely based on a bad month.


Passage number 317.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The term "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" simply refers to a person and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 318.
 At least we are admitting--MR. MARTIN. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is agreeing with the statement made by someone else.


Passage number 319.
MR. GUFFEY. But the number that we will put in there withthat change will be something in the neighborhood of 1-1/2 to 2percent for M1 growth in the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a number that will be put in place for M1 growth in the fourth quarter.


Passage number 320.
-42-11/7/84MR. PARTEE. It will be pretty small.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not contain any meaningful content or statements that can elicit contention or disagreement. It appears to be a random combination of numbers and abbreviations that does not convey any clear message or argument.


Passage number 321.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think it is going to changewhatever we put in anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about a potential change without any opposing viewpoints mentioned.


Passage number 322.
MR. GUFFEY. That is the reason I would opt for alternativeII, so we don't have to deal with it in mid-quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a response by Mr. Guffey stating his preference for alternative II. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement.


Passage number 323.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I presumed we were going to put in 2-1/2to 3-1/2 percent or compromise between them and put in 3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their assumption or belief that a certain range of percentages will be used or a compromise will be reached between them.


Passage number 324.
MR. AXILROD. Well, alternative II is only focused on the twomonths for M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that alternative II focuses on the two months for M1 without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 325.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I know, but I presume that's the same assome quarterly figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is acknowledging their own knowledge and making an assumption that the quarterly figure being referred to is the same as the one they are aware of.


Passage number 326.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The reason is that the passage only mentions Mr. Partee without providing any context or information about his actions or opinions. Without further information, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement regarding Mr. Partee.


Passage number 327.
 Yes, it's 2-1/2 or 3-1/2 percent, depending on--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's going to take 1/2 percentbigger growth for the two months because we are one percent lower inOctober than we thought we were.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting different calculations and pointing out that the growth rate will be dependent on certain variables.


Passage number 328.
MR. PARTEE. So we can't really put in more than 3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a straightforward statement of fact without any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 329.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Three is a nice round number and thatimplies a little over seven percent, I take it, for November-December.I don't even know what you have. What are you intending to put inhere on the two alternatives. You said 7 percent for "B." What wasit for "A".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 330.
MR. AXILROD. "A" had 8-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement made by Mr. Axilrod is a straightforward statement about a percentage.


Passage number 331.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible.] So, it is 8 or 8-1/2percent, I guess. For "B" you had 7 percent and for "A" you had 8-1/2percent and it is starting out a little low so that adds another 1/2percent. So you would have 7-1/2 [and] 9 percent for those twomonths.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating percentages for "B" and "A" and explaining how they add up to get the total percentage for the two months.


Passage number 332.
 If we put in 3 percent--if I'm doing this arithmetic right--that implies 8 to 8-1/2 percent for--MR. GUFFEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply stating a mathematical calculation.


Passage number 333.
 Something more--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, 3-1/2 percent presumably implies 9percent. If my arithmetic is right, it comes out about 8-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply performing a calculation based on the given information and stating the result.


Passage number 334.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, it's about 8-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a numerical percentage and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 335.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, that's right; you need 8-1/4 percent forNovember-December to get 3 percent for the three months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is discussing interest rates for a specific period of time.


Passage number 336.
MR. AXILROD. Well, our numbers are 3-1/2 percent forSeptember to December and 8-1/2 percent for October to December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod is simply stating the numbers.


Passage number 337.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With the new October figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 338.
MR. AXILROD. No, I am sorry. That's with the old October[unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply apologizes for not having the information the listener requested.


Passage number 339.
-43-11/7/84MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, if you haven't written offalternative II altogether, I think you can do essentially that samething fairly easily if you change the second sentence right after thesemi-colon and say something like "which would partly offset theunanticipated decline in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 340.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There isn't that much difference betweenthese two [alternatives]. The only difference is that one sentencereally. It's a question of whether we state it as a quarterly figureor as a two-month figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is comparing two alternatives but does not express any disagreement or contention. It simply states that the only difference between the options is how the information is presented.


Passage number 341.
MR. BLACK. That's exactly right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black agrees with the previous statement and confirms that it is correct.


Passage number 342.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The rest of this is all open.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "The rest of this is all open" indicates that there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 343.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, not only have we used quarterlyfigures but, as I said before, Fed watchers are going to come out withthe same arithmetic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 344.
 Thirdly, if we do fall short of this 8 to 9percent growth in November and December--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know how you got that figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses confusion about how the figure of 8 to 9 percent growth was derived, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument being made.


Passage number 345.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. --it clearly makes it even fairlyobvious to non-Fed watchers and casual Fed watchers that there wasthis enormous shortfall. I just don't see why we want to play aroundwith moving away from the quarterly numbers. The minute we do thatthey are really going to take out their pencils and do all thearithmetic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their belief that it is obvious to both non-Fed watchers and casual Fed watchers that there was a significant shortfall. They also express confusion about why there is a desire to move away from quarterly numbers. The statement does not involve any discussion or disagreement with another perspective.


Passage number 346.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the only issue here, which is nota substantive issue but a cosmetic issue, is precisely that: whetherwe want to cite a two-month number--whether that's a good policy onbalance or not. I have some sympathy for saying it's not. We'vepretty consistently used quarterly numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is only one issue being discussed, and then offers their personal opinion on the matter. They also mention a consistency in using quarterly numbers, indicating that there is no conflict or debate surrounding this practice.


Passage number 347.
MR. MARTIN. We don't have any real reason for the shortfallsand how to read them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is a lack of real reason for the shortfalls and how to interpret them.


Passage number 348.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I guess I am saying that we might as wellstick with the quarterly figure. In either event, I would make aspecial sentence about M1 and say whatever we want to say about ashortfall in it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply expresses a personal opinion or suggestion about sticking with the quarterly figure and adding a special sentence about M1.


Passage number 349.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Let me ask a minor question, Steve.If my recall is correct, and it probably isn't, didn't we always usethe word "reduce" rather than "decrease" existing pressures on reservepositions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and acknowledging the possibility that their recall may not be correct.


Passage number 350.
MR. AXILROD. Oh heavens, I don't remember.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement expressing forgetfulness and uncertainty.


Passage number 351.
MR. GRAMLEY. You think there's a difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The provided passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of a statement by Mr. Gramley asking for someone's opinion on a matter, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 352.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. People are going to wonder why.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. People are going to wonder why. This statement suggests that there may be a potential disagreement or difference of opinion among people as they ponder or question the reason behind something.


Passage number 353.
MR. AXILROD. I can't imagine that they will.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's beliefs or assumptions.


Passage number 354.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But am I correct that we always used"reduce".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 355.
-44-11/7/84MR. AXILROD. I don't know. I can check.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they don't know the answer and can check to provide the information.


Passage number 356.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me try to resolve the problem wehave here and then we can come back and try to write something.Again, I don't think there is a substantive difference. After "Thisaction is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3" whydon't we put in the same figures we had before. We're within a halfpercent of them, aren't we.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply suggesting a solution and proposing to use the same figures as before.


Passage number 357.
MR. AXILROD. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 358.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's say "growth of M2 and M3 at annualrates of 7-1/2 and 9 percent." All right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply stating a hypothetical scenario about the growth rates of M2 and M3.


Passage number 359.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context about Mr. Axilrod that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 360.
 That is, we are projecting to be within that;we are not actually--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement or clarification of a projected outcome.


Passage number 361.
MR. AXILROD. Well, the October figures are quite different:6 percent for M2 and 10 percent or so for M3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents the October figures for M2 and M3 without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 362.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's still a reasonable target, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning if something is still a reasonable target, indicating uncertainty or seeking confirmation.


Passage number 363.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, that's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod simply affirms that the statement or suggestion made by someone else is correct.


Passage number 364.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Shall we stick a phrase at the end of thatsuch as "as indicated at the last meeting" or something like that.Then go with another sentence on M1. Well, maybe we don't need that"as indicated at the last meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is just considering alternatives and weighing the need for a specific phrase.


Passage number 365.
"MR. AXILROD. You could say "continue to be consistent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply suggests that someone could say "continue to be consistent," without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 366.
"MR. PARTEE. Except we're changing the specifications,though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the specifications are being changed.


Passage number 367.
 So, "continue to be consistent"--MR. GRAMLEY. No matter what we do, they are going to grow atthose rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact that regardless of what is done, they will grow at those rates.


Passage number 368.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "M1 is expected to grow over the periodby" whatever. Let's say 3 percent tentatively, which is halfwaybetween and a round number. We could just put a semi-colon and thensay "more rapid growth would be acceptable in view of the substantialdecline of M1 in October." Or we could say "M1 is expected to growover the period by 3 percent, less than anticipated earlier in view ofthe shortfall in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement first provides an expected growth rate for M1 (3 percent) and then acknowledges that this growth rate is lower than initially anticipated due to the shortfall in October. This is a straightforward explanation of the expected growth rate.


Passage number 369.
"MR. AXILROD. That's better.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement or affirmation made by Mr. Axilrod.


Passage number 370.
MR. GUFFEY. What period are we speaking of.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks a question about the period being discussed.


Passage number 371.
MR. AXILROD. From September.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a fragment and does not contain enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 372.
MR. GUFFEY. Oh, September to December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a timeframe from September to December.


Passage number 373.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And then we could go on to say "In thelight of that shortfall, more rapid growth in that aggregate would beacceptable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments. It simply proposes a suggestion based on a given situation.


Passage number 374.
"-45-11/7/84VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do you want to say "In view of thenegative number in October" rather than "the shortfall".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The question is asking for clarification or confirmation regarding the use of a phrase, but it does not indicate any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 375.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think "decline in October" is all right.Then we're going to say more generally "Lesser restraint on reservepositions would be acceptable in the event of significantly slowergrowth in the monetary aggregates." I sure don't know whether we needthat greater restraint sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 376.
MR. PARTEE. The whole thing starts out with "decreasesomewhat." I wonder whether we want the "somewhat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing curiosity or doubt about the usage of the word "somewhat," but there is no explicit disagreement with anyone.


Passage number 377.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's get to that point. Is that generalframework of the directive--just in terms of the language--all right.SPEAKER(.). Mind over matter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Let's get to that point" suggests a willingness to proceed and discuss something. The following question about the general framework of the directive does not indicate disagreement either. The interruption by the speaker with "mind over matter" is unrelated to any contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 378.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me take the funds rate first; thatseems to be easier. Most people have said 7 to 11 percent, whichmakes sense to me. It's more centered and we raised it not so longago. I think after all this period of time it might be appropriate tohave some gesture toward reducing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author states that most people have suggested a range of 7 to 11 percent for the funds rate, which the author agrees with and finds reasonable. They also suggest that it might be appropriate to consider reducing it after a period of time.


Passage number 379.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's a lucky number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "It's a lucky number" is a subjective opinion and does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 380.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Generally, we are at 7 to 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a range of numbers without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 381.
MR. MARTIN. Yes.SPEAKER(.). I guess so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin agrees with Speaker's statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 382.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The critical figure will be the borrowingassumption. There we are dealing with a great deal of uncertainty. Ithink all these comments about the seasonal borrowing are relevant butalso I suppose it's possible that the seasonal borrowing will decreasenow that market rates are so low. We had an experience recently witha big bank waltzing in for a large amount of borrowing for no apparentreason. And if one or two big banks waltz in during a reserve period,that uses up all our borrowing here and we're left in a peculiarposition. We have a full range of proposals here--from $400 or closeto it to $700 million, which averages to $550 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "I think all these comments about the seasonal borrowing are relevant" suggests that the author agrees with the comments made about seasonal borrowing. However, the phrase "I suppose it's possible that the seasonal borrowing will decrease now that market rates are so low" introduces a different viewpoint or uncertainty regarding the borrowing assumption.


Passage number 383.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You may have two groups of dissentingvotes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 384.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I do think there is some danger in easingtoo aggressively here. I don't think that analogy in '80 is aterribly good one to give because we had those credit controls andother factors that were driving down M1. But we have had a prettygood decline in interest rates. I personally feel a little morecomfortable about the outlook simply because interest rates havedeclined. I think we have to show some motion here and that seems tobe the prevailing sentiment. What anything means I don't know. As apractical matter, I take it nobody would be very happy at this stage,contrary to a few weeks ago, to see the rates backing up appreciablyin the market; the bill rate can go up a little from where it is todayand so forth. But I don't know what borrowing level providesassurance against that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and uncertainty about the potential risks of easing too aggressively and the impact of interest rates on the outlook. They also mention that nobody would be happy to see rates backing up in the market, but they do not provide any contradictory statements or conflicts with the prevailing sentiment.


Passage number 385.
-46-11/7/84VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm afraid that at $700 million theremight very well be some backing up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a concern or fear about the possibility of there being backing up at $700 million.


Passage number 386.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I agree with that. We don't know that,but I would agree that the odds are substantial in that case. Itcould happen with $600 million but that is less likely, depending uponwhere you think it is now. Driving it down to $500 million seems tome a bigger step than is appropriate at the moment. Maybe it will beappropriate in a few weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement with a previous statement and providing further explanation and analysis.


Passage number 387.
 My view is that that could put the fundsrate at 8-1/2 percent, given--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing the speaker's own view or opinion, without any opposing or contradicting statements. Therefore, the answer is no.


Passage number 388.
 If we have a volatile--MR. PARTEE. I thought we had a staff projection that $400million would be consistent with 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The statement is interrupted by someone else's thought, but there is no indication of disagreement between the speakers.


Passage number 389.
MR. RICE. Yes, that $400 million would be 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply agrees with the statement that the $400 million would be 9 percent.


Passage number 390.
MR. AXILROD. We think that borrowing of $400 million willkeep the funds rate slightly above the discount rate. And it might gobelow that; I don't think it will. A lot depends on how we manageoperations and the signals given. In general, that's probably right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states their opinion about borrowing $400 million and its potential impact on the funds rate.


Passage number 391.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But, if the markets think that we'regoing to be easing aggressively, they will go even further, Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement about the potential reaction of the markets to a certain situation.


Passage number 392.
MR. PARTEE. They probably won't cut it much below thediscount rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement made by MR. PARTEE without any indication of opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 393.
MR. AXILROD. Well, I ought to add a caveat, Governor Partee.With this two-week reserve period what President Solomon mentioned isperfectly right. If we have to push reserves in aggressively to getthe borrowings down or if some big bank comes in early and creates alot of excess reserves and the funds rate tends to go down,anticipations of a discount rate decrease will come into play and theactual funds rate may actually fall below the present discount rate.Now, I can't imagine that the borrowing will be particularly high inthose circumstances, but there is some give there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Axilrod is simply adding a caveat and explaining a potential outcome based on certain circumstances.


Passage number 394.
MR. PARTEE. It would be pretty eccentric to have the fundsrate much below the discount rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker is expressing their opinion that it would be unusual or odd to have the funds rate significantly lower than the discount rate. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 395.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, not for any sustained period. But it hasbeen for a few days; it was on Monday and Tuesday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 396.
MR. PARTEE. Maybe we just ought to provide some reserves andforget about this borrowing number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is suggesting a course of action and there is no indication of disagreement from anyone else.


Passage number 397.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage only mentions Chairman Volcker without providing any context or details that would indicate a contention or disagreement.


Passage number 398.
 We could do that, but we're going to getthe--MR. PARTEE. We don't know what will happen then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. Although there is interruption indicated by "--MR. PARTEE," it does not necessarily imply disagreement or conflict. It is more of an interruption or interjection in response to uncertainty about the future outcome.


Passage number 399.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If the money supply is weak, we are goingto drive [the funds rate] way down and then you get into the '80s[situation].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not involve contention or disagreement. It is a statement discussing a hypothetical scenario related to the money supply and its potential impact on the funds rate.


Passage number 400.
 That's what we did in 1980--MR. PARTEE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 401.
11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --until we finally stopped and the fundsrate got way below the discount rate. Maybe that's what we want to doat the next step but I am not sure we want to do it right now. Giventhe way this market has been acting, my gut feeling is that we oughtto be in the $550 to $600 million range. And if the rate shows signsof backing up at that level--unless we get some really good businessnumbers--we ought to let borrowing go down further pretty promptly butdo it over [a few weeks]. We have one two-week reserve period andthen we have another two-week reserve period. I'd do it by the nextreserve period maybe, but not all at once. Are we in the first weekof a reserve period. No, we're just ending a reserve period.SPEAKER(.). It starts on Thursday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and considering different options, but there are no conflicting opinions or arguments between multiple speakers.


Passage number 402.
MR. AXILROD. The reserve period starts tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 403.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, by the beginning of the next reserveperiod we will have the retail sales and the durable goods ordersfigures and some more data on unemployment claims, won't we.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 404.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We will have more flexibility andmore options to move or not to move on the discount rate if we go downto the $600 million, or possibly the $550 million, level. I think the$600 million level is better, because otherwise we are going to havereal problems with what may be a psychological situation in themarkets where the expectations are so heavy for a discount rate cutand so affecting behavior that we may feel that that's what we want todo if conditions indicate further easing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different options and expressing their opinion on which option is better based on the potential market behavior and expectations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 405.
MR. PARTEE. That second reserve period, if I am reading itcorrectly from the calendar, starts with Thanksgiving. Is that aproblem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is indicated by the phrase "Is that a problem" at the end, suggesting that Mr. Partee has a concern or disagreement regarding the second reserve period starting with Thanksgiving.


Passage number 406.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We serve pressed turkey here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that "pressed turkey" is served at a particular place.


Passage number 407.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a thing for pressed turkey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement expresses a personal preference or liking for pressed turkey, but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 408.
MR. MARTIN. We don't want to end up being the turkey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement by Mr. Martin is a clear expression of a shared perspective or belief, rather than a contentious or conflicting viewpoint.

MR. PARTEE. That second period may be eccentric because ofthe holiday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states that the second period "may be eccentric" due to the holiday.


Passage number 410.
MR. STERNLIGHT. There might be reserve problems because ofthe holiday then, but I don't think it presents any problem for edgingthe borrowing down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sternlight is stating his opinion about a potential problem but does not mention any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 411.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their willingness to accept $550 million as a starting point for negotiation or progress.


Passage number 415.
MR. MARTIN. What would the second step be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple question asking for clarification or further information.


Passage number 416.
-48-11/7/84MR. PARTEE. Well, it would depend on whether we had to gofurther. We would have to go down toward $400.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 418.
 If the money supply is weak and theeconomy is weak and so forth--MR. PARTEE. If everything is still weak, probably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The statement "If everything is still weak, probably" indicates a possible disagreement or difference in viewpoint between the speaker (Mr. Partee) and the previous statement. Mr. Partee's response suggests skepticism or doubt about the previous assertion.


Passage number 419.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Or a discount rate cut rather than gocompletely down to $400 million in the second step.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage is providing information about a potential discount rate cut. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 420.
MR. PARTEE. Maybe both.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee's statement simply suggests that there could be multiple possibilities or factors at play.


Passage number 421.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But that would be a half-point cut.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents an idea without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting arguments.


Passage number 422.
MR. GUFFEY. I would just remind you that the borrowing levelwas just reduced from $750 to $700 million this week. And federalfunds today--although to be sure it's Wednesday--are trading below thediscount rate. I don't know what all of that means and the funds rateshouldn't remain there, obviously, but we've already taken one cutfrom $750 to $700 million that the market doesn't know about. Nowyou're suggesting cutting it another $150 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information and explaining the current borrowing level and federal funds rates.


Passage number 423.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But at the conference call, youremember, there were some people who wanted to ease aggressively andsome of us--and I was in the other group--wanted to ease only to apoint where we avoided going down to 9-1/2 percent [on the fundsrate]. We thought that the Chairman and the Open Market Desk might goas low as $650 million on the borrowing assumption. Some of us hopedthe rate would not go much below 10 percent. I think they stayed veryfaithfully within the spirit of the consultation by bringing borrowingdown only to $700 million. And the average fed funds rate recentlyhas been a shade under 10 percent. So I think it was a perfectlyappropriate move; I was a little surprised it didn't come earlierbecause the market situation was very strange.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing different viewpoints and preferences of people at a conference call, but they do not express any disagreement or promote any argument.


Passage number 424.
 In a sense, that'spast history almost, Roger, and I think--MR. GUFFEY. Let me be sure to be understood. I am notcritical of having moved to $700 million. I am just noting the factthat we very recently moved to the $700 million level and to talkabout taking it to $550 million seems to me to be a rather largechange in policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any clear contention or disagreement. It simply presents different perspectives on the matter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 425.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a pretty good microscope if youcan tell the difference between $750 and $700 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage includes a statement about having a "pretty good microscope" in order to distinguish the difference between $750 million and $700 million. This suggests that there is disagreement or contention regarding the ability to accurately discern a $50 million difference.


Passage number 426.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, to be sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, is expressing agreement or affirmation with something that was previously said or thought.


Passage number 427.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only states the title of Chairman Volcker without providing any information or context that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 428.
 It was a feeble gesture to--MR. GUFFEY. I cannot tell the difference, but the fact ofthe matter is that there has been an overt move and we don't know whatthe result is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there has been a move, but the outcome of that move is unknown.


Passage number 429.
MR. CORRIGAN. I personally think that whatever we do themarket is at a point where it is likely to try to run beyond it, whichis another reason I would favor a more conservative approach. I thinkthe market psychology is a big factor here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is the personal opinion of Mr. Corrigan regarding the market psychology and his preference for a more conservative approach.


Passage number 430.
-49-11/7/84MR. ROBERTS. There is the possibility, of course, that themarket, having already discounted a discount rate decrease and a move[by this Committee], might react adversely if we didn't move enough.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a possibility or speculation about the reaction of the market.


Passage number 431.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If they did, then we ought to move more; Idon't think anybody is talking about a backup.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply stating a hypothetical condition followed by a personal belief, without any conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 432.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I still feel that $600 million givesus the maximum flexibility to respond to any changing circumstanceseither in the market psychology or in the real economy or--well, Idon't think we'll see much change in the money numbers in the next fewweeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their belief or opinion about the amount of $600 million providing flexibility to respond to any changing circumstances.


Passage number 433.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Frankly, the difference between $550 and$600 million is not going to be visible in anything we do. It'swithin the range of error that we hit anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author simply states that the difference between $550 and $600 million is not significant enough to affect their actions, as it falls within the range of error they typically encounter.


Passage number 434.
MR. CORRIGAN. [It's not] the difference between $550 and$600 million. I think the only thing that matters is the extent towhich there is an implicit automatic assumption that you'd go downfurther to $500 or even $400 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Corrigan is expressing his belief that the specific difference between $550 million and $600 million is not important, but rather the extent to which there is an assumption of going down further in funding. This statement shows his perspective and does not contradict or dispute any other viewpoint.


Passage number 435.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think the assumption is that wewould automatically go down; the assumption is we would go down if themoney numbers come in weaker than anticipated and if the business andgeneral news is biased on the less strong side rather than the strongside. If we come up with a positive retail sales figure in Octoberand a strong new orders figure and the money supply is up $3 billionin the week of the 15th and another $2 billion in the following week,the 22nd, I don't think there's any assumption that we'd do anything.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their viewpoint without specifically opposing or contradicting any other viewpoint.


Passage number 436.
MR. MARTIN. Would it be at $550 million then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There isn't any contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward question about a specific amount of money.


Passage number 437.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we start at $550 million, it would.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or arguments. It simply states a hypothetical scenario of starting at $550 million.


Passage number 438.
MR. PARTEE. We also ought to take a look at this seasonalquestion. I don't know whether we'll get all that much detail but Ihave a feeling that we may get the decline mainly from the seasonaldropping off. I'd forgotten about it until it came up today that thisseasonal borrowing must be running toward the end of its period andthat, therefore, there will be a drop in seasonal borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a statement made by Mr. Partee expressing his opinion and observation about the potential decline in seasonal borrowing.


Passage number 439.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why won't they just renew it for thefollowing year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question asking why "they" won't renew something for the following year.


Passage number 440.
MR. PARTEE. Oh, I don't think they can; it's not really donethat way. They have to have a time when they're out of debt, Ibelieve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 441.
MR. AXILROD. It may be a big factor this year. Normallyit's not a big factor because the variations in the other borrowingand the errors in their relationship swamp it. But we're getting soclose to it now that it may very well be a factor and we wouldcertainly want to look carefully.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Axilrod discussing the possibility that a certain factor may be significant this year.


Passage number 442.
MR. CORRIGAN. It has been a factor, hasn't it, Steve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply states a statement made by Mr. Corrigan and asks for confirmation.


Passage number 443.
-50-11/7/84MR. AXILROD. Well, it's a factor technically in theintercept, not necessarily in the slope of the relationship.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply a technical statement about the relationship between factors and intercept in a mathematical context.


Passage number 444.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Why don't we compromise by saying theinitial borrowing assumption is in a range of $550 to $600 million andleave it [to you] as you feel your way over the next couple of days.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It suggests a possible compromise and leaves the decision-making to the reader without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 445.
MR. PARTEE. How about $500 to $550 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "How about $500 to $550 million" is simply a suggestion or proposal.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Guffey has a certain amount of money, without any opposing views or conflicting statements.


Passage number 447.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're getting pretty narrow. From mystandpoint, if you want to make it $550 to $600 million, it's finewith me. I'll make it whichever I feel like.SPEAKER(.). That's the actual state of the art, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers express agreement and a willingness to accommodate the suggested range of $550 to $600 million. The second speaker even adds that they are fine with whichever amount is chosen.


Passage number 448.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think everybody is saying we play this alittle [flexibly]; we've been playing it this way anyway. It dependsupon what happens in the market. If the market gets way ahead of it,we go slower; if it doesn't, we go faster.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is explaining a flexible approach to playing a certain way, depending on market conditions. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 449.
MR. MARTIN. I'd just like to see you have the flexibility togo to $400 million if the market conditions and the economy dictate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a desire for flexibility based on market conditions and the economy.


Passage number 450.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that is within this anyway. Youcan have an argument as to whether the market conditions and theeconomy dictate it but it's certainly within the range of where we cango as I understand it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their understanding that something is possible within a certain range and acknowledges that there may be arguments about it based on market conditions and the economy, but does not directly disagree with any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 451.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The given passage mentions a person's name, but it does not provide any contextual information or details that would imply contention or disagreement.


Passage number 452.
 I would like to think that we're doing thiswithin the context of alternative A, but we're--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know what alternative Ameans. That's just a question of the number to put in, isn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the meaning and significance of "alternative A."


Passage number 453.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage as there is only a mention of "Mr. Partee" without any further context or dialogue.


Passage number 454.
 I just say that to give a sense of--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Frankly, the number that I thought ofputting in there--but it's not going to make any difference to me--isthe round number that is halfway between "A" and "B." If we do it ona quarterly basis, I'd put in 3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a personal opinion or preference.


Passage number 455.
MR. PARTEE. I have no problem with 3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Partee, does not express any disagreement or contention in this passage.


Passage number 456.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There's a danger in the sense thatthe market is so bullish that they are going to seize on almostanything.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing two different observations: a significant bond market rally and uncertainty regarding a similar rally in the stock market. There is no conflicting opinion or disagreement among different parties.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. To some extent that doesn't bother mebecause I don't think the general business picture is very risky onthe up side. And if it gets moderately risky on the up side, we cantighten up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not present any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply expresses their opinion that they are not bothered by the business picture and believe it is not very risky on the upside.


Passage number 458.
 I don't want to get the money supply [expanding sorapidly] in the next few months that we've got a problem, but--51-11/7/84MR. PARTEE. It gives you one more chance to adjust theportfolio if you're an FCA or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing a desire for the money supply not to expand rapidly in the next few months.


Passage number 459.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Steve], did you write down the languagethat we had. I'll fill in some numbers as you go along.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 460.
MR. AXILROD. Maybe Normand has been writing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that someone named Normand has been writing.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 461.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In sentence number one, I don't carewhether it says "reduce" or "decrease." We'll take a vote on that."In the implementation of policy in the short run, the Committeeseeks..." "To reduce" is a better Anglo-Saxon term; no they're bothLatin, aren't they.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that they don't care whether the word "reduce" or "decrease" is used but suggests taking a vote on it. However, another person contradicts this by stating that both terms ("reduce" and "decrease") are Latin, not Anglo-Saxon.


Passage number 462.
MR. AXILROD. The staff sees no difference, but--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not present any contention or disagreement. Mr. Axilrod states that the staff sees no difference, indicating a lack of disagreement or contention among them.


Passage number 463.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "Reduce" sounds better to me. "...seeksto reduce somewhat existing pressures on reserve positions. Thisaction is expected to be consistent with growth of M2 and M3 at annualrates of around 7-1/2 and 9 percent during the period from Septemberto December." We're putting in there the same figures we had before;we're not very far away. Now I don't remember what I said before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing their preference for the word "reduce" and mentioning that the figures mentioned are consistent with previous ones, but they are unsure of exactly what they said before.

Passage number 467.
"VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The unexplained decline.

Passage number 469.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In light of that decline more rapid growthof Ml would be acceptable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage suggests that in light of a decline, more rapid growth of Ml would be acceptable. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 470.
MR. PARTEE. And then "More generally...
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage only consists of a statement by Mr. Partee without any additional information or opposing viewpoints. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 471.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, and then it would go on to say "Moregenerally lesser restraint..." Instead of "acceptable"--we just usedthe word "acceptable"--let's say "Lesser restraint on reservepositions would be sought in the event of significantly slower growthin the monetary aggregates, evaluated..." etc.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Yes, and then it would go on to say 'More generally lesser restraint...'" is simply providing a continuation or expansion of the previous statement.


Passage number 472.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, if you go that far and use theword "sought"--which is all right with me--then I think we ought toleave in the counterbalance sentence. Otherwise, if we leave that outtoo, then it's really going to look silly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing agreement with using the word "sought" and suggesting that a counterbalance sentence should also be included for coherence.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 473.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's all right with me. The othersentence says "acceptable," which is weaker than this other one. Ifthat sounds generally all right, we're still left with what level ofborrowing we're starting off with. I am perfectly happy with anunderstanding of $550 to $600 million that would be played in thefirst week depending upon how the market conditions look. We'll stay-52-11/7/84there if things are very equable. If things come out on the strongside, well, we'd stay for a while; if things come out on the weakside, we'd make another step downward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker is expressing a difference in opinion or preference regarding the level of borrowing and potential actions depending on market conditions.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and stating that they do not find something compelling. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if there is any disagreement or contention with another person or viewpoint.


Passage number 483.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentioned Chairman Volcker without providing any information or context, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 484.
 You're quite right, neither "A" nor "B"has that, but they are within 1/2 point of it and I think that's--MR. KEEHN. Just to carry over the language doesn't seem tobe a clean way of developing a directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply discusses the proximity of "A" and "B" to a certain point and the effectiveness of carrying over language in developing a directive.

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If we end up with interest rates[down] much further with your second or third step, there's going tobe absolutely no incentive in the Congress to do anything about thatdeficit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.
