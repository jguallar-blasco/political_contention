{"1982FOMC19820202meeting.txt": ["MR. WALLICH. Aren't we somewhat in a minority in regard to ahopeful outlook for inflation in '83 and beyond. I see that outsidemodels we review seem to feel that in '83 inflation will pick up againwith recovery. I look at our own alternative long-run strategies andthe easy strategy, number 2, has inflation virtually leveling off in'84. It still goes down in '83. Now, is all this due simply todifferences in assumptions on monetary policy or are there more realsector things built into these estimates", "MR. PARTEE. To pick up on your comment, Mr. Chairman, I didget the impression as we went through the chart show and discussed theoutlook [at the Board briefing] this morning that this is not aforecast that emphasizes the negative. Everything's possible, but youhave a really remarkable decline, as the Chairman said, incompensation per hour. It could occur. But, as you know, it's towardthe extreme of what one might think could happen. I must say thatyour output per hour forecast strikes me as being pretty strong, giventhe fact that there won't be much recovery in the economy under yourprojection. As a matter of fact, for the period from the latter halfof 1982 to 1983 you have the longest sustained increase in output perhour that we've had since 1977. When you look at prices relative tounit labor costs on the next page, the price index goes down nicely,mirroring the decline in unit labor costs. There apparently isn'tanything that occurs in food or anything else that tends to [push]prices up.On the real side of the economy, it seems to me that you havean extraordinarily optimistic projection for plant and equipment[spending] given the capacity utilization chart shown and also thefinancial factors that are on the page previous to that. And finally,you have consumption really doing pretty well. Apparently, none of2/1-2/82the alleged effects of cuts in tax rates is working in terms ofstimulating savings. So, therefore, consumption remains high relativeto after-tax income. The general impression I get is that this is apretty upbeat forecast that you're giving us, under the circumstances.Would you like to comment on that", " I'm talkingabout--MR. BLACK. We always hear more of these things when theeconomy is near the bottom", "MR. WINN. Well, the thing that troubles me most in yourforecast is the level of unemployment. There is very little progressmade during the period of the next couple years. With thesupplemental unemployment benefits starting to disappear and with thesituation in the states being worse than projected--I think you getyour totals because of Alaska and Texas, which are in very strongpositions--we have a widespread absence of support for the [affected]population group, in light of the reduction in some of the federalprograms in this area. And I think the FDR [television series] is nothelping us much in terms of a background on that. I sense in thelabor movement and in the political movement a stirring that I don'tthink is going to let this thing grind out in the kind of sequencethat we see. Then supplement that with further bankruptcies in someof these sectors, and it seems to me that we haven't factored intothis [forecast] a scenario that could be quite explosive. This levelof unemployment is quite different than in previous [recessions] interms of the hard core element. And we're removing support [byscaling down] some of the programs that perform the cushioning effects2/1-2/82there. So, I think there is more explosiveness in these numbers thanis apparent in the actual figures", "MR. FORD. May I ask if, as I take it, this chart show iscorrelated with the projections in the Bluebook. It is. There'ssomething very interesting in the chart of long-range projections thatI think is wonderful, but I don't understand how it can happen. Thatis, on strategy 2 you have the fastest money growth associated withthe lowest interest rates and the highest inflation. How did thatwork out. Do you see what I mean. On the strategy 2 you have thehighest inflation with the highest money growth, which I would expect.But then you also somehow get the lowest interest rates out of it;that's the part that puzzles me. How would you explain that", "MR. WALLICH. Could I pick up on that. We often findourselves saying that we cannot control interest rates except maybevery temporarily at the short end. And here we see that apparentlywe're supposed to be able to bring down Treasury bill rates for threeyears and make that stick. I find it hard to see the consistency ofwhat one finds oneself saying about the difficulty of providinginterest rate relief and these numbers here", " You didn't postulate that if we had a [tighter]fiscal policy we might have a more--MR. KICHLINE. Yes, we did. Fiscal alternative[unintelligible] higher money. In 1983, we'd get a 6-1/2 percent billrate instead of 12-1/2 percent. One can get all sorts of things, butthat was an outcome that at least in the first 3 years produces a muchbetter performance on most of the variables you might be interestedin. Then it begins to get worse as you go out further in time", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What are you assuming here on the budget.You're assuming a higher level of expenditures than the Administrationis going to project by a considerable margin, right", "MR. WALLICH. Jim, isn't your model in a sense vitiated bythe fact that you have data going way back into the '50s wheninflation wasn't very important but fairly sizable actions were takenboth to curb inflation and to get the economy going. So, you have ahistory of large actions, large swings in the economy, and modestreactions on inflation. The model then gives you these same answersfor the present period when it would seem to me that large swings inthe economy would also have large effects on inflation", "MR. FORD. In other words, if instead of just the T-billrates shown here you also had shown, say, rates on 5- or 10-year notesor bonds, the apparent inconsistency there would be less apparent.That is, you could have the [lowest] long-term rates under thetightest monetary policy", "MR. BOEHNE. Getting at this real rate effect: Don't youhave to trade off the effects of the inflationary expectations, whichhave become commonplace, versus the demand effect that comes from thisvery large deficit. It seems to me that it's the demand side that isdriving up the real rate and more than offsetting the positive effectsyou're getting from inflationary expectations", "2/1-2/82MR. GRAMLEY. I don't subscribe to the theory that you getthe same nominal GNP no matter what fiscal policy does", "MR. GRAMLEY. A lower nominal GNP with a smaller deficit,right", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And you get lower [employment] and lessgrowth", "MR. GRAMLEY. You get more unemployment and somewhat lessgrowth. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This last compensation figure--I keepstaring at Mr. Zeisel--you have plotted: Is that the third quarter orthe fourth quarter", "MR. AXILROD. Well, so far as we could tell, in the last 2 or3 months we have had this very sharp run-up in the money supply, whichpartly was expected, given interest rates, and partly unexpected. Ican't divide it very easily between the expected and unexpected parts,but I would point out, as many of you have heard, of course, that wehave had a fairly sharp turnaround in all of the components of money;but in particular the turnaround in other checkable deposits seems tobe correlated with a turnaround in savings deposits. For example, thesavings deposit component of M2 declined over the 6-month period fromApril to October '81 at about a 21 percent annual rate at a time whenother checkable deposits were growing at around a 15 percent annualrate. I picked that period because that is after the bulk of theshifting into other checkable deposits was finished in the first 4months of the year. Since October--in the last 3 months--savingsdeposits on the new seasonals have increased at a 12 percent annualrate, compared with this 21 percent decline, and other checkabledeposits have moved from a 15 percent annual rate of increase to a 53percent annual rate of increase. At the same time, of course, demanddeposits have turned around. They had been declining at a 6 percentannual rate and are now expanding at a 6-1/2 percent rate throughJanuary. But the bulk of that expansion in January occurred in thefirst week and is now ending, whereas the expansion in other checkabledeposits has remained strong through the balance of January. So, Ithink the demand deposit expansion is working its way out whereas asyet we have not seen the NOW account and savings deposit expansionworking its way out.We've tried to investigate the various reasons for theincrease in savings and in demand deposits. We have surveyed thebanks and we have not gotten very satisfactory replies. In my viewsome of it is related to nonconsumption, just savings resulting from afailure to consume [and funds] flowing into the easiest alternativesfor a while--demand deposits, NOW accounts, and savings deposits.Some of it is related to actual financial uncertainties. We see thatin time certificates; small time certificate growth slowed verynoticeably in December and January, and that money is being placedelsewhere, at least temporarily, in more protected forms. And we haveheard bits and pieces of evidence that corporate demand deposits were-16-2/1-2/82rising toward year-end and early in the year, partly for corporatewindow-dressing and partly for compensation balances. However, thosewere bits and pieces of evidence and they were not very clear-cut.This rapid expansion has tended to exhaust much of the growthfor the year [allowed for] in the tentative targets, as the Committeecan see by observing chart 1, following page 11 in the Bluebook. Thatrange of 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent is plotted from the actual level forM1 in the fourth quarter of 1981. As you can see, the Januaryexpansion has brought growth well above the range; growth is wellabove the parallel dashed lines [unintelligible]. In effect, much ofthe expansion for the year has been used up. It is quite possiblethat we could get negative numbers in February and March. As theBluebook points out, we had that in 1981 following the April bulge ata time when short rates rose very sharply. And that has occurred onrare occasions at other times. But absent such a sharp drop, theamount of monetary expansion [that could occur] over the balance ofthe year is relatively limited [if money growth is to be] within thetentative range adopted by the Committee. That, of course, Mr.Chairman, brings up questions about the range and its basing andwhether it should be raised", "MR. MORRIS. The unadjusted data", "MR. ROOS. I asked our staff to see if they could churn upsome figures that perhaps would explain not the IRA thing but why M1acted as it did. And they did come up with some interesting figuresthat I'll be brief in touching on. The bottom line of the figuresthey gave me indicated that we were somewhat slow in our willingnessto change our nonborrowed reserve path under certain circumstances.They looked at four periods. One, for example, was the 3 weeks endingAugust 19 and, Steve, let me see if I can explain what I'm trying tosay. In those 3 weeks, the projected deficiency of total reservesrelative to path averaged about $152 million, according to ourrecords, and in that period we did not change our nonborrowed reservepath nor did we change the discount rate. The average in the 4 weeksending September 15--and this was when the aggregates wereundershooting--was about $244 million. The deficiency in the 3 weeksending October 7 was about $405 million. And in each of thoseperiods, if my staff's figures are correct, we apparently did notchange our nonborrowed reserve path nor did we change the discountrate. Now, back in May of [last] year, when total reserves wereprojected to be about $500 million above path, we increased thediscount rate and we reduced the supply of nonborrowed reserves byabout $375 million. And as a result of those actions, Ml begandeclining immediately and we did avoid a continuation of that. We, ineffect, interrupted the bulge that occurred then. Is there any logicin their conclusion, based on that type of evidence, that one of theproblems has been a problem of our not moving our nonborrowed reservesas quickly as we should", "MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, President Corrigan mentioned theeffect of interest rates and I probably should point out to theCommittee that our monthly money market model, which is very oftenwrong and is sometimes right, would have projected very sharp growthin the money supply. That is one of the reasons we thought [M1] wouldgrow in November and December, way back when. And [the model] wouldproject that growth continuing on, given interest rate moves that hadalready occurred, into January--but not at this rate--and February andMarch and petering out after that. On the other hand, if you look atour quarterly model, it would suggest that the money growth we'vegotten in January is more than enough to finance the quarter's income,given interest rates. And to get what it says we would have for thequarter, then we would have to expect [M1 in] February and March todrop at around a 13 or 14 percent annual rate. That's just about whatthe money model says it is going to increase. So, the models tend togive varying results", "MR. BALLES. Well, in searching for possible answers here, Ihave another question I'd like to raise with Steve. In each of thetwo years, Steve--in 1980 and 1981--when we have had a convergence ofthe federal funds rate and the discount rate, and the funds rate evenhas gotten down to a bit below the discount rate, that was followed bysome very rapid monetary expansion, as we all know. With the benefitof hindsight, looking back on that period between the November andDecember FOMC meetings last year, total reserves were almost ontarget. They were a little above. But the nonborrowed reserve levelwas raised quite sharply, by almost $200 million. And that-25-2/1-2/82undoubtedly had the effect of keeping the interest rates down becauseif we hadn't raised that, borrowings would have gone up. And Isuspect, as I look back on our feelings in December, that most of uswould have viewed that as not a very opportune time to be letting thefederal funds rate rise, which would have been the result if we hadnot increased the nonborrowed reserve path. I'm just wondering ifmaybe we aren't falling back into the trap of intuitively trying tokeep interest rates down at a time when it seems logical to do thatand then paying the price for it later on when we get this delayedreaction of sudden very sharp expansions in monetary growth, as we gotin both '80 and '81. A companion question would be: With respect tothat major study of our operating procedures that you headed up, as Irecall there was a recommendation for more frequent changes in thediscount rate. As I look back on it, we haven't really done thateither. Well, those are just a couple of thoughts as to some deeperfactors that might be at work here in these sudden surges of monetarygrowth. I'd like your reaction to that", "2/1-2/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd be more impressed by these theoriesabout reserves and all the rest if the increase in the money supplywere not so divergent between the different components of the moneysupply. That doesn't prove that it's wrong, but it's just a littlesuspicious when the NOW accounts are going up at the same time thesavings accounts are going up. And that's a sharp change in trend", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, the only thing I'd like to add,since it has been mentioned and I think it's significant, is that thebulk of Christmas sales came much later this year than in previousyears. And the bad weather in January also caused extremely weaksales. Credit card companies with whom we checked emphasized that thesales were very weak. That tends to give some logical common sensesupport to the view of various bankers that these are temporaryincreases. Add to that the precautionary reasons that call forsomewhat larger balances. I don't have any hard proof, but my feelingis that a substantial part of this increase will be washed out over aperiod of time. I do not believe that we could begin to attributesuch a sharp increase to economic reasons--advance indicators of avery strong economic recovery. There may be many factors involved;there probably are to get such a sharp increase. But I think it'shard to conclude that a substantial part is not temporary", "MR. BALLES. Yes, I'm suggesting, for reasons set forth inthis very brief memo, that we ought to increase the lower end of the2/1-2/82[tentative M1] range to 3 percent instead of 2-1/2 percent, keepingthe upper end at 5-1/2 percent. Very briefly, the reason is that, asI looked back to last July, we hadn't known about the weakness nowemerging in the economy. We had expected--I think more than we donow--the prospect of a further downward shift in the demand for money,and that downward shift seems to have slowed pretty considerably.Whether it will resume and go on in 1982 remains to be seen. Butgiven the fact that we now are in a fairly serious recession that wehadn't really anticipated in July, and given the fact that the demandfor money is no longer shifting downward as much--and maybe not atall--as compared to last summer, and given the fact that a 2-1/2percent lower band would seem pretty Draconian right in the middle ofa recession in terms of public announcement effects, I believe wewould be better advised to use a 3 to 5-1/2 percent range. That wouldhave the virtue of being uniform across the board; the upper end, thelower end, and the midpoint [of the M1 range] would all be 1/2 pointlower than our 1981 range. And this would continue some credibilityin our longer-run anti-inflation approach of gradually cranking downthe growth ranges every year. If we were to hit the midpoint of the 3to 5-1/2 percent range that I'm proposing, which is only apresumption, the growth would be 4-1/4 percent. And 4-1/4 percent isa pretty healthy decline from the actual observed M1-B growth of 5percent last year. So, although I supported the tentative decisionlast July for the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range, I've changed my mindfor reasons I've just set forth on M1.On M2, it gets a little more complicated. The composition ofthe M2 and M3 aggregates, in terms of the portion that is sensitive tointerest rates, has really changed dramatically, as we all know. Mystaff calculates that as recently as the end of 1978 assets yieldingmoney market rates of interest comprised only 8 percent of M2 and thatthat's up to 45 percent now. The interest-sensitive portion of M3 atthe end of 1978 was calculated at 21 percent and it's now up to 54percent. We knew this last year, but we didn't really do anythingabout it. We decided for reasons the Committee felt satisfied with--and I didn't object because I thought it was a good idea--to keepthose ranges down more or less for public reaction purposes. Wedidn't want to be in the posture of raising the M2 and M3 ranges. Butas we all know, the actual [growth] last year, certainly not to mysurprise, was considerably over the ranges that we set forth for theyear", "MR. BALLES. The presumption is that M2 and M3 in the futurewill continue to be more sensitive to interest rates than they wereunder the old definition", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That means that M2 will go down ifinterest rates go down", " But I--MS. TEETERS. They could move them out just for[unintelligible]", " Well, it clearly slowed down then and there areno ceilings now, so--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is no question that when we hadceilings, [M2 growth] slowed when rates rose and increased when ratesfell", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All right, now you're saying there is avery small negative elasticity; as near as we can say it's declining.If I understand this correctly, that's the opposite of the presumptionthat Mr. Balles is making", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, there's no question about that. That's adifferent subject. You know, there is some very good news. This isthe last time I'm going to be with you and it's very clear that when Icame on board things got worse and now that I'm leaving things arebound to get better. So you're going to do better this time than youhave before. But even under those circumstances, it strikes me thatthere are some costs in making any changes. How big are those costs.I have talked to a lot of market participants and I can't find asingle market participant who doesn't feel that it's going to havesome impact if we change these targets. They will argue differentlyon how big that impact is going to be. But I think that's a vitalquestion here. It's not only what we do that's critical but whatpeople think we're doing and what we say we're doing, and that's going2/1-2/82to make a heck of a big difference through the year. So, I would beperfectly willing to see us take our time getting back to the targets.I have a feeling that we probably are going to end up in the upperpart of the range for M1, but I really do believe that if we changethose targets, there is going to be a cost and I urge you to thinkcarefully about that cost", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I have several things on my mind. One isthat I think we're in a real box and we have a way to go with themonetary aggregates in 1982, M1 in particular. Given what hashappened so far, if we were to reach the midpoint of the range by thefourth quarter, we would end up permitting an increase in M1 of all of1.55 percent from January to November. And I just don't think we canlive with that. With M2 I haven't made the calculation, but taking arough ruler and laying it out and comparing it with this 6 percentgrowth triangle, to get to the midpoint must imply a growth ofsomething like 6-1/2 percent from January to November. I don't thinkwe can live with that either", "MR. GRAMLEY. Unless we're awfully lucky, I'm afraid thosegrowth rates are not going to permit the economy anything like thekind of progress this year that the staff is projecting. We need tothink seriously about doing something that will give the economy somebreathing room. Also, I think this year we ought to start out givingmore weight to M2 than we have. We ought to express that publicly sothat the focus of attention is not all on M1 as it has tended to berecently. And I think there's a way to rationalize John Balles'suggestion that we raise the target range for M2 that's different fromthe rationale he uses, and that is that the increasing interest-sensitive component of M2 has probably raised the income elasticity ofdemand for M2. If you look back at history, the studies of demand forM1 and demand for M2 have always come out that M2, the luxury good,has an income elasticity that is bigger than 1 and M1 has an incomeelasticity of considerably less than 1. The main reason was that M1didn't have interest payments on it and M2 did. But as more and moreassets that are interest sensitive are shifted into M2, the chancesare that its income elasticity has grown. And I [considered] the factthat Fred Schultz has said we will have some adverse reaction in termsof loss of credibility if we adjust our targets. But I said at eitherthe last meeting or the previous one, I don't remember which, that Ithink our credibility basically doesn't depend so much on thesetargets and whether we stay within the ranges from one month to thenext as it does on the basic fact that we've been following a verytough and tight monetary policy since October of 1979. That is whathas gained us our credibility. If we stick with that basic posture,we will still have credibility. I think we ought to give serious-36-2/1-2/82thought to the suggestion of raising the M2 target range to 7 to 10percent. And I think we ought to go further than just raising thebottom edge of the M1 target. I would prefer to do something likeusing a different base--starting out with the lower end of the rangefor 1981 as the base figure rather than starting from the actual", "MR. WALLICH. Which page is it", "MR. AXILROD. There's a text discussion in paragraph 14", " That doesn't sound--MR. FORD. How can you rationalize shifting M1 up from theactuals to the bottom of the band unless you also do the same thing byshifting [M2] on some end of the band", "MR. FORD. I have some sympathy with Fred's view, too, givenall that has been discussed, that we should stay basically with thelonger-run targets that we already set but [I would] pay a lot moreattention to trying to get back into the ranges on both if we can.With regard to base drift, I'm very concerned about how thisdiscussion is going. Look at the history of what we've done and thinkback to last year's big debate about what to do about base drift. Ithas been suggested, if I understand Henry right, that we not onlychange the way we handle base drift from last year by going to thelower end of the M1 band instead of the actual [outcome] but that onM2 we do yet another thing. My feeling is that the market people willtake this to say that we're just fooling around so much that we'repurposely trying to manipulate the game so that it will come out theway we want it", "MR. CORRIGAN. Basically, the way I read the newspapers andthings like that, the message that seems to be coming through bothfrom the Hill and the Administration is that it's time to change thismonetary policy in some [way]. The money supply has to be allowed togrow faster and it will grow faster even with the existing targets.But my point is that if we change the targets, the risk we run is alittle different than just the risk Governor Schultz was referring to.I think we run the risk that credibility will be affected in a moreamplified way because of the perception that the Fed has buckled underagain; they always have and they always will. And that just elevatesthe concern that Governor Schultz spoke of", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I have three points, probably noneof which will prevail. The first is that I would raise the lowerlimit of M1 to 3 percent and I would put the top at 5 percent. Ithink 2-1/2 percent is too low and I have long favored narrowing thatspread because I think doing so would give additional credibility towhat we say we're going to do. But I sense that we'll go for 2-1/2 to5-1/2 percent, so I would suggest that we ought to aim definitely at 4percent regardless of which of those two routes we follow. The second2/1-2/82point is that I wouldn't favor what the Bluebook called rebasing. Ihad some sympathy for it back when we had overshot our targets, butthen I started trying to contemplate how difficult it would be toexplain to the market how an aggregate was going to grow at a certainpercentage rate from where it really wasn't at the moment and Idecided that it was best just to adjust the rates. And now, sincewe've come in on the low side in the case of M1, I think we'd reallycatch a lot of flak if we tried to do that. Furthermore, with ourshifting from M1-B to M1, which is going to be very difficult toexplain, if we had to explain rebasing on that, too, I just don'tthink anybody would really understand what we're trying to do. Myfinal point is that I'd really rather solve this problem of runningover on M2 and M3 by not setting ranges for them. I realize we don'tknow all we would like to know about M1, but I think we know moreabout it than we do about M2 and M3. So, I'd get rid of thesemultiple targets and focus primarily on M1", "MS. TEETERS. Well, my problem is that I'm not satisfied withthe forecast. If we stick to these targets, we end up with virtuallyno growth for the fourth year in a row and unemployment of 9 percentor above. I think that's politically very dangerous. We're courtinga lot of trouble for the Congress, the Administration, and theAmerican people [if we try] to hold unemployment at 9-1/2 percent. Wesaid we were going to review these targets. We set tentative targetsand that has turned out in my mind to be a major mistake because weare setting targets for the subsequent year when we're right in themidst of the formulation of fiscal policy for that year on the Hill.And then we don't have the courage to change them. I don't want toplay around with the base because I think that is too difficult toexplain.We ought to look at this and ask: What gives us anacceptable level of real growth and some decline in the unemploymentrate next year. And that leads me to say that we should go at leastto last year's M1 target of 3 to 6 percent. The target proveddisastrous and we undershot it. Instead of doing all this horsingaround with the base, we should [set the ranges] straightforwardly theway John Balles has suggested and widen the difference between the M1and M2 ranges, and then try to stay with that. Even with 3 to 62/1-2/82percent, if we come out at the upper limit, we are not going to have arobust economy next year. But at least we might get some decline inthe unemployment rate and in interest rates and I think that's whatwe're here for. Our major responsibility is to provide a healthyeconomy. We are getting considerable forecasts, at least, of areduction in inflation; and if it turns out that we're wrong, maybe wecan change the ranges again in midyear and do it in an honest wayrather than just always have this problem of perception. One of theproblems with sticking with the ranges that we have is that if wedon't come within them, then we have an enormous credibility problemstarting the end of the year. We can push, but there's just so muchwe can do with this. Sooner or later we have to face up to whether wemade it within our ranges or we didn't. We go into an enormous amountof explanation to try to explain why we didn't. We may push off thatcredibility problem, but we don't avoid it. So, I would suggestraising the ranges on all of the aggregates", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We seem to have contrasting views on whatto do with M1: Leave it alone or throw it out", "MR. SCHULTZ. We ought to put Messrs. Morris and Roos in thecenter of the table and let them go at it", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would agree withthose who have spoken about the uncertainty that might come about bytrying to rebase or to fool around otherwise with the numbers. As aresult, I come out on the side of taking the ranges as we set them inJuly and trying to decide whether or not we want to increase ordecrease those ranges, as the case may be. Let me just say that it'sstriking to me that one month's money growth--which we have talkedabout and the bulge that took place is totally unexplainable--hasprompted this Committee to talk for another hour and a half or so asto how we should change the ranges for the period. That's a dramaticchange, it seems to me, from what we talked about just one month agoat our December meeting. I mention that to make the point thatbecause of the uncertainty that I suspect rests within everybody'smind and the unexplanability of the January numbers it doesn't seem tome to be very logical to start talking about rebasing or doinganything else with those numbers. There's only one [month of data].As a result, I would reestablish what we set in July and agreed uponagain in December without taking any formal action on it.There's one potential [change] that has been mentioned beforethat might be acceptable as far as I'm concerned, and that is themovement of the lower end of M1 from the 2-1/2 percent that weoriginally set to 3 percent. And that is only because the Januarybulge probably has rendered that 2-1/2 percent lower limit ineffectiveunless we get some very big negative numbers in the next couple ofmonths. And if moving the lower band from 2-1/2 to 3 percent would2/1-2/82serve the Chairman's purpose when he testifies before theCongressional Committees to give a view that we are going to be a bitmore expansive in 1982 than what we achieved in 1981, then I would optto increase the bottom end of that M1 range from 2-1/2 to 3 percent.That produces a midpoint, if anybody worries about midpoints, of 4-1/4percent as opposed to 4 percent, and that's some 2 percentage pointsmore than we achieved in 1981. It tells a pretty good story", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm assuming it doesn't go down verysharply. That comment may not be correct", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That assumes that we don't have a greatbig decline in the short run. But, one of the peculiarities is this:Suppose October weren't there and suppose this increase had happenedone month earlier. The fourth quarter would be very close to thefourth-quarter base and nobody would be arguing that that wasn't theappropriate thing to start with. [The bulge] comes a month later andresults in a $5 billion difference in the base. Should that type ofthing affect us. That's the kind of consideration that I've beenstruggling with. I have gone up and down on this, not knowing what isgoing to happen in the next 6 weeks. My feeling is that we willpretty much know the story then, although we never know for surebecause there's always another week out there. But at least in 4 or 5or 6 weeks, we will have a much better feel as to whether some of thishas washed out or not. If it has, the current targets may not beperfect but, given the problems of fiddling around with them, theywould look entirely appropriate to me. If that did not happen, I'dhave a very serious question as to whether we were not being tootight--that something more basic and continuing may be going on here.That would imply, as a matter of judgment, given what is going on inthe economy, what is going on in interest rates, and what is going onin the money supply, that we would have to think seriously aboutproviding a little more relief. My tentative judgment is that that isa very hard decision to make right now and that maybe we should justsay we are not prepared to make that judgment but will keep the matterunder review and if we have to change it, we will change it. And wewill change it as soon as [the situation] becomes more solidlyapparent than it is today", " It seems--MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, if the Committee had set the kind ofmoney growth rates that actually transpired over the past month, itwould have accommodated what has happened without getting the rise inborrowing and the rise in the funds rate that has occurred", " Yes, but I think--MR. WALLICH. It depends on supply and demand", "MR. AXILROD. President Roos, may I just make a comment.When you observe in the market that there is an increase in money andshort-term rates go up, it is not in my opinion because people believethat there's going to be more inflation. In my opinion--and this iswhat is predicted in the Bluebook--it is because the market believesthat the Federal Reserve is going to hit its longer-run targets and,therefore, will take action to restrain the growth in money that hasbulged in the short run because of the [increased] demand. And withdemand high relative to the supply, the price, as Governor Wallichsays, goes up. And the price of money is the interest rate.Therefore, they realize that interest rates are going to go up in theshort run and short-term interest rates are what we're dealing with", "MS. TEETERS. I have a tentative question for Peter. I'm notsure I'm totally correct but if I add up roughly [the figures in] thefootnotes in appendix 2 [in the Bluebook], you took $540 million outin the multiplier adjustment, which is greater than I've ever seenbefore. That must mean that you had a very unstable multiplierrelationship in your initial projections that you were constantlyadjusting. That also suggests to me that reserves were shiftingbetween categories at a greater degree than is normal. When all thereserves went out last summer, they sort of disappeared. During thisperiod did you have a shift of reserves from low reserve depositcategories to high reserve deposit categories", "MR. BLACK. I don't know for sure, Peter, whether you orSteve ought to handle this question. I just wondered if you had givenany thought to possibly changing this automatic reaction mechanism.The rule of thumb you have, when you force the banking system toborrow any total reserves above path, is on a one-to-one basis. Haveyou considered other combinations. Looking at this period, one wouldthink running borrowing up from $300 million to $1.7 billion [in themost recent week], with the target of $1.5 billion, would be a whale-53-2/1-2/82of a move. Still, the money supply did spurt. Have you monkeyed withthe idea of maybe changing that automatic part", "MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, as I said, some of the move up was amore or less automatic fallout of a strengthening in demand forreserves. We did, well along into the period, make a discretionarydownward adjustment in the nonborrowed path of $190 million, I thinkit was, which added to that borrowing gap. There is continualconsideration given to the size of those adjustments. And the factorsbearing on it on this occasion had to do partly with trying to reachjudgments about how lasting this bulge would be. If there had been asense that this bulge was likely to be more lasting, and particularlyif there had been a sense that it was occurring against a backgroundof a strengthening economy instead of a still weakening economy, myview is that there probably would have been more of a discretionarydownward adjustment made to build up that borrowing gap even further", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, I saw that, and I didn'tunderstand why we would do November to March", "MR. AXILROD. That's what your base was before", "MR. AXILROD. In our judgment, it could go as high as $3billion because we believe that we can't get that kind of reductionfor two months without a further rise in the funds rate, even thoughthe economy is as weak as it seems. But I have a certain degree ofuncertainty about that because our quarterly model does suggest, ifyou believe it, that given the amount of money that has already beenproduced and given the weakness of the economy, that that amount ofmoney isn't in effect needed for transactions associated with GNP inthe first quarter. But it might be needed for precautionary purposes,so you have to force interest rates up to get it out of there", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'll suggest a possible approach as afocus for discussion. I think you're saying, Steve, that eitherbecause of transactions balances alone or transactions plusprecautionary balances--depending upon what model you look at--thedemand should not continue to rise at the rate it has been rising, butit is going to rise a little anyway, or hold stable perhaps.Therefore, if we're going to get [M growth] down, we have to takesome action to tighten up--well, for borrowings to be about where theyare or higher, up to $3 billion. That's the number you just gave interms of borrowing. Alternative A says, against the presumption whichmay be wrong--it may just relapse on its own--that if we really wantto retrace January, we have to be aggressive in tightening up themarket. And that's going to push the funds rate way up because ofthis demand factor. Alternative B says, if we stay more or less wherewe think we are--lower than where we were in practice last week andmaybe this week, but where we were aiming--that we would get aleveling off, but that's it. Alternative C says, if we're a littleeasier in terms of pressure on reserve positions, measured by $1billion worth of borrowing, that we probably would get a smallincrease in the money supply but we certainly cannot retrace theincrease we had. And \"D,\" of course, moves further in that direction.It says that even if we were quite easy on reserve positions, wewouldn't get much of an increase in the money supply compared to whatwe have had, but we would certainly add to what we have had", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Because it has already occurred, that'sright. Now, the question is what we want to do. If we get anysignificant increase from where we are, I am suggesting that we haveto resist it. I would accept that as a starting proposition. I thinkthere is some chance it could happen by itself. But who knows.Tentatively, anyway, I reject something like alternative A, [whichimplies] that we're just going to whack off a big amount in an effortto get a quick reversal that we feel we otherwise would not get. Onecan take the view that it would tighten up the market verysubstantially in the middle of a recession. I am not proposing that.I do think we have to show some resistance, which means a tightermarket than we now have, if the figures carry us up significantly fromwhere we are. And I interpret something like \"B\" or \"C\"--either oneor someplace in between--as saying we can ride along and we would besatisfied", "MR. ROOS. Okay. If we had a 9 percent average growth for M1over the last two quarters and we're forced to seek a 3 percent growthrate of M1 for the next two quarters, wouldn't that have a verytraumatic effect on output late in the year", "MR. ROOS. Can anyone accurately forecast the demand formoney", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. If I understood whatyou said earlier, the only quarrel I might have with you is what sideof \"B\" we ought to end up on. You are on the right; I'd go a bit tothe left", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We would certainly let borrowings go up atleast, in accord with the automatic [mechanism]. And we might have todo a little more than that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, a billion and a half dollars. I don'tknow how soon it would develop--we will want to discuss thatexplicitly--but I am talking no higher than $1.5 billion of borrowing,which presumably means an easier market than we have now even withzero [M1 growth]. Just to be explicit, on the borrowing one couldargue that maybe it should be even lower. It depends on what kind ofchances one wants to take", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but we would not be in too bad shapeby the end of the quarter, or we'd still be high. But that's comparedto where we are now. I don't think we should assume that we couldn'tget a $5 billion decline in the money supply between now and March.And then if March were stable, we'd look in not too bad shape. Wewould still be high [relative to the long-term target]", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If we get the washing out startingearly in February, I don't think any of us has a problem. If itdoesn't work out like that, though, it seems to me that we might wantto build in a little extra protection by setting the initial borrowingassumption at, say, $1.3 billion rather than at $1.5 billion becauseotherwise we're going to get a rise in rates, I think. If we startwith $1.5 billion for borrowing and don't get a decline, there's agreater risk that we're going to get a rise in interest rates. Wewould give ourselves a little margin if we start with $1.3 billion", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Before we get off on this question, let meask in general whether anybody is radically out of the ballpark Isuggested. If people are, let's put it on the table and then disposeof that issue and then come back to the fine-tuning. Mr. Roos", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's just put this on the table anddispose of it or not. You are just an advocate of an aggressive moveat the moment in the hope and expectation that that will help in thelong run. And you would take all the implications that that may havefor substantially higher interest rates in the very short run", " I don't think we could get that in one month, butif that persisted for a while it could cause--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER", "MR. SCHULTZ. Now, wait a minute. I don't think \"B\" with aslight tilt toward \"A\" is accurate because that's January to March.The Chairman is suggesting zero [M1 growth] from now until the nextCommittee meeting. I think that's a different animal", " So we throw out zero and we come up--MR. WALLICH. Not using a funds range makes a lot of sensebecause that range is always misunderstood in the market. They allbelieve that it cannot be breeched, but actually it is a checkpoint atwhich consultation begins. I think we'd do ourselves a lot of good byremoving it", "MR. MORRIS. Well, I would be very upset if, without anyevidence that the economy has bottomed out--I think the only evidencesuggests the economy is still going down--we threw out any constrainton interest rates on the up side, as Mr. Partee suggests", "MR. CORRIGAN. I have just one little anecdote here. We talkabout all these statistics all the time, and I would note for therecord that many of the people who are always telling us what to dotell us we should look at the monetary base. If you look at themonetary base for 1981, it's actually quite stable on a quarterlybasis. But the most interesting thing is that the growth rate of themonetary base was slowest in the fourth quarter when the growth of themoney supply was fastest. And I think there's a little message there.As to the substance of the short-run decision that we will bemaking, I personally would have quite a strong preference for havingsomething like the second alternative directive [shown in theBluebook] as our basic marching order, with M1 at zero and M2 at 9percent. I would be very comfortable with a funds rate range of 12 to16 percent. I for one would feel very, very strongly that we shouldmaintain a band on the federal funds rate for some of the reasons thathave already been stated. I don't think there is a great deal ofmisunderstanding in the marketplace as to what that band means rightnow; most people know exactly what it means. So, I would be veryuncomfortable getting away from having a federal funds rate band, andI would fix it at 12 to 16 percent. On the borrowings, again, I wouldfeel fairly strongly that we should start at $1.5 billion. At leastas I read the Bluebook and look at what has happened even since thisBluebook was written, I would interpret the staff's analysis as sayingthat over the intermeeting period as a whole a borrowing level of $1.5billion should be compatible, from where we are right now, with bothlower interest rates and a lower actual level of borrowing. That'show I would look at it, Mr. Chairman", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The way Nancy formulated it, it'sbasically a discretionary decision. It seems to me that the advantageof starting with $1.3 billion as against $1.5 billion is that then wehave a carry-through during the entire period of the lower base.That's because we make the adjustments and the amount of change thatresults from the reality of the situation doesn't affect the startingpoint. So, you get the carry-through effect of the $200 millionincrease in the initial nonborrowed reserve path by starting withborrowings of $1.3 rather than $1.5 billion. I will live with $1.5billion--in every other respect I agree with what has been putforward--but I'm just not sure that at $1.5 billion we will get 14 oreven 14-1/2 percent [on the funds rate]. I certainly don't think 14percent is what it is likely to produce; it probably will be 14-1/2percent at best. And given the psychology of the market, we may notget that. I just wanted to have a safety margin to start with. If wedon't build it in to start with, Nancy, then it becomes simply adiscretionary decision at a later time", "MR. SCHULTZ. Good common sense. We can't have that", "-80-2/1-2/82MR. GRAMLEY. It seems to me that the bigger [issue withrespect to] what we want to do with M2 is not the fact that we have anadditional bias or lack thereof this year relative to last year butthat last year we were well over the upper end, or several tenthsover. If what we want is an increase in nominal GNP of, let us say,between 8 and 9 percent, then we ought to be choosing a range for M2,given the recent velocity figures, that has a midpoint between 8 and 9percent. And if we put out another 6 to 9 percent range, particularlyif, as I hope, we will be giving increased stress to M2 this yearrelative to M1, then we would be aiming almost certainly at a targetthat we will tend to violate on the up side unless we're not going toget that kind of economic performance", "MS. TEETERS. Does no one share my concern that the forecastis too low. If all our temporary problems get [unintelligible] inessence that we are negating the President's program. I find myselfin the odd position of being the only supporter of President Reagan inthe room here. Basically, [the staff is] projecting a major continuedrecession at very low rates of [activity]. And the overall policy maybe too tight. Whether we have problems with the base or any of therest of it, we are just making monetary policy too restrictive to getthe sort of recovery that I think all of us want", "MS. TEETERS. I think there is a disadvantage in going [totestify] as early as the 10th because [Congress] might come back andsay that we did not give a proper evaluation of [the Administration's]economic policy", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It is worth pointing out on the otherside that there is an advantage in testifying on the scheduled daybecause then we would begin to accustom the committee, the Congress,and the public [to the idea] that we are willing, when there aretechnical or structural shifts, to be more flexible on midyear--or Ishould say intra-year--adjustments. If we wait the three weeks thenyou are somewhat less likely to put forward that point of view. So,it seems to me that there are arguments on both sides", "MS. TEETERS. I learned 25 years ago that monetary policy wasa flexible policy instrument, and we have been rigid for 2-1/2 yearsnow, which is ridiculous", "MR. GRAMLEY. The counterargument is that if we are notwilling to be flexible from July to early February, what makes anyonethink that suddenly we are going to resolve to be flexible between nowand, let's say, March", " We say it and that doesnot--MR. GRAMLEY. If we can agree that we are going to beflexible, let us start flexing. Let's not postpone this by notifyingthe public that we are flexible", "MR. WALLICH. Well, it seems to me that if one is uncertainand later may have to say that we need flexibility because things haveturned out differently, then one would strengthen one's position byshowing this uncertainty a little earlier rather than coming in[firmly] early and then having to backtrack. I think we would have aharder time making that change", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It is not that they would not understand;it is that they would say there is a bias", "MR. FORD. They would say it is a one-way deal and we arefaking it. It comes across as being dishonest", " It is just a question of which is--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think it is [the same]. That ismy point. If we raise the band, we are saying that from now on wewant a higher growth rate. If we change the base, we are saying we donot want a higher growth rate from now on; we have forgiven whathappened. I think that is saying two different things", "MS. TEETERS. That is right. And either way it is an easingof monetary policy", "MS. TEETERS. Have you thought through the implication ofthese interest rates for the savings and loans institutions. [Theirrepresentatives] were here the other day asking us if we weredeliberately putting them out of business. And I would say that, yes,we are deliberately putting them out of business", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I want to reject that. I think theimplications for savings and loans are very important, but it is notall that clear--I will join Mr. Roos to some extent here--whether thesavings and loans would be better off by greater or lesser expansionin the money supply and what that means for interest rates over aperiod of time. That is a dilemma we are fighting all the time", " I think then--MS. TEETERS. Or how many we want to put out of business", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I'm not sure I agree with that either. Istill contend that long-term interest rates are the key. And they arenot going to come down until the deficit comes down. I think GovernorGramley is making the assumption that we by monetary policy are goingto make these changes in what happens to the economy. I do not happento believe that that is the case because if we give up, then theinflation problem is just going to explode again and the economy willbe in terrible shape. We are in a box. I do not think we have theopportunity to move. We have to stay where we are and do our job. Wecannot control the economy; we cannot control what the Administrationdoes. You say, [Nancy], that you are supporting the President. Itseems to me that the President has to support his program, which he isnot doing right now", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we would rebase at the top of therange; that is what to do. But even rebasing at the top of the rangecosts .4 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. --and we rebase M1, we are in realdanger of getting a major reaction by the market, the press, and thepublic that we are definitely easing monetary policy verysignificantly", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What I am saying--I think you aremisunderstanding me--is that I think we could get away with rebasingM1. But to rebase M2 and then offset it by raising the target rangeanother 1/2 point I think is overkill", "MR. SCHULTZ. I disagree with your comments on credibility.I think there is an enormous sense out there that we are still theonly game in town in the fight against inflation. If we do somethingto change that, we are going to do something very important. To methat credibility question is really critical. We are right back inthe situation we have been in before, particularly now that the2/1-2/82President will not do anything about the deficits. We are in thisuncomfortable, improper, nasty situation that we have to deal with,which is that the central bank of the United States has far moreresponsibility than it ought to have. But the fact of the matter isthat we have it because of the way the political system works. Andthis credibility question is just absolutely vital. We have not yetchanged those inflation expectations because everybody thinks that weare going to cave in to the political pressure that is going to be onus. They do not understand all these nuances about demand shifts andlinkages and all this other stuff; all they see is that the Fed is theonly inflation fighter we have in the country. If we give anindication that we are caving in and if we start making some changes,there are some really serious costs in terms of credibility, Paul. Ithink that credibility factor is more important than you just gave itcredit for", "MS. TEETERS. I would say to Larry Roos that having gone tothe reserve targeting and monetary aggregates targeting with a greatdeal of reluctance and skepticism, and having all the troubles andcriticism that we have had, I am getting more and more to the pointthat I do not think it is the right way to [conduct policy]. We oughtto be moving back toward interest rate targeting combined withaggregates targeting, knowing that we are not going to achieve eitherperfectly, but we would have a better monetary policy than we have hadand a better economy. We have bounced this economy all over the matfor three years with no growth", "MR. ROOS. Of course, Nancy, what disturbs me--and I say thiswith humility--is that I fear that what is being done may not producethe results we sought. Procedurally, I don't think we really aredoing what ought to be done to conduct monetary policy in the way thatthose who wanted to target on reserve targets had sought initially.What I think will happen in the real world--I am not going to bearound--is that this will not work. And everybody, broad-brush, willsay that the monetarist approach failed when I really do not thinkthat we have conducted a true monetaristic experiment here. But wecould argue that for forever and a day", "MS. TEETERS. I have a much more practical point. I do notlike what we have done to the economy in the past three years. I donot like 9 percent unemployment rates and I do not like interest ratesin the 17 to 20 percent range", " If it becameclear on the basis of the evidence that accumulated over this period,that the November-December-January spurt was more indicative of theunderlying demand relationship than the August, September, and Octoberlow levels--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I would vote yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, whatever we say other than thatthese are the ranges and come hell or high water we are going to bewithin them, we are going to raise some questions in some people'sminds. There is no question that people will be talking about it, fortwo weeks anyway, if we say anything but that. But the problem is:Do we want to say that. We also may get ourselves in so deep that wecan never change the darn things and we may be doing thingssubstantively that we do not want to do. So, we have to balance thatoff. The fact is that there are going to be a lot of people out therewho would heave a sigh of relief if we said that, because a lot ofpeople think policy is too tight", "-94-2/1-2/82MR. GRAMLEY. Well, let's say the economy begins to showsigns of a modest recovery along the lines that the staff hasforecast. But the staff forecast was built on the assumption thatthere was going to be a big drop in M1 during the course of the firstquarter. Given the policy targets that we set this morning, we aresaying that is not happening; we are saying it is going to stay level.So, from March on we are going to be applying a tighter monetarypolicy than was built into the forecast, which means that if we wantto stay within the range, we will be opting for a weaker economy. Dowe want less than 1.3 percent real growth from the fourth quarter tothe fourth quarter", "MR. GRAMLEY. I would opt to wait a couple of weeks, if Ithought I could get anyone else to go along with me, on loosening thereins. But I doubt very much--no matter what happens over the nexttwo weeks--that this Committee is going to be willing to loosen up theranges. Maybe they are, but I suspect that your suggestion has appealbecause I do not think this Committee realizes yet how harsh amonetary policy it is imposing on the economy with the kind of targetswe are looking at now, given what I think is going to happen to money.Maybe we will be lucky and money growth will turn negative and we willhave a lot of room from then on. But I doubt it. So, I think we arelooking at a situation, if we are not awfully careful and if we do notstay really flexible, where we are going to be opting for a stillworse economy than what the staff is forecasting", "MR. AXILROD. Governor Gramley, if I might say, believable ornot, the staff forecast is based on the scenario you described--thatis, virtually no growth in money over the next couple of months andthen three quarters of growth averaging 1.3 or 1.4 percent quarterly.And as you have pointed out, that requires, if you believe the models,a resumption of the downward drift in so-called money demands afterthis quarter at a rate almost as rapid, but not quite, as we had allof last year. So, if that does not develop, then we would get muchhigher interest rates, at least in the short run", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. At the risk of being mischievous, mayI point out that this process or line of presentation--namely, gettinga decision sequentially on this particular issue--[may prejudice thedecision]. You are asking for a decision on that and saying that youare going to inform the [Congressional] committee and prepare theground that under these conditions we might be willing to make anadjustment and that it would be logical to do it in the form ofrebasing. If you get an affirmative decision from this Committee nowon that and then go on to ask if we should fine-tune on the targetranges, then the answer I think becomes clearly no. We will looksilly, it seems to me, if we make minor adjustments in M1 or M2 even,and then on top of that say we are prepared to take another look atthis and do some rebasing. So, if you do not want to prejudice thedecision on the last point, it seems to me that you really have to askfor a decision on both", "MR. BALLES. Absolutely", "MR. SCHULTZ.

Well, let me come back and see whether wecan resolve this. We have a proposal on how to present this on thetable. There obviously are pros and cons. There are problems withit, as expressed by Larry Roos and others; they are clearly there.There are also, obviously, some advantages.

And then thequestion is: What happens next", "MR. WINN. Could I raise one more question, Mr. Chairman.What's the status of Mexico, with the devaluation", "MR. CROSS. Well, the devaluation by Mexico was certainlyregarded initially as very useful--a successful move in that therewere reflows of capital back into Mexico and a reversal of thedollarization that Mexico experienced. So, during the first few weeksthere was a very rosy and successful view about it. But there hasbeen a notable lack of a supporting program and increasing concernabout the lack of such a program. At the present time there has beena decree to increase wages by really very, very large amounts--amounts which almost nobody thinks can be justified by thedevaluation. Mexico had a very large increase in the minimum wage inJanuary of 33 percent. Another 30 percent has been proposed; theemployers haven't yet agreed to all of this. So, that adds up to a[cumulative] 73 percent wage increase in the first 2 or 3 months ofthe year. And everybody is beginning to wonder how long the peso canremain at the level it now is with these kinds of wage increases andthe expectation that inflation will run at 50 percent or so this yearat a time when U.S. inflation is 7-1/2 percent or so. So, it appearsthat the initial reaction, which was so favorable, is now giving wayto second thoughts.

A number of them, likeLarry Klein, were very sympathetic to us. But it was remarkable howmany--not just the standard old line monetarists--had questions aboutthis. The way it came out from some of them was this: If you saythere will be wider variations in interest rates, should you try tocontrol the [monetary growth] path in some way to take some of thefluctuation out. Implicit in that statement is the hidden assumptionthat we're now successfully operating counter-cyclically in fine-tuning the economy, and they question whether that can be so. I guessthe question is: Do you really feel that you're working against theswings in rates so that if we somehow had smoothed the [monetarygrowth] path it would have produced more violent fluctuations ininterest rates than we've seen", "MR. KICHLINE. Oh, I think it's possible. You're quitecorrect that those indicators--and we have really nothing else--pointto further weakness in the second quarter. The staff's forecast hasabout flat final sales, which is risky. All of the positive numberswe see result from a slower runoff of inventories, and forecastinginventories is currently messier than M1. So, I think there's a gooddeal of risk in the forecast and I would say it's primarily on thedown side. The one encouraging thing is that when you add up thevarious sectors, we're clearly not getting the major declines inspending that we saw earlier. But at this point it seems to me it'svery risky and we could have further to go before the economy, infact, turns up", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If I'm reading the numbers right, youare estimating a GNP implicit deflator for the first quarter of 5.0percent; but for the second quarter it jumps up to 6.6 percent andthen comes down again substantially in the third quarter and fourthquarter to about 5-1/2 percent. What explains such an abrupt shift inthe deflator from the first to the second quarter", " And I am concerned about what the--MR. BOEHNE. If I were putting together a forecast, I'dprobably be about where Jim is. Although I think there is a bottomingout, I haven't seen a lot of evidence that a recovery is occurring.But it's this thing that one can't measure--the sense of vulnerabilityto the economy because of the psychology--that really gives me moreconcern than anything", "MR. WALLICH. I note that we have had a relatively rareevent: namely, that the March projection seems to show an improvementboth in progress on inflation and in growth. Now, that by itself isalmost implausible. One would think that inflation is wound down bymore slack in the economy. And here it looks as though inflation iscoming down more than previously expected, while growth is a littlebetter than previously expected; it may be the effect of oil prices,which is an exogenous element.I would certainly agree that there's a great deal ofuncertainty about any estimate now. But other than that, it seems tome that there's a considerable degree of consensus about the mostlikely pattern: namely, a bottoming out in the second or thirdquarter and then a rise. There's some disagreement about the strengthof the rise, but our projection now is coming closer to that of theAdministration than it used to be. So, in terms of the most probablecourse of events, there is a high degree of consensus. The dispersionaround that consensus is something else. There is a high degree ofuncertainty, but that is part of the process of winding down theinflation. If everybody were completely sure of what he expected,there would not be a great deal of pressure on wages, prices, andfinancial behavior; and I think we have to accept this as part of thecost of the process and part of the cost of making progress [oninflation], which really has been quite remarkable to date", "MR. CORRIGAN. The other thing that is taking on a slightlydifferent tone is what I guess I would call a level of frustrationthat is associated with the interest rate situation itself. Manypeople look at the obvious inflation [improvement] and they look atinterest rates and they see these enormous premiums. Regardless ofwhat those premiums precisely reflect, in a sense there seems to benothing that is going to get rid of that problem. I don't think it'ssomething that people--at least in a major way--are blaming theFederal Reserve for. Indeed, one gets some feeling that people dorecognize that at this point at least the Federal Reserve is locked into some extent, and I think that's right. At least as I would look atit, when you question what could be done by the Federal Reserve to tryto deal with that problem, the hard fact of the matter is that we havevery little room to maneuver. I personally can't see how we're goingto get much relief from that when we're looking at, in Mr. Kichline'scase, $160 billion deficits. Nor can I see, without taking exceptionwith your forecast, Jim, any real possibility for any kind ofsustainable growth in the economy with this fiscal situation the wayit is. I'd like to think that political and other forces would bebrought to bear to do something there, but I don't see that happeningeither. So, I come out with the sense that we are indeed between arock and a hard place at this point", "-19-3/29-30/82MR. KEEHN. I hear a lot of gossip. Harvester, frankly can't[mirror] the GM and Ford settlements. They've got to get more[concessions]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They finally can get by with great bigincreases", "MR. KEEHN. Yes. There are increases in delinquencies,foreclosures, and bankruptcies. But, honestly, the increases are froma very low base. So, it's not yet a broad, pervasive problem. Butthe actual numbers are beginning to increase", "MR. GUFFEY. Just one other comment in that respect: Whilethere are foreclosures and there are work-out situations, there arevery few sales. There are offers of land sales in our area but veryfew sales actually have taken place. That means that the lendinginstitution is taking over the land or their alternative is workingwith the borrower one more year. So, it's very difficult for us toget a handle on how much land prices have actually dropped becausethere are no sales to verify it", "MR. ROOS. I think reasonable, in terms of less-than-might-be-expected settlements. They realize that they have to be flexibleunder these circumstances and I think this will bode well for theeffort to continue to hold down inflation. These guys at least werenot bitter in their reactions, and they said that even though theirrank and file membership are experiencing things that they haven'texperienced for some years, they're not reacting as they might have inthe '30s. They're not just saying the world is going to the dogs. Ifelt more of an upbeat reaction in terms of the long pull than some ofthe others of you who expressed yourselves yesterday. And in my ownshort experience on this Committee, I think we've tended to getcarried away emotionally on the down side when things are gloomy.Si mentioned yesterday, when you questioned him, what ishappening to farm prices in Illinois. I remember just a few years agowe were all extremely appalled at the inflationary upward movement infarm prices. So, I think it's important that we not get carried awayand over-react to what hopefully will be a temporary situation", "MR. RICE. From the point of real growth in the thirdquarter, it is the most optimistic, as compared with Data Resources,Wharton, and Chase. In the third quarter only Merrill Lynch is moreoptimistic than the Board's forecast", "MR. RICE. That's right. I'm encouraged, of course, by thataspect of our staff's forecast, which projects the recovery to beginin the second quarter with GNP increasing at a 2 percent annual ratein real terms. But I'm worried and concerned that this recoverydepends pretty much on what happens to inventories. Without theanticipated reduced rate of inventory liquidation, the recovery I takeit will be delayed until the third quarter. In the meantime, there'sa good deal of stress and distress out there in the economy with manysectors in the economy feeling a good deal of financial pressure;pessimism was widely reported yesterday. As President Winn says,there really may be too much doom and gloom out there, but it isnevertheless there. Financial conditions have deteriorated markedlyfor nonfinancial corporations. As you know, the interest coverageratios for these firms have fallen to record low levels, downgradingsof debt ratings have been occurring in large numbers, the businessfailure rate is running at a record postwar pace, mortgagedelinquencies are up, and the housing sales situation didn't look asgood in February as we thought it did up until yesterday. We heardyesterday about the farming sector and the problems it was having. Inthese circumstances, it seems to me that it is important that therecovery not be delayed until the third quarter. While there is everyreason for hoping that it will occur as projected in the staffforecast, I think everything should be done to try to encourage anearly recovery. Thank you", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, I have to add my name tothe list of the worriers today. I don't know that I would develop aforecast, if I had to make one, that looked any different insignificant ways than the staff's. But it seems to me that as theinformation comes in, increasingly it's calling into question whetheror not we're at the end of recession and about to see a rathersignificant recovery. Obviously, the staff's forecast is not arecovery of the dimensions that we've seen typically in the postwarperiod after a recession; but it indicates pretty good growth in thelast three quarters of the year, a 3-3/4 percent annual rate. And asFrank Morris mentioned yesterday, the price figures have been quiteweak. Maybe we're looking at something different now but-25-3/29-30/82historically, at least, prices of industrial raw materials turn upbefore the rest of the economy. Initial claims are still very high.Yesterday we learned that consumer confidence in March, on the basisof the Conference Board survey, was down again. The machine toolorders figures continue to be very weak. There's just no sign ofabatement at all in that area, but it's a very small part of the totaleconomy. I would say that there's at least a 60-40 chance that wewon't see growth of more than, say, one percent in the last threequarters of the year; that we'll get a bump because of a turnaround ininventory investment from deep negative to small negative or zero orsmall positive; that final sales will continue to erode, at least inareas like business fixed investment and maybe housing; and that wewill see very, very little upturn at all.I think we have seen a very, very substantial weakening ofattitudes around the country. I just sense a different kind ofattitude than I can ever recall during my period as a professionaleconomist. Part of the reason is the concern about the budget but Ithink to a larger extent it is a consequence of the fact thatcontinued monetary restraint over a very prolonged period has put theeconomy into a very, very weakened state. I don't think we shouldlook at what we're seeing now as an unexpected development. We've hadas much growth in nominal GNP as we had any reason to expect, givenwhat we had provided by way of increases in the stock of money--indeed, more so because we've had downward shifts in money demand. Ithink we're making more progress on inflation than we had any right toexpect. We're making more progress than the traditional Phillipscurve type of analysis would have led us to expect. So, we're lookingat a situation now which is essentially of our own making, though notentirely. And now the question is what we do about it. I think wehave a very narrow line to walk. I don't think we can afford to giveup the progress we've made or to endanger it. But if there is adanger now, it is that we have more restraint than we want rather thanless restraint than we want. I'm very much worried about what isgoing to happen in these next few months", "MR. AXILROD. Well, as I mentioned to the Board yesterday, Irefused to put the 1983 interest rate forecast in the Bluebook thistime because that's such a long way off. Attitudes might change andwe could have a wholly different outlook. But our basic interest rateforecast is for high interest rates in '83 of about this dimension.And with the deficit being even larger, one might want to questionagain the possibility of that being associated with the type of realGNP growth we have. But the quarterly model, which is of course oftenwrong, would suggest growth at these interest rates also. This issomewhat different from President Solomon's question of how can wereconcile this and not have interest rates higher. But even at thishigher level, the quarterly model would suggest that real growth willindeed appear to be something like what we have projected", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, it's an environment in which we havetremendous government borrowing, and the amount of funds raised in thefirst half of this year is fairly low. That picks up in the secondhalf and, given this forecast, would be substantially higher in '83.Much of that is government-related. The private sector borrowing, interms of the consumer sector and mortgage borrowing, is very low; itcontinues to be constrained. Durable goods expenditures are not doingvery well either and that's a reflection of the high interest rateenvironment. So, we get all of this financing but in a fairly tensesituation. Steve didn't put the interest rates in the Bluebook but weactually have a sheet with the numbers written down that I look at onoccasion, and we have short-term rates drifting up in 1983. So theydo rise in this forecast", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, my thoughts are very muchalong the lines of Lyle's. I'm more pessimistic short-term than thestaff is, certainly. I think the second quarter is going to benegative. I have not seen any basis yet for expecting an upturn.Certainly, the numbers we have in March so far don't support theproposition that the second quarter is going to show an upturn. Andit seems to me that we're going to have financial conditions that aregoing to mean a sluggish recovery--perhaps more sluggish than even thestaff has estimated. But there is one cushioning factor in theeconomy that no one has talked about thus far, and that is thetremendous upsurge in defense procurement, which is really beginningto develop a momentum. That will impact the economy very unevenly.Fortunately, in New England we get about three times our proportionateshare of defense contracts, so it is cushioning most of our majorcorporations--like Raytheon and United Technologies and so on--thatare in both the defense industry and domestic industry. I asked themhow they're doing and they said that their domestic business is lousy;their export business, which tends to be quite large, has been hithard by the rise in the dollar. But the defense business is boomingand their only problem in defense is getting the production out. So,that will cushion New England, California, Texas, the leading [defensecontractors are in those areas]. It's not going to do much for Si'sMiddle West, though", "3/29-30/82VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But it's highly possible that if weease the monetary targets, we would bring down short rates but therewould be a perverse reaction in the long end of the market", "MR. ROOS. Well, if I had to opt for something, I would saythat if there is an April bulge, it should be brought down almost asquickly as possible in order to permit money to grow gradually overthe last part of the year. On the other hand, that could cause a2- or 3-week--if one can define it [that closely]--upward movement ofthe fed funds rate and other short-term interest rates and that doesfrighten some people. It's a matter, though, of whether we bite thebullet now in order to position ourselves for growth in the aggregatesin the second half of the year or if we tolerate that, as we sometimeshave in the past, and then are forced to keep money growing at a verylow rate, as occurred for six months last year. In our analysis, thatis what we did from May to October of last year, and it was acontributing factor to our present weak economy. Now, this may beseeing it from a monetarist point of view; I assume it is. And someof you may not share that view. But it worries us, looking into thefuture, that we may be setting the stage for problems at the end ofthis year and going into next year", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm still having a littletrouble reconciling the assumption that the adjustment to nationwideNOW accounts was completed in December with the fact that NOW accountshave been growing at about a 50 percent annual rate in the firstquarter. Somehow, those two things don't come together very well forme. And the fact that most of this money bulge was in NOW accountsraised a question in my mind about whether this bulge means the samething that a bulge in the old M1 would have meant. This leads me to aquestion for Steve. It's a hypothetical question, but I'll ask itanyway. If you assume that we did not move to nationwide NOW accountslast year and that the NOW accounts were still confined to New Englandand New York, would you have expected, on the basis of what hashappened, a 10 percent rate of growth in old M1 in the first quarter.Or is that too hypothetical to even--", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I want to come back to NOW accounts. Ihave basically the same concern that you expressed, Paul. If you lookat the behavior of the narrow aggregate as it used to be defined, itlooks as if there's some squeeze on it. If you look at it with NOWaccounts in it, it looks rather substantial. As a matter of fact, toput an exact point on it, if you use the old definition of M1--currency and demand deposits--you will find that in the seven monthssince the cyclical peak it has increased at an annual rate of only1-1/2 percent, which is the lowest growth rate of the last fourrecessions.On the other hand, if you include NOW accounts, you will findthat it has increased 7 percent at an annual rate in the seven monthssince the cyclical peak, which is the fastest rate of the last fourrecessions. So the way one looks at this NOW account surge makes allthe difference in the world. It may be that Frank is right. I thinkwe probably don't have a very good handle on how many NOW accounts arebeing opened. And I rather despair, this far into the exercise, offinding out much really useful information on the number of newaccounts. If he is right, it's not going to come out again becausethose are new accounts and the funds won't come out. Or it may bethat Steve is right that [the bulge reflects] precautionary balancesbut we don't know whether those precautionary balances are going tocome out or not. But the fact of the matter is that over the lastseveral months we've had very large growth rates in the NOW accountcomponent. What they call OCDs now was still 20 percent orthereabouts in March, Steve. I think that ought to affect the waythat we look at this target rate simply because we don't know what isgoing to happen to that component. We can't continue to squeeze whatamounts to corporate balances in order to accommodate the rise of NOWaccounts if they continue to rise at a very rapid rate in the periodahead.As I look at those paths, there's nothing at all exceptionalabout \"A.\" It has 4-1/2 percent growth [in M1] in the 3 months fromMarch to June. That 4-1/2 percent growth doesn't sound like a largegrowth rate to me for M1 and that includes whatever disproportionateincrease was occurring in NOW accounts over that time. It didn't seemlarge in March; it was about 2 percent. February was, of course,minus but that was an unwinding of the demand deposit explosion inJanuary which did in fact, as you expected, totally unwind in themonth of February. Therefore, my view is that we ought to be prepared-38-3/29-30/82to accept modest continuing growth in M1, and 4-1/2 percent in my viewis modest. And if, in fact, these NOW accounts don't come out--thatis, if we don't get some correction of this very large increase thatwe had over the fall and winter--I don't think that will impact on thesecond half of the year because my view of the matter is that we oughtto change our targets. We ought to accept a higher growth rate forthe year as a whole, which would have been entirely because of theincrease early in the year associated with this explosion in NOWaccounts. That's if those balances don't come out. If they do comeout, then we can make room for it. I must say I see no reason tosqueeze the economy harder and harder at this point in time, given theconditions that we've been talking about and given the fact that weare looking at something that has the cosmetic oddity of an explosionin NOW accounts accounting for virtually all of the strength that wehave seen", "MR. WALLICH. I'm starting from the premise that we're notgoing to get inflation down much more unless we can sustain somedegree of pressure. So, I think some degree of pressure is consistentwith a moderate rate of growth. I doubt that it's consistent with the4.5 percent rate of growth of the GNP, not money supply, that thestaff has forecast for the second half. That is really quite a goodgrowth rate, and in that environment I think concerns about excessivewage payments will yield very quickly to a feeling that now is thetime to catch up--that people have made sacrifices and they need to berewarded by compensatory higher increases. Now, a policy of about 3percent [real GNP growth] should allow for possibly some reduction in[un]employment. It depends on productivity. I think it carries somerisks that a financial crisis might hit. But as we look at theinterest rate projections of the staff, they don't seem to indicatethat the problem of the thrifts will be greatly alleviated no matterwhat we do. There's the danger also that the dollar may go higher.If we do damage to our exports, we may do damage to other countriesthat reflects back on us. I think that danger is less because theyare now beginning to realize that a high dollar is not so much of arisk for them and that they can afford to reduce their interest rates.Now if one accepts, as I do, aiming at something like 3 percent realgrowth, then I think alternative A really lacks credibility. It lackscredibility, anyway, in terms of our [long-run] targets because it3/29-30/82means that we're going to be above our targets for the rest of theyear. And we're going to have that held against us continually", "MR. CORRIGAN. Well, Mr. Chairman, as to the comments thathave been made, ranging from chasing aggregates to the NOW accountanalysis, and did we have a bulge or didn't we: What does it mean.The comments about leaving some room in the second half of the year Ithink are all relevant. And in the context of this potential Aprilbulge problem, they take on a special significance. But I think theyalso relate in a fundamental way to an analytic problem that I don'tthink we have quite dealt with yet. The manifestation of thatanalytic problem is the simultaneous phenomenon of a lot of interestrate variability and a lot of money supply variability. We sit here,of course, and make judgments about reserve paths and we makejudgments about changing those reserve paths. But implicit in bothsetting the paths and changing the paths is this notion that it isultimately changes in interest rates that are the trigger variablethat sets in place the adjustments in portfolios that in turnultimately reflect themselves in altered rates of growth of the moneysupply. Now, that's all well and good. But I think we have to keepsome perspective on that. The perspective that I think is importantis the recognition that those interest rate changes are only one ofthe factors that determine the nature and pace of the portfolioadjustments that ultimately do reflect themselves in the rate ofgrowth of the money supply. In the context that we are operating now,it seems to me almost self-evident that the nature of thoseadjustments in response to any pattern of interest rate change has initself changed. Indeed to take the extreme--and this is relevant inthe context of this April bulge--if we are going to smooth out allthose bulges and all those short-run blips in the money supply, wemust be prepared to get to the point where the interest rate impactthat we can create by changing reserve paths is large enough tooutweigh all those other factors, ranging from seasonal adjustmentfactors on up. Now, as it may impact on the observed behavior of themoney supply in the short run, we must be prepared at the extreme todo that in a context in which, at least in my mind, the jury is out asto what the nature of the interest elasticity of money demand is.Indeed, I still find myself, at times at least, attracted to theargument that in some sense we may be creating some of the variabilitythat we have seen in both money and interest rates by the nature ofour own activities. I'm not persuaded of that, but at least I have toleave my mind open to it.In that analytical setting, I must say I would be a littletroubled with the prospect of aggressively chasing a bulge in themoney supply in April, even though that would prolong the amount of-44-3/29-30/82time that we might be over the stated targets for the behavior of M1for this year. Again, from an analytical point of view, I think Mr.Axilrod's earlier comments are relevant here. If that were to happen,it does in some sense aggravate the problem. But at the same time, ifsome of the speculation around the table about this NOW accountphenomenon is accurate, one could still reasonably expect that the NOWaccount build-up would wind down later in the year and still wouldleave plenty of room for the kind of expansion in the economy that isimplicit in the staff's forecast. The long and the short of it frommy point of view would be at this time to go slow indeed in terms ofthis April bulge, should it materialize. I hope it doesn't because ifit doesn't, we're obviously in pretty good shape in any event. As tospecifics, I would come out somewhere between \"A\" and \"B.\" And if wegot a bulge, and the net result were that we ended up with a quarterthat looked like \"A,\" that wouldn't bother me all that much either", "MS. TEETERS. I'm basically impressed by the fact that all ofour worst fears have been realized. We have nearly 9 percentunemployment. For every Federal Reserve District, the openingsentence in the Redbook was about depression or not functioning wellor no sign of recovery. We have the thrifts going down. We have aliquidity crisis in the thrift industry in at least half of theDistricts. We have a massive reduction in credit ratings, as Emmettmentioned, and a very high level of business failures. What more doyou want. We have the economy essentially out flat. And under any ofthese alternatives we don't get a great deal of recovery. At the endof the [projection period] we get to maybe 75 percent capacityutilization and still have well over 8 percent unemployment. As Ithought through it, so many of our other problems would be alleviatedif we just had some reduction in interest rates at this point. Itwouldn't help all the thrifts, but it would certainly help some. Andgoing along with a 13-1/2 percent or 13-1/4 percent interest rate,[with rates] rising sharply next year, is not my idea of how to putthis economy back to work.Given the alternatives that we have and the wide division ofpreferences here, I obviously want to associate myself with GovernorPartee and Governor Gramley and go for alternative A. And if it turnsout that that's not doing the job of recovery then, as I said lasttime, we should raise our targets. We can do it a number of differentways. The one modification I would make on \"A\" is that I would go fora billion dollars of borrowing rather than $750 million because Ithink the $750 million is too strong a signal that we are going forease. But I don't think 13 percent is an acceptable level of interestrates for this stage of the [cycle]. I think we can do more. I havesome reluctance to ease sharply because I don't think we are going toget the correction in the federal deficit that we need to offset thecollision course that I anticipate next year if the deficit is notchanged. But, under normal circumstances and with a normal fiscalpolicy, we should be a lot easier than we are now. And the fact thatfiscal policy is so overly expansionary is the only thing that keepsme from urging an even greater relaxation in monetary policy", "MR. KEEHN. I will admit to a significant bias caused by thecircumstances in the Middle Western District. And though I certainlydon't disagree in any way with the fundamentals of the staff economicforecast, I am skeptical or merely unconvinced with regard to thetiming as well as the strength of the recovery. Also, it seems to methat an awful lot of uncertainty about the composition of M1 and M2has been expressed around the table. Meanwhile, we have an economythat is operating under the very most difficult circumstancespossible. While I'm not in any way suggesting a major change in whatwe are doing or how we are doing it, I do think that we have toprovide at least a modest degree of relief, and it seems to me thatalternative A is a way of doing that. I would be very strongly infavor of alternative A as a way of trying to accommodate a possiblebulge that could occur in April, but particularly because M2 is in areasonable position within its range. So, I would very much be infavor of alternative A", "MR. PARTEE. Well, of course, there are people who maintainjust the opposite: that M2 is a better predictor. I think the last3/29-30/82study I was associated with showed that we got very little additionalinformation when we added the M2 components to M1. And I don't knowthat that has changed much. But M1 is deteriorating, I think, and itmay be that we'll have to have a rationale for using M2. There's noreason that can't be developed. After all, until he found that hedidn't have so much to hit the Federal Reserve over the head with,Milton Friedman was for M2; it's only recently that he has changed toM1", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's a little high on a quarterlyaverage basis. If you look at it on a December-to-March basis, it'sjust about at the top of the range", " I don't care whether it is put at 9 or--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know whether either of those isright. It seems a little strange, putting all our money on somebody'sjudgmental correction of a seasonal adjustment which is doubtful. Itis piling doubts on doubts. But I think we have to reach somejudgment as to how we want to accommodate or not accommodate, howrapidly we respond to an increase, and where we set the borrowing in-51-3/29-30/82the first place. If we set the path consistent with a lower level ofborrowing than we now have, which is what--$1-1/4 billion roughly", "MR. PARTEE. Then why don't we widen that range again towhere we like it and make it 11 to 16 percent", "MR. GRAMLEY. I am worried about the substance of yourargument. I think 3 percent as a target for the second quarterassumes that we are going to get a reversal of this build-up in OCDs,and I am not at all sure that that is going to take place. And I3/29-30/82don't want policy to follow a course that is going to push up interestrates if that doesn't happen. On the other hand, if we have a pathbased on a 9 or 9.1 percent increase or thereabouts for M1 in Apriland a 10 percent increase in M2, then we can come back next time andlook at it again", "MR. GRAMLEY. The thing that I think we need to worry aboutnow is the phenomenon that happened last summer. In putting moreattention on M2, I think we let more constraint develop on the economyex post than we wanted. And Governor Partee was reminding us over andover again that we were going to do that. I wish I had listened tohim then. I think that's something that we have to be careful aboutin April. If the M1 number happens to come in at 3 percent, let'ssay, one could easily interpret that as no bulge. But in fact if theeconomy was weakening and the signals of economic weakness weregathering [momentum], then we would be sitting back and accepting 3percent and it would just be the wrong thing to do", " The second half is--MR. FORD. You wouldn't mind", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm a little worried about the marketperception when we narrow or widen the range--I'm not talking aboutthe absolute levels now at all--because the market attributes muchmore significance to our narrowing or widening that range than we do.We don't really give it much significance. But market observers don'tunderstand why we would be narrowing or widening the range unless it'sof some importance to us. I have heard recently views that we arekeeping the fed funds rate within a very narrow range in terms ofactually looking at the market behavior. So, I don't particularly-56-3/29-30/82care, except that if we want to de-emphasize the constraints that areimplied by the range, we ought to try, if at all possible, not to keepshifting back and forth between a narrow range and a wider range", "MS. TEETERS. We can afford some easing. You know, we arereally at the bottom of the recession. I don't see why you are soenamored of keeping interest rates in the 13 to 15 percent range.

[Statement--see Appendix", "MR. BOEHNE. While there are pockets of prosperity in myarea, notably in the health area, in general the news is quitebearish. It's grim in some quarters. There are just no signs ofrecovery, to take an example, has a number of productsthat they consider leading indicators--and they have been for a numberof years--and there's just no life in them at all. In fact, some ofthem are still going down. If you talk to the economists in some ofthese firms, they are still optimistic about a recovery later in theyear. But if you talk to the top guys in these firms, they may saythe same thing publicly, but their attitudes and expectations havedefinitely soured. One of the things that seems to be at work here isthat they see a longer-term deterioration of their competitiveposition going out into '83, '84, '85, and '86. And that's largelybecause they're having to cancel a lot of investment plans, given thebalance sheet constraint, plus what they see as the high value of thedollar that is putting them at a competitive disadvantage with theirforeign competitors. I think the feeling is that even if we got adrop in interest rates soon, which they certainly would like to have,they are really going to be in a very tight spot for a number of yearsif this situation continues. They see a considerable amount of redink. So, at least among the people that I talk to in my District, theattitudes--while they weren't good at the time of our last FOMCmeeting--are now [focused on] looking out three or four years. Andthey are saying the damage that the current climate has done is inareas where they think their longer-term competitive position is atstake. And while I think in general they are still supportive of whatthe Fed is doing, there is some erosion in that support because a-12-5/18/82number of them are beginning to think that perhaps the situation isgetting counterproductive because of the effect it's going to have ontheir own competitive positions several years out", "MR.

In Birmingham, for example, we are down to oneU.S. Steel blast furnace in operation and there's a lot of talk thatit may be shut down in June. That would create another problem for usin that area and [contribute to the process of] deindustrialization inBirmingham. Other things that had been sustaining our regionaleconomy are also beginning to waiver. Most particularly, we had theenergy boom going for us over in Louisiana--a lot of gas well drillingand so on--and there has been a precipitous decline in that kind ofactivity. We've had heavy layoffs in oil field drilling operationsand related activities there. Most discouraging is the fact that evenin our high-tech belt, which is emerging around Atlanta and inFlorida, we've had companies such as Scientific Atlanta laying offpeople for the first time in anybody's memory there. Companies thatwe think of as having a regular 25 percent increase in profits yearafter year are starting to feel the pinch. So, things are looking-14-5/18/82pretty serious around the southeastern states in our District. Theonly thing that seems to be encouraging in our area is the fact thatwe have the World's Fair going on, which is attracting a lot of peopleto Eastern Tennessee and compensating somewhat for the manufacturingweaknesses in that state.On the subject of housing finance that you raised, Chuck,while I do think the investment aspect of buying a house is fadingsomewhat, there's a very strong feeling--I do know a lot of thebuilders in our area and talk to them regularly, and thrift executivesas well--around Atlanta and around the Florida Keys that they are justwaiting to get out there. Builders are chomping at the bit. We'vehad steady increases in permits and housing starts in a number of ourmajor metropolitan areas, although they are still at depressed levels.And I would say our residential markets will come back, though perhapsnot with the same vigor as when housing used to be a sure-fireinvestment as well as a place to live. We have a lot of pent-updemand for housing in Atlanta itself due to some unusual developmentsthere like Georgia-Pacific crossing out \"Pacific\" and coming back toGeorgia. We have a pretty good [housing] market. So, we have someencouragement from that side.We have another big minus force and that is that farmers inthe Southeast are getting clobbered credit-wise--almost like Mexico,you know. The story is that they are overextended on their debt.We're watching the markets for land very closely, trying to detectsignals of any kind of collapse in land prices and we're not seeing itbecause it seems as if the lenders just don't want to liquidate peopleunless they absolutely have to. So, we're really not seeing a lot ofturnover of property, but we are hearing from a lot of bankers inrural areas that they are not happy about their farm loan portfoliosin terms of credit quality. And that just reflects the fact that ourfarmers are having a tough time throughout the District. Overall, I'dsay that the bloom is off the Sunshine states in our area, and thatexcept for a few areas of brightness we're feeling the recessionpretty heavily. And there is a lot of worry and concern amongbusiness lenders in our District", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I listened to my colleague Bob Black andI wish I could share his optimism. If we get a budget compromise andget it soon, I think I would go along with his view that we have apotentially good recovery ahead of us. I think we would get asignificant drop in bond rates, a pickup in stock prices, improvedconsumer confidence, and improved business attitudes generally. But Imust say that I think the likelihood of getting a significantreduction of prospective deficits before the election is pretty slim.We have to be prepared for the possibility that we will live for 3, 4,5 more months with this extremely gloomy set of attitudes pervadingfinancial markets and the nation more generally. I don't think thatwhat Bob is talking about is very likely. On the contrary, I seethings going the other way in recent months. Plans for business fixedinvestment are weakening. I had been worried earlier about thepossibility of a very, very large decline in business fixedinvestment, and I thought that the incoming evidence over the wintermonths had alleviated that concern; now I believe that that [revised]judgment was probably not right. I think we may see further signs of-15-5/18/82deterioration in business spending plans in the months ahead.Consumer attitudes are very, very sour. And until that situation isrectified, we're not likely to see a significant pickup in demand fordurables.I'm worried, and worried considerably, about the cumulativeeffects of high interest rates and what they are doing to the strengthof business enterprise. Interest charges are transfer payments; whatgoes out of one pocket ought to go into another. But I'm afraid theeffects on marginal propensities to spend in the aggregate are very,very negative as these high levels of interest rates continue. Ratiosof interest to profits plus interest have gone up very, veryconsiderably and they're going up further. And that is clearly havinga very substantial effect on the ability of businesses to financetheir operations, particularly smaller businesses. I'm wondering ifthe real danger at this point may not be that an episode of the kindwe were talking about earlier will cause credit markets to close inthe sense that lenders around the country will suddenly stop lendingas a means of protecting themselves against the possibility of veryserious effects. That's something we need to watch very, verycarefully. I hope the staff at the Reserve Banks will all keep incontact with their banks so that we can understand fully what is goingon in credit markets. I think we're going to have to be extremelycareful to avoid upsetting the situation, which could precipitate arenewed downtrend in economic activity instead of the upturn the staffhas forecast. If I had been in the staff's position, I probably wouldhave forecast just about what they did because that's what I think thelogic of the numbers suggests. But the logic of the qualitativeevidence coming in suggests that all the risks are on the down sideand I think that's what Jim Kichline was telling us this morning", "MR. GUFFEY. First of all, I'd like to direct a question toJim Kichline. If I understood your comment, Jim, the Greenbook isbased upon an assumption that there will be a budget compromise andthat it will be in magnitude about half what the President hasrecommended. I was under the impression that the assumption had beenthat there would be no compromise", "MR. KICHLINE. No, in February we had taken roughly half ofthe proposed deficit-reducing measures in the Administration's budgetat that time. We have retained that [assumption]; those numbers on aunified deficit basis are around $25 billion in deficit reducingmeasures both on the tax side and in expenditure cuts. The numbersbeing talked about in the Congress--adjusting away some of the thingssuch as interest rate declines, which we have not put into thesemeasures--are in the $50-$60 billion range. So, we're at roughly halfof what is being talked about in the Congress now", "-19-5/18/82MR. GRAMLEY. What do you assume about cuts further out. Itseems to me that the critical issue in terms of the effect on theeconomy of a compromise is what happens to expectations about furthergrowth of the deficit beyond fiscal '83. What does that mean forlong-term interest rate expectations, not just for long-term interestrates now. If one were to assume that we had that kind of deficitreduction for fiscal '83, but much much more in '84 and '85, then Iwould be quite convinced that the economy would come out of itscurrent slump and turn up. But if that were the only action--a cut inthe deficit of $40-$50 billion or somewhere around there--and if thatwere the figure for deficit reductions in '84 and '85 also, then Idon't think we'd get much relief", "MR. PARTEE. Peter, was the currency shipment to Argentina anoticeable factor", "MS. TEETERS. May I take my turn now. I have listened verycarefully, and I get a strong sense of crisis--which I've beenanticipating for quite some time--not just in financial markets but inpractically every sector of the economy now. No particular regionseems to be exempt. Even if today's problems with the money marketare resolved successfully--and we don't have any clue on that as ofthis point--I think there is another in the wings. Whether it's aparticularly new and inexperienced or maybe dishonest broker orwhether it's one of our larger firms, we are going to be facingfinancial crisis sooner or later. I would hasten to point out to youthat since we last met we've had five major bankruptcies, allanticipated. Braniff may not have disturbed New York but it obviously-26-5/18/82disturbed Dallas. We have a list of close to 75 major corporationsthat have had their credit ratings downgraded. And since that listcame out, there have been three additional bankruptcies reported.There are other firms that are obviously very shaky and that have veryhigh debt [levels]. I think much of this crisis and the problems,both in the international market and the domestic market, have comefrom the high variability of interest rates. And I think people havebuilt into the interest rates now a margin for risk, which reflectsthat variability. And the variabilities also have created new marketsthat I don't see any function for except for variable interest rates.Those are the futures markets, the options, and the ultimatesilliness--the options on futures, which strike me as just puregambling or trying to avoid risk.So, it seems to me pretty obvious when one looks at theeconomic projection, which I don't disagree with, that we are in theprocess of just pushing the whole economy not just into recession, butinto depression. And that's not a forecast of a good economy, I wouldpoint out to you. It seems to me utter foolishness to have 9.4percent unemployment and a 15 percent federal funds rate. Those arejust two things that have never occurred in this economy before. Thestaff has lowered its forecast, and has done so across the board,although mainly in business fixed investment. But everything is down.And when I questioned them about it yesterday, they said \"We no longercan deny the April numbers.\" The April numbers are very bad. Andthey carry that forecast of very slow growth out for a longer periodof time. If you look at it closely, there is no recovery. By thetime we get to the fourth quarter of 1983, the unemployment rate isdown to 8.8 percent and capacity utilization is up to 73 percent. Ithink we've undertaken an experiment and we have succeeded in ourattempt to bring down prices, although I realize they are lower thancan be sustained. But as far as I'm concerned, I've had it with themonetary experiment. It's time to put this economy back togetheragain and to get us some stability as to where we're going and how ourinterest rates are going to operate. I have very little respect forthe long-term aggregate [ranges] and I don't feel we have to proveourselves any more. I think it's time to operate as rational peopleand to try to get the economy at least started on a tentativerecovery.Given the alternatives that Steve has presented, that leavesme in the position of alternative A. I can't conceive of maintainingthese interest rates and not having really severe problems as we moveinto the summer. I'm concerned, as is everyone else, about thosedeficits. I would hasten to point out to you that approximately $100to $125 billion of the deficit is due to the recession. And I don'tthink we should require the Congress to try to offset recession-induced deficits by cutting expenditures or raising taxes. Even if weadjust for that, the deficits are substantial. And that's what Iassume the Congress will be working on rather than trying to removethe other part of it. I think it's time to relax [policy] and toreliquify the economy. It's time to permit corporations to fund theirsecurities loans. It's time just to say we are finished one job andto start the next one", "-27-5/18/82MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think everyone agrees that theeconomy is in a bad predicament now and that lower interest rates area prerequisite for any kind of sustained recovery. But where we havethe point of difference is how we think we ought to get those ratesdown. It seems to me that there are two main reasons why rates arestaying up. The first would be the uncertainties concerning whatmight be done by Congress on the present budget impasse; I guess allwe can do in that area is to jawbone, as I think you've done veryeffectively from time-to-time, with the rest of us chiming in wheneverwe could. But the second reason is a fear that the System at somepoint may be forced toward some materially easy monetary policy. Andagainst this background, I think the best way to reduce inflationarypressures, and with them interest rates, is to get these monetaryaggregates back within the target ranges and keep them there for thebalance of the year. So, I think we ought to stay with \"B,\" which weadopted last time. But I would regard that \"B\" part on M1 as theupper limit. I would be glad to accept maintaining the language inthe directive about a lower rate or an actual decline in M1, if that'saccompanied by substantially reduced pressures in the money markets.I have two other points. The first is that I would be alittle concerned about leaving in the sentence in the directiveregarding M2--the second sentence in the operational paragraph. Weincluded that last time mainly to cover the effects of the tax-relatedflows into M1, and we are now well past the tax date. And I wouldn'twant to see M1 come in above the \"B\" specifications even if M2 were onpath. The second point is that paragraph 10 in the Bluebook statesthat the staff's best estimate is that an $800 million borrowing levelwould be compatible with \"B.\" The borrowing level in the first four-week period of our intermeeting period averaged $1.3 billion. Andsince the demand for borrowings is notoriously volatile, I think itwould be a little better to start out a bit more conservatively. Forlack of a better figure, I would throw out $1.1 billion. And then I'dhave a clear understanding with the staff that borrowing would beadjusted down quickly if new data suggested that we had greater-than-anticipated weakness in the money supply and a lessening of pressuresin the money market", "MR. AXILROD. May I just make one comment that I think isrelevant, particularly in this recent environment. What we haveexperienced very recently is a little less borrowing and the fundsrate just coming down. Before that we had a higher funds rate than wethought [likely] for the level of borrowing. I'm not at all certainthat the banking system feels that eager to borrow. If we ever gotinto a liquidity pressure situation, it may be that they'd want tostore up their goodies a bit. So, I'm not exactly certain. It couldgo that way. I'm really just not certain, President Guffey", "MR. AXILROD. Yes", "\"MR. WALLICH. Well, I would like to remind you that this isprobably the low point on inflation that we're going to reach in thiscycle. From here on out visible inflation--[as reflected in] theindexes--is going to rise. I know that the underlying inflation rateisn't as low as the indexes show and that that underlying inflation islikely to continue coming down. Nevertheless, from now on out thenewspapers are going to be reporting that inflation has started again.Who was it that did it. I'll give you three guesses.So, I fear that we're in some danger of repeating pastperformance and that we may shift to an accommodative if not expansivestance too early. And things need not improve, unemployment wise,under such a scenario. Mrs. Thatcher now has 12 percent unemploymentand she had up to 20 percent interest rates. That may happen to usthe next time around if we start the next expansion from the presentlevel of inflation. I do agree with those who say that our job is toget interest rates down. We need to get credibility for what we'vebeen doing. Interest rates in real terms are surprisingly high and Ithink this is largely because people don't trust what has beenaccomplished so far. They see inflation accelerating again. Theylook at inflation as something on the order of at least 10 percent peryear over the long run. I don't see great [problems] in maintaining adegree of pressure at this time. Monetary policy really hasn't beenvery tight given that it is operating at very high interest rates.We're above our M1 target. We have not made a dramatic effort to getback into it as we did a year ago in April. The concerns that thetargets might be too low to accommodate a reasonable rate of growth ofnominal GNP have been largely removed. We're now looking at nominalGNP growth of 6 to 7 percent; a target at a peak 5-1/2 percent plus anormal gain in velocity of 2 or 3 percent clearly would accommodatethat and even would allow, possibly, for some decline in interestrates.Finally, the danger of provoking a severe downturn seems tome to be protected against--not guaranteed against, obviously--both bythe endogenous workings of the economy, such as the inventoryturnaround, financial endogenous factors such as the possible drop ininterest rates if the economy stays very weak, and the exogenousfactors of the tax cut and social security increase. So, it seems tome that we could continue to pursue a policy of moderate restraintuntil the economy turns. I would lean--I'm not always to be going for\"C\"--toward something like \"B-.\" That would mean to me a funds raterange of 11 to 16 percent instead of the 12 to 16 percent associatedwith \"C;\" I'd shade the range on the low side because we do want toget rates down. And for the borrowing assumption I think $800 millionis peculiarly low and I would opt for something around $1 billion.Thank you", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. He's not likely to do that. My ownjudgment is that we can't evade this issue that fully. He's going tocome back. He's going to come back in another letter or hearing very-43-5/18/82quickly if he thinks our response is too obviously evasive. Now, atthe same time, I don't think we can answer the question. And weshould not, in my opinion, prejudge precisely what we would do withouteven knowing what the resolution is", "MR. PARTEE. How would you like 10 percent for the bottom ofthe funds range. There was some expression around the table for that", "MR. BALLES. What did you say on the federal funds rate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I said 11 to 15 percent.

I agreewith the staff that we're going to have a recovery. I think that'scoming. But I suspect that it will be more of a statistical recovery--one that economists can point to rather than something thatbusinessmen are going to identify with. It seems to me that businessattitudes are still pretty sour and that balance sheets are prettywell strained. So, my guess is that, given the level of interestrates, your forecast is probably pretty optimistic, with most of therisk on the down side. How would you assess the risks of a deviation", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, I would agree with you. Certainly ourperception is that the risks are on the down side for real growth.Looking at the various sectors, the business sector is the one thatprobably worries us the most. While we have over the last severalforecasts reduced the expected performance of investment outlays--asJerry mentioned, it's about normal now--what we didn't mention is thatthe normal range in the postwar period is -2 to 17 percent and we'reat 8 percent. So, there's a lot of room at one end or the other.Looking at the data and trying to make some allowance for that, in ourjudgment that 8 percent is about right. But surely the Redbook andthe qualitative comments that we pick up are worrisome. I don't seeany major risk of this being an explosive recovery and I perceive therisk to be on the down side. And I think the financial structure ofthe various sectors and the level of interest rates are real problemsas we look ahead", "MR. BOEHNE. I've heard a good deal more concern expressed bybankers in recent weeks about credit quality problems going out overthe next 6 months or so. If I keep hearing a story enough times, Ithink there's some credibility to it. They say they now think thatcustomers they had never really thought about as being a problem aregoing to be a problem over the next 6 months. I don't think anybodyin the room could do any better job of putting together a forecast. I6/30-7/1/82believe Jim has done his usual good job. But with interest rateswhere they are and the weakness of the business sector, the odds areon the side that we're probably going to have a weak recovery. Andwhile I wouldn't forecast it, I would not rule out that there is areasonable chance the recovery could abort and that we could haveanother recession in 1983.On the longer-term strategy, I would come down on the sidethat it's time to show some flexibility [in setting] these targets atmidyear and I would raise the [M1] target. As I look out over thenext 6 months, it seems to me that we would have to keep M1 [growth]at 3 percent or under during the second half in order to [lower it to]the top end of our target [range for the year]. If we get a 10percent bulge in July, we would have to live with something like 1-1/2percent growth from August to the end of the year. Maybe velocitywill increase and maybe liquidity demands will go down, but it seemsto me that there is a very large risk here and that we need a littlebreathing room. There is, of course, the risk on the inflationaryexpectations side and on credibility, but I believe our credibilitywould be enhanced by being realistic. It's just very difficult tosell the limits that we imposed on ourselves. So, some flexibilityand some upward adjustment in the targets would make sense given thesituation we're in", "MS. TEETERS(.). John, this points up the inappropriateness,I think, of trying to establish growth rates for next year when we'reright in the middle of the budget process. [It would be better] if wecould wait to do this until late in the fall or even early next year.To try to establish growth rates with all the uncertainty about thisparticular aspect of it just highlights the problems that we have", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I want to pick up on Ed Boehne's commentstoo. It's extremely hard to believe that we wouldn't get somerecovery out of a $40 billion tax cut--$30 billion in taxes and $10billion in social security--starting tomorrow. And the inventorynumbers in the aggregate, though there are some exceptions, seemfavorable to a slowing at least in inventory liquidation. That oughtto be enough to give us some increase in the period immediately ahead.But I, too, am concerned about a relapse as time goes on andas we get into 1983. I note in particular that the staff's forecastfor this period presumes a flattening out, relatively quickly in termsof the cycles that one goes through, in real business fixedinvestment. They have it dropping rather sharply through midyear andthen stabilizing. I wonder what the basis is for expecting that therewould be such a sudden stabilization of that number considering thatit consists essentially of business plant and equipment. Almosteverything I've heard--and it's in the Redbook too--about what ishappening in machinery orders and equipment suggests continueddeterioration there as well as in commercial construction of shoppingcenters and office buildings. Again, almost everything one hearssuggests substantially growing problems with overbuilding in theoffice area. And then, finally, oil and gas well drilling, which Iguess is a fair size item in the [business fixed investment] figure,has been affected by the outlook for a sharp drop in oil prices. Theeffect that has on drilling activity has been reported at our lastseveral meetings. Considering that it's an item with a long lead timeand considering these things and the financial state of manybusinesses, one wonders how [corporate] budgets could be consideredand approved that would call for rises in capital spending, how thefunds could be raised, and how the contracts could be let and all thiswould result in a stabilization of real business spending by themiddle of next year. It just seems to me that instead there might bea very, very protracted and sizable continuing decline in capitalspending as we go through next year. And that would greatly changethe first half of the outlook.Similarly, the residential construction industry isdemoralized. They're concerned not only about the price of money,6/30-7/1/82which you forecast to be remaining at 16-1/2 percent, but about theavailability of funds because the savings and loans are goingbankrupt, and also about the possibility that people will be pullingback from making commitments of that kind in an environment wherehousing prices are no longer rising appreciably and in many cases arefalling. It's also an environment in which balloon payment loans willbe maturing next year, and many more bankruptcies and foreclosures andtakeovers of property will result from that. So, one wonders whetherthere would be the basis for what is, in terms of percentage rates ofincrease, a pretty sizable rise in residential building.My final concern has to do with net exports. Although thosecharts that Ted Truman presented are very calm, I think there is avery real possibility that there won't be very much recovery abroador, if there is much recovery abroad, that there won't be thefinancial capacity to hold up exports to some countries like Mexicoand Canada that are important to the United States. Indeed, given theprice of the dollar, the price of equipment purchased in this countryis now so high that it seems unlikely that we would do very well inthat area.So, if we did have greater weakness in plant and equipmentcontinuing in 1983, a failure of residential construction to recover,and a further deterioration in net exports, or more than forecast, Ithink that constitutes sufficient basis for thinking that the recoverymay falter before too many months have gone by. If it does, and doesso in an environment where interest rates have stayed high, I'm surethat the financial distress that the bankers are worried about will bewith us in spades. It's very difficult to forecast. So, as I see it,that's our hazard. The question that I have is how we should plan aposture for monetary policy that will minimize the very real risk of atrue shock to the economy later on--probably not until 1983. I'm notsure; I'd rather hear other peoples' reports", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, since I agree with Lyle'spresentation, let me try and answer that last question, or at leastgive my personal view on it. My own view is that we should say thatwe would tolerate a modest or limited overrun in view of the NOWaccount behavior, that is NOW account funds not acting as transactionsmoney. The reason I think we should choose that rather than either ofthe other two options--rebasing or raising the targets--is first ofall that raising the target a half point to 6 percent target implies aprecision that is almost ridiculous, given the possible swings invelocity in the second half of the year. If we were seriouslyconsidering 6-1/2 percent, that might make more sense. But I don'tsee the point of changing the targets a half point when I think itwould be more consistent and better received in the markets if wesimply indicated that we would tolerate a modest or limited overrun inview of the NOW account behavior.Stepping back, I think it's worth mentioning that ourforecast is significantly different from Jim's. We have significantlyhigher real growth in the second half and significantly higherinflation. We are almost 1-1/2 points higher on real growth, at 3.9percent, and almost 2 points higher on inflation. We think inflationwill be about 7.3 to 7.5 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No, for the second half of '82. TheBoard staff has inflation coming down steadily from the secondquarter; it drops from 6.1 to 5.7 percent in the third quarter andthen drops again to 5.4 percent in the fourth quarter, whereas wethink it will be around 7-1/2 percent in the second half of the year", "MR. BLACK. [This week M1 is] moderately down. I hope thatwhat the staff now forecasts is what happens; in that case I don'tthink one can say \"well above,\" but I don't know whether that[projection] really will hold up. I recognize the possibility thatthis burst in M1 may well reflect unusually strong demands forliquidity on the part of the public or it may be partly a reflectionof the unusually sharp drop we had in interest rates toward the end oflast year. But it's at least equally plausible that it has resultedfrom our having put out too many reserves, as I think John Balles'memorandum suggested very cogently. We're now in a situation, ofcourse, that to stay within our targets we're going to have todecelerate the rate of growth in the aggregates. And that puts usbetween a rock and a hard place. But even though it isn't a verycomfortable choice to think about having to slow down the rate ofgrowth in the aggregates somewhat from where they've been, I think itwould be a serious mistake to raise the long-run targets. It seems tome that the key to the sustained recovery has to be an improvement inthe financial conditions of the business sector. And I don't reallybelieve we're going to get that unless we have an improvement in thelong-term capital markets--a reduction in long-term rates. And asyou, Mr. Chairman, and others have stressed very well, we have acommitment to lowering our targets gradually over the long run to getthem to a noninflationary rate. If we were to move the targets now,as Larry's survey suggested, I think most people would interpret it asan abandonment of our stated objective. And such a change in thepublic's perception of what they think we're doing could postponeindefinitely the strengthening in the capital markets that I think weso urgently need. So, I would opt very strongly for retaining ourpresent targets and hope that we don't overshoot them. So far as nextyear is concerned, my inclination is to cut those ranges by about 1/2percentage point", "MR. KEEHN. To start first with the economic situation: Mycomments are repetitive of what I've said in the past and repetitiveof what we've already heard. The situation in the Midwest continuesto be very, very serious. I keep reading about the recovery that isgoing to occur but I am coming to the view that it is something we allhope will come but perhaps may not. Indeed, I'm beginning to have alurking suspicion that we could be on the front edge of something muchworse than we realize. Virtually all of the sectors in the Midwest[economy] are continuing to deteriorate. The capital goods figureswere in the paper. All the major companies are continuing to reviewtheir capital expenditure programs and each review results in afurther curtailment. The steel industry is operating at a capacitylevel not seen since the 1930s; that speaks for itself. In theagricultural sector, the situation is a touch better on the livestockside but not on the grain side. And the farm implement manufacturersreally are in a very, very difficult state.-12-6/30-7/1/82So, my comments, regrettably, are unchanged from what I havesaid before; indeed I think things are a little more serious. One CEOperhaps summed it up best by telling me the other day that in his viewthe situation is terrible, that it is getting much worse, and that anattitude of fright is now beginning to spread over the businesscommunity. I think perhaps we have a new problem, though I admit it'sa bit anecdotal, in that I'm hearing some comments from variousbankers that I've talked to about the buildup in problem assets. I'vebeen astounded by the increase in total loans that has taken placethis year in the face of the recession that we're dealing with. Ihave just a hunch that there are a lot of loans that are, to use theeuphemistic phrase, desperation loans, and that we could be seeingsome nonperforming assets resulting in some losses. Summarizing mycomments about the District: The situation is very, very serious.With regard to our strategy, unless I were to hear some veryspecific definitional and structural reasons to change our targetsthis year--and I haven't heard them so far--I think that we are theonly credible game in town and that to change the ranges this yearwould run a very significant risk. I would leave the ranges this yearas is, but I would certainly aim at the high side and wouldn't be theleast bit upset if we were to miss or go over. Looking ahead to nextyear, in light of my comments, I think to reduce the ranges for nextyear would be a very serious step and I certainly would be inclined toleave them just where they are", "-14-6/30-7/1/82MR. BALLES. I think she means we've never changed--I don'tbelieve we have--by making a midcourse correction in a rangetentatively announced in July for the following year. We have neverchanged that", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You were so indifferent to M1, youdidn't care", "MR. MORRIS. Yes", "MR. MARTIN. I would join those of us around the table whohave pointed out the downside risks when we consider a consumer-ledrecovery. I think we are all aware that the consumer is in a verydifferent frame of mind and financial frame of reference than he waspreviously. It's all very well to indicate the improvement in theliquid assets of consumers as a group; but in terms of consumer demandfor durables, we're likely to witness in the latter months of thisyear and in 1983 the factor that Governor Partee brought out, whichcan be built on a little. When we talk about residential building andthe financing thereof, I would take no exception to his comment. Butwhen we think about the mass of consumers--those tens of millions ofconsumers who already have mortgages and trust deeds, many of whom forsome years have been in the habit of refinancing those residentialmortgages and pumping that money into durables not to mention trips toEurope and kids going to private schools and a lot of other goodthings--those same people are witnessing the cocktail partyconversation now about how much so-and-so lost when he was transferredto Boston or whatever. And they are finding that that source of fundshas definitely dried up. In fact, there are others within that groupof consumers who are having difficulties now meeting the [higher-cost]refinancing that is being imposed upon them. And as that kind ofconversation wafts its way through suburbia, not to mention exurbia,-16-6/30-7/1/82the tendency is to build up those good old precautionary balances andto have a liquidity preference that is a bit different from what itwas when one could go and get $15,000 or $25,000 on the residentialmortgage. I'm not so sure that those precautionary balances are goingto be translated into spending and that we can count on the projectedchanges in velocity.Indeed, as the shocks that Lyle and others mentioned hereoccur--and we don't need to attach a probability to failures of majorcorporations and failures of major financial institutions in thecountry because I think those failures are a certainty and will beexaggerated by the media--the effect on the consumer of these shocksis going to be significant. Talk about a multiplier. This also saysto me that there are implications not only with regard toprecautionary balances held by consumers on the one hand and businessfirms possibly on the other, but it has implications for the kind offinancial climate that we maintain--a liquidity climate oravailability climate, if you will--for the economy in general giventhat individual crises will be magnified at a time when consumerpsychology and attitude are important. And it seems to me for us toskate too closely to constraint or to usual or historical norms wouldbe very dangerous.So, to the extent we can do so without upsetting the markets,I lean in the direction of liberality. In terms of the question ofovershooting versus raising the targets, I think we have to realize--again thinking in terms of what the consumer understands and what hedoes not understand--that there have been improvements in the controlof inflation. The consumer does not understand the [technical]matters; if you start talking to him about velocity, he becomes veryglassy-eyed. I think the consumer can understand that if we raise thetargets, we may be liberalizing [policy], and he may feel that's a badthing. I don't think he will ever understand our explanations,however well expressed by anybody--excuse me, Chairman--about theovershooting phenomenon. I'd lament the raising of targets; thatwould communicate something we don't want to communicate. But I thinkwe can explicate the overshooting process on and on and have goodreasons and understand that it is more acceptable. I hate to see uslocking ourselves into what we should call bracketmania or targetmadness so that we raise the targets and then say okay we raised them,now [we have to] make them. I hate to see us overstress the targetingas such and would rather see us have the flexibility of saying surewe're over, or yes we're under, and here are the reasons", "MR. CORRIGAN. On the economy, Mr. Chairman, I made aforecast that looks like everybody else's, and the fact thateverybody's forecast looks essentially the same is one of the thingsthat worries me. I think it suggests that none of us knows what isgoing to happen. I do agree with all that has been said on the-17-6/30-7/1/82downside risks: I think that's where the problem may lie. But thereis at least a tinge of a different interpretation one could put on allthat has been said, and that is that we may be losing sight of thefact that in all of this there are also some things that have occurredin the fairly recent past that aren't all bad. The inflationimprovement is no longer just a statistical aberration; it's veryreal. We have a situation where in my judgment, for the first timeperhaps in the postwar period, businesses are really looking atthemselves. They are not just going through the superficial aspectsof counting noses and cleaning house in the conventional ways. Beyondthat, I think we do recognize that the consumer has done a reasonablejob of getting his balance sheet in order. There's the prospect, ifwe're right about a near-term recovery, that at least thedeterioration in corporate liquidity in a statistical sense couldmoderate.Fundamentally, what I am suggesting is that in all the doomand gloom there are some elements that with a break or two might bodevery well for the future rather than all being on the down side.However, I do agree that the downside risks are there. And they allcome back to the question in some simplistic sense of the way to alterthe balance of the risks that everybody has talked about. It seems tome to reduce to the proposition of: How do we get interest ratesdown. That's the one thing that would alter that balance of risks. Idon't want to sound too agnostic on this score but my sense of thingsis that jiggling the money supply and the ranges that we're talkingabout jiggling either in real terms or in target terms isn't theanswer. That is not what is going to get interest rates down. Theinterest rate problem, as I see it, is a combination of anexpectational phenomenon partly growing out of the fact that thereality of lower inflation has not sunk in--and maybe we shouldn'texpect it to have sunk in this fast--but more fundamentally acontinuing reflection of this overall Federal budget situation. Ithink a great opportunity was missed a couple of months ago and thatmiss was very visible in the eyes not just of Wall Street but of MainStreet. Regardless of whether the number is $140 billion or $160billion, the sense on the budget situation is that it is in factdeteriorating. And it's very hard for me to see how, given that andthe other factors I've mentioned, there's a lot we can do in jigglingmonetary policy that really is going to get at that fundamentalproblem in the near term of lowering interest rates, which again Ithink is the only thing that really can alter the balance of risks.Taking that into this strategic discussion about the targets,let me do it backwards by looking at 1983 first. I very plainly wouldcome out in favor of leaving the 1983 targets where the 1982 targetsare, across the board. I would do that partly in the context ofsaying that there is more than the usual amount of uncertainty. But Imight also suggest, depending upon what we do for 1982, that keepingthe same targets for 1983 might well produce a situation in which theactual growth of money in 1983 is lower than in 1982. But I certainlywouldn't be disposed to do anything now other than restate for '83 thetargets from '82. Now, on the question of the '82 targets, I do countmyself in the camp of those who would say: \"Let's stick with what wehave.\" I say that for a couple of reasons. First of all, I amwilling to put my bet on the proposition that we will get some rise invelocity in the second half of the year. I say that partly because Ido think that some of that NOW account activity could wind down; and I6/30-7/1/82also would suggest that the kind of velocity increase that we wouldneed to achieve in order to see the economy behaving something likeJim's forecast isn't all that big. If we had 5 percent money growthin the second half of the year, that would leave us in pretty goodshape vis-a-vis the M1 target", "MR. BOYKIN. For 1983, I would differ from Jerry. I would beinclined, much as Bob Black was, to reduce the ranges a little for '83with a very clear understanding that whether that would hold or notwould depend on developments and would be firmed up at year-end", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. One point on flexibility between thepreliminary figure given in the testimony in July and the figureadopted next February is that it's always easy to go down a halfpoint; it's a lot harder to go up a half point if we put ourpreliminary target a half point lower", "MR. BOYKIN. Well, in terms of our stated long-term objectiveof a gradual reduction in the growth rate of money, this is anextremely critical time. That's very obvious. But I don't thinkanything has occurred to this point that should deter us from thatover the long term. And I would have some concern if we were givingpreliminary signals that it may not be the thing to do at this point.But depending on what happens between now and next February, if thecircumstances certainly indicated that we shouldn't reduce the rangesor should maybe even raise them, I think it would be much moreunderstandable and much more justifiable. The credibility issue is6/30-7/1/82extremely important. I'm inclined to give quite a bit of weight tothe perceptions problem myself", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know that I can answer thatquestion and I'm not sure it's appropriate to ask", " Well, I don't know what--MR. WALLICH. What is $600 million going to accomplish,granted that we owe them good relations and have ongoing relationshipswith them. They need nearly twice that a month. And if they don'tget money from any other source, particularly until late in the year,I don't see how they can avoid either a devaluation in very chaoticconditions of inflation already, default on the debt, or exchangecontrol", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know what is going to happen withregard to the flight of capital. As I say, in some ways it'ssurprising that they haven't had more before the election. There isthe theory that after the election there will be some reflux. On theother hand, one can make the argument that nobody thought anything wasgoing to happen before the election, so the capital flight will comeafter the election. So, we can speculate about everything. But interms of your general vision, I don't know how to do this, but allthose bases have been touched", " Even though $700 million is not going to solve theirproblem and they understand why we're pushing them toward the Fund,which would solve their problem, they--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, of course, even that is a[unintelligible]. The amount of money involved from the Fund isn'tgoing to solve their problem either", "MR. WALLICH. It is a very broad political objection in LatinAmerica. They are not at all positive with respect to the IMF, to putit very mildly. So, I don't think the president, either this one orthe next one, has a great deal of leeway. He has to face a hostilepolitical opinion", "MS. TEETERS. You mean the reason the Administration is so[unintelligible] is because of our seasonal adjustment program", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It doesn't make such a dramatic changelast year. The major change is basically that it has a biggerseasonal adjustment factor for the first month in a quarter and asmaller one, or the reverse, for the second month in a quarter. Thechange is less in July than in these other quarters, but it issignificant in July too", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Of course, the further back you go, justtheoretically, you would expect it to make less improvement becausethe seasonal is adjusted as it gets later information. Allowing for abulge or lack of a bulge or whatever, depending upon which way youlook at it, obviously creates problems in setting a path for the nearterm. So, I guess we have to discuss two things: What kind ofgeneral growth we would like to have ideally in the next 3 months; andhow to handle the uncertainties surrounding this year's seasonal andother impacts and why. What", "MR. AXILROD. I was going to add only one thought, Mr.Chairman, which is that I don't know if it's clear that alternative Ais the one that would be more consistent with a decision to run at thetop of the present ranges or with possibly raising the present ranges.All of the alternatives are consistent in a sense with anything theCommittee decides for the long run; the fourth quarter can always beadjusted. But alternative A is more consistent--even more so with thedownward June revision--with running closer to the top. Andalternatives B and C, of course, would be more consistent withretaining the present ranges and an effort to run growth down withinthe range rather than close to the top. Those were all the comments Ihad, Mr. Chairman, apart from the Bluebook", "MR. AXILROD. I don't have the new M2 figures, GovernorPartee, but the effect on M2, if nontransactions don't change, shouldbe roughly one-fourth the effect on M1. In answer to GovernorGramley's question, for M1 we have not quite 1 percent higher growth-396/30-7/1/82from the new lower June base; at the present [level] we've projectedfor September, M2 would be about 1/4 of a percent [higher]", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'm very happy, as most of youmight suspect, by this revision in the June M1 figure. If I'vecomputed it correctly, this will allow us to bring M1 by September tothe top of the upper band without having to slam on the brakes. Thefigure that I've computed from June--and what I'm doing is using theMay figure for June since we're assuming a zero rate of growth--would allow us to hit the target while letting the money supply growat 4.6 percent. I think that gets us out of the dilemma I suggestedwe were in yesterday--being between a rock and a hard place--becauseif we did that, it would preserve our credibility by coming in at thetop of our target and we wouldn't have to say that we deliberatelyplan to overshoot the target, which I think would be [ill advised].At the same time, we'd be aiming for a higher rate of growth in M1than we appear to have gotten over the last three months, so I don'tthink we'd have to risk any severe tightening in money marketconditions and the dangers that might entail. So, I would urge verystrongly that we aim to be at that top part by September, and I wouldtake whatever M2 figure Steve thinks is compatible with that. I'mguessing that a borrowing level of about $900 million might be aboutright and, as usual, I would like to widen the federal funds range.Just in case July is wild, I'd like to be able to go to 17 percent andthen hope like the devil that we didn't have to [go that high]. Atthe same time, I'd like to reduce the lower end to 10 percent and hopethat we get a better performance than we expect in July and could letthe funds rate come down", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, it sounds to me like too low a growthrate, if June wasn't absolutely right, but I may be wrong", "-42-6/30-7/1/82MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I do not have my calculator and Ihave no doubt that I would fail to operate it if I had it, so I willnot get into the billion dollar question. I would be in favor ofkeeping the [current] targets for the balance of 1982. I would be infavor of a relatively passive form of implementation of our policy sothat if we miss the upper limit of the target by September--in duedeference to my colleague, President Black--I would not be concerned,provided we went along the course suggested by Governor Teetersyesterday. One of her suggestions yesterday was to be more explicitwith regard to our attitude of tolerance so that we remove from themarkets fears and premonitions or the expectation that we will becoming on hard to bring the [monetary growth] numbers down, which willproduce certain interest rate impacts. The reasons for my positionwith regard to the upper limit of the target came out, as was obviousto all of us, in the discussion yesterday. It is the downside risk;it is the unusually high degree of uncertainty; it is the peril thatcorporations and financial institutions confront; it is the greatuncertainty of the international situation added to all of these. Andas the Chairman has indicated, it will be 6 months or 8 months or Xmonths before the Congress begins to resolve a $60 to $70 billionswing between estimates of the deficit.I view ranges and targets as tools. My own experience inbusiness and government has been that you use budgets and targets andranges and brackets in your work. And in the real world, either ingovernment or outside it, those targets, brackets, ranges, objectives,and goals are usually missed by whatever organization it is. Themature individual understands that these are tools and not the sacredwrit. Now, I don't have any great insight as to whether velocity willgo up enough or not enough. Frankly, I don't believe anybody elsehas. That is again a reason for my thesis of tolerance of resultsrelative to goals and targets. I think we should keep our targets forthe balance of '82 at this time and we should operate in a moreexplicit, but relatively passive, mode for the upcoming period", "MR. MARTIN. I think a 4.6 percent increase [in M1] is notenough. I'm not sure that a 5-1/2 percent increase, as in alternativeA, is enough. It might be enough if indeed July has a certainconfiguration. So I would go for alternative A, but I'd be quitetolerant if alternative A were exceeded", "MR. ROOS. Chuck, may I inquire, sir: If we make a strongstatement in reference to interest rates, doesn't that imply asignificant departure and doesn't that signal that once again we aretrying to balance interest rates and aggregate growth", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, just so I don't appear to be toomuch of a Simon Legree, may I say that I'm just as interested ingetting rates down as anybody else but I differ on the method fordoing it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Isn't it only 6/10ths, if this othercalculation is right", "MR. AXILROD. Well", "MS. TEETERS. Well, I can't even tolerate a 15 percent upperlimit, as Chuck can. I think 14 percent is outrageous in thesituation we're in. I would much prefer a cap of 14 percent and saythat we are not going to go above it. We've had enormously adversereactions over the past couple of weeks as the rate has edged back upto the 15 percent level", "MR. BALLES. I indicated yesterday in the preliminary go-around that as I look back a year ago or even six months ago at whatwe were expecting and forecasting, it's clear that the economy is inpoorer shape in terms of real growth and unemployment and that we'rebetter off than we had hoped on the inflation side. That's really thebasis on which I rationalize my departure from our longer-term programof gradual diminution of monetary growth. I feel now that wedeliberately ought to plug some countercyclical considerations intoshort-term policy, that is, for the 3 to 6 months ahead. And it's onthat basis that I am in favor either of announcing an increase in the1982 range or permitting a modest overshoot, maybe up to a point. Thedifficulty with not announcing it or at least saying that we're goingto tolerate an overshoot is that if we have an overshoot and themarket doesn't hear us say anything about not correcting it, they aregoing to assume that we will correct it. And that sets upexpectations of a tighter policy in the weeks and months immediatelyahead. They will be anticipating some action by us to tighten upagain. So, we're in somewhat of a box on that score, Mr. Chairman.If we don't decide to increase the '82 range formally, I think we haveto go in the other direction, which a number of people mentionedyesterday and which I also find satisfactory, of indicating ratherexplicitly that we do anticipate some modest overshoot and thus bythat action remove anticipations that we are about to tighten", "MR. MEEK. It's a little confused", "MR. PARTEE. Yes. Because I agree there is going to be arecovery, but my concern is much, much deeper than that. I believethe recovery may be very wishy-washy and that it may be followed by acollapse. And I think we ought to have a point at which we say: Thisis it for the time being and we're not going to tolerate--tolerate istoo strong--but we would not expect the funds rate to tradeconsistently above 15 percent", "MR. FORD. Are you implying that there wasn't a change inOctober '79. If I understood you, you said it would be similar topre-October '79--that there is precedent for it", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, if I had to cloud my mindagain by thinking about M1, I would support Governor Gramley'sformulation. While I sympathize with Governor Partee's general pointof view, I think it would be a big mistake for us to announce that wewere willing to peg interest rates again. One thing we've learned inthe last few years is that the presence of an intermediate target formonetary policy has sheltered the central banks--not only ourselvesbut the Germans said the same thing at that meeting in New York [asdid] the British and the Canadians and others--from a direct sense ofresponsibility for interest rates, and I think that has contributed toa stronger policy posture. To begin, even in a little way, to backaway from that would be a serious mistake strategically. And while Ithink we're following the wrong intermediate target, I believe itwould be a big mistake to start doing without one", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What do you mean we're following awrong intermediate target", " Yes, but what they do, Preston, is that theysit down and figure out the rate at which the money supply has to growfor the last six months and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My sense is that that argues against [yoursuggestion], Nancy. One can argue it any way but if we say that's abig number, then we have a problem. If we say it's a relatively smallnumber and in fact we overshoot it, we're right back into thatcalculation. If we're a little vaguer, we avoid that arithmetic or wetry to avoid the arithmetic. We never avoid it", "MR. GRAMLEY. Do you mean that if in July we appear to begetting a bulge of over 9 percent in money supply growth that youwould adjust the nonborrowed reserve target upward unless there weresome indications that this growth was being generated by astrengthening in the economy. If what happens is that the amount ofborrowing goes up and interest rates go up, then that is notaccommodating in the sense that I would use the word", " The 9 percent now becomes a biggerincrease for the monthly average for July than it did when theBluebook was actually written because we're starting so low with thesame--MR. BLACK. About 11 and a fraction percent, I believe, iswhat we figured out", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My only difference with you is that we maybe in really big trouble, but I don't think it's going to involve adifference of 1 percent in the growth rate from June to September", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We're lucky it isn't a dromedary--adouble hump", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. If we were squarely on thetarget in June, 5 to 6 percent would be something like the right thingto say. It just says we're going to stay right around the upper endof the target", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One way of playing this is to set theborrowing level slightly below $800 million. The more we go below,the more it increases the risk that we might have to reverse itinstead of opening up room for coming down further quickly if thingsdevelop in a satisfactory way", "MR. FORD. The point of this quote is that we always realizetoo late that we put in too much stimulus. So, I feel strongly thatwe should never set a cap on the funds rate at right where it is. Wehave to allow at least for a little change. We're talking aboutputting it at 15 percent when it is already--maybe for window-dressingpurposes--right around 15 percent. We have to give ourselves someroom to breathe on rates and not give people a formula to work withwhich would allow for a very rapid expansion when we may regret itlater. So, I'd be more cautious. I'd set the borrowing at over $800million and put a wider range on the funds rate to include somethingabove where it is", "\"MS. TEETERS.

If you're going to wait toconsult until the fed funds rate gets up to 16 percent, I'm not happywith that", "That would be an unchanged--MR. GRAMLEY. There's another good argument for keeping itwhere it is. It looks awfully funny to me, if we're in a meetingwhere we are trying to make sure that we adopt a directive that doesnot countenance increased interest rates, to raise the upper end ofthe federal funds range.

Let me just say that I think what we were saying implicitlyearlier-- explicitly but implicitly tying into the resolution--wasthat there was great skepticism. We can say we welcome any restraintthat that resolution signifies or will result in and we encourage theaction in that respect, but we have a good deal of skepticism orquestioning at this point. It could be put more strongly. Or putmore politely there was no assurance, if I may put it that way, thatthe budgetary figure was going to come in at $104 billion orthereabouts next year. Part of that to be sure was a reflection ofdifferent economic assumptions; part of it was not. But certainlythere was some concern over the net result of the resolution. It isconstructive in the right direction but a concern was expressed by anumber of people about the budgetary outlook. Now, anybody else cansay anything they want to say. But explicitly we haven't adopted anyranges as a matter of fact. This is further background discussion forthe final [decision].

Thealternative of continuing on the course of a monetary restraint-91-6/30-7/1/82discipline in the face of these kinds of budget deficits hascatastrophic implications for the capital markets, for businessinvestment, for the thrift industry, for small businesses, and forfarmers.

TEETERS. But there is no final action. We don't knowwhat they're going to come out with so we're left literally in limboas to what next year's fiscal policy is going to be.

Again, those GNP comparisons are interesting;but the one that just hits me dead between the eyes is that 50 percentof the total credit flows in the economy [will be taken bygovernment]", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I have no doubt that interest rates arehigh. What I'm questioning is why. My theory is that I have a hardtime explaining the level of short-term interest rates as a phenomenonassociated with the deficit. Now, the long-term rates clearly are,and there is some crowding out from that standpoint because of theexpected future interest rate impact of this deficit impinging oncurrent investors", "MR. GRAMLEY. I don't find that argument at all convincing.The reason why long-term interest rates are high is because investorsare reluctant to buy long, so they buy short. And we're transferringthe credit demand as well as the supply into the short-term markets.So, I don't see why that should have an effect on short-term ratesexcept to the extent that the fear of deficits is generating increaseddemand for the aggregates that the Federal Reserve controls. And tothat extent, yes, one can explain high short-term interest rates thatway except that a central bank which recognizes what is going onpresumably has the option to increase the growth rate of thoseaggregates to take that into account. So, on net, I end up saying thefear of the future deficit causes high long-term rates now but I'm notsure at all that it should affect short-term interest rates", " I would--MR. GRAMLEY. I certainly might. I would want to keep myoptions open. I think that could have a major effect on expectedinflation rates and, therefore, on current interest rates. It couldhave a major effect on demands for the monetary aggregates because ofwhat happens to the level of interest rates and expected inflationrates. I would want to keep an open mind to the possibility thatcomplete and thorough resolution of the budget problem would give usan opportunity to follow a more expansive monetary policy. I grantHenry's point that in the long run what determines prices is the stockof money, providing one makes sufficient assumptions about thecompetitive character of the markets and so on. But I'm afraid thatlong-run period exceeds my term as a Governor; so, during the periodwhen I'm here, I'd like to think about adjustments", "MR. ROOS. What is the purpose of our response. Is it reallyto offer an intelligent guide to these fellows on Capitol Hill or justto get a response done. I think they are not asking for economicanalysis; they're playing politics", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but when Paul appears to testifyhe may be asked what the reaction of the FOMC was", "MR. WALLICH. You may get a technically oriented questionalong these lines: If stimulus is withdrawn through a lower deficit,is the reduction in interest rates that follows from that sufficientto counter that withdrawn stimulus. And you'd have to stretch a pointconsiderably in order to say yes. You really have to assume thatinvestment is enormously responsive to a decline in interest rates forthat to happen. So, on a temporary basis, one cannot deny that areduction in the deficit generates some reduction in expansion. Butthe difficulty of getting back on track with monetary policy is alwaysthe primary thing. And the fine-tuning that we can do for a half-yearor a year seems to lead us back to where we used to be", " I'm not even sure about that, but I--MR. GRAMLEY. There's another way of approaching it, which isto say that we have to base monetary policy on the assumption of areasonable fiscal deficit, which does not involve excessive crowdingout and which is, therefore, in the neighborhood of, say, 2 to 2-1/2percent of GNP. Accordingly, that's the fiscal policy assumption thatour monetary policy is based on. Now, automatically, if the Congressdoesn't hit that kind of reasonable fiscal policy, then monetarypolicy bites harder. And that reminds Congress of where itsresponsibilities are. I'm only saying that half seriously", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who's passing the buck.

And at this time I think either verysoft language with regard to not changing the target ranges oractually saying something about lowering the targets by 1/2 pointmight instill more confidence in the market", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I have a little problem, which Imentioned in my own testimony, in that someday this velocity may notincrease so rapidly. If we had, let's say, 5 percent [M1 growth] nextyear--which may turn out to be right and it may turn out to be lowerthan that--that assumes, in order to get any kind of economic recoverynext year, that we have to have a higher-than-trend velocity figure.It would have to be well up into the ranges of what we get with a goodrecovery and rising interest rates. I gulp a little at this stage insaying that that is necessarily consistent with even the projectionsthat we have, in the light of all the uncertainties that exist aboutthis. We sit here and imply--if we want growth above 5 percent, whichI guess is what you're saying--that we have to have about a 4 or 5percent increase in velocity through the year to get real growth in7/15/82 -5-the economy of 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent.

I must say, even though there isn't alarge difference, that I think Bob Black's language implies a muchgreater willingness by the Fed to \"cave in,\" so to speak, if there isa liquidity problem in the economy, whereas what we are saying is thatif the velocity of circulation is less than what it normally would bebecause of precautionary demands as well as demands for money andliquidity, we will factor that in.

[Statement--see Appendix", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's ratified. I didn't mean to shutoff any questions, but let's discuss Mexico. Who is going to presenta proposal here--Mr. Cross or Mr. Truman or me", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you say no small banks. I thinkthat's an obscurity. The banks don't want many [current bank lenders]to be paid off, that's for sure. When there are a thousand plus banksout there, the problem is: How do you control them all. But if verymany of them wanted to get out, the whole [deal] might blow up.That brings me back to the swap line. I forget just where wewere when we talked on the telephone but there was an agreement inprinciple in Basle early last week for [official loans totalling] $1.5billion, meaning $750 million from the United States and $750 millionfrom the other countries. Those countries are insistent upon abasically equal sharing that does not take account of the $700 millionof new money we already have in there. The $750 million consisted ofamounts as high as million for Canada and Japan, million forthe United Kingdom and million for Germany. Then the amountpretty quickly drops down to million for essentially allthe rest of the G-10 countries. I think they're all in, aren't they.Well, with an exception of one or so, that was tentatively agreed on.The reason it was $1.5 billion was that that was all the Mexicansasked for, even though they think they need more. Mr. Silva Herzog,the Finance Minister, sort of clinched that by saying in histelevision address in Mexico that he was discussing $1.5 billionbecause he wanted to put a figure in his speech and he didn't want toask for more than he knew he could get. That was the explanation, Iguess. But once the Europeans heard that, they said no more than $1.5billion but with some understanding, at least among some of them thatI've talked to, that the Mexicans might have to come back for more.Now, subsequent to that and subsequent to our conversation,the Bank of Spain, or the Spanish authorities anyway, who did notattend this meeting in Basle have volunteered million as agesture of good will to their Spanish-speaking brethren in the NewWorld. That is the biggest single amount that any country has come upwith. They have had a swap agreement with Mexico, and apparently thatswap is more meaningful than I might have thought, or so they haveinterpreted it. So that would bring the European amount up to $925million and they want us to match it. I have, of course, discussedthis with the Treasury and they have agreed to put up $600 million.That leaves us with $325 million if we fully match [the othercountries]. The idea here is that we will all go in together. TheEuropean side will be done through the BIS, and the BIS is technicallyputting up the money with various kinds of support from the centralbanks or the governments. We will not be in that technicalarrangement, but the understanding is that we will provide the moneyin parallel to their providing the money. They don't have the samedegree of flexibility that we do in timing because they have to raisethe money in the market, and they like to go by a schedule and havesome warning as to when they're going to put up the money. They justcan't sit there and say \"How much do you need this morning.\" and putit up the way we can. But the understanding at this stage is thatthey will put it up in three tranches, and this is deliberate so thatat no time are we providing much more money than the Mexicans need.And we will put it up with a mutual understanding, which will bewritten into our swap agreement and into the Treasury's swap agreementand reflected in some way in their agreement, that this money will be8/24/82provided over the coming weeks as they need it but with an option onour part to evaluate the wisdom of putting up any amount of money inthe light of progress on negotiations with the Fund, with languageabout looking toward an agreement with the Fund by the middle ofSeptember. You may have some exact language there that you canprovide, Ted, but that's the general concept. We may not put up ourmoney dollar for dollar with theirs, because theirs will come inlumps. We will put it up as it is needed from day to day and theEuropeans won't come in with a second tranche until we catch up withthem on the first tranche or maybe exceed them by a few milliondollars. And then they will come in with a second tranche and we'llcatch up with that and proceed in that manner so that Mexico at notime will have any very great amount of money in the bank while we areobserving progress with the Fund. What is that language you have orthe nearest approximation you've arrived at now, anyway, Ted", "MR. PARTEE. Paul, I just want to raise a difficult issue andthat is the question of quality of credit. The Federal Reserve istraditionally concerned about the quality of the credit that itextends. At the discount window we require collateral and we takehaircuts on bonds and that kind of thing to be sure that we havecollateral. We have sometimes said that we would not lend to aninstitution that was no longer solvent, although that's a very iffymatter and I'm not sure that that has much point. But I do make thepoint that we have been very careful in the administration of thediscount window as a traditional matter to see that we were wellsecured. In cases where we were approached for lending in specialcircumstances, such as in the case of Lockheed or New York City, we'vebeen reluctant and we have said that it had to be bridge financing.In the case of New York City in particular, I recall that we said wecouldn't see the other end of the bridge, but it was bridge financingwithout much, really, in the way of meaningful collateral that NewYork City could ever put up. In the case of the other swaps in whichwe were engaging, I guess we have always felt--although we neverreally tested it--that the countries were solvent. In the case ofMexico, one of the things that disturbed the Committee when itconsidered [establishing] the Mexican swap was the question of whether8/24/82at some time or other Mexico would get to be in financial difficultyand there would be some question about the quality of the swap", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I forgot to describe the collateralside. I think the fundamental point is the one you just made: Noneof this is going to work unless there is a good [economic] adjustmentprogram. And it's going to have to be a very draconian adjustmentprogram. I think we have to recognize the full extent of thelimitations on that program, which I'm not in a position to judge,certainly at this stage. I'm not sure that anybody can judge how muchthe country can take. A country can have a fine-looking draconianadjustment program but if the country goes up in revolution, it willbe unsuccessful. And I'm not sure the Mexican citizenry is fullyaware yet of what has hit them, to say the least. But that has to bethe fundamental backstop of any credit. We have labored long over thecollateral issue and there aren't any terribly satisfactory answersbecause Mexico doesn't have that much collateral. But there areanswers, satisfactory or not. The idea of this is that our presentswap will remain secured, if that's the word, by a Fund agreement thatdoesn't exist yet. But if it does come into existence, our swap willhave first claim on it. This second loan--and the proposal is thatthis would be a separate swap--will be secured along side the BISarrangement with the remainder of the Fund drawings as they areavailable over time. I guess we have the gold [collateral] byimplication. They are willing to pledge $250 million in gold, whichdoesn't go very far, but there it is. And by some assignment yet tobe worked out, oil revenues are an ultimate backstop if nothing elseworks. Ted, maybe you're more up-to-date on that negotiation than Iam. The BIS people are in Mexico City discussing that now", "MR. BRADFIELD. The arrangement that has now been worked outbetween the Bank of Mexico and the BIS as far as a direct assignmentby debtors, that is to say oil companies, is that Exxon and other oilcompanies in the G-10 countries [will assign] to the BIS an amount inexcess of what would now be $1825 million of the total amount of thecredit extended. The assignment would be substantially in excess ofthat amount, somewhere around $2.5 billion in total", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm not so much worried about theMexicans, but the Europeans will not really understand why we were sochintzy if we come in $25 million short of the 50-50 match. Ipersonally would put in for it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The only consideration I can see on theother side is that we will be discussing this with the Europeans inToronto, I'm sure, and I can see how things go. If they have reallyshut off the principal payments on their loans, this should be enough,particularly if we want private banks to come in. But there's alwaysa possibility that there will be a need for a few hundred million morealong the line here someplace, so I want to warn you about that. Butthis should be enough as I now see it. Well, I'll put itconservatively: The calculations now assume that they get a prettyfull rollover from the private banks; assuming that the private banksdo come in once there is a Fund agreement, this should last themthrough the Fund agreement if that's successful. And after the Fundagreement in principle, at that point if the banks come in for somemore, I do not see that we're going to have to put up any more.That's my judgment at the moment, but I would not promise you that theMexicans are not going to run out [of dollars] during the next two tothree months", "MS. TEETERS. Do we get paid back equally with the BIS. Isthat the idea", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, out of the same pool equally", " Of course, if oil prices decline--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

PARTEE. That's right", "MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix", "]MR. ROOS. Jim, this follows the gist of your comments on[output]. I noticed that in the Greenbook you have reduced yourestimate for real output growth in the third quarter from about 2-1/2percent to 1 percent. In your analysis, was the slow rate of M1growth over the past months--I think this has an effect on thedecision we make later--a factor that led to your conclusion", "-15-8/24/82VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We wouldn't have any difficulty withthe direction of your analysis, but we are assuming an essentiallyflat third quarter, not as strong as 1 percent. We also are assuminga lower average federal funds rate in the fourth quarter. You'reassuming 10-1/2 percent; we're assuming 8-1/2 to 9 percent. If wedon't get something in that 8-1/2 to 9 percent region--if there is asignificant back-up in rates in the fourth quarter--then we think thefourth quarter, instead of showing 2 to 3 percent real growth, mayvery well be negative. So, I think the difference is possibly in theassumptions. With your assumption [of the funds rate] at 10-1/2percent, you still assume roughly 2 percent real growth in the fourthquarter, whereas our analysis would be that if rates back up to 10-1/2percent, that is likely to result in a negative fourth quarter", "MS. TEETERS. Jim, did you really factor in the sharp drop inrates that has occurred in the last six weeks.", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, we tried to and we have put down ourassumptions. The interest rate assumptions appear in the Bluebookand, as you know, they are trending up later this year and into 1983.One of the questions one has to ask is: To what extent does part ofthe rate behavior reflect concerns that wouldn't track into spendingin the economy but rather a flight-to-quality, looking at bill yields,for example. That seems to me almost a sign of weakness, notsomething that says those low rates are going to translate intosignificant gains in spending later on. The one area where it israther important--and it's an open question--is in the mortgage area.That FHA rate, as of today, is down to the 14 percent level. I thinkthat's encouraging. But in our forecast we don't have privatemortgage rates coming down that low; in fact we have them stuck in the14-1/2 to 15 percent area, which we think is still an area that wouldnot generate substantial levels of housing activity. So, the outcomein the staff forecast is one in which we don't believe the currentlevels of rates would likely be sustained, given our assumptions onmonetary policy and our outlook for the economy", "8/24/82VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That was partially because there wasa higher increase in savings than we expected and partially because itwas offset by greater weakness in the rest of the economy than weexpected. I personally feel that the more pessimistic scenario--inother words, continued weakness--is quite likely if there's a back-upin rates. And even though there will be some modest increase inconsumer spending, I don't think it will be enough. Whereas if theaverage federal funds rate stays in the 8-1/2 to 9 percent area, Ithink we're likely to get the kind of real growth of 2 or 3 percentthat we're talking about", "MR. PARTEE. One terribly important question is how weak iscapital spending. The staff has reduced its estimates quite a bit,but the forecast is for equipment spending still to be rising by themiddle of next year I believe and for the decline in nonresidentialconstruction to be moderating by the second half of next year. Thequestion is, if there's a major cycle there, whether it will go deeperor whether it will turn around that rapidly. And the Redbook seemsvery pessimistic on capital spending to me. I don't know if thatrepresents your views or not. In Atlanta you are looking at one setof exceptions; you saw a little strength recently", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Anecdotally, what I hear in New Yorkis very pessimistic on capital spending. Just last week a fewbusinessmen told me they had made further cutbacks in their plannedcapital spending, and those plans had already been quite low", "MR. ROOS. I find myself in the pleasant posture of agreeingwith Tony and the others in terms of the ultimate objective. I thinkwe should avoid a continuation of slow money growth. But I'm a littleconcerned about the thought of our attempting to lean against afurther drop in interest rates because I think that would imply afurther slowing of money growth. Money has grown exceptionally slowlyover the last five months and, at the risk of analyzing something in alittle different manner than some of you do, our experience prior toevery recession that we've had since World War II is that when moneyhas grown below its trend rate for two or more quarters it inevitablyleads to a softening in the economy and to a recession. Even a ratherunsophisticated set of eyes such as mine can see that this has beenthe experience. And although none of us knows what the future holds,I have a great fear that if money is permitted to grow slowly forseveral more months, we could have a serious weakening in the economyat the end of this year and into the early part of next year. If thatwere to happen, we could have a revitalization of the criticism thatwe have been too tight. So, I would certainly favor alternative A,-20-8/24/82but I would not be quite as concerned as one or two others haveindicated about acting to prevent a further drop in the fed fundsrate. I think doing so would exacerbate the undershoot of growth inthe narrow aggregate", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to risk disagreeingwith anything that has been said up to now. I certainly want to seeinterest rates low, and for that reason I'm inclined towardalternative A. But at the same time I want interest rates to staylow. And I worry that if we follow alternative A in the face of theGNP forecast that we have, the implication is that interest rates areprobably going to go back up in the very near future. There are goingto be upward pressures. In order to keep interest rates down, we'rereally going to have to increase money growth substantially above thetarget range. Now, I wonder if we want to do that. If we increasemoney growth for the year to above, say, 6 percent, I just wonder ifwe are willing to accept such an outcome. If we are, then fine,alternative A is a good way to go. If not, then it seems to me thatwe're going to have a fairly strong back-up in rates. And the effectof this I do not welcome. Since the difference between \"A\" and \"B\"seems to me to be unusually narrow this time, I could go just aseasily for alternative B. But I am prepared to go along withalternative A. It's rare that I'm in such a happy position as tochoices", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin", "MR. KEEHN. Between the two alternatives, I certainly amemotionally pushed toward alternative A because, given thecircumstances in the Midwest, I think we want to do everythingpossible to encourage and sustain lower interest rates and to try toimprove the outlook for the recovery. I have to admit that I am fargloomier than the staff forecast with regard to the outlook for boththis year and on into next year. Having said that, I find the shiftin the implied growth rate for M1 between now and the end of Septemberunder alternative A just a little abrupt. And if we run into a periodduring which M1 begins to grow, I wonder whether we won't have toreact in a way that would cause rates to back up. So, though [thedifference between] the two alternatives is fairly narrow, I mightcome down about in the middle between the two, just to split a finehair even finer. I'd suggest that M1 growth of maybe 6-1/2 to 6-3/4percent would be appropriate so that we can see how it goes betweennow and the end of September. With that a fed funds range of 7 to 12percent and a borrowing range of $300 to $350 million would beappropriate", " I was going to ask you how you reconcile this--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Anybody else want to say anything. It'sup to me", " I think it's going to be read--MR. PARTEE. It's giving the Chairman all the authority; thatis what it amounts to. It gives the Chairman all the authority; Ithink the Committee renounces its responsibility if it accepts such athing. Given the two choices, I would much prefer 7 to 10 percent [onthe funds rate range]", "MR. MORRIS. Yes, I don't see anything wrong with setting a 7to 10 percent range specifically. It's still 300 basis points. It'snot cast in stone that we have to have a 400 or 500 basis point-30-8/24/82spread, and it seems to me foolish to have one that we don't plan touse", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't like this idea of 7 to 12 percent,which gives a public impression that is different than the privateone. I'd have a little difficulty defending it. I don't know as ithas become a big issue of why we said 12 percent in the first place onthe credit conditions.SPEAKERS(.). Yes", "\"MR. MARTIN.

Right now the fedfunds rate is 9 percent and we're talking about a period of six weeksbetween August 24th and October 5th. Are you really saying that youwould define market conditions as volatile if in six weeks the fedfunds rate went up by 2 percentage points from 9 to 11 percent", "MR. PARTEE. Bill, I think you're still talking about thewording in that suggested alternative. The trouble with \"volatile\" isthat it means different things to different people", "MR. MORRIS. And 300 basis points is not managing interestrates. When we managed interest rates we had a 50 basis point range", "MR. CORRIGAN. I started out liking it, but I'm getting moreand more gun-shy about it. I'm not sure it's the right way to go", "MR. CORRIGAN.

Otherwise, therewill be a lot of speculation as to what \"unusual volatility in creditmarkets\" means and some further stimulation to the belief that we areputting monetary policy on the back burner. Whereas if we say 7 to 10percent, they will know that we just don't want too much movement inthe period ahead", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Well, you have had a description, on thetechnical side so to speak, of the money situation, the marketsituation, the government securities market, and the general stabilityelsewhere I suppose it's fair to say. In terms of the generalbackground, my own conclusion--and anybody can comment on this alittle later--is that it is clear that any sense of economic expansionhas been delayed. Immediate signs of economic expansion, apart fromas a matter of faith, are sorely lacking. Investment is declining andis going to decline for some time. The atmosphere, if anything, seemsto be weakening, and survey data seem to show a weakening.Consumption is rather flat; there is no sparkle to it and that's the[sector] we have to look to for expansion. It is a situation withsome risks, looked at it just in terms of the internal economy.As I look at what is going on abroad: The problems of Mexicohave in no way cleared up; the problems of the rest of Latin Americaare clearly being compounded by a general economic slowdown andrecession; there are very few signs of life in Europe; and there's aweakening, if anything, in Japan from an already not very strongsituation. One gets the same sense [abroad as here] of where therisks and concerns seem predominantly to be at this particular stagein development.I think we have a pretty good record on the inflation sideand, on balance I suppose, things seem to be getting more entrenchedthere. The weaknesses in the financial system remain very evidentboth internationally and domestically although I sense--and Petermight want to comment on this--that there's a little less feeling ofpeople being right on the edge of their chairs in the financialmarkets this week [than there was] maybe two weeks ago. But they arenot very far back from being on the edge of their chairs. There isstill a lot of differentiation in markets; there is still a relativelycalm and easy situation in the central money market, which has a senseof calming things, but a very uncertain, nervous atmosphere iscontinuing.To get to the point, in the end, I think this is a situationin which I would not find a mechanical application of the reserveprovision rules suitable, given the certainty that that would lead toa decided change on the tightening side from recent money marketconditions. In terms of what seems desirable, that runs against anyother broader background that we see going on. I feel that at leastfor this brief period before we actually meet in a Federal Open MarketCommittee meeting, which is about a week and a half off, or sevenworking days off, we should not follow--and I would not intend to--amechanical application of those reserve provisions but ratherstabilize market conditions somewhere close to where they arepresently or even slightly below where they have been in the lastcouple of weeks", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just throw in a quasi-fact withrespect to the outlook. The Rinfret survey, which is the first surveyof plant and equipment spending that comes along--I don't know whatreliability our experts would put on it--shows steeper declines thisyear and next year than anything that has come out so far", "MS. HORN. Your feeling is that if we were to stay with thenonborrowed path, that would perhaps drive fed funds rates up toward11 percent or above"], "1982FOMC19821005meeting.txt": ["MR. CROSS. The Argentines have been mentioned a great deal,and currently they have an IMF [team] down there looking toward thepossibility of a Fund program for Argentina. They also are seekingsome assistance from the BIS and from commercial banks. TheBrazilians feel that they are being [adversely] affected largely bythe spillover effects of the Mexican and the Argentine problems. Fora period they found it very, very difficult to roll over theirmaturing debt, but more recently they sounded a bit more encouraged[so] that situation looks a little better. But you're quite rightthat there are a number of these very difficult situations, withmonetary troubles in the period [ahead] for a lot of countries downthere", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

In New York we have 17Brazilian agencies and they have been having difficulty getting newdeposits or getting people to leave in the foreign deposits. We havea liquidity problem here because, like the Mexican agencies, most ofthat money was used to finance Brazilian borrowers, either public orprivate", "MR. PARTEE. Did you say you have 17 Brazilian agencies,Tony. Is that right", " By discussion on the part of some of the dealers atthe Desk or by--MR. STERNLIGHT. [Unintelligible] from the market who havewritten commentaries and from discussions with market participants", "MR. BOEHNE. I have a question. Your forecast and almost allthe forecasts have a phrase in them that says something like: \"Theconsumer is going to lead us out of this recession,\" and economiclogic would suggest that there's something to that. However, when Italk to people who are in the consumer business--retailers, forexample, and bankers who are in the consumer loan area--they hear thatstatement with almost disbelief. The attitudes both on the part ofthe sellers, and it seems the buyers, are pretty sour. At least inthe northern part of the country, one hears a lot about sellingblankets and heaters and worries about oil bills and gas bills forwhat is supposed to be an unusually cold winter. My real question is:How do you weight these attitudinal factors versus the real factors.such as the tax cuts and personal income increases and so on. I thinkhow one comes down on that says a lot about what one's forecast is", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, I certainly wouldn't make it the mostprobable outcome. Our forecast represents our highest probability[outcome]. But for the near term, and let's view that as over thenext quarter or two, there are clear downside risks in that there isquite likely to be a negative [GNP] number in the third quarter or anegative number in the fourth quarter, and one might classify that asa triple-dip. I wouldn't say the same if I were to take a bit longerhorizon, particularly over 1983. I'd just like to say that in thefirst year of recovery in the postwar period we've had rates ofincrease of real GNP on the order of 7 to 8 percent. The staffforecast is for 3 percent. It is 3 percent for good reason. Butlowering that number, I think, begins to get a bit risky on the downside. It's very difficult when the economy, hopefully, is near thebottom of a recession to spot the potential sources of strength, butfor now it seems to me that there are clear risks on the consumerside. On the business investment side, while we have had a majordownturn in this cycle, it could very easily go weaker. So, I thinkthe short-run risks are on the down side", "MR. BALLES. Jim, one other question, if I can follow up onthat: As we look back to, say, last spring--I haven't really checkedthe record so this is strictly my recollection but it is reasonably10/5/82clear--your forecast, our forecast, and most private forecasts wereconfidently expecting an upturn in the third quarter. Month aftermonth has gone by and we haven't seen it; I still don't see it. It'sstill a forecast and not a fact. Do you have any insight into whathas delayed that widely expected and anticipated upturn", "MR. BALLES.

I'm a little paranoid--I guess Ihave been for most of my life with the Federal Reserve--that everytime something comes up that casts some suspicion on M1, there's anawful lot of readiness to bury it. Does our policy action todayrequire that we do something that's a significant departure from theway we've been doing things. Couldn't this matter be studied andcouldn't we have a summit meeting if necessary, a la Jerry's[suggestion], prior to our next meeting of the FOMC to see what thebest brains in the System think will be the result of the DIDC actionand everything else", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think there will be a tendency amongsome to pay a money market funds rate plus; the question is whetherthe market gets driven there. I'm just guessing. Among other things,we approved what I think of as the \"bucket shop relief regulation\" atthe last DIDC meeting, where an institution can broker all of thismoney. So, we'll have people advertising all over the country. Thesewill be insured deposits and people will keep it with the guy payingthe highest rate. And that will tend to force the rates higher. Iwould think there would be two tendencies initially: To pay a moneymarket funds rate plus, or to pay something related to the Treasurybill rate. My guess would be that the bill rate fellows might getforced higher. In a tight money situation, I would feel ratherconfident of that result.

And I might say that I commend you all: Idetected no leaks after the last meeting. We are discussing obviouslyhighly sensitive subjects in this particular meeting and I can'timpress that too strongly upon you. I'm talking about some of theseinternational financial problems, especially their domestic ones. Anyone of these things can be blown by inadvertent comments. There isdiscussion going on, particularly with respect to Argentina andYugoslavia, of central banking monetary authority packages. The-19-10/5/82question is whether those packages are big enough for the situation inboth cases. As I said, they are in negotiation with the Fund.Yugoslavia has been operating under a Fund program, but it's a rollingone-year [credit]. The third year of it is under discussion at themoment. These are in theory governmental matters and in ourinstitutional structure more appropriate for the ExchangeStabilization Fund than for the Federal Reserve. I think the Treasurywould say that, too. But they have concerns and limited amounts ofmoney, and at some point I think it's possible that we will have tomake a decision within the confines of this room as to whether wecontribute to them too, simply in order to get the money big enough.And that raises issues that we have not had to face before--exceptperhaps marginally in the case of Mexico. I don't know if it's goingto come up; I hope it doesn't. My position is that it should not comeup. On the other hand, I cannot exclude it, given the nature of theproblem", "\"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me say in that connection--and Ishould have said it more clearly before--that I think this situationis manageable. In a very big sense, I think we are on the verge ofvictory in what we've been trying to do. It's a delicate situation,but it's also a very risky situation", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, the current ones are under discussionwith the BIS but there is the inherent management difficulty of theseproblems. There are very substantive economic problems and,underneath that, social problems and political problems. But from themanagement standpoint, the difficulty is that there are so manyactors. Mexico is the extreme case, but it's only a more extremeexample of reality. In Mexico, we are dealing with 1,100 banks orsomething like that. When you're dealing with that many banks aroundthe world, not just all over the United States but all over the world--and I mean banks you've never heard the name of in [Saudi] Arabia orthe Far East or wherever--getting all those banks to sit in the canoetogether is a little difficult. The same problem exists when dealingwith the BIS or in any cooperative international effort. There are alot of actors. They don't all understand the problem in the samedegree and they all see a little different self-interest in thesituation. I think almost all the central banks recognize some commoninterest in seeing an overall solution to the problem, but they have alot of individual interests, too, and getting them all to negotiatetogether is difficult. Everybody wants all the countries in; that'sthe tradition. And we get into this ridiculous situation where acountry that is putting in $12-1/2 million has the same voice as theUnited States does. That's a bit of an exaggeration, but there isthat kind of problem. They are all dealing with their owninstitutional structure. No central bank wants to touch thesesituations in the sense of a traditional central banking operation.They all would take the same attitude that we probably would take:It's a governmental problem. And some of them have institutions to doit and some don't. In virtually every case the central bank has moreflexibility in the short run than the government; some governmentshave none. Some central banks may not have any. We have this kind ofproblem, of course. The U.S. government itself is like dealing withfour different countries. But you multiply that and the difficultybecomes geometric, I guess, even when we're only dealing with 10 or 12countries. It's obviously important to get not just a facade but thereality of some international cooperation in these things--not justbecause of the money, which is significant, but because of the general-21-10/5/82feeling of solidarity, a common problem, a common approach, and allthe rest. And the banks, of course, are distributed among all thesecountries, too, including some countries that are not involved, and weneed the support of the central banks in dealing with their own banks", "MR. WALLICH. I'm sorry. I feel like turning it around andsaying it is a sufficient but not absolutely necessary condition.

To answer your question: I don't think there's anywillingness in this government to try to get the exchange rate valuedown in terms of levels. Given Paul's talks with the Secretary [ofthe Treasury], there may be a tad greater willingness to be in themarket on days when there are surges but not a [willingness to]sustain the effort, I don't think, to get the level down", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My mental image of the business world isthat those that are profitable are sitting on cash. Those that arenot profitable are being squeezed", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I did. I gave him a much strongerlecture than probably was politic. He apologized but gave me theargument that it's a catch-up because their workers' wages had fallenbehind. I don't know how true that is", "MR. CORRIGAN. With all this understandable talk about Mexicoand all the rest, you didn't say a word about small banks at the otherend of the spectrum. But I think it's relevant to this generalconversation. We started about four or five months ago carefullymonitoring the small banks in the Ninth District. The monitoringtakes several forms, including literally getting an instant picture ofan examination the minute it is completed, and we are compiling listsof one-bank holding companies [in difficulty]. The criteria that weused was that if a one-bank holding company will consume at least 75percent of the bank's 1981 earnings to meet its debt servicerequirements in 1982, it is on the list. It's really striking, to putit mildly, to see the number of institutions that fall into thatcategory in the case of the one-bank holding companies. The number issubstantial, and that of course assumes that they have the equivalentof 1981 earnings to work with in the future to meet these debt servicerequirements at the holding company level. With the problem loans andthe loan losses and this new instrument and all the rest, one could atleast question the proposition that they're going to be able to retainthose earnings. Similarly, in the case of small banks, at least theones that seem to be scattered around the Ninth District, it's notuncommon to see that the classified loans in the recent examinationversus the last one are up anywhere from 200 to 500 percent. As ofyet most of that increase is in the commercial sector and the MainStreet retailers. There is not yet a major increase in the problemloans reflecting the agricultural sector itself. But one has towonder how long that can last, given what is going on right now.The other thing that I would observe in terms of these smalland medium size banks that I think is directly relevant to what wassaid earlier is that it is rather astonishing to me to see the extentto which these regional and small institutions have money placed inthe London market. There are very logical and natural reasons whythey should do that, and certainly we don't want to chase that moneyout of there right now. Nevertheless, it is a form of exposure evenin these banking organizations that ties in with this internationalsituation and goes in many cases well beyond our general perceptions", "MR. ROOS. This would mean that we would set no targets forM1.[Secretary's note: The draft directive wording circulated atChairman Volcker's request did not include a target for M1", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, but we can put in something like:\"The unemployment rate in August was unchanged at 9.8 percent butthere were some indications of a deteriorating labor marketsituation", "MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, why would this be preferable tocontinuing to specify the target for M1 but putting in a disclaimer orat least the warning that M1 might behave in an unusual manner and ifthat occurs, we would reserve the privilege of adjusting itaccordingly. I'd prefer that for the sake of continuity. If weignore M1 totally, despite the explanations that are given, I thinkpeople could read sinister purposes in it; it would make base driftpale in comparison to dropping one of our important targets totally.I'd rather see us say that we're doing this but it is somewhattentative due to what might happen on these new instruments. Toignore M1 would really run the flag up that in some people'sperception we are making a basic change. There is still a significantamount of debate between Frank and me and others; some of us thinkthat M1 is not as unreliable as others do. I just think to drop itwould look as though we've really retreated in that regard", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Eleven percent is also unacceptable to me", "MS. HORN. Mr", " Chairman, this indicates your dissatisfactionwith the way we handled it last time--that is, to have a target thatwas sensitive to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I am totally dissatisfied. What wedid last time was unacceptable to me. I just want to make that plain.I think we made a mistake last time. I think we would not have sodifficult a problem psychologically this time if we had not done whatwe did last time. It wasn't that big a mistake in some sense. Butit's unfortunate that we ended up at this meeting with the federalfunds rate and private rates about 1 percentage point higher than theywere at the time of the last meeting because we had a high M1 figurein September. That was the only reason it happened", "MR. FORD. What you are saying quite plainly, if I hear youcorrectly, is that you think rates are too high now and you don't wanteven a tiny increase from the present rate of 10-1/4 percent on thefed funds rate. You don't want it averaging 11 percent", "MR. FORD. I want to say, respectfully, that I'm flatlyopposed to this. If we were to do this, especially now, I think itwill consolidate any adverse opinions against us that are already outthere about our motives for doing this at this particular time. At abreakfast meeting with the leading bankers in Atlanta 72 hours or soago, at which Mayor Young was the guest of honor speaking to us, hevolunteered in front of all the bankers in the room a comment--we werediscussing the city's problems--that he was instructing his staff toissue some municipal bonds immediately in order to do a certainproject in the city of Atlanta. I said: \"What's the rush about this,Andy.\" And he said: \"You guys are going to change policy right afterelection day and now is the time to do it.\" This was Andrew Young.I've heard from more people than I care to describe to you commentsquestioning our integrity and our motives in the context of anelection campaign", "MR. WALLICH. We have made that switch, though not quite asexplicitly; nevertheless, we've made it from time to time. We haveplaced more weight on M2 at times", "MR. GUFFEY. Let me first of all say that I agree with theproposal that rates shouldn't go higher, that they should be in someway capped from this point forward for some period of time. Indeed,they should be urged to come down, not precipitously but in a modestway, over the quarter. But having said that, I look at the languagethat you have put before us and am trying to equate that with what thestaff has in the Bluebook. It seems to me that the 8-1/2 to 9-1/2percent range for M2--or at least the \"A\" proposal [of 9-1/2 percent]--and then the caveat in the last sentence would suggest that we willtolerate growth above that given some perception of liquidity needs orotherwise. I'm suggesting that in my view at least--and I will ask aquestion of Steve in a moment--that probably will result in ratescoming down immediately following this meeting, depending upon how webuild the path. And I would hesitate to associate myself with thosewho would want a fast drop in rates. If that's not a correctassessment, I would like to ask Steve: How would you build your pathfor the reserve objective based upon this kind of language. And whatwould you expect to happen within the next two weeks. That is rathera critical period for us", "MR. AXILROD. Well, at the 10 percent discount rate, if youhad a borrowing of $200 million, just to take an example--I'm notsaying it should be at that level--I would not expect the funds rateto get as low as that. It would be more like 10 percent or a shadeunder. Peter may have another view", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we are all in agreement on only onething, I think: that we would like to see interest rates come down.I would like to raise the question of whether it might not bereasonable to suppose that a little resistance now to the strengthwe've had in the aggregates might not save us from a bigger move lateron. We have engineered a pretty sharp reduction, almost 400 basispoints, in the federal funds rate from its level back in July.Historically when we've had that [kind of decline], we've had anexplosion of the aggregates. And if that does happen--though, of-37-10/5/82course, all of us hope it doesn't--we may find ourselves in a positionwhere we are going to have to move against that. We have justfinished a discussion of countries that have delayed taking wise stepsand they have gotten to the point where they have to take very drasticsteps. I have a whole collection of quotations from members of theBoard of Governors who have stated very eloquently that this is thepoint at which we've lost it, usually, in the past", "MR. MARTIN. I would join with Governors Partee and Teetersin the view that the impending recovery is probably not as projected,given today's interest rates. I would call your attention to therather heroic assumption, in current dollars, of the recovery inresidential structures quarter-by-quarter running between plus 24percent and plus almost 40 percent. Given today's interest rates andtoday's lack of liquidity in the financial system, I simply don't feelthat those are obtainable growth numbers. If that's part of theconsumer leading the recovery, it is not likely to occur. Much moreimportant is the weakness in business fixed investment; it is toostrong as projected. The first thing corporations have to do is toreliquify themselves; they're going to have to raise $20 billion or$40 billion or $60 billion in a very short period of time. Andthey're not likely to be able to do that in an economy with the degreeof liquidity it has today. It appears that there are notuncertainties anymore but fear out there in the capital markets. Partof it is derived from the international situation but a good deal ofit is the awareness of the precarious nature of our own privatecorporate sector in this country. And I think the need forreliquification extends very obviously to the thrift industry and tothe small banking industry as they face the changes that need to bemade there. But to get back to business investment, which I think isgoing to decline more than our projections show, corporations facevery low returns on investment after taxes despite the efforts of theCongress to change the depreciation and the cost recovery situation.As we know, the recently enacted tax revenue measure has taken backhalf of the benefits, plus or minus, in that area. So, we face anextended period of weakness in business investment.I think the best thing we can do is to bring rates down andhelp reliquify so that sometime out in 1983 or even 1984 we will havea recovery in the private sector. I would support a temporary movingaway from an M1 target. I believe that is consonant with maintainingour integrity as a central bank. We would be making a real mistake ifwe become too mechanical in the application of a policy in a multi-trillion dollar economy. So, I would like to see this directive,perhaps with the Corrigan codicil adding language pointing toward thereduction in the growth of the money supply over time. I would alsolike to see a borrowing level of $200 to $300 million with a verbal10/5/82directive, if you will, that interest rates be brought down, but in agradual way, echoing a previous comment here. [Unintelligible] thatwe temporarily target interest rates and that we be overt and candidin our specifications", "MR. BALLES. After the November meeting. I don't think wecan wait that long", "MR. WALLICH. The last sentence. Instead of starting with\"Somewhat more rapid,\" I would say \"In the light of mounting evidencethat economic and financial uncertainties are continuing to lead toexceptional liquidity demands, somewhat more rapid growth in thebroader aggregates would be tolerated.\" So, we allow for an overshootof M2, which is the one thing I would suggest that we target", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It could be up", " As you look at the behavior of velocity overthe year, it does not--MR. GRAMLEY. That was a good argument last April, but I'mnot sure it is now", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles, I have you on the list, butyou have already commented. Or do you have something more", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will respond to that shortly, after Mr.Roos and Mr. Morris get finished with their comments", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It has moved us very quickly most ofthe way to the deregulation that we expected by 1986. I think we havea real dilemma here today. On substance, I feel that we absolutelyhave to have some modest decline in rates. I believe there is a realdanger of a major cracking and then we would have to go even farther;whereas with a modest decline now that stays in place for a whilethere is a better chance of working ourselves out of this bothinternationally and at home. I recognize that there will be a gooddeal of questioning, not only in monetarist circles but moregenerally. I don't think there will be an avalanche of criticism,given our credibility, but there will be major questioning as to whatthis means in terms of longer-run anti-inflationary policy. And itseems to me that there ought to be some words [to convey] our longer-run commitment and our expectations that inflation will continue tocome down--and possibly they should be just in the Chairman'sstatements and other statements, not in the directive. I don't knowhow to do it in the directive without sounding defensive, but thereought to be some words about that.So, I would support this. I do feel that if one reads thiscarefully, we are really not targeting M2. We are targeting basicallymoney market conditions and we are saying that we expect this willinvolve growth of M2 in the range of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent.Therefore, I'm not sure that we really need the last sentence. Thelast sentence simply makes more explicit what is there quite carefully[unintelligible]. I don't see that the way this is written, with theexpectation of M2 growth of 8-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent, is a constraint ondoing what is necessary to get the operative sentence. And if I amcorrect in my interpretation, I don't see why we need that lastsentence. In that sense, I would agree with Chuck", "MR. PARTEE. But I also would drop the operative sentence", "[Lunch recess]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This need not be taken as strikingly assome people either fear or hope, depending upon which side of thespectrum they are on. I don't consider anything in here veryinconsistent with what we've been doing. We have said we are going tointerpret the aggregates somewhat loosely in effect--I'm nowinterpolating--in the light of our judgment as to whether there areunusual precautionary demands for money and liquidity. The market hasassumed we are operating that way quite comfortably and this is anextension of that idea. What it does is to take out M1 for a veryparticular reason. I raise the question because there is this talkabout how to say it publicly. If we write a letter to the Congress,for instance, and say we've changed the targets or we have some newoperating approach or some such thing, I think that makes it much moregrandiose than is intended in my mind. I am reluctant to have aspecially called press conference or a speech or something for thesame reason. It just makes it sound as if we're off on some entirelynew course. I think we have to get the message over publicly that,indeed, we're not going to be worried about the M1 figure in the shortrun, if we're not. We have in effect said--and we are repeating andamplifying what we said--that we would tolerate for some period oftime growth somewhat above the target range should unusualprecautionary demands for money and liquidity be evident. Going backto my testimony [in July], I know I had a lot of criteria--theperformance of the economy, interest rates I deliberately put in, theavailability of bank credit--all of which I said bear upon that-53-10/5/82judgment. That's what I said in the testimony. We think, yes, allthose things are operative now and we are willing to tolerate a bulgein the targeted growth if that is necessary in this time period. Itis precisely the circumstances that we foresaw as a possibility. Idon't think it's that big a deal. Other people put otherinterpretations on it. I just tell you that I don't think it has tobe read as too big a deal. In any event, assuming that we are in thisgeneral neighborhood, let us pin down the operations morespecifically, which comes down pretty much to the initial borrowinglevel, I think.

I would not overestimate the precision ofour control technique on M1 either, but there is no doubt that itlooks more strained when we are doing it this way. I was going tomention later, but I will just mention it now, that we will have apaper prepared for the Committee looking toward the targets for nextyear. It will not be primarily on the control mechanism, although itmay get into that. It seems to me almost certain now that [as aresult of DIDC actions] we shortly will have a full transactionsaccount with a market rate of interest. We are very close to that nowanyway, and we'll have another account. We may have very close totransactions accounts without any reserve requirements on them. Wevirtually have that now. It raises all kinds of questions both aboutthe impact this will have on differential growth among the aggregatesand even total growth of the aggregates during some perhaps lengthytransitional period. And it also has a bearing on the controlmechanism. I don't think we can solve those problems today; I'm surewe can't.

Like Jerry, I've talked with both lendersand developers and found from them the first sparks or glimmerings orvery preliminary indications of some recovery. But we have to putthat into the changed institutional framework in which the lenders andthe developers and the sellers of existing housing now operate. Oneof the positive indicators, of course, is the substantial upswing inFHA applications. That is a positive, but those FHA applicationsgenerally deal with housing, in submarket by submarket, that is at thelower percentiles of the housing market. It would be difficult tohave a 1.3 or 1.4 million housing start number based only on thatsegment of the market. It would be difficult to have that kind ofrecovery in housing from the 800,000 to 900,000 level unless existinghome sales revive and continue to support the month or two upswing innew home sales. The question is whether even that one or two monthincrease in new home sales will persist. The question is where thefinancing is going to come from to handle the need for the financingof the foreclosed properties--and they would be foreclosed if theydidn't have to be shown in certain asset categories of the thriftinstitutions and the commercial banks. That kind of financing, ofcourse, is taking and will continue to take first priority overadjustments and accommodations to the regular borrower. I note thatthere is a question about the thrift institutions with this marvelousnew account, which is primarily a transaction account and will belooked on by their managers as a short-term source of funds. Do wereally expect them to make 30-year fixed rate, fixed term loans with 5or 10 percent down. That kind of contract is going to be what ittakes to get to a 1.3 million level, supported by some multiple ofexisting home sales of 5 million or whatever it takes to support the1.3 million. I don't see it that way", "MR. BALLES. Just to reinforce what Governor Martin wassaying on housing, the forestproducts industry, one from one of the biggest firms in the West, saythat there indeed have been signs of a little pickup. Translatingthat into what it means for 1983 as a whole, they are still prettybearish in the sense that 1.3 million would be about as much as theyare looking for in new housing starts. And in a broader sense thatindustry is still in the doldrums because of what the foreign exchangebusiness is doing to log exports; that is a very, very severe blow.And finally, the pulp and paper business, which is another importantleg of that industry, is really in the doldrums. So, at least in ourforest products firms, I don't find any great optimism these days.If I could finish with a question, Mr. Chairman, I'd like toask a question of Ted Truman, at the risk of repeating what perhapsalready has been said, which I didn't understand. In view of what hashappened to interest rates in this country, with lower nominalinterest rates at least, is there any good reason you can think of whythat darn exchange rate is not only hanging up there but gettingstronger", "MR. BOYKIN. Well, I would pretty much be where Roger andJerry are. My overall reading of the Eleventh District [based on] ourown internal forecast that we've just gone through at our Bank isslightly more optimistic certainly than the Board staff's forecast. Idon't know how much of this is hope. But I see things that I findvery hard to understand. This is strictly anecdotal, but with regardto housing, Sunday afternoon out of curiosity I visited two housingdevelopments in Dallas. At one, the builder apparently was prettyoptimistic; he had just completed 10 specialty homes beginning at$375,000. And the crowds [were so big] you could hardly get in thehouses. I was impressed with that, so I went across the road toanother new development, and the lots began at $250,000", "MR. BOYKIN. The rig count has improved. There is a questionof whether it is a real improvement or seasonal for tax purposes andso forth. But the rig count is up slightly. On the other hand, theseismic surveys are not showing that much improvement, so it doesraise the question of whether it will hold", "MS. HORN. I suppose if I were grasping at straws to saysomething optimistic from the Fourth Federal Reserve District point ofview, I would say that the comments I've heard since the last meetinghave [conveyed] in some sense more confidence. But if one goes belowthe tone of the comments and into the statistics business people havebeen basing them on, in fact, the statistics don't seem to show anyimprovement in the capital goods industries. We hear about continuingdeterioration and backlogs, for example. And the farm sector is muchas several people have reported, in terms of what farmers buy andextremely weak land prices. But, in fact, the comments do seem tohave a little more confidence in them, perhaps really because peopleare now beginning to say that they are going to take market share awayfrom somebody else and somehow be at a competitive advantage ratherthan that they are seeing an overall improvement in the economy. Isee this as heavily reflected in the consumer sector in the FourthFederal Reserve District as in any other [sector]. But I could put anoptimistic face on what continues to be perhaps not a negative set ofdata but a stagnant to negative set of data in our District", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. One last comment I'd like to make isthat I met with a group of about fifteen business leaders, and thoseamong them who have been doing well in the last two years--three orfour of the fifteen--continue to do well. Those who have been doingvery poorly say they see the situation as absolutely flat; though itis not deteriorating further, they don't see any signs of recoveryyet. And I found it interesting that when I asked about salary andwage increases, all of them, including those who were doing well,talked about increases in a range from zero to 6 percent, with theexception of the New York financial community", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The wage increases that the New Yorkbank community expects to pay within the next 12 months were running 8to 10 percent, but the increases expected in the industrial communityranged from zero to 6 percent", " Don't we take off fromthat higher level and doesn't that give us for the year growth in thataggregate that is way above the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you talking about 1983", " I think that'swhat is causing these numbers--MR. ROOS. Well, I would see the effects of this on interestrates differently from the way Ed Boehne and Frank Morris perceivethem to be. Regardless of what we know about the behavior of theaggregates, there are a lot of people out there doing a lot offiguring. And if money--whether it's M2 and M1 or a combination ofthese various Ms--continues to grow at anything like the rate it isgrowing presently, even though that money growth is authorized as ameans of achieving lower short-term interest rates, I believe theopposite is going to occur, and I think it will occur very quickly.In other words, we will start to get articles and a reaction that willboost rates rather quickly in the belief that we will reinflate.Frank, I don't think we can turn this inflation [fight] off and on inany orderly way; people are still skeptical as the devil as to whetherwe are going to hang in there and keep our anti-inflationary posture.If we have three months or four months of really fast money growth, Ithink we will see these rates skyrocket instead of coming down", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with those whohave already suggested that we must find an appropriate interest ratelevel that will further our economic recovery. I'm not sure that-22-11/16/829-1/2 percent isn't it, but it certainly hasn't given a good signalyet that it is the appropriate level. That implies to me that weought to move interest rates to a modestly lower level, and that lowerlevel is, I suppose, something this Committee should decide. All thetalk about targeting reserves and looking at M2 for some informationalcontent as to what policy should be I think is a bunch of baloney inthe sense that we are targeting interest rates. And we ought torecognize that. In that context, I think there are a couple of waysto go. First of all, let me say that I am not suggesting that we doaway with or abandon the regime of targeting reserves and moneysupply, at least for public consumption. But around this table itseems clear to me that [we are on] an interest rate regime and weought to target on the interest rate we think is appropriate to getthe economic recovery started again", " Having said that--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think that's quite accurate,Roger, if I may interject. Speaking for myself, I would have lowerinterest rates if these aggregates weren't rising so darn [fast]", "MR. MARTIN. Would you", "MR. WALLICH. I, like everybody, would like to see lowerinterest rates. But what is the way to get them. The basic reasonthey are so high, I think, is indeed that the targets were too tight;they were calculated on the expectation of something like 3 percentvelocity gains and we've had the opposite. So there is less money in-26-11/16/82the economy than there should be unless this turns out to be atemporary situation, as it quite conceivably may. We have suspendedM1 temporarily; I think targeting on M2 is a good thing to state as aprinciple, but it's not a very easy thing to do operationally. Thebasic decisions we have to make are about the funds rate and theborrowing assumption. I think we have a certain degree of leeway asfar as departing from the targets is concerned. The market hasresponded, I think, very well to our statement that we weren't goingto adhere closely to M1. It hasn't had the effect of causing thelong-term rate to go up, which would be the interpretation of a strictmonetarist position; the long-term rate has come down. How long thiscondition will continue is a real question. Bob Eggert asked thisquestion of his forty economists and got a response that no doubtranges from 0 to infinity. But eliminating the [outliers], he arrivedat seven months as the period of time over which perhaps a departurewould be accepted by the market before people would begin to becomeuneasy and long-term [rate movements] would begin to become perverse.So, we have some leeway and we must make the optimum use of it. I'dbe reluctant to spend it all right away and reluctant particularly todo what the market seems to want and to expect us to do right away,which does look like throwing the book at the recession now. So, Iwould like to postpone a more drastic action and would go with \"B", "MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, the way I view the currentsituation is that I just don't think it's possible that the economycan stumble along at essentially zero growth for much longer. Thefinancial strains that are there just won't permit it. If we floataround zero for too much longer, with very little difficulty we couldend up in a more severe downside situation. It is clear from theinternational side that the LDCs need to generate some exports. Onthe domestic side, I suppose some consolation can be drawn from recentdevelopments in the financial markets but, underneath all that, theextremely serious financial strains are still very much with us. Myown bet is that, even with the current interest rate structure orsomething very much like it, the prospects for some growth in realterms emerging in early 1983 and getting up in a range of 4 percent orso are reasonably good. But at the same time, while that is my ownbet, I have to concede that the amount I'd be willing to wager at themoment is not much more than a nickel.There is another characteristic of the outlook for 1983 thatI'd like to mention, too. All the forecasts, of course, assume thatunemployment is going to stay high no matter what. I think somethingis going on that may make it stay even higher than the conventionalforecasts. And that is that a lot of businesses have really cut intotheir management and white collar work force during this correctionperiod, and I think they are finding that they didn't need all thosepeople. As we begin to see a recovery, that phenomenon is probablygoing to make unemployment stay higher than it normally would, whichsimply is going to add more fuel to the fire.Having said all that, in terms of the alternatives that arebefore the Committee, if I understood them or if I thought they meantanything, I would be inclined to alternative B. That may in one senseseem to contradict what I said earlier, but I don't think it reallydoes. Again, I'm not sure what any of it means, but the thrust of my-27-11/16/82position is that I would tend to be a bit on the cautious side rightnow, [given] the monetary growth that we are seeing--whatever thenumbers mean. The potential is at least remotely there that we couldfind ourselves facing a bit of a problem in early 1983. The problem,other things being equal, might even call for a slight increase ininterest rates. It seems to me that that is a total no-winproposition. That view is reinforced, at least in my mind, by thepeculiarities of the operating environment that we are in. If we haveto snug up, regardless of what alternative we are working from, giventhe way the path is drawn and the operational mode that we are in, thesnugging up process inherently is going to be slower and less precisethan it would have been under the former procedures.The last thing that is relevant, in terms of being a bitcautious, is this new [financial] instrument. It really won't hituntil December, but it seems to me that it is going to depress thegrowth of M1 when it hits; and on top of that it is going to produce ashift from higher reserve requirement instruments to lower reserverequirement instruments, which as that begins to happen would in turnmean that a given reserve path, however drawn, might have differentimplications for the amount of money growth, however defined, onemight have assumed in the first place. That, too, leads me to theview of being a little cautious among those alternatives. I wouldhedge my bet along the lines of Mr. Guffey's suggestion of putting theborrowing level down a bit from the $350 million that the staffassociated with Alternative B so that we could see a reduction in thefunds rate coupled with or followed by a reduction in the discountrate. I might even be prepared to go one step further. If fortechnical reasons, we aren't able to orchestrate that, I'd be inclinedto take my chances with a reduction of the discount rate even with thefed funds rate trading about where it is right now", "MR. ROOS. Do you have any uneasiness or any fear that if themarkets perceive the aggregates to be growing [rapidly], the movementin interest rates would be upward instead of downward. Is that a[concern] that should be factored into our decisionmaking", "MR. BOYKIN. In trying to balance the risks, the down side isvery frightening. There is a possibility, though, that there is alittle [risk] on the up side. Obviously I'm influenced somewhat by aslightly more optimistic view of where the economy is heading. Withregard to the lag effect, the argument has been made that we reallyhave not had time to see the full effect of recent policy actions. Ifind that to be a fairly persuasive argument [so] the cautionaryapproach also has appeal to me. I think we can remain cautious andnot take a very overt action at this point to deliberately try tobring rates down. So, if I were voting today, I would vote for \"B", "\"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me make a couple of additionalcomments. I gave you a finely balanced statement of pros and consbefore, I suppose. I have no doubt in my mind that we've had a changein liquidity preference. The argument is over how long that willlast, but it has lasted for five quarters. Well, I don't know if onecan say it has lasted for five quarters; the numbers always have bumpsup and down in a quarterly series.

The movementupward in interest rates carried with it a very substantial increasein the exchange rate, so we had a lot of negative effects on exportsfrom that.

I'm repeating myself, but there is a deepdegree of depression and feeling of disturbance in every otherindustrialized country", " It may not right away; we're going to publisha high borrowing figure this week, but I presume the funds rate--MR. MORRIS. It would take a cut in the discount rate,wouldn't it, to do something", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Short-term rates now generally areworking on the assumption of an 8-3/4 to 9 percent funds rate. Theydid not align even with a slight upward movement. As I understand it,at least from some of my banker friends, short-term rates are lowerthan would be indicated by a 9-1/2 percent fed funds rate", "MR. ROOS. If you count four or five months into the future,I'll be fishing and you all will still be wrestling with this. Butlet's assume that by forcing rates down a little you do achieve animprovement in the economy and this stimulus starts causing interestrates to rise next spring as this long-sought recovery is reachingmeaningful proportions. Yet money has grown so quickly that theprospect of inflation is heightened. Are you all going to be willingto apply the brakes at the time. If you don't apply the brakes atthat time, we're going to be right back into double-digit inflationrates in a few years", "MR. WALLICH. I would like to see that phrase removed", "MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I have one other point to make onthis directive. I'm a little concerned about the phrase in theopening paragraph that reads \"the reinvestment of funds from maturingall savers certificates and the public's response to the new accountdirectly competitive with the money market funds mandated by recentlegislation.\" The latter half of that statement really flies in theface, I think, of what is said on page 7, paragraph 9 in the Bluebook.It is made pretty clear in the next to the last sentence of thatparagraph--and I agree with what is said there--that the new moneymarket account will only have a small [quarterly] effect on M2 when itbecomes available in mid-December for the simple reason that it is notgoing to be around long enough in the fourth quarter. I tried my handat writing a slightly different version of a directive. I don't knowwhether this will help or hurt the cause. The bottom line is to takeout that phrase in the current proposed directive which reads \"thepublic's response to the new money market account competitive withmoney market funds mandated by recent legislation.\" I agree it isgoing to be a big problem when we get into the first quarter; I don'tthink it's a problem for this quarter", "MR. FORD. Paul, this really raises the question I wanted toask, which is based on your perception of the usefulness of M1. Ihave the feeling that in your mind M1 is permanently [distorted],especially in light of what the DIDC is doing [and] the all saverscertificates. If the consensus of the Committee is that M1 will neverbe used again, or at least not in the foreseeable future, then I thinkwe ought to come out and say it and see what happens", " Well, of course in January we have to specifyaggregates ranges, and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I know. What I'm concerned about iswhat we specify next year, because I anticipate that probably by sometime next year we will have full interest payments on transactionaccounts at least of individuals. I think we are hanging by a thread,frankly, in terms of having reserve requirements on individualtransaction accounts at this point. The new account is so close to itthat I can see the lobbyists saying we have this account, which ispractically a transaction account without reserve requirements, andyou can't go back and put reserve requirements on something that isonly marginally different from what Congress just told you to give uswithout a reserve requirement", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't want to nit-pick, but I don'tsee the point of deleting the words \"much less than usual weight,\" assuggested because the Fed watchers are going to wonder what thatmeans.

Well, let me talk about the public sidefirst. What is distressing about this to me is that it obviouslyaffected the markets and affected policy. Maybe we came out of it allright and maybe we didn't; I don't know. But it certainly gave riseto more dangers about misinterpretation of our intentions than I hadbargained for. I might also say that we had a leak--and maybe morethan one--about the Greenbook, as you know. I don't know whether itwas from the Administration or the Federal Reserve. I have heard allsorts of allegations from the market--they may be without substance,but it worries me every time I hear this--that there has been anoccasional leak of an M2 figure or an M1 figure, or whatever. I hopethat is wrong, but it makes me uneasy when I hear about it. Whatworries me, just looking ahead, is this lack of discipline--if I canput it that way. It's like the vultures going after carrion. Everyreporter in the world is challenged to make his own story, and thereporters who may have been involved the first time are all the morechallenged to keep it up. I think there is a tendency on the part ofany organization, for people to say \"Damn it. If somebody else isleaking, I'm going to talk to a reporter, too, and get my story out.\"Unless this is stopped, it's just going to cut us up.I am convinced that in a way it enormously complicates thepolicy problem because so much of policy is what people think it is orthink our attitude is over a period of time as opposed to what we do.-53-11/16/82This whole situation is intolerable to me. This organization, aboveall others in Washington--I used to think the Treasury was this way,but certainly do not now--does not leak. And I think it has been toour advantage to have that be both the impression and the reality. Ithas enormously increased our credibility, the credibility of officialstatements over the years, and the credibility of policy. I don't seeany way we can operate other than on that presumption. We are dealingwith a Committee; we are dealing with a lot of people. We can't havea lie detector at the door coming in or out of the office. Weultimately have to do what is right because there is a consensus thatthat is right and an understanding of what the rules are--anunderstanding of the people around the table and our associates.Frankly, I think we perhaps should tighten up the distribution of someof the materials--to go to your point--partly as a reminder of thesensitivity of this business. And we will be proposing some changesin that connection. Joe Coyne might just talk a minute about hisunderstanding of the rules and then we'll have a more generaldiscussion of this or of any ideas anybody else might have", "MR. COYNE. If I might, Mr", "MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I presume we'll talk about thisafter lunch, but we could finesse the whole issue by releasing [thedirective] right after the meeting, [as I proposed in a recentmemorandum to you, which I also sent to all Committee members andother Reserve Bank Presidents]", "MR. ROOS. I think we have a potential problem, though, withour economists, some of whom are rather like prima donnas who havetheir noses out of joint by being expelled--correctly, I agree withyou--from this meeting. And unless there is some agreed upon way ofhandling that, one of those fellows will go and tell somebody that thegag rule is on.

In fairness to Nancy, her argument, though, isthat publication might tend to cause something that we were trying tomake happen anyway happen just a little sooner", "MR. MORRIS. Well, suppose we think that whatever we aretargeting on is going to strengthen greatly between meetings, butwe're not sure. So, we give the Manager a wide funds range in whichto operate and he is supposed to use that range if the target showsgreat strength and not use it if it doesn't. In that case we would bepublishing a much higher upper limit, and the market would be likelyto move quickly toward that limit. Then if the events did not occurto justify the move, the Manager would not move the funds rate. Thenthe market would be stuck up here, and it would have to come downagain. This would produce increased instability in the money market", "MR. BLACK. That's what really worries me. That's the verypoint that tips me against releasing it", "MR. RICE. Peter, isn't it true that you get calls frompeople in the market saying that they know that other people havegotten privileged information", "-63-11/16/82CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, these are the suspicions that I'vehad reported to me recently, more or less casually, but they areworrisome. They are statistical, such as what the money figures aregoing to be tomorrow. The last one was what the M2 figure was goingto be. Just to clarify what I know about this last episode: I hadbreakfast with the Secretary of the Treasury the morning after themeeting, as I do every week. The only thing I told him concerningwhat we had discussed was that we were going to put a lot less weighton M1 because of all the problems he knew about. We had a very short,two-minute or so discussion; he knew what the problem was. I alsosaid I was going to explain this to the public on Friday because Iwould be going to the Business Council and it would be a goodopportunity to put it in the right perspective. Two hours later, it'son the tape, because he literally walked out of that breakfast andwent to a meeting of the dealer bank association--of all things, apublic meeting--and said something about it. He said something vagueabout it when he was asked a question. What he said was accurate.But there it was. And then he didn't say anything else. Then KenBacon was snooping around. I don't know, but Joe Coyne's story isthat Ken Bacon was speculating on this privately, as many of thesethings go, and assumed that we might have to come to that decision.It got confirmed by what the Secretary of the Treasury said and he ranwith the story. He may not have had any other leak. The article waspretty accurate except for the headline, which said the FederalReserve was easing or something. That wasn't the point. That isobviously not what I wanted to say. But except for that firstsentence, it was a pretty accurate story. My speculation is that onereporter got something in the paper, which wasn't itself all thatdamaging, and it sent the other bloodhounds on the scent. They thengot more substantive comments directly, obviously, out of the FederalReserve. And that was the damaging thing, really. I was upset enoughabout the Secretary of the Treasury's performance and that story, butthe really damaging policy story was the one the next day, whichobviously did come from the Federal Reserve. I think it's a perfectexample of how one leak generates another", " This is a continuing saga of the mysterious--MR. FORD. Wait a minute. I have to defend Nancy on this.The logic of it has to be that at the end of a month--with our nextmeeting only being a month away--they will have it. But somewherebetween releasing it the same day and after one month, it becomes anon-story. That is witnessed by the fact that we usually don't getstories about the minutes when we release them", "MR. GUFFEY. I don't agree with those who say that releasingthe directive will avoid the leaks. I agree with those who say thatit might even increase speculation. But I'm a bit troubled with theproposal that we release the directive early, based upon the fact thatwe think we had a leak after the last meeting. I don't think that wecould control leaks by releasing the directive immediately after ameeting. I think the issue that has given rise to the discussiontoday can't be cured by an early release. I'd also add a detail:-65-11/16/82That we don't know how we are going to operate in the future and howthat directive might look and how we might have to move one way or theother in the intermeeting period. As a result of that, it seems to meto be paramount that we maintain that kind of flexibility. If wecan't control the leak problem by early release, then I would adopt amotto that has been used by others in the past and that is \"If itain't broke, don't fix it.\" I would continue to do what we are doing,since we can't control the leak problem in my view, and I would notopt for early release", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you're wrong. I think it wouldincrease the market. There would be text-analysis as well; we'd getall the English majors as well as the---6611/16/82SPEAKER(.). They couldn't use English majors, Paul", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me put this in extreme form. Youreferred to these quiet little meetings we have in public. I'm notsure it has no effect at all, but those involve relativelynoncontroversial issues by and large. We discuss consumer credit andsome arcane regulations. Let me go on the other side of the spectrumwhere I've had a certain amount of experience. Those DIDC meetingsare a zoo. Anybody who does not think the substantive result iscontrolled by the fact that those meetings are held in public doesn'thave his head screwed on right. Now, we are not talking here abouthaving a public meeting, but I'm afraid it's a step in that direction.In a public meeting one cannot make effective arguments or explorealternatives. And you cannot get anybody to change his or her mindonce they have made a statement. And you end up with miserabledecisions, in my humble judgment. And that is [true of the DIDCmeetings] obviously because they are filled with enormous lobbyinginterests. You can imagine what interest monetary policy would have--not quite interest groups, and maybe that would diffuse them, butpolitical groups. If we ever got to that point, we could forget abouthaving any coherent policy except by subterfuge. Somebody would talkbeforehand and would announce that this is what the policy is going tobe and everybody has agreed to say yes or no. In my opinion, that'sthe way those things have to work, if [the group] is going to make anintelligent decision at all", "MR. BOEHNE. I was going to add on to Henry's statement. Ithink the reasons are convincing to a lot of people around the tablefor not releasing it. I suspect that we would have a hard timeconvincing outsiders of the validity of those reasons. I think we alldid hide behind the ideal that somehow [the release of the directive]would help rich people and give succor to the speculators, and I thinkthat served the purpose for us. If we stood up in public and tried togive a convincing speech on why we ought to do it [the way we do], Ithink it would be difficult. That doesn't mean that I'm notsympathetic to not releasing it; I'm saying that if we tried toconvince somebody from the outside, it would be pretty much an up-hillproposition", "MR. CORRIGAN. Is there any question of that"], "1982FOMC19821221meeting.txt": ["MR. BOEHNE. I have a question. Would you comment some moreon the backup in long-term rates following the discount rate drop aweek ago. Would you attribute that to technical reasons or is thereanything there that might be a harbinger of a change in expectationswith regard to Fed policy and inflation", "MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I don't know if I would attribute thebackup to the discount rate. The discount rate reduction certainlydidn't have the impact of earlier reductions in reducing longer-termrates; one heard the comment from a few people that maybe the recentmoney growth would lead to a reemergence of inflation at some pointdown the road, so that investors were less inclined to continue theinterest they had had in the longer-term market. I would regard thislast discount rate move as having been about neutral for the longermarket. The fact that rates have backed up in the longer end I wouldattribute more to the supply [of new issues] coming in the longer-termsector. Treasury supplies have been quite heavy and the corporatesupply and tax exempt supply are also on the sizable side", "MR. ROOS. Our District experienced significant strength innew home sales in November, and automobile sales seem to be improving.Retail sales are up on average 6 to 6-1/2 percent. But as Ed Boehnementioned, the heavy equipment industries are in bad shape", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They're very optimistic. I don't knowwhat they're smoking", "MR. KEEHN. I would suggest that there has been adeterioration, whereas at the last meeting I had a tinge of feelingthat maybe things were getting better. The housing side may bebetter, but I think Nancy Teeters is absolutely right that we have aseasonal adjustment factor that complicates that scene. The auto sidecertainly is better. In retail sales, the optimism that was evidentas people were getting ready for the Christmas season has begun todeteriorate. People on the retail sales side that I talked with areclearly disappointed by the way they see Christmas shaping up. On theindustrial side, capital goods are declining further. There isabsolutely no evidence of a turnaround among the people I talk with,and the pessimism is getting to be very, very pervasive. I think someof these people are beginning to run out of gas. They just areterribly, terribly discouraged", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, I have a reasonable one. Thechains tell us that their sales are doing fairly well in the easternregion, with particular strength in apparel, cosmetics, and consumerelectronics. But they say that their sales in other parts of thecountry are not doing as well. For some reason the East seems to bedoing fairly well on retail sales", "MR. GRAMLEY. I would add my voice to those who are concernedabout whether or not the recovery is going to materialize. TheRedbook this time, although noting elements of optimism--the twinkle,if you will, Ed--commented repeatedly about the manufacturing sectorslipping further into recession and attitudes becoming more and morepessimistic. I think we're dealing here with a combination of a biginventory overhang, particularly in durables, declining business fixedinvestment, and very, very sick export markets. What I worry aboutmost is the possibility that the efforts to improve productivity,which have been going on in full force since midyear, will continue toerode employment and earned incomes. So this little revival ofconsumer spending that we feel over Christmas may prove to be very,very short lived. If I were to put down numbers--if I were in Mr.Kichline's position and thank heaven I no longer have to make myliving that way--I might come up with some very similar numbers. Butmy worries all focus on the possibility that in fact we'll see anotherdisappointment", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I have a question, Steve. You havein your monthly pattern an extremely low growth figure for M2 forDecember, 4-1/2 percent. That seems a little hard to believe,particularly since you are arguing that the [main] influence of the-12-12/20-21/82inflows to the new accounts will be to expand M2. How do you get the4-1/2 percent figure", "MS. TEETERS. Steve, with all the nonreserveable componentsthat are already in M2, aren't you going to have a rather majorproblem trying to estimate what the multipliers are. For any givendollar of reserves we really don't know how much inventory it creates", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to begin by commendingSteve and his associates for what I think is a very good paper. Imight add that I've heard everyone who has discussed this say the samething. I agree with a lot of its major conclusions, particularly thatwe just can't use M1 as a target in the intermediate period. I thinkM2 is probably the best target that we can use. I don't see where wecan really throw M3 in there. But I believe there is some differencebetween the staff position and my own as to the emphasis we ought togive M1 at this point. The paper clearly recognizes, it seems to me,that it is desirable at some time to return to maintaining some kind-15-12/20-21/82of relationship between M1 and our policy. But [the paper] seems abit vague to me [on that point], and I would like to see us make thata little more definite. Most of you probably are not going to buythat view at this point, but I'd like to see some kind of commitmentto return to M1 targeting by mid-1983 unless it clearly is notpossible to do so. I don't think we really know whether it will beclearly impossible or not. I favor this for two reasons. One is thatI think the pricing policies of Super NOW accounts and money marketdeposit accounts is going to be pretty well set by midyear and thelion's share of that shifting is going to be behind us. From then onout we should be able to use M1 itself or develop some reasonably goodshift-adjusted M1 that could serve for targeting purposes. My secondreason is that in the past--it may not be true in the future butpresuming that it will--M1 has been a better predictor of the behaviorof nominal GNP and prices over the long run, despite all theseregulatory changes that people thought would destroy its validity. Ithink it's quite possible--in fact, this is what I think will happen--that the money market deposit accounts and the Super NOWs will bepriced so that most of the savings and investment money will go intothe money market accounts and most of the transactions money will gointo the Super NOWs. And in that case I see no reason why M1 wouldn'tcontinue to bear a pretty good relationship to nominal GNP and prices.So, I would like the presumption to be that we will go back to M1unless we find that we can't do it. That would be my main emphasis.I have two more points beyond that. One is that I wouldrecommend very strongly that we devote whatever resources arenecessary to see what we can do in the way of developing a reliableshift-adjusted [M2]. I realize that is not an easy thing to do but Ithink it's something we have failed to try. My second point is that Ilike the idea of the shadow target but I reach a somewhat differentconclusion from Jerry on that. I'd feel a little better if we bumpedit a little higher because it's not practical for the Committee toparticipate in these ad hoc adjustments made to the borrowed reservetarget between meetings. So, I would like the automatic part to belarger than it has been in the past. I think I'll stop right there.Well, one other point. If the interest elasticity of M2 isless than that of M1, as it probably will be, and if the elasticity ofM1 is less than it has been in the past because of this innovation,then I think we necessarily would have some larger movements ininterest rates than we've been willing to tolerate, if we're going tostay on whatever path we finally end up with. So, all of these thingslead me to suggest that the automatic adjustment mechanism ought to bemade as strong as the Committee is willing to accept", "MR. WALLICH. I would like to note that if you want a surveyof targeting possibilities, some are not in the paper. While I12/20-21/82wouldn't recommend these, I think there are serious contenders. One,on the basis of the research done here at the Board, is that the useof intermediate targets is inefficient and that better and moreprecise results can be obtained by targeting on the real sectordirectly. On the other hand, there are many arguments against that,including the political one, but it is something that one ought tobear in mind as one makes these choices. Also, I note that there isnothing in the paper about exchange rates", " Again, while I don't thinkexchange rates are a proper target for this economy, they are targetsthat are used in other countries, in the EMS countries for instance.That again is something to think about. I would think certainly thatexchange rates might play a greater role in our targeting in thefuture than they have. We have a little sentence [on them] in thedirective but not much attention is paid to them. Finally, there is areference to nominal GNP. You may recall that Martin Feldstein camehere a few weeks ago and gave us a talk recommending that we target onthat. I think that's dangerous advice. It means playing God, and thecentral bank should be a humble technician administering theaggregates and not trying to say what nominal GNP is to be.On M1, I share all the points made in the paper. I think wehave to wait and see if we should use it, if it becomes viable again.What I hear from the market is that the money market deposit accountsmay prove more attractive or may be made more attractive by the banksthan the Super NOW accounts, but we will have to wait and see.Certainly M1 is the one element in money supply targeting that to mecarries any real conviction; with M1 we are dealing with transactionsbalances and there is some reason to think that they do guide theeconomy--of course, always through interest rates. On interest ratetargeting, which is rejected in the paper, the way I feel is that theyare what we should target on if we had the knowledge and no politicaldifficulties. But we have a great difficulty, of course, in decidingwhat the right rate is and it would be difficult to sustain it in theface of opposition. But since I believe the economy runs on interestrates, not on money, it is in one sense better to target directly oninterest rates than it is to target on money and let money determineinterest rates.Well, to come to what is doable, I think M2 is our best betin the short run. We have to keep it very flexible with a wide rangearound it. It is attractive in the sense that trying to control itproduces large changes in interest rates which control the economyeffectively even though we do not control the M2 aggregate itself veryeffectively. We may have to accept considerable deviations. Thebase, I think, perhaps deserves a little more support than we've givenit here, particularly the nonborrowed base. Fundamentally, of course,the base is currency and it's hard to believe that the economy runs oncurrency. However, currency is about the best behaved variable wehave because it's the one about which the least is known. Most ofthese $500 dollars per capita that we have in the form of currencypresumably isn't active in the American economy--[it's in othercountries such as] Mexico or destroyed. The base, because it is afairly stable aggregate, is a safe aggregate to target on and one thatwould not give us a great deal of trouble, particularly because we canmake allowances for misadventures to currency such as [possible] largeshipments to Argentina or a boom in the underground economy. Butother than that, I think the nonborrowed base has something to commendit. On credit, I feel the same way as the paper does. It is-17-12/20-21/82informative; it has meaning but it is technically difficult. The dataare poor, late, and subject to revision. And it is difficult tocontrol. So, I would go for a credit aggregate larger than bankcredit as an associated device. Thank you", "MR. BALLES. Oh, Continental. And Vanguard is going with the[Bank of] Boston, I believe. Heaven knows what this is going to do,with the amounts showing up in M1 and M2. So, I just don't have afeel as yet as to how long this uncertainty will go on. But Icertainly agree with what I think was your conclusion, Steve, that itwould be premature to dismiss M1 forever. On the other side of the12/20-21/82coin, I feel it would be premature, using the words that Bob Blackstarted off with, to commit to returning to M1. That [wording] wouldbe a little stronger than I would be prepared to support. But I agreewith Bob's concluding comments that we certainly ought to make itclear that we will be prepared to re-examine M1 when the dust issettled and very possibly return to M1 as a target.Meanwhile, my very, very tentative instincts tell me that ifMl doesn't settle down and start behaving in a way that has apredictable demand relationship and predictable effects on theeconomy, the nonborrowed base might be the thing to look at much moreclosely. But I think it would be a mistake to move to something asesoteric as the nonborrowed base just for some interim period ifthere's any hope at all of M1 finally settling down in a way that wecan use it. The problem of explaining the nonborrowed base to thegeneral public, the Congress, and so forth would, I think, be veryformidable. Meanwhile, I think you have come up with a good--in myopinion, the best--interim solution, which would be to stay with M2for some months ahead and see what happens to the behavior of Ml", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We will have Mr. Morris, and then Mr. Rooswill give us the opposite side", "MR. MORRIS. To consider returning to M1 by mid-1983 isextremely unrealistic, I think. Not only do we have the potential ofthese corporate accounts but we also have the experience that it takesa long time for people to adjust fully to changing their cashbalances. The New England experience with the NOW account was that ittook three years to reach equilibrium with NOW accounts. I never didbelieve the idea that the change would take place that much morerapidly in the country at large. And the fact that NOW accounts havebeen growing over the past year at about a 35 percent annual rateleads me to question the maturity of this device. So, I don't thinkwe should expect that the public is going to adapt to these newaccounts very rapidly. It seems to me that goes against the grain ofall our earlier history. Neither should we expect that money marketmutual funds are going to sit back and let the banks take all theirmoney away from them. I would expect, for example, that the next moveby the money market funds would be to offer unlimited checking. Wealready have unlimited checking with Merrill Lynch's cash managementfund", "-19-12/20-21/82MR. MORRIS. No minimum size check and no limit on the numberof checks. One pays for the cost of processing with a service charge.If the Super NOW account turns out to be very popular, which I thinkit will, it seems to me that the money market funds will respond byoffering unlimited checking, which will open the ballgame again. Whenthe dust does settle sooner or later--I think it's unlikely to be bymid-1983--what we call M1 is going to be a very different animal, asSteve indicated, than the M1 of earlier years. And it's going to takeus 5 or 6 years of experience with the new animal to develop anyconsensus as to how it's going behave relative to nominal GNP and howwe can control it. Certainly, there is no scientific basis forexpecting that it is going to behave relative to nominal GNP in thesame way that the old M1 did.There is a lot of theology on M1 floating around at thismeeting. Steve mentioned a couple of things that raised some of thebasic issues. He talked about the vexing questions of cause andeffect in using credit as a target, as if to suggest that there are novexing problems of cause and effect with respect to money, a pointabout which I would raise serious questions. I agree with Henry thatwhat moves the economy is interest rates and not the black box. Stevealso raised the question of whether credit can be controlledindependently of GNP. I suspect that it cannot. But I have not seenany demonstration in the last three years that we control M1independently of GNP. The idea that M1 is so interest-sensitive thatwe can control its rate of growth by interest rate changes so small asnot to have any impact on the economy I find hard to believe. Icannot reconcile that theory, that doctrine, that theology with whathas happened in the past three years when we finally made very bigmoves in interest rates to get M1 under control and those big moveshad very big impacts on the economy. So, I find a lot of conflictbetween the facts and the theology in the case of M1.I think we need a proxy--an independent intermediate target--for nominal GNP, or the closest thing we can come to as a proxy fornominal GNP, because that's what the name of the game is supposed tobe. If we have to target something that is not predictably related toGNP, which M1 has not been in the past two years, one of two thingscan happen. One is that we can do as we did in 1981 and say the M1shift adjusted, which was our target, is coming in too low and we arejust going to let it come in low--we're not going to use it as atarget de facto. I think that was the right decision. If we hadtried to hit our targets for M1 in 1981, we obviously would have puttoo much money into the system. I think the targets have misled usthis year. That is, up until October when we finally caught up withit, it seems to me that the monetary aggregates misled this Committeeinto following a much more restrictive policy than we intended. Andthat is reflected in a nominal GNP growth this year, which we're nowestimating at 3.6 percent, that I don't think any of us a year agowould have [favored] as a target for nominal GNP.It seems to me that the best proxy for nominal GNP in thisworld of enormous change is the rate of growth of debt. Now, that maynot be a perfect proxy, either. But we certainly don't want to goback to interest rate targeting. Politically, I don't think we couldadopt a nominal GNP targeting approach even though theoretically thatis what we ought to be doing. I don't think we can do it. We need aproxy for nominal GNP", "MR. MORRIS. Well, let's say the President comes out inJanuary and says we are going to have 12 percent nominal GNP growth,and you go up before the congressional committee in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony the next month and say we're going to finance a 9percent nominal GNP growth. It seems to me it is not well suited tothe needs of the central bank to be that far out on a limb", "MR. MORRIS. I disagree with that statement that we haveadjusted for NOW accounts. I don't think we have at all", "MR. GRAMLEY. The staff called our attention repeatedly tothe range of uncertainties in these estimates, and I'd like to startby stressing that. If one takes a look at table 2 in the Bluebook onpage 8, one sees the staff estimates that for the year 1983, fourthquarter-to-fourth quarter, flows to M2 will add somewhere between 1/2and 2-1/2 percent to the growth rate of M2. But they get to thatconclusion by going through a whole series of instruments and bymaking estimates that are often clever and often well conceived but inthe final analysis are off the wall. That is said not in any way todenigrate the work of the staff. There is simply no one who can knowwhether out of the $350 billion in CDs $1 billion or $50 billion isgoing to shift. Now, if these uncertainties are bad for M2, think ofwhat they are for M1. From my standpoint, when the estimates for 1983imply somewhere between a reduction of $8 billion and an increase of$24 billion, which is an increment of from minus 2 percent to plus 5percent for the growth of M1, that aggregate is a very dangeroustarget until these things settle down.There has been some suggestion that the way out may be tolook at something like the nonborrowed base. I don't interpret thestaff documents the way others must be interpreting them. The staffsaid that if we start with these problems and go back to the totalmonetary base, we'd be dealing not only with all those problems butone more: the instability of currency demand. Therefore, that isgoing to be a horrible target. Some of this horribleness would beremoved a bit if we went to the nonborrowed base. To focus on whatthe nonborrowed base would mean: If the demand for money is -4 andwe're trying to push out 10, we're going to be dumping in reserveslike gangbusters. So, borrowing will go down to the floor to keep thenonborrowed base exploding and interest rates will fall. And we arejust going to be all over the place. We are going to have wildinstability in interest rates. As I look at what the staff has said,the best we can do at the moment is to focus on a broader aggregatelike M2. I come to that conclusion not without some sympathy forwhere Frank Morris is. But the main problem with a credit target isthat we simply don't get the data with the kind of timeliness we needin order to make it a sensible intermediate target for monetarypolicy. It's just not there", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The answer to this question depends uponwhether or not one is in favor of a credit aggregate", " It was sovolatile we couldn't--MR. AXILROD. It was so volatile, actually, that we gave upon it. It can be developed. I don't think the lag is two weeks; Ithink it's closer to three or four. But it certainly could beestimated. Our estimate is 65 percent in two weeks as against your 85percent; we could estimate that 20 percent and add it and not beterribly far off. But we don't have it available in any real senseand it hasn't been tested. That doesn't mean it couldn't be developedor shouldn't be developed. But we're not near it, in any real sense,from our point of view", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Lyle has said verymuch what I wanted to say; I may just go at it in a little differentway. I agree with those, however, who say that we shouldn't bury M1totally. We ought to keep it in the background. It has served usvery well politically in the past. Perhaps it could again. It mayhave some informational content, as everything settles down, that wewill want to use in the future. As a result the fact that we merelyset it aside for some period of time to be looked at again isimportant. Lyle has made the point that I wanted to make with regardto the interest rate volatility of the proposal made in the paper,using what I think is the only reasonable variable to guide us in thefuture, and that is M2. We'll have to pay more attention to interestrates and thus perhaps build in an interest rate target, whether wepublish it or not, that constrains some [rate] movements.I would just ask a question of Steve or others with regard toM2. It looks to be very stable on a quarterly basis, but if you lookat it on a monthly basis, just taking this year as an example, it hasranged from about 4.4 percent growth in February and what would be 4.5percent in December, if we hit that [estimate], up to about 14percent. In about 6 months of that period it was above 10 percent and[in the other] 6 months it was below 10 percent. The question that I-25-12/20-21/82would pose to Peter or Steve is this: How does the Desk propose tooperate without some interest rate constraints. I'm saying, as Lylehas just said, that we have to pay more attention to interest rates; Idon't understand how the Desk would accommodate either an increase ora decrease in the nonborrowed path for the purpose of trying to adjust[operations] in an intermeeting period on [the basis of] a directivegiven to the Desk following the meeting", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I hear all these comments about thepolitical viability of targeting nominal GNP, which I understand. Iwant to offer an observation. I would be very surprised if we gotthrough the hearings in February without being asked to reconciledirectly whatever target we have with whatever nominal GNP theAdministration has. And if it does not reconcile, we're going to havea big problem", "MR. MARTIN. Several of us have commented on the probablelength of time of the transition. I'm one of those who come down on[the side of] the long transition theory. It has been said that thelength of time it will take before [we can assess] the behavior of thenew instruments and indeed the old instruments, which also may havetheir interest ceilings changed or removed by the DIDC, depends on theaggressiveness of bankers and their marketing efforts. I think that'sincorrect because I observe that the commercial banks in the countryare going through a few other phases and adjustments right now. Ifyou add in thrift institutions, several dozen of them are failingevery month. That's a rather difficult transition. Now they aregoing to be adjusting to noon presentment [unintelligible] and allthat implies with regard to the clearing processes, and to ten percentwithholding, which is putting a slight strain on most of their papershuffling. There are loan write-offs, international complications,etc., etc. If we shift our view from concepts and abstractions towhat is going on in the institutions that are out there, I think onecan at least make a case that the transition period is going to berather extensive. And I would suggest to you that the consumer isalmost as confused as his friendly neighborhood banker. It's going to-28-12/20-21/82take those consumers a while to settle down and determine where theywant their balances and how much and what kinds of services they wantfrom institutions that are changing their offerings of services ratherfrequently these days.I'm not as concerned about the journalistic recitation ofexpectations of the markets as I am about the behavior of the marketsthemselves. I don't believe that Milton Friedman, my old friend HerbStein, Lindley Clark, and the rest of those good folks are going todetermine how the market reacts to what we do here in terms of M1 orM2 growth targeting, the changes in the directives, and so forth. Ithink market participants are much more likely to react to thecontinued flood of negative or at best neutral information with regardto the company they underwrote last week, last year, or two years ago--literally to the bottom line of a corporation whose securities theyare attempting to make a market for--to unemployment, to the exportindustry complications, to shortfalls in business fixed investment,and to all the rest of what is happening in the real world, and not towhat Lindley Clark says in The Wall Street Journal. Therefore, Ithink we have some action space to pursue some aggressiveness in M2and some tolerance of M1 because the real world is just not shaping upvery well for 1983.So, I'm endorsing what has been said with regard to acontinued surveillance of M1. It is certainly attractive. We've allexercised our due diligence now and looked at many of the othermeasures. And, certainly, we should try to reinstate M1 in thepantheon. But in the meantime, in what I think will be a longtransition period, I would hope to see us discuss in our directivesand our public utterances both M2 and M3. I'm not wild about M3 as amarvelous measure. But look back at those tables on velocity at theend of the excellent work that has been done here. I would hate tosee us confined to one measure among the aggregates when velocity oneyear is +4 percent and another year -5 or -5-1/2 percent. I'd like tosee us have a little flexibility in the aggregates targets and,lacking something better, I would suggest M2 and M3. It's a bitvague; certainly M3 is a bit vague. For that matter M2 is not a modelof clarity. But I'd like to see M2 and M3 specified and a little moreemphasis in our public utterances on interest rates. We're notfooling anybody, you know. The folks out there know that we're payinga little more attention to interest rates. Why not come right upfront with it. That we look at M2 and M3 as the validator is a plus.I think the word flexibility is part of the key to this. I wonderback on the discount rate cut, which wasn't exactly a world beater,what the markets would have done, as they firmed up, if we hadn'treduced the discount rate. So, I opt for flexibility", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think this velocity argument isgoing to work during this period; it will work the other way around ifthey are at all smart, which may be an overestimate. They are goingto say \"I see velocity went haywire last year, so you have to give usa commitment that you're not going to follow that target but are goingto adjust for whatever velocity does. And you better hit that nominaltarget", "12/20-21/82MR. KEEHN. I will be brief. It seems to me, for all thereasons we've said, that we are going through a period of very highuncertainty. And during this transition period, while certainly weshouldn't abandon M1, I think we should deemphasize it considerably.I don't know how long it's going to take before we can re-utilize it,if in fact we can, in the way that we have in the past. But I agreewith Governor Martin that the length of time required will be muchlonger rather than shorter. Certainly for the foreseeable future weshould deemphasize it. It seems to me that we have pulled off thisdeemphasis of M1 pretty well; I am impressed by that. I think themarkets have by and large accepted it to a greater degree than Iexpected. In all the public comments that you have made and everybodyelse has made we are putting greater emphasis on M2, which I wouldagree we should do, with a balanced view. And I think there is someconsiderable market expectation now that we will be following M2. Thethe very last thing we ought to do at this point is to introduce somenew esoteric aggregate that we plan to follow, which could serve toconfuse the markets. So, having introduced M2 in this way, I think weshould carry through with it and use it as our principal guide. Italso seems to me, in looking ahead, that we ought to be contemplatingan increase in the range on M2 next year--in my view by a considerableamount. Meanwhile, we have an economy that is awfully sick in myview. We could very well be in a recovery phase. But the people Italk to, particularly on the industrial side, as I said earlier,continue to be very, very pessimistic. I think we should put a veryheavy eye on interest rates, not only domestically but as they pertaininternationally. We simply cannot at this point afford to have anyincrease in the rates we have some level of control over--mainly onthe short-term side--for fear of the possibility that a recovery willbe snuffed out. So, I'd be in favor of M2 but I also would be puttinga very careful eye on following the interest rates", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, although we all believe incontrolling the money supply over the long run, some of us are placingimportance on returning to targeting M1 as soon as possible--say, bythe middle of next year--and some of us are more skeptical. I don'tthink that creates a problem in the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony; it'sperfectly finessible. [We should say] that we will be watching it andlearning from it what we can, notwithstanding distortions, and that ifwe see that it becomes free of distortions, it could be an appropriatetarget. I think there's a widespread feeling of uneasiness among usabout M2 and M3 as presently constituted. They don't have a trackrecord; we don't know what they tell us about nominal GNP. One thingthat bothers me is this: Suppose next year or the year after we beginto see inflationary pressures develop and we have to start tightening.If M2 and M3 were growing weakly and unemployment were over 10percent, what is our reason for tightening. What do we offer. I feelthat the fig leaf is pretty much tattered and that the mood of theCongress is pretty realistic. The country knows what we are doingand, therefore, that we have an important effect on economic activityas well as inflation. It seems that there ought to be a way offormulating our policy so that it meets the political realities and isa little more honest, and yet doesn't lock us into the bind that weall are familiar with. Therefore, I would recommend for seriousconsideration that we say the following: That we have certainexpectations about where M2 and M3 will end up--and perhaps avoid theuse of the word targeting; that those expectations would beimportantly influenced by trends and levels of real economic activityand trends and levels of inflation; and that we would be drawing ourreserve paths from M2 and M3 as we go along with the meetings. ButI'd be fairly honest about the fact that we're looking very heavily aswell at other considerations that are less important, such as nominalGNP and the exchange rate. Those would be the two important ones. Iwould add to that, just as reassurance to the markets, that our long-term policy, notwithstanding any possible alternate later weakness inthe Ms, would be to maintain positive real interest rates.SPEAKER(.). To do what, Tony", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comments. I don't know quitehow one summarizes this discussion. In some ways I think there was aconsensus; in other ways I think there was a lot of disparity. Let memake a comment about the deficit that has emerged from the discussionthis morning. I don't think there is much prospect of the deficitdeclining in any foreseeable time period, which is a more importantproblem maybe than some of the ones we've been grappling with in thelast couple of days, difficult as those are. The Administration'scurrent estimates are going to be higher than anything we've seen andwill remain higher. I think we have to have targets, just by law.And apart from the law, I didn't notice any great tendency around thetable to depart from them entirely in terms of monetary or credittargets", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. We may make bigger onesthat way. In today's world, with things so uncertain and upset, itdoes have dangers. It personalizes things much more, which I don'tthink is ideal. It leaves us with more expectational questions. Itmay be fine now, but everybody will say: What happens when the Boardchanges and the personalities change and you don't have a rule. ButI'm hard pressed to condense what we have to do into a simple rule,given all the uncertainties we face and given some of these numbersgoing off track. I don't think we have to apologize for the approach,but I don't think it's ideal. There was some question--Roger Guffeyand some others may have touched upon it a little--of explicitinterest rate targeting. I don't think we have to go to that. It's afine distinction maybe, but there is a distinction between having anexplicit interest rate target and having, as I'm sure a lot of peopledo around this table, some limits of tolerance on what interest ratechange one wants and some general idea as to the direction one wouldlike rates to go as one is interpreting the numbers and setting thetargets and setting the borrowing levels and so forth. And I thinkit's a distinction worth preserving. I'm not sure I'd want to confinemyself to talking about real interest rates or saying we have to havea positive real interest rate. I can imagine circumstances in whichwe might have to have a negative real interest rate. I don't think weanticipate it at the moment, but I'm not sure we want to have too muchat stake on a real interest rate.There was one thing I do disagree with, so I will just stateit. There was some implication and some comment that people would beperfectly happy with even bigger swings in interest rates--I may be-41-12/20-21/82overstating it--in order to keep some of these aggregates on target.That, I think, we cannot afford in the foreseeable future; I justdon't think we can. We have had too much [rate fluctuation] in thepast for my own blood. But given the state of the economy now I donot think we can be casual about thinking of swings in interest ratesof several percentage points up or down and just take that as a by-product of some target we're aiming at that we've not very sure ofanyway. That is one thing I would feel pretty strongly about myself", "MR. WALLICH. We seem to be talking about the differencebetween the proviso and the rule. We've switched from this in thepast, as you know. We had an interest rate rule provided theaggregates or reserves didn't violate some constraint; then we movedthe other way. We had a money supply rule provided the funds ratedidn't violate some constraint. I think we're somewhat in this areahere. There is a difference in saying we have an M2 target, which wequalify by a number of other things, and saying we are looking at alot of things but we hope that M2 or some other monetary target comesout right and we will try to effectuate that. There is a differenceeven though the two [approaches] meet somewhere in the middle", "MR. PARTEE. But Tony is right. The discount rate and thefunds rate have been closely linked", "MR. MORRIS. I think Jerry is right. The most scientificstatement made yesterday was Lyle Gramley's statement that the staffestimates of the impact of the new account on M2 are off the wall.And I think that's exactly right. As long as the banks are paying anabove-market rate on the new instrument--and I don't know how longthat's going to go on--there is a tremendous incentive to shift out ofmarket instruments into M2. At least with M3 there is the offset inthat presumably the banks that take in a lot of money this way will betaking in less through large CDs. I would differ with Jerry only tothe extent that I wouldn't have an M2 target at all", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure", "MR. CORRIGAN. Just a simple case: Assume that we have notonly a central tendency but a tremendous convergence that says nominalGNP is going to grow by 9 percent; prices will rise by 4 percent andreal GNP by 5 percent to make it nice. Then we say we think M2 and M3and total credit will look like X, Y, and Z. But then this centraltendency [puts our forecasts] in a different light than the oldforecasts if, as we get into the year, there's a marked departure inactual performance of the economy from the central tendency eventhough the Ms and whatever else we use in our steering devices lookall right. The question is: Do you contemplate any more of a direct-48-12/20-21/82linkage between what we would do with the steering devices or targetsand that central tendency forecast", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, it's not reliable. For what it'sworth, that's what it is. Well, are there any other comments. Ithink we better get something out that will make all this a littlemore concrete", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's going to be much harder thistime, though. What bothers me about the Administration forecast isthat they are likely to have a higher inflation forecast by asignificant margin, not only for [the coming] year but a pretty highinflation forecast out into the future relative to what I think isgoing to happen. And that doesn't indicate great confidence in thesuccess of the anti-inflationary program, for my money. They have acertain institutional bias; partly they have the budgetary problem.But in part it's because at least some of them want to make darn surethey're not very far away from the consensus of other forecasts. Andif you look at the consensus of economic forecasts for the next fewyears, they have a considerably higher inflation rate than our staffseems to be [leaning] toward. So, if they go toward a consensusforecast partly for budgetary reasons but partly just because theywant to be near the consensus, that puts us in the position of arguingthat the inflation outlook is really better and it is doable. Andthey are saying, and everybody else is saying, we ought to besatisfied with a higher inflation forecast and have a more-51-12/20-21/82expansionary policy. That's my biggest concern. And it's not justnext year's forecast. Maybe I'm wrong, but my gut feeling now is thatthis will be evident in the '83 forecast and in the 5-year forecast", "MR. PARTEE. Taking out the shifts", "MR. PARTEE. That amounts to some unknown amount over andabove that", "MR. BALLES. If it turns out that we're all using differentassumptions on the growth of the Ms, it could be a little awkward", "MR. BOEHNE. Just a question: The Greenbook forecasts of thecurrent account and trade deficits are much larger than I at leasthave seen from other people. Is it that we know something they don'tknow.

That will really be serious", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Then we have a real problem. But theyalready have [commitments for] basically more than $4 billion exceptthat some of that is contingent on getting more, so it's not perfectlyclear yet", "MR. BLACK. We'd better check with Mr", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You stated that a little too generally, Ithink, Henry. The historical fact was--but it wasn't a policy andyour comment may have been interpreted as general policy--that we didnot participate in Hungary for purely political reasons.

FORD. The other aspect of this that bothers me is thefact that the Presidents of the [Reserve] Banks that I have talked toare all very uneasy about having someone in their Bank make phonecalls in which we are in effect saying to the banks: If you will putforward your share of the new package of $4 to $5 billion, we wouldwink at the realities of the creditworthiness of your loan. Thatmakes me very concerned", "MR. WALLICH. That wasn't the language that was used", " I got most of it but not--MR. AXILROD. Well, we're going to type it up and send itaround. On the operational paragraphs, alternative one as proposedallows for a high M2 growth, something that would accommodate a shift--if you believe our 3 percentage points--of that order of magnitude.But because that number for M2 would be pretty large---- would have tobe, say, 11 or 12 percent really, and that may present some problem ofcredibility--it would almost seem to call for an early estimate of ashift adjustment factor. That is, if you decided on the 11 or 12percent but thought two or three or four percentage points of that wasshift, once you go that route, then I think it inevitably involves acontinuing shift. While that is one reasonable approach, the staff--or certainly I--would tend to prefer the approach of alternative two,which allows for a smaller rate of growth in M2 and also includes anM3 growth that probably, as President Corrigan mentioned, is not goingto be as much affected by shifts. So, that's our tentative thinkingin this current period", "MR. PARTEE. You have absolutely no current information thatI can see, including the flash report on the GNP, that indicates thatvelocity is turning around. It is still going down fast for M2", "MR. AXILROD. There are differing numbers in thosealternatives. I'm suggesting that you might use alternative two,which incorporates the lower numbers that do not fully allow for theshifts. If you use the M3 numbers that are there but subtract 2 to 3percentage points from the M1 number, you would not be making as muchadvance allowance for the shifts as is in the text, which is our bestestimate of the shifts.
