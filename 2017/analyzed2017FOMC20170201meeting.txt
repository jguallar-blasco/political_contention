Passage number 1.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And without objection. I think as everyone recalls, President Lockhart will be stepping down from his position at the end of February.  Consistent with tradition, he’s elected not to attend this Committee meeting.  But we will have the opportunity to honor him and express our best wishes at a reception in the Eccles Building atrium this evening.  And, for today, I am pleased to note that First Vice President Marie Gooding, who has attended a number of FOMC meetings previously, will represent the Atlanta Bank today.  Marie, welcome back. Effective with today’s meeting, Presidents Evans, Harker, Kaplan, and Kashkari will be members of the FOMC.  This year will be the first on the Committee for Presidents Harker, Kaplan, and Kashkari, so a welcome is in order to them.  And President Evans, you are an old hand as a Committee member.  So you get a welcome back.

Passage number 25.
 MR. POTTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I recommend that the Committee approve the existing Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, and the Foreign Currency Directive without amendment. I would like to highlight another item for the Committee’s consideration.  In January 2009, the Committee suspended the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues in light of the Federal Reserve’s program to purchase agency debt and agency MBS.  The SOMA contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it continues to conduct transactions in agency MBS securities as part of the reinvestment policy adopted by the Committee.  Consequently, I recommend a continued suspension of these guidelines.  No Committee vote is needed to continue the suspension. CHAIR YELLEN. Are there comments or questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Hearing none, we need a motion to approve these documents.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 27.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Second.  January 31–CHAIR YELLEN.  Without objection.  Okay.  That takes us up to agenda item 5, which pertains to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.  As you know, the staff have proposed several relatively minor changes.  Two of them would afford more flexibility in the classification or downgrading of FOMC information in certain circumstances.  A third change would simply conform the program to a change made by the Committee last year to the foreign authorization regarding Federal Reserve staff who are authorized to discuss System foreign currency operations with the Treasury.  Are there any questions about the program. [No response]  If not, do I have a motion to approve the proposed changes to the program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 28.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states that Mr. Fischer makes a motion and Chair Yellen seconds it. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 29.
 MR. TARULLO.  I have no objection.  I fall in that latter category, Madam Chair, of people who had questions but didn’t want to be in opposition.  I want to address the somewhat broader issue of the SEP itself.  I know this is not the time for an extended discussion, but I hope that, at some point, we will have an opportunity to discuss it.  As I think about our experience with it since it was put in place, I honestly cannot tell whether, on net, it’s been somewhatJanuary 31–positive or, on net, it’s been somewhat negative in terms of communicating effectively with the public.  But the fact that I think it’s that close a call suggests to me that there should be a good opportunity to have some discussion about ways that it might be improved, and perhaps we should step back a little bit and ask ourselves if it has worked as intended. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Well, we will consider taking that up in due course and consult with the subcommittee on communications about that.  Seeing no objections to moving forward then, the minutes of this meeting will note that participants agreed to include fan charts in the SEP, effective with the March 2017 minutes.  In terms of implementation, a staff paper that covers fan charts and, more generally, measures the uncertainty in macroeconomic projections will be released to the public shortly after the publication of the minutes of the current meeting. We will provide you with that paper in advance of its publication, and I also understand that in advance of our March meeting, our Public Affairs Office will release templates of the fan charts so the public can see what they will look like.  Those would use data given in the December 2016 SEP.  And my understanding is that we don’t need a vote on this, and we simply have widespread support and will go ahead and do it. Okay.  Well, that completes our organizational items.  We’re making great progress, and let me turn things over to Simon, who’s going to give us the Desk briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 30.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Lorie, your exhibit 2, panel 7, “Federal Funds Rate Expected at Change in Reinvestment Policy”—I think you explained this and I just missed it, so I apologize. Is this saying what market participants expect the federal funds rate will be when we stop reinvesting or when we announce our plans about reinvestment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question asked by Mr. Kashkari seeking clarification on a particular exhibit.


Passage number 31.
 MS. LOGAN. It refers to when the Committee makes some adjustment to reinvestments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage merely states a fact about the Committee making adjustments to reinvestments, without any hint of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 32.
 MR. KASHKARI.  The actual reinvestments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a fragment and does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 33.
 MS. LOGAN.  The actual reinvestments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions. It is simply stating a fact about reinvestments.


Passage number 34.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Kashkari, is simply stating "Okay."


Passage number 35.
  January 31–MR. POTTER.  Yes, there might be some slippage in terms of when it’s announced versus when it actually happens.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Potter is acknowledging the possibility of a delay between the announcement and the actual occurrence of something, without expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 36.
 MS. LOGAN.  It announces the change, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It simply states that a change is being announced.


Passage number 37.
 MR. KASHKARI. I’m just making this up, but, say, if we announce in June that six months later we’re going to stop reinvesting, that would be what this is capturing.  Or is it the actual date when the reinvestments stop.  Do you see the distinction I’m making.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply explaining a distinction between announcing the cessation of reinvestments in June and the actual date when the reinvestments stop.


Passage number 38.
 MR. POTTER.  I think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the statement provided. Mr. Potter simply expresses his opinion, stating, "I think so."


Passage number 39.
 MS. LOGAN.  I was going to get the exact wording of the question to make sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Ms. Logan simply shows her intention to confirm the wording of a question.


Passage number 40.

Passage number 42.
 MS. LOGAN.  It might take me a minute.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that it might take Ms. Logan a minute to do something without any conflict or debate taking place.


Passage number 43.
  If there’s another question— MR. POTTER. We’re going to read out the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that if there is another question, they will read it out.


Passage number 44.
 MR. LAUBACH.  I believe it is about the date of first change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Laubach is simply stating his belief about the date of first change.


Passage number 45.
 MR. POTTER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 46.
  Yes, but it is a question of “announced” versus— MR. LAUBACH. Yes, but that’s what the question asks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is a difference in opinions ("Yes, but") but then agrees with the question that was asked.


Passage number 47.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Wasn’t the presumption when we asked the question that that period be relatively short.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence is a straightforward statement asking about the presumption made when a question was asked.


Passage number 48.
 MS. LOGAN.  “What is your estimate for the most likely timing (in months forward) of a change to the Committee’s policy of reinvesting payments of principal on Treasury securities and/or agency debt and MBS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 49.
” MR. POTTER.  That’s the timing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states "MR. POTTER. That's the timing."


Passage number 50.
 MR. KASHKARI.  It’s something in the middle.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The statement does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that "It's something in the middle", without reference to conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 51.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. It’s sort of ambiguous.

Passage number 53.
” VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 54.
  Changing the policy, actually implementing— MR. KASHKARI.  Yes, that’s simplistic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 55.
 MR. POTTER.  I haven’t met anyone who has thought through that particular issue.  However, that’s clearly a policy option in terms of people getting ready for it.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they haven't met anyone who has thought about the particular issue, but acknowledges that it is a valid policy option.


Passage number 56.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think most people thought that that interval would be short.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal belief or assumption, but there is no indication of any conflicting opinions or statements from others.


Passage number 57.
 MS. LOGAN. The dealer reports themselves that I’ve read suggest that when they do their projections of the balance sheet, they’re starting at that point—which I think matches up with the actual change.  But due to the way the question is written, I can’t say that everyone read it that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply points out that the question's wording may have led to different interpretations by different people.


Passage number 58.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Okay.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 59.
 MS. MESTER.  Can I ask another question on the reinvestment policy. I’m getting a lot of questions from both bankers and nonbankers about the policy, and the memo that you distributed triggered my question.  Do you have a sense of whether the market participants that answered the questions are thinking about our change in policy tied to a level of the funds rate— and then the timing comes after that. So they think in terms of, “Okay, they’re going to change their policy when the funds rate goes up by a certain amount or to a certain level,” and then that informs when it’s going to happen.  Or do you think they’re thinking in terms of, “It’s really calendar dependent—they’re going to stop it in six months or the beginning of next year at whatever the funds rate would be at that time.” Because I think what we’re trying to January 31–communicate, at least the way I’ve been thinking about it, is tying it to the level of the funds rate. I couldn’t tell from your report and the survey memo that you sent out if you had a sense of how they’re thinking about it.  So I would be curious about what your feeling is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and expressing curiosity about how market participants are thinking about the reinvestment policy.


Passage number 60.
 MS. LOGAN.  I think you could think of it both ways.  Of the 31 respondents that made a change to the timing, 26 brought it forward, and some of that must have just been passing of time. But of those who brought the date forward, 20 of the 26 changed the actual funds rate that it’s connected to.  So there was some change going on during the intermeeting period of the actual federal funds rate that they were connecting the timing to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There doesn't appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting facts and analyzing the data.


Passage number 61.
 MS. MESTER. Does that tell you that we need to clarify our communications about it, or do you think that’s not necessary. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, it just said “well under way.”  I should say we are going to discuss reinvestment policy at the next meeting.  We’ll have several papers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Chair Yellen is simply stating that the reinvestment policy will be discussed at the next meeting.


Passage number 62.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If you look at the answers over time, though, it looks like we’re tied to a level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. It simply states that if you look at the answers over time, it appears that we are tied to a certain level. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 63.
 MS. LOGAN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 64.
  A lot of people are expecting us to do it once— MR. POTTER. It’s been between about 1 and 1½ percent for over 12 months.  And when we first asked this after the rate increase and the change of language in the postmeeting statement, which is the “flash” survey after the December 2015 meeting, they thought 12 months ahead, because they were thinking, “Well, the federal funds rate could likely have been in that range.”  And then, as the market path flattened and the SEP changed, you could see some extension for months out under most of them.  The dealers are more likely to have it be state contingent than some of the people on the buy side, but there is a general movement in that direction.  There is uncertainty about what “well under way” means.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that some people thought the federal funds rate could likely have been in the range mentioned, but then there was a change in the market path and the SEP. This suggests that there are different opinions or disagreements about the future trajectory of the federal funds rate. Additionally, the speaker mentions that there is uncertainty about what "well under way" means, indicating a lack of agreement or consensus on its definition.


Passage number 65.
 January 31–VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  And one more thing.  I think the other thing that happened that made it a little bit more complicated this past intermeeting period is because we talked about the reinvestment policy in the minutes, people started to reevaluate:  “Well, maybe it’s going to happen at a lower federal funds rate than we thought before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 66.
” So our discussion of it may have pulled some people forward— MS. LOGAN.  That’s where I said 17 of the participants did change the level of the rate at which they thought the reinvestments were going to be changed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is disagreement about the impact of the discussion on the participants' perception of the rate at which reinvestments would be changed. One person believes that the discussion pulled some people forward, implying a positive effect, while Ms. Logan states that only 17 participants actually changed their perception, suggesting a different, possibly less significant, outcome.


Passage number 67.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Right.  There are two things going on. CHAIR YELLEN. Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are two things going on, followed by the name of Governor Brainard without providing any further context or information.


Passage number 68.
 MS. BRAINARD. Yes.  I think these questions may be triggered by the same thought process that I’m starting to think about as well as we start to engage in this.  We are going to have to decide if we do tie it to a level of the federal funds rate, then, essentially, you’re priming the market to expect two changes at the same meeting, which I think is a lot to digest. And so we’re going to need to think about potentially separating those things in some clearly communicated way. CHAIR YELLEN. For the next meeting, we’ve planned a number of papers on reinvestment strategy, and it will be our topic of discussion for March.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 69.
 MR. TARULLO.  I have a different topic.  At one of the meetings toward the end of last year, I inquired whether, in light of the changes effected to money market funds by the SEC rule, this might be an opportunity to put some requirements on the nature of our counterparties in the ON RRP.  I think it was Lorie’s report in December about the amount of money that flowed out of prime funds but not into government funds—it’s kind of sloshing around somewhere, we’re not quite sure—that sort of reinforced my thought that if we’re going to do something, this might January 31–be a good time to do it.  Have you had a chance to think any more about how we might go about thinking about that issue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply sharing their thoughts and inquiry on a specific topic, without expressing any disagreement with others.


Passage number 70.
 MS. LOGAN. The staff is looking at that analysis right now.  They’re looking at the counterparties in full. On slide 12 you can see that we were looking at who the counterparties were that were investing at rates below the overnight RRP rate.  We’re preparing that analysis, and when the Committee thinks it’s appropriate, we can bring that in front of the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 71.
 MR. POTTER.  Andreas is going to be talking about part of that issue in his briefing. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, I need a motion to approve open market operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants in the conversation seem to be in agreement about the topics being discussed and there are no opposing views or arguments presented.


Passage number 72.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Let’s now turn to item 10, a review and discussion of the “Economic and Financial Situation.” David Wilcox, Steve Kamin, and Andreas Lehnert will provide the briefings this morning.  And I would like to note that Andreas, who has long served as deputy director of the Board’s Financial Stability Division, has recently been appointed its director. I’m sure I speak for all of us in congratulating Andreas and wishing him all the best with his new responsibilities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 73.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  David, do you want to start.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 74.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Steve, can I go back to this border tax in box 10. I just want to make sure I understand it.  The reason, in the border-tax case, why exports go up—are you assuming implicitly that U.S. exporters will be able to lower their prices to be more competitive overseas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification from Steve and expressing a desire to understand the concept better.


Passage number 75.
 MR. KAMIN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention involving Mr. Kamin.


Passage number 76.
  Yes, that is indeed the assumption, because the export subsidy that is basically implied by the corporate tax system lowers their cost and, thus, allows them to— MR. KAPLAN.  Do you think they will pass it on in prices, which means they will sell more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for the opinion of the person being addressed.


Passage number 77.
 MR. KAMIN. Yes, exactly.  So they can pass it on, and they can sell more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply acknowledges a statement made by someone else without expressing any disagreement or contrasting opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 78.
 MR. KAPLAN.  And that won’t be offset, in your judgment, by the appreciation of the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The passage indicates a potential disagreement or differing opinion. The use of the phrase "in your judgment" implies that there might be a divergence of views on whether the appreciation of the dollar can offset the stated situation.


Passage number 79.
 MR. KAMIN.  It’s partially offset.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only states that something is partially offset, there is no indication of any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 80.
 MR. KAPLAN.  But not completely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: While the statement acknowledges a partial agreement, the use of the word "but" indicates a disagreement or contradiction to some degree.


Passage number 81.
 MR. KAMIN.  But it’s not completely offset.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is not expressing disagreement or contention. It simply states a fact.


Passage number 82.
 MR. KAPLAN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The passage only mentions "MR. KAPLAN" without providing any additional context or information that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 83.
  And then the reason in the tariff case that exports decline is— MR. KAMIN.  Is because in the tariff case, there is no export subsidy.  There is only the imposition of the tariff. But the tariff, by basically raising real GDP and inflation, and improving the trade balance leads to a rise in the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing an explanation of why exports decline in the tariff case. There is no mention of conflicting views or opposing arguments.


Passage number 84.
 MR. KAPLAN.  I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only states "I see" as a response, which does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 85.
 MR. KAMIN.  That rise in the dollar depresses exports.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage states a fact without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 86.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Got it. Okay, thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 87.
   January 31–MR. BULLARD.  Just to follow up on that, am I to understand these charts to show that the dollar does not immediately respond. But if it did immediately respond, and in proportion, the blue lines would show no change, for instance, in real GDP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 88.
 MR. KAMIN. First, as shown in panel 15, the dollar does immediately respond.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply presenting a fact or observation.


Passage number 89.
 MR. BULLARD.  But it doesn’t increase enough.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or indications of disagreement or contention. It simply states that something does not increase enough without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 90.
 MR. KAMIN.  Exactly.  If it did increase fully to offset the border adjustment tax, and if there weren’t some other rigidities that happen to be built into our system—it takes time for trade to adjust, there is some time involved in producers changing prices, and so on.  If those rigidities were not present, and if the dollar went the full amount, then you would get no change in the macroeconomic variables.  And that was the argument that was made by various economists in blogs and newspaper articles and whatnot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. 

The economist is providing arguments against the idea that there would be no change in macroeconomic variables if the dollar went the full amount to offset the border adjustment tax. The economist is suggesting that there are other rigidities in the system that would prevent such a scenario. Therefore, there is a disagreement or contention over the potential macroeconomic effects of the dollar's adjustment.


Passage number 91.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So these are pictures of the rigidities that you think are prevalent in the world that would prevent the theoretical adjustment from occurring.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is simply stating that the pictures represent the rigidities that could prevent theoretical adjustment from occurring.


Passage number 92.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Well, let’s put it this way. The model incorporates rigidities and other factors that we think would prevent the adjustment that would take place in a perfect foresight, general equilibrium, flex-price solution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is explaining that the model incorporates certain factors that would prevent adjustment in a perfect foresight, general equilibrium, flex-price solution.


Passage number 93.
 MR. POTTER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The provided text does not contain enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. It only mentions the name "MR. POTTER" without providing any context or additional details.


Passage number 94.
  But it has some factors in it as well that— MR. KAMIN.  What’s that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply introduces the idea that "it" has some factors.


Passage number 95.
 MR. POTTER. —oil is priced in dollars, things like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states a fact about the pricing of oil in dollars and does not present any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 96.
 MR. KAMIN. There are some factors like that.  In our model, as I have discussed with our modelers, some of those factors aren’t built in.  But let me pick up on Simon’s point.  In rarified models in which the dollar immediately jumps the full amount of the border adjustment tax so there are no changes in any macro variables, that change in the dollar by itself introducesJanuary 31–very substantial wealth effects and very substantial balance sheet effects that indeed might be expected to affect economic activity. Now, those particular financial effects are not actually built into our general equilibrium model anyway.  I suppose they could be.  That would require some fairly advanced modeling of the kind that we are developing, and that would be another reason why you wouldn’t get the instant jump to what’s basically a steady state with an unchanged macroeconomy.  In our case, we generate that through other rigidities, but it is also true that changes in the dollar alone can generate financial effects that would, again, prevent adjustment immediately in the way that some fiscal economists have suggested.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Kamin, discusses how certain factors are not built into their model and suggests that changes in the dollar alone can generate financial effects that would prevent immediate adjustment, contrary to what some fiscal economists have suggested.


Passage number 97.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  And just to be clear, now, you’ve got no reaction of foreign economies to the imposition of a border tax here.  So if they react in a certain symmetric way or something, could that offset what’s shown in these pictures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question seeking clarification on a specific topic.


Passage number 98.
 MR. KAMIN.  Right. In our model, foreign economies do respond with monetary policy tools using the same types of policy reaction functions that we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is describing a model where foreign economies respond with monetary policy tools using similar policy reaction functions. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 99.
 MR. BULLARD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only contains the name "MR. BULLARD," which does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 100.
  But not through tariffs and— MR. KAMIN. Exactly.  But they do not retaliate via tariffs or taxes. If they did, that could, indeed, significantly diminish the short-run benefits of these measures to the United States.  It is worth getting a little bit more specific. Let’s put it this way, if we impose a tariff and they impose a retaliatory tariff, that is very clearly a negative for us.  And that takes our tariff hike, which has some short-run positive effects on real GDP, and immediately makes it negative. We haven’t done this, but I think things get a little bit more complicated if you think about whether, in response to our border adjustment tax, they actually retaliate with their border January 31–adjustment tax.  The reason I say it’s a little bit more complicated is because the border adjustment taxes actually involve subsidies as well as tariffs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker initially suggests that retaliation through tariffs or taxes could diminish the benefits of the measures to the United States. However, another speaker introduces a different perspective, stating that the situation gets more complicated if the other country retaliates with their own border adjustment tax. This suggests differing opinions on whether retaliation through tariffs or taxes would be beneficial or detrimental.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 101.
  And so a subsidy war actually could have the implication of global fiscal expansion, which— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But, Steve, don’t they already have something pretty equivalent in a lot of countries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The phrase "But, Steve" signals a disagreement or counter-argument to the previous statement.


Passage number 102.
 MR. KAMIN.  Some do, but they could enhance them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply suggests that some individuals could enhance their skills.


Passage number 103.
 MR. BULLARD.  I have another question, but it’s on a different topic. CHAIR YELLEN.  How about we complete questions on this topic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 


Passage number 104.
 MR. BULLARD. Okay. CHAIR YELLEN.  And I know, Vice Chairman Dudley, you had a two-hander on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 105.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes.  One thing I just wanted to add.  This is all about goods.  What about services.  I think about tourism.  You move the dollar up by 15 percent, the attractiveness of U.S. tourism goes down, the attractiveness of foreign tourism goes up—so there is a whole bunch of other things that are going to adjust, not just in the goods market or in the financial markets.  There is also a services sector. The question I want to ask you about on this is, my understanding is that there is a real question about whether this would even be legal under the WTO.  How does that actually work. If you implemented the border adjustment tax, and then some countries said, “We want to take this to the WTO,” then don’t you have to wait something like three years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily discusses the potential impacts of a border adjustment tax on the goods and services markets, as well as the legal implications under the World Trade Organization (WTO).


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 106.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, the number I’ve heard for how long the litigation would take is five years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The speaker states a specific number (five years) regarding how long the litigation would take, which could potentially be disputed or disagreed upon by others.


Passage number 107.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Five years.  So essentially it would be a fait accompli for a long time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact that something will be a "fait accompli" for a long time after five years.


Passage number 108.
 January 31–MR. KAMIN.  I think it could indeed be, yes.  I should say that it’s an open question whether this violates WTO rules at all. In principle, wage deductions are not allowed as part of VAT systems under the WTO. CHAIR YELLEN.  But a payroll tax cut, which it is equivalent to, is fine under the WTO.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both speakers are discussing the potential violation of WTO rules by a certain action, but they seem to be in agreement about the possibility.


Passage number 109.
 MR. KAMIN.  Exactly.  If the United States said, “Well, we’re implementing a VAT because that’s an excellent practice, and we’re also cutting payroll taxes.”  We’re not lawyers in our division, but anyway, I think it’s an open issue.  But the point is, even if the WTO decided it was not permissible and other countries sued us, I think it would take quite a while to award them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering a hypothetical scenario and expressing their own opinion on the matter.


Passage number 110.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Okay. CHAIR YELLEN.  Were there other questions on this. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange where one person asks if there are any other questions, and President Lacker's response is not mentioned.


Passage number 111.
 MR. LACKER.  I was a little confused about something involving the exchange with President Bullard.  This rarified case in which the equilibrium reaction of the dollar is 20 percent and completely offsets real effects—I take it you’ve got a handle on what it would take to do that.  And you talked about some impediments, some costs, and those to me sounded like costly adjustments, the kinds of things whose effect would fade over time, which would have led me to expect your blue dollar line to get to 20 percent over time. I must be missing some other rigidity in the way you think about things that permanently impedes the achievement of that result.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing confusion and seeking clarification from the person he is addressing.


Passage number 112.
 MR. KAMIN.  Sure.  I was hoping to avoid getting into this, but I understand that some people are interested in how we make the sausage, so I will proceed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging the audience's interest in understanding the process, although they may have preferred not to discuss it.


Passage number 113.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m interested in the economics of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is simply expressing the speaker's interest in the topic of economics. There is no hint of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 114.
  January 31–MR. KAMIN.  Yes. Our model is a perfect-foresight model.  And so what that means is that in the absence of any of these rigidities, if we basically implemented the border adjustment tax as a fully permanent hike in tariffs and increase in subsidies that would stay that way forever, indeed, in that model, the dollar would jump the full amount of the border adjustment tax.  And you would actually have the unrealistic outcome that I was maligning earlier.  We think that in the real world, market participants who trade foreign currency don’t really have a clearly established view as to what an equilibrium many years down the road will be, and we don’t view that as a very strong attractor of the currency.  And we view the real world as not being subject to perfect foresight. We implemented the simulation in a way that is responsive to that concern.  The border tax and subsidy do not stay absolutely constant and permanent forever.  Instead, there is a very gradual reduction over time in both the border tax and the export subsidy, which is not particularly substantive over the first few years. It just lowers it by a few percentage points, but basically it is enough to unwind the perfect-foresight gravity that otherwise pulls the currency to that longer-run level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply explaining a model and the adjustments made to account for real-world conditions.


Passage number 115.
 MR. LACKER.  And why did you do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question without any conflicting perspectives or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 116.
 MR. KAMIN.  Because the combination of the perfect foresight assumption and a permanent border adjustment tax gave you a highly unrealistic outcome, and the best way to proxy for the genuine uncertainty that in the real world agents would have about where the currency would go and to what extent trade balance considerations would push the currency would just be to introduce this very, very gradual degradation of the initial policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing a hypothetical scenario and suggesting a way to address a potential issue with it.


Passage number 117.
   January 31–VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Are there any models that actually try to build in the financial side to figure out what happens to the relative value of foreign assets and domestic assets and solve it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply asks whether there are models that consider the financial side and analyze the changes in the value of foreign and domestic assets. It does not express any disagreement or contention; it is a neutral question seeking information.


Passage number 118.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, we are developing those, but they are certainly not in the stage at which they could be applied to this particular example.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the development of certain things is underway, but they are not yet at a stage where they can be applied to a specific example. There is no contention or disagreement present in the statement.


Passage number 119.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But that’s what you would want, ideally.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement expresses a personal opinion or desire, indicating what the speaker considers as an ideal outcome. There is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 120.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 121.
 MR. LACKER. You both backed away from perfect foresight and you didn’t introduce it as a permanent change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is stating a fact about both parties' actions without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 122.
 You made it a slowly— MR. KAMIN.  Well, no, we kept the perfect foresight but made the shock a little less permanent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It describes a decision made to slow down a process but maintain perfect foresight with less permanent shock.


Passage number 123.
 MR. LACKER.  Oh, I see.  So you did that in order to simulate less-than-perfect foresight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states an observation or understanding.


Passage number 124.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Well, in order to simulate a situation in the real world in which agents don’t have a clear sense of exactly where the exchange rate would be going over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact or making an observation about simulating a real-world situation.


Passage number 125.
 MR. WILCOX.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 126.
  It’s probably also worth mentioning that, Bill, we do expect some very powerful constituencies to line up in opposition to the enactment of— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The retail sector, in particular, is quite geared up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is simply mentioning that there may be powerful constituencies that will oppose the enactment of something, specifically mentioning the retail sector as one example.


Passage number 127.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  And they are not the only ones.  For example, an issue with the tax would be that exporters would be in a position of having zero tax liability.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states a fact about the potential tax liability of exporters.


Passage number 128.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The provided passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 129.
  Well, they would have negative tax—  January 31–MR. WILCOX.  Well, negative tax liability under the version of the bill that was introduced by Brady and Ryan.  It would not be refundable, so the Treasury wouldn’t be writing checks to exporters, but they would be in a position of paying no taxes forevermore.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement about the potential negative tax liability under a specific version of a bill introduced by Brady and Ryan.


Passage number 130.
 MR. KAMIN.  And if they were combined with other companies that had a lot of taxes, then it would be like they’d get the straight amount.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any elements of contention or disagreement. It simply states a hypothetical scenario without conflicting viewpoints or opposing positions.


Passage number 131.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  That’s right. One of my colleagues had the interesting observation that this would give rise to an incentive for Wal-Mart to merge with Boeing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a statement made by Mr. Wilcox regarding a colleague's observation.


Passage number 132.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  There’s your synergy. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I’ve got President Rosengren and then President Kashkari afterward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a lighthearted exchange between participants.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 133.
 MR. ROSENGREN. My question is for Andreas.  It’s in exhibit 1, “Spread of Capitalization Rate at Origination to Treasury Yield.” I’m just wondering whether that is the most relevant comparison, because when I think about cap rates for commercial real estate, they are very slow moving.  And when I think of how Treasury yields have moved, they tend to move very quickly.  If you look at December, it looks like a 1 percent decline in that measure.  But I think that’s because Treasury yields went up, not because there was a big movement in commercial real estate prices.  And, in fact, much of this movement seems to be driven by Treasury yields rather than commercial real estate valuations.  So I just wonder whether you think this is the most useful way to determine valuation in the commercial real estate market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren is questioning whether the comparison of the spread of capitalization rate at origination to treasury yield is the most relevant comparison for determining valuation in the commercial real estate market. He argues that cap rates for commercial real estate are slow-moving while treasury yields tend to move quickly. He also suggests that the movement in the measure is more driven by treasury yields rather than commercial real estate valuations. Therefore, there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 134.
 MR. LEHNERT.  This has the notable value of being easy to grasp, easy to present, and also telling the right story.  So, first, in terms of what actually happened to the level of the cap rate, I was interested to see that it actually ticked down in December. For whatever reason, rents weren’t keeping pace with the price increases we saw then.January 31–A bunch of our colleagues here have looked in more depth at commercial real estate valuations and are actually trying to incorporate fundamentals such as vacancy rates, rent growth, and interest rates but, let’s say, in a richer fashion.  And the upshot of all of that is that valuation pressures are notable in CRE. It really does feel that in a lot of markets and for certain property types, people are paying over the odds in terms of their history. It’s not as extreme as it got in 2005 and 2006, but it’s on par with maybe the late ’90s in terms of valuation pressure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their observations and opinions about commercial real estate valuations.


Passage number 135.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Rosengren simply expresses gratitude while Chair Yellen acknowledges President Lacker. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 136.
 MR. LACKER.  There are others in front of me, I think. CHAIR YELLEN.  Sure.  President Bullard, you had another question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange where one person acknowledges that there are other people ahead of them to ask a question.


Passage number 137.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a question on the “Material for Briefing on the U.S. Outlook,” Forecast Summary page, the Unemployment Rate chart, which is panel 4.  We’re using confidence bands around this, which are 70 percent confidence intervals.  If you look at this band, I’m wondering how comfortable we should be with this.  This band shows 70 percent confidence intervals of 3 to 5 percent two years, three years out. It looks pretty symmetric. It’s putting about a 15 percent probability on a less than 3 percent unemployment rate and almost no probability on a more than 6 percent unemployment rate. I’m wondering what we should do as the unemployment rate goes down.  Does this distribution get more skewed to the upside because there’s some probability you go back into recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and expressing curiosity about the distribution of the unemployment rate.


Passage number 138.
 MR. WILCOX.  We made an effort at trying to show that on page 67 of the Tealbook.  The confidence intervals that you’re pointing to in the exhibit that I passed around are generated out of FRB/US, and those have a number of operational or logistical conveniences associated with them. We can generate them under almost any circumstance, at any given time. We canJanuary 31–project them out a long way because the FRB/US model doesn’t get tired [laughter], unlike human analysts. What’s shown on page 67 of Tealbook A is an effort to go in your direction and take account of actual characteristics, including asymmetries in the forecast intervals.  Now, these are based on actual track records of staff forecasts.  And what you see in the upper-left panel is that the confidence interval is asymmetric in the way that you described.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Wilcox is explaining the process and characteristics of the confidence intervals being discussed.


Passage number 139.
 MR. BULLARD.  And so could we use this, or you’re not ready to report that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a simple question about whether a particular piece of information can be used or reported.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 140.
 MR. WILCOX.  Well, to paraphrase the line from the movie, I’m not sure who this “we” is, Kemosabe.  [Laughter]  We provide you with these confidence intervals that are shown in the Tealbook, but for purposes of putting together the kinds of exhibits that I show regularly, my own preference here is to continue using FRB/US-model-generated confidence intervals. We do cross-check them against one another to make sure that the model’s confidence intervals don’t stray in their characteristics too awfully far from the others.  I was going to call on either Dave or Jeremy Rudd.  In general, my impression is that the FRB/US model’s confidence intervals are a little narrower than the actual judgmental track record has been.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses a preference for using FRB/US-model-generated confidence intervals, while also acknowledging that they may not always align with the "actual judgmental track record." This suggests a disagreement or difference of opinion in terms of which confidence intervals should be used.


Passage number 141.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I think the question that you’re getting at is actually not addressed by either the FRB/US or by the Tealbook errors, because what you’re getting at is an issue called “state contingent” confidence intervals.  So David’s asymmetry would apply.  What you see in the Tealbook would apply if the unemployment rate was 7 percent.  They’ve got a sample skewness there, but it’s not conditional on being at 4 percent unemployment. In FRB/US, that’s not computed that way either, partly because the way it’s run is that it doesn’t think that the errors or the shocks or that the mechanism of the economy is any different whether the unemployment rate is at 5 percent or 6 percent or 4 percent. But there is a literature   January 31–that says that things look different when the unemployment rate is very low versus when the unemployment rate is very high.  So nothing the staff has available at this point gets at the issue that you’re raising, but people have worked on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing explanations and clarifications, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 142.
 MR. WILCOX.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Insufficient information. The passage provided does not give enough context to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 143.
  We just simply don’t visit 4 percent unemployment often enough to have— MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  It’s very difficult to get reliable statistics using historical errors to get at this issue you’re raising.  In theory, you could do it with a model, but you’d have to have a model that has different states of the world and in which the dynamics change in different states of the world.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers are providing information and discussing the difficulty of obtaining reliable statistics in regards to unemployment rates.


Passage number 144.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, I appreciate your answer.  I just want to stress that we probably shouldn’t be putting a lot of probability on unemployment outcomes that we’ve not really observed in the postwar era.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing appreciation for the response and emphasizing the importance of not giving too much weight to unemployment outcomes that haven't been observed in the postwar era.


Passage number 145.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement as it only states a response without presenting conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 146.
 MR. EVANS.  Can I ask you a clarifying question. I should know how these are calculated, but I’ve forgotten. The uncertainty here—how much of it is associated with parameter uncertainty, and how much is realization of shocks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a request for clarification about the calculation of uncertainty.


Passage number 147.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  In the FRB/US model, it’s all shocks.  But in the Tealbook errors, it’s everything that could go wrong—it’s the actual errors that were made over history.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply presents two different perspectives or approaches (shocks vs. errors) without indicating any conflict between them.


Passage number 148.
 MR. EVANS.  Because I’m sure we’ve all been out in public and you run into somebody and they say, “Oh, you are terrible at forecasting,” right.  Things like that.  In my mind, I always think of this as, well, I’ve either got a model that I like or don’t like.  That’s parameter uncertainty.  And then, of course, a year or two from now things happen, like trying to explain why Alabama lost the championship game because the running back got taken out of the game.  IJanuary 31–mean, who thinks of that.  It’s not the forecaster that was so much at fault, but it’s events that took place.  And this is all about events, isn’t it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the speaker's personal perspective on forecasting and the potential factors that can affect predictions.


Passage number 149.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes, and that’s the advantage of using the Tealbook errors, because those are the errors that are associated with stuff that actually happened.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating the advantage of using the Tealbook errors as they are errors associated with actual events.


Passage number 150.
  The only question would be: Is the 20-year period, or whatever we use, is that— MR. WILCOX. Can we just level-set what we’re talking about.  The confidence intervals that are shown, for example, in panel 1 of my forecast summary are generated under the assumption that the model structure is known, that the parameters are known, and that the only relevant source of uncertainty is the error term that attaches to each of however many behavioral equations there are—40 equations, or something like that. The confidence intervals that are shown in Tealbook A, page 67, are based on our actual track record and, therefore, encompass in principle both that event shock but also model uncertainty, parameter uncertainty.  In principle, they’re all-encompassing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly consists of clarifications and explanations regarding different types of confidence intervals.


Passage number 151.
 MR. EVANS.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a dialogue between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen. There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in this short excerpt.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 152.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  Since the election, there’s been this major move in equity values, and it’s about 8 or 9 percent, so I was really eager to get my financial stability memo, because that’s where I was figuring I could count on an assessment of this thing that gets debated in the press, which is the extent to which this represents a warranted revision of the fundamentals underlying dividend growth or not.  And I was a little disappointed by the extent of your discussion of that question.  I was happy there was an interesting box in the Tealbook about dividend growth projections.  That seemed informative.  But I was yearning to hear you tell us [laughter] whether equity moves have outstripped the move in fundamentals. January 31–Now, there was something in there about historical percentiles, and that got me thinking, well, maybe when you say valuation pressures, I should just take that as a statistical term about historical things even though things change in the future.  And maybe the valuation change is warranted even though it’s out in the tail of historical distribution.  Could you help me with this, Andreas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses dissatisfaction and disappointment with the extent of the discussion about the revision of the fundamentals underlying dividend growth. He is yearning for clarification and guidance on whether the recent equity moves have outstripped the move in fundamentals. This suggests a disagreement or difference of opinion on how to interpret and assess the current market situation.


Passage number 153.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Yes.  I guess we don’t want to be in the business of telling the Board or the Committee whether valuations are right. I think we have a certain level of humility about all of those things, and so the most that we can do is tell you, given the best models that are available, are we looking at something that’s “rich” or “cheap” by historical standards.  And then, we also—again, learning a lesson from the 2005–06 experience—look at nonprice measures of excitement or, for want of a better term, “heat” in the financial system. So, I wish that our models could tell us the probability of a big decline in asset prices so that we could build that in.  But, as you know, by the efficient markets hypothesis, those are hard to sustain, hence the pointing to historical experience. I wouldn’t describe it as a purely statistical exercise, again, because we’re bringing in a lot of these nonprice measures. In the case of the equity market, one could debate whether earnings trajectories should be marked up, in fact.  It does seem that it’s not a time when we’re at a two-year low in terms of the uncertainty about that issue.  I hope that satisfied you a little bit. I’m sorry to disappoint you, President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lehnert is explaining the limitations of their models and the approach they take in assessing valuations and risks in the financial system. There is no opposition or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 154.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, I do find that informative.  I’ve always been curious about the relationship between the efficient markets hypothesis and the work of the Financial Stability Division.  That clarification is helpful.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses gratitude for the clarification provided.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 155.
  January 31–MR. KAPLAN.  I hate to get into this discussion, but I’ll just make one comment, which maybe hasn’t been talked about enough.  The mean estimates of the value, right or wrong, of a corporate tax reduction, even to 25 percent, are about $9 per share, annualized.  So if you take $126 and take that to $135, you could also argue it may be more than just animal spirits.  Some of that increase from a corporate tax reduction is being reflected in the market—who knows how much, but it’s probably a good bet that some of it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that some of the increase in the market is being reflected due to a corporate tax reduction, while acknowledging that the exact amount is uncertain. This suggests that there may be differing opinions or debates about the extent to which the corporate tax reduction is affecting the market.


Passage number 156.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Of course, that’s assuming that the corporations get to keep those profits, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is merely making an assumption and seeking confirmation.


Passage number 157.
  I mean, there’s a competitive— MR. KAPLAN.  Of course.  But it just gives you a sense of—for people running models, which people on the buy-side do—that’s the best estimate I’ve heard that people have congealed around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 158.
 MR. LACKER.  So it makes it seem plausible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a matter of fact rather than as a conflicting argument.


Passage number 159.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Yes. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both MR. KAPLAN and CHAIR YELLEN are in agreement.


Passage number 160.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, thank you. First of all, I want to thank Steve for tackling the border adjustment tax issue.  This is a really consequential piece of legislation, and if it were actually enacted, it would have really big implications for how we think about the world on this Committee.  So I hope that you keep digging into this even though we don’t have the greatest models in the world to look at this, but this is a really big deal if it were to actually pass. Second, I just want to say that there was a comment about the Michigan survey in terms of the political affiliation. We were quite interested in that, so we took a look at the implications for our own survey, the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations. We don’t capture political affiliation. Instead we looked at if you’re a Republican county, if you’re a Democratic  January 31–county, if you’re in between, and we found the same exact results.  The confidence went up in the Republican counties.  It went down in the Democratic counties.  So, obviously, it’s not as big an effect because counties aren’t a person, but it very much corroborates the results of the University of Michigan. And, finally, I had a question for Andreas.  In the border discussion, you passed over the deductibility of interest. If you did get rid of the deductibility of interest, how are we thinking about that. Because I remember the Tax Reform Act of ’86, which changed the depreciation rules quite substantially and had huge consequences for real estate.  What do we think would happen if we got rid of the deductibility of interest and we started to think about that.  Are there instances in which relative prices would change in a big way, and are there things we should be nervous about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude, providing additional information, and asking a question for clarification.


Passage number 161.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Yes—I mean, if that goes through to actually eliminate the mortgage interest deduction.  Of course, also, the mortgage interest deduction becomes less valuable as you cut personal income tax rates. It does seem that house prices would fall as a result.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. Although there is a discussion about the potential effects of eliminating the mortgage interest deduction and the decrease in value due to reduced personal income tax rates, it does not involve conflicting viewpoints or differing opinions.


Passage number 162.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I was thinking more on the corporate side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts about wanting to focus more on the corporate side.


Passage number 163.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Yes, but house prices are, from a stability perspective, quite a big deal.  And I should also advertise my colleague David Rappoport’s recent working paper on this topic, which gives some estimates of the size of the change in house prices. On the corporate side, the deductibility of interest is one of those wedges between the public and private cost of debt.  In principle, especially for the financial services industry, you ought to eliminate one of those areas in which there is a private desire to maintain leverage.  But, again, a foregone tax revenue is a social cost—and, of course, there is also the deadweight cost of a higher-leveraged system.  Now, I don’t think at this point that the tax engineering is the mostJanuary 31–important determinant of financial firms’ credit structure.  I think regulations and so forth are the driver there. Then looking at the nonfinancial sector, it does seem like that’s the sort of thing that might take a little bit of gas off the fire of corporate borrowing. It does seem that the corporations that are borrowing the most are the ones that have or anticipate having the biggest growth in their cash flows.  So it seems like a betting on expansion rather than, again, financial engineering.  And, again, it does feel like the credit cycle on the corporate side seems to have slowed notably in the past few quarters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily presents the speaker's thoughts and observations on various topics related to house prices, corporate debt, and credit cycles.


Passage number 164.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It seems like removing the deductibility of interest would actually make the system more stable, right, because you’d have less incentive to take on a lot of leverage in the system.  But there’d be some big adjustment costs as you move to the new equilibrium.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement followed by a hypothetical question, discussing the potential effects of removing the deductibility of interest.


Passage number 165.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Yes, exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lehnert is simply agreeing with or confirming a statement made by someone else.


Passage number 166.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any further questions. We now have an opportunity to comment on financial stability, and a few people have indicated a desire to do so.  Let’s turn to that next, starting with President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply thanking and asking if there are any further questions before moving on to a different topic.


Passage number 167.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The QS report did a nice job of highlighting that Federal Home Loan Banks are increasingly funding illiquid real estate assets with short-term borrowing from government money market funds, and Andreas covered that a bit in his presentation as well.  Money market funds now hold over 50 percent of the debt issued by Federal Home Loan Banks, up from 30 percent in 2014, and the Federal Home Loan Banks with some of the weakest reported capital ratios have been some of the most aggressive issuers of   January 31–liabilities. Over the three years ending in September 2016, two of the Federal Home Loan Banks with among the lowest capital ratios increased discount issuance by more than 200 percent. Thus, while recent money market reforms have diminished the financial stability risks of runs on prime money market funds that have taken losses, in one respect, the benefit may not have been as great as it appears.  While banks now receive less direct funding from prime money market funds, banks are increasingly the recipients of funds coming indirectly from government money market funds through the Federal Home Loan Banks. Should real estate values sink and confidence about the implicit government backing of the Federal Home Loan Banks drop, investors might run from funds with large Federal Home Loan Bank exposures, especially if those Federal Home Loan Banks are weakly capitalized. Alternatively, the money market funds themselves might choose to sharply reduce their holdings of Federal Home Loan Bank liabilities. While this might seem unlikely, it is the unexpected violation of widely held assumptions that tends to generate financial stability problems. Furthermore, it should serve as a reminder that declines in real estate values can cause problems through a variety of channels, and we should not be overconfident that we understand fully how such a decline in real estate values would affect the financial system.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating facts and raising potential concerns about the funding of illiquid real estate assets by Federal Home Loan Banks.


Passage number 168.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 169.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you.  Governor Powell gave a very nice speech at the American Economic Association meetings highlighting an issue that we talk about a lot in terms of monetary policy, and that I’d like to see more research and study of.  In particular, that’s the relationship between very low interest rates and a flat yield curve, on the one hand, and financial stability, on the other hand—by that I mean incentives to take on leverage, risk-taking, and bank profitability.January 31–In Governor Powell’s speech, he talked a lot about the current context: very low interest rates and the tradeoffs in monetary policy and goals.  But, from my perspective, if r*, the natural rate of interest, really does stay close to zero or very low around the world as current estimates indicate, I think that these issues are actually going to be with us for a very long time.  And thinking through this very low rate and also our large balance sheet—a very flat yield curve may be around for maybe another decade. It raises a number of issues that are not just about the current cyclical state of the United States, but, I think more importantly, maybe a longer-term global issue that we are going to need to be focusing on in terms of longer-term strategies. So what I’m highlighting is, I would love to see more analysis and research so we understand what these tradeoffs are likely to be in the long run, even as we normalize monetary policy in the United States.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is the opinion of the speaker that more research and study is needed regarding the relationship between low interest rates and financial stability. The speaker also expresses a concern that these issues will persist for a long time. There is no counterargument or disagreement presented in the passage.


Passage number 170.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks, Madam Chair.  Like you, I would like to thank Nellie for her devoted and successful service in building up what is now the Financial Stability Division and in populating it with high-quality analysts, among them Andreas, who has taken over as director.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and praise towards Nellie and Andreas for their successful service and contributions to the Financial Stability Division.


Passage number 171.
 MR. TARULLO.  She’s not going to hear this compliment for five years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a straightforward statement that suggests someone will not hear a compliment for a certain period of time.


Passage number 172.
  [Laughter] MR. FISCHER. Has she actually stepped down. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 173.
 MR. LEHNERT.  Today is her very last day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a fact - that it is the very last day for someone. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 174.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  So I can tell her.  If I call her before midnight.  [Laugher] We all wish Andreas success in his important role. In view of the length of today’s discussion so far, I’ll speak briefly and pointedly, and I want to make a few points.  I’m talking about the basic things that are going on in the financial   January 31–system and that are likely to be with us for a while.  First, the macroprudential tools for the regulators and supervisors of the financial system are inadequate.  We here have considerable control over lending in the large part of the financial system that we supervise, but we do not have the authority that regulators in many other countries have to set loan-to-value or debt-service-to-income ratios on mortgages, or both.  Because major financial crises frequently involve real estate financing, this is an important problem.  Now, in effect, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have this authority over the mortgages they insure, but their authority has not been used for countercyclical purposes. Second, we don’t have adequate tools to deal with much of the shadow banking system.  There has been a major success in dealing with money market mutual funds, but the shadow banking system will likely be the source of instabilities for years to come, and it will be the focus of a major part of the division’s work program this year. Third, nine years after the start of the great financial crisis, international negotiations over one basic element of the regulatory system, the risk weighting of bank-held assets, remains under discussion.  Studies of the differences in risk weights assigned to the same asset by different banks led to the conclusion that there should be a substantial role for a standard set of risk weights in calculating risk-weighted assets.  The negotiations over this issue continue, and it’s important to conclude them. In that regard, we should applaud the role that Governor Tarullo is playing on this and other issues. Fourth, and this goes back a while, the provisions limiting the Federal Reserve’s ability to operate as a lender of last resort in a crisis are untested and could constrain the execution of this critical function, a constraint whose cost to the economy could be very high.  January 31–Now, nothing I’m saying should be construed as a criticism of what has been achieved since the start of the Global Financial Crisis.  Our financial system is much more robust than it was a decade ago. At the same time, we should recognize that much of what our regulators do is to carry out an intelligence function, and, as we know, intelligence agencies have all had their failures and their crises. We thus need not only to reduce the probability of crises, on which there has been an enormous emphasis up to now, but we need also to be prepared to deal with them when they arise, for they will arise. Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It mainly discusses the limitations and challenges faced by regulators and supervisors in the financial system.


Passage number 175.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you.  I found the quarterly assessment of risks to financial stability interesting and helpful, as always.  The key “takeaways” are fairly straightforward. Valuation pressures have risen to “notable” for the first time in a year, while financial-sector leverage remains low and risks associated with maturity and liquidity transformation have moved lower. The reassurance we derive from the assessments of low risks associated with financial-sector leverage and liquidity and maturity transformation is due, in very large part, to the core reforms that we and other regulators have put in place in line with our statutory responsibilities in recent years and months.  The low leverage and sounder liquidity and funding practices in the systemic banking institutions at the core of our financial markets are critically important to the overall moderate assessment of vulnerabilities. And the recent implementation of money market reform is also noteworthy, with assets in prime money market funds having fallen more than two-thirds over the past year, well above what had been anticipated, which has been accomplished with minimal disruptions to domestic funding markets so far.  January 31–Looking ahead, I would view with much greater alarm a buildup of valuation pressures and evidence of increased risk appetite if these developments were accompanied with any erosion in the core rules that are in place to reduce systemic risk and undergird financial stability. For these reasons, I think continued vigilance is very important.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing appreciation and agreement with the assessments made in the quarterly assessment of risks to financial stability.


Passage number 176.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you.  I have been spending considerable time trying to figure out what message we’re getting from markets.  Normally when uncertainty climbs, risk premiums increase, the equity market falls, and credit spreads widen, but that’s not what we’ve seen post-election.  So what’s going on.  And should we worry about the risk of a sharp reversal. I don’t profess to have the answer to this, but I’ll make a couple of tentative observations. First, I think the markets are doing well in spite of greater uncertainty, because I think there’s a perception that the risk of a near-term U.S. recession has dropped.  And because of the perception that the prospect of political gridlock in Washington has diminished, the sharp narrowing that we saw in high-yield OAS spreads is consistent with this notion that Simon talked about, that recession risks have diminished in the near term. I also think that the international outlook does appear to have improved somewhat, even though there was a downshift in the growth rate in the last quarter.  We’ve had a recovery in commodity prices.  The dollar has appreciated, which we think is important because it removes some of the deflationary pressure on Europe and Japan.  And I have been surprised that Brexit has not had really bad consequences, at least yet, for U.K. economic performance beyond the weakness that we see in sterling.  So a lot of the things that we were worried about haven’t materialized, and so that seems to be supportive for greater optimism.January 31–Now, on the issue of the anxiety about European banks, I agree with Steve that the concern about that has receded.  My own view is that while the sentiment about European banks has improved, the underlying situation really hasn’t changed much.  There are a few key systemic banks that still have inadequate capital. They still have poor earnings outlooks.  There are still questions about the viability of their long-term business models. So this is an issue that has maybe gone away from a sentiment perspective, but it’s still really there in terms of the fundamentals. Now, the fact that the markets are buoyant now, in my mind, could just be setting us up for a bigger, sharper correction or adjustment later.  I can imagine that, if we got a program of substantial fiscal stimulus, that could push the U.S. economy well beyond full employment. In that situation, we might have to slam on the brakes pretty hard, and that might increase the risk of a large rise in bond yields, a much slower stock market, and a recession.  Now, that’s not priced in.  That’s over the horizon. Or the professed goal of the Trump administration, to get tough on trade, could lead not necessarily to better trade deals for the United States, but just a significant increase in trade barriers and the resultant bad set of consequences that would flow from that, including higher inflation.  So it seems to me that we may be trading a greater likelihood of a sustained expansion over the next year or two for a greater likelihood of a hard landing later. I’m not sure if that’s a major financial stability risk, but it does imply a higher likelihood of greater stress on the system and much greater price volatility at some stage. And if that were to occur, that could expose some inherent weaknesses in our financial system that’s been in a long period of moderate growth and a long period of relatively low financial market volatility.January 31–I think there are already some warning signs of excess in addition to what was talked about earlier:  Used-car pricing assumptions that are used in auto leasing seem awfully optimistic; multifamily capitalization rates are very low; and also the overhang of retail property is getting a lot of attention in New York as more retail sales migrate to the Internet. Now, the retail property sector in the United States is very overbuilt.  If you look at the space per capita in the United States compared with other countries in retailing, we have multiples of the space per capita of most other countries, and, with more volumes shifting to the Internet, the pace of store closings is increasing. Following the holiday season, we saw a whole series of store-closing announcements from Macy’s, J.C. Penney, and Sears.  In fact, the Limited declared bankruptcy, and they’re closing all their stores. The good news on the retail side is, it’s not that big of a sector if you look at it relative to, say, housing, and it looks like the debt exposure is pretty broadly distributed across a lot of different players: insurance companies, REITs, pensions, other institutional investors, as well as depository institutions. But it does seem like this is a sector that we can be almost certain is going to be under fundamental pressure in the years ahead.  So I would just encourage the staff to maybe do a little bit of a “deeper dive” into that particular sector. Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.

Passage number 177.
  If there are no further comments on— MR. FISCHER.  Could I just ask a question. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple exchange between Mr. Fischer and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 178.
 MR. FISCHER. Vice Chairman Dudley, do we count Amazon as part of the retail sector.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question is seeking clarification or confirmation about whether Amazon is considered part of the retail sector.


Passage number 179.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes, it’s part of the retail sector, but it’s not part of the retail store space.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any statements or ideas that could be interpreted as contentious or disagreeing. It simply establishes a distinction between the described subject (part of the retail sector) and another category (retail store space).


Passage number 180.
   January 31–MR. FISCHER. It’s not part of the real estate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a statement made by Mr. Fischer without any contrasting opinions.


Passage number 181.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Well, there’s real estate.  They have warehouses rather than malls. So it’s not like the real estate is going to go away.  As you pull dollars out of the malls, you’re going to put them into the warehouses.  But I expect the warehouses probably have a much higher retail sales density rate than the malls.  So, on net, there’s probably quite a bit less real estate, and those warehouses are not necessarily located where malls are located. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating different perspectives and observations about the real estate industry.


Passage number 182.
 MR. KAPLAN. I’m going to ask one more question.  I was going to ask it earlier, but I used up my questions.  This is on page 107 of the data sheets.  I see we go out to 2019 on government debt and the size of the deficit.  The CBO graph shows there’s going to be a “hockey stick” in the next five years, and my concern is, depending on what fiscal policies are, in fact, implemented, we could have an even further deterioration of this situation.  I can see how, when the next recession hits, the fiscal situation will possibly have deteriorated meaningfully from where we are today, and the FOMC will be the entity to which everyone looks for a response. So, in light of the growth in entitlement spending projected by the CBO, I think it might be useful to extend the charts on page 107 to 2020 and beyond, even if it’s in summary fashion.  I just think it would be useful to look at this projected deterioration.  I have a funny feeling in the years ahead we’re going to be looking at the debt and deficit outlook a lot more closely as maybe a very high source of instability that we will be increasingly expected to deal with. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I suggest we take a break for about 20 minutes.  We will resume around 3:30. [Coffee break]  January 31–CHAIR YELLEN.  Let’s get going again.  I think we’re now ready to being our economic go-round.  President Lacker is going to start us off.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 183.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Our surveys, and reports received from business contacts, indicated that economic activity in the Fifth District continued to strengthen since the previous FOMC meeting.  The manufacturing survey improved for the third consecutive month and indicated solid activity in January, led by increases in shipments and new orders.  Service-sector activity also continued to expand more broadly since the December meeting.  Expectations regarding activity over the next six months improved in both surveys as well. The overall tone from contacts continued to be quite positive, although there was some uncertainty expressed regarding potential changes in fiscal and trade policy.  A number of contacts reported increased business investment or plans to increase investment in 2017.  One of our directors whose firm fabricates and installs structural steel for large commercial buildings indicated that he was very bullish about the economy, and his company was purchasing equipment and planning a new facility.  A leading manufacturer of gypsum board, cement boards, and finishing products reported a jump in capital expenditures for 2017.  Contacts in the auto and industrial supply sector reported strong investment as well. Comments from our service-sector contacts were positive, on balance, as well.  An engineering firm reported strong demand and so much difficulty finding workers that they were declining projects.  A banker noted that consumer and commercial demand had been healthy and that business was “currently as good as it gets.” He also said that he had heard strong optimism from customers, who indicated that they were investing in real estate and infrastructure for their companies. A staffing agency specializing in accounting, finance, and human resources reported January 31–a very strong December and January due to tight labor market conditions and noted that firms were using fewer temporary workers and instead were looking more for direct hires. She further noted that this was making it difficult for staffing agencies to maintain a deep temporary labor pool. Not all of our contacts were positive, however.  A dealer in heavy construction equipment noted that customer doubts about their pipeline were causing them to lease equipment rather than buy. Several contacts in the transportation industry noted that conditions were improving but remained weak.  A number of contacts relayed concerns regarding upcoming federal policy changes, including the potential repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act as well as trade and fiscal policy. A defense industry executive noted that there was tremendous uncertainty in their sector, citing the federal hiring freeze and the lengthy confirmation process for agency leadership.  In addition, she noted that potential shifts in U.S. diplomatic posture in some regions could cause foreign governments to reevaluate strategic alignments and shift their defense acquisition strategies toward non-U.S. suppliers. Turning to the national economy: I agree with the staff’s assessment that the usual statistical reports provide little reason to alter the outlook.  U.S. households have benefitted from robust employment growth and are expecting further improvements in labor market conditions. Thus, consumer spending was strong in the fourth quarter and is likely to be solid in the current quarter and beyond, even in the absence of tax cuts.  Rising employment, rising incomes, and rising consumer sentiment should all support continued growth in consumer spending. The residential outlook for this year is more opaque.  It is possible that rising household formation will boost the demand for new homes and support growth in residential investment,January 31–but it’s not clear that supply constraints on new home construction are easing, and their continuation would be a headwind for residential investments. And a firmer rate environment could damp demand this year, as the Tealbook suggests. The Tealbook forecast includes strong growth in non-residential fixed investment this year, and I agree with that outlook based in part on incoming data, such as the increase in oil drilling and the firming of new orders for capital goods.  But I also put some weight on the improvement in business sentiment since the election.  In addition to the anecdotes, such as those I cited earlier, there’s a notable jump in small business optimism that was reported by the NFIB, and the Conference Board’s measures of CEO sentiment have risen notably in the fourth quarter as well. In short, the consideration of the usual spending measures supports a forecast of overall growth continuing at an above-trend rate, which should lead to additional tightening in labor markets. In the near term, I would expect employment growth to average near last quarter’s pace of 165,000 jobs per month.  That’s below the Tealbook’s first-half estimate of 183,000 jobs per month.  Even so, my forecast is more than double the benchmark for breakeven employment growth, so I expect a continued decline in the unemployment rate or an increase in the labor force participation rate or both. The significant rise in inflation breakevens since the election has been noteworthy, I think.  The 10-year breakeven is now 10 basis points higher than it was in October 2014, the first meeting at which our statement mentioned that inflation expectations had declined.  This supports the case that inflation will rise toward 2 percent even if it is held down temporarily by base effects in the near term.   January 31–I continue to anticipate the need for policy rates to rise briskly this year, and we may need to move at non-press-conference meetings, in my view.  In any case, I fervently hope we’ll increase rates a few times before I retire.

Passage number 185.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Incoming data since the previous meeting have not changed the forecast I had in December.  My current forecast is similar to that of the Tealbook forecast.  My policy assumption is also similar for 2017. My modal forecast calls for four increases, but with the acknowledgement of the possibility that more rapid tightening may be in order in the out-years, in order to prevent a large overshoot of full employment in the labor market. The private-sector forecast for 2017, which is the Blue Chip consensus forecast, like the Tealbook and my forecast, has the unemployment rate falling to 4½ percent by the end of this year, with the decline continuing in 2018.  The December median SEP differs from my forecast in that the SEP unemployment rate median gets to 4½ percent at the end of this year and remains there. despite the real GDP growth forecast over the next three years averaging 2 percent.  In contrast, I expect the economy to grow somewhat faster than 2 percent, which is above my estimate of potential at 1¾ percent, and, as a consequence, I expect the downward trend in the unemployment rate to continue. My somewhat higher growth in part reflects the assumption that we will have fiscal stimulus at the magnitude in the Tealbook.  The assumed increase in fiscal policy stimulus is consistent with the financial market movements we have seen, including the significantly higher prices in stock indexes and improvements in numerous indexes of business and consumer January 31–confidence. While many aspects of fiscal policy are unclear, actions taken to date do seem consistent with a lower corporate tax rate and an emphasis on significantly reducing government regulations.  Regardless of whether the movements in stock prices and confidence indexes reflect diminished risk aversion, confidence that fiscal stimulus makes a downturn in the near term less likely, or animal spirits released by the promise of lower taxes and less regulation, I do think that the positive movements we have seen since November do imply the possibility of growth as fast as, if not faster than, the Tealbook. However, the modal forecast does not capture possible heightened tail risk.  Indeed, threats of possible trade wars, fiscal hiring freezes, or an abrupt end to the ACA make me concerned that downside tail risks may be elevated.  However, it is noteworthy that financial markets seem to have priced in much less risk with stock market volatility indexes at surprisingly low levels. The possibility that labor markets become tighter and cause more wage pressure is addressed in one of the alternative scenarios in the Tealbook.  My staff looked at whether tight labor markets were generating higher wage pressures by looking at the CPS microdata, which allow one to control for compositional effects, such as varying productivity and price- and wage-setting patterns across industries that make it difficult to isolate the effect of labor market slack in some aggregate wage measures. They find that the relationship between nominal wage growth and labor market tightness has strengthened recently and is consistent with the pickup in wages evident in the Atlanta Fed wage tracker.  Such a finding suggests we may not have the luxury of waiting long to return to a more normalized monetary policy.  The data are also consistent with evidence that we have undershot the natural rate of unemployment.  As we have discussed here before, I fear that such  January 31–an undershoot is worrisome in itself, as it may force a more aggressive subsequent policy response—which would risk a large reaction of the economy as the unemployment rate rises back to the natural rate. Thus, while I cannot dismiss the concerns that the spate of optimism in financial markets and confidence indexes will be ephemeral, should such optimism be more enduring, I would worry about an overshoot like the modal forecast in the Tealbook.  Such an outcome, in my view, would likely not be sustainable and would require significantly more tightening than shown in the December SEP and contained in the Tealbook.  Thus, my policy comments tomorrow will reflect the risk I see should the Tealbook forecast be an accurate representation of what actually unfolds.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.

Passage number 186.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The economy of the United States is in a good place but with major—that is, very large, some would even say “yuge”—uncertainties hovering over it.  The good news about the U.S. economy is much the same as it was when we met seven weeks ago on December 13 and 14: Unemployment is at or below most estimates of the natural rate, the PCE inflation rate is close to reaching its target rate of 2 percent, and there are few problems that need FOMC intervention. To be sure, the low growth rate of productivity and the consequent low growth rate of real GDP are major problems, but monetary policy can, at best, contribute relatively little to increasing the growth rate of the economy on a sustained basis. Further, conditions abroad have improved.  Both the growth rate and the inflation rate of the euro zone have increased.  The projected decline in British growth that was expected to follow a Brexit election victory has not yet appeared, though we should remind ourselves that Brexit has not yet happened and that Britain is still a member of the European Union bound by   January 31–its rules.  The Chinese economy grew rapidly in the fourth quarter of 2016, although the engine of growth is one that will not be permanently sustainable.  The Indian economy, however, is suffering from an “own goal” following an ill-prepared monetary experiment. And the Japanese central bank, according to the newspapers today, believes that it is in a good position to begin growing more rapidly again.  Commodity prices have risen, and commodity producers, including oil-producing countries, are doing better. In terms of U.S. growth, the more timely Tealbook—for the production of which the staff deserves our thanks and commendation—presents an analysis of an expansionary fiscal policy consisting of an increase in the primary budget deficit by 1 percent of GDP.  This expansion is assumed, at least for the meantime, until the proposals under consideration take more shape, to take the form of a cut in personal income taxes beginning in the third quarter of this year.  It is calculated to increase the growth rate of real GDP by ¼ percentage point per year in 2017, ’18, and ’19, which means that the level of real GDP would be ¾ percentage point higher by the end of 2019. Of course, as the Risks and Uncertainty section later in Tealbook A, which includes fan charts, makes clear, a wide variety of possible fiscal outcomes remain in play.  In addition, we plan at our next meeting to discuss considerations for beginning to reduce the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  In light of the very small amount of information about the economy that has arrived in the data received since our December meeting, it’s clear that no change in the interest rate needs to be on the table today.  What we do in March will depend on the data that come in before that meeting. I would like to conclude on the same note on which I began.  The specter of a possible end of the second age of globalization hangs over us.  In the period between the two world wars,   January 31–a great deal of attention was paid to competitive depreciations, known also as “beggar thy neighbor” policies.  This latter phrase, which has a wider context than just depreciations, applies to what has been happening to the Mexican economy since November 8.  More of that approach carries great dangers for the world economy, not least for the U.S. economy. We also need to remind ourselves of Kindleberger’s conclusion from his studies of the global economy that the world economy needs a hegemon.  That role has been played for over 70 years by the United States.  There is no other country that can take our place at this stage, nor is there a good argument for thinking that the United States should abandon its role as the essential nation in global governance.  Nonetheless, we appear to be flirting dangerously with that temptation.  I hope we do not succumb to it. Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is primarily providing an assessment of the state of the U.S. economy and discussing various global economic conditions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 187.
 MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, overall economic activity in the Third District continued to improve, with activity in the Philadelphia metro area picking up notably.  Employment growth also improved somewhat in December, and there is evidence of increasing price pressures as well. The overall outlook was a bit more positive than it has been in a while.  Our January manufacturing survey displayed its strongest readings since November 2014, with strength in shipments, new orders, employment, and inventories.  There is ample evidence that manufacturers are beginning to restock, and optimism is rampant. One well-diversified contact in the region indicated that his order book to May is up an astonishing 50 percent from a year ago, and he is seeing strength in Asia and Europe despite the strong dollar.  He is not seeing red in any of his business lines.  His organic pet foods business is booming, and the margins are incredible.  It is a good time to be a dog in America.  [Laughter] Activity in our service sector is picking up as well after several months of rather tepid growth.  Revenues and new orders were robust in January, and strength was widespread.  Additionally, auto sales have been robust, and future indexes remain unusually high for this late in an expansion. Employment reports in the region are a bit mixed, with employment growth fairly flat, which doesn’t quite square with the falling unemployment rate, low initial claims, and the information we are receiving from our surveys.  Nonresidential construction activity in the region is also robust, and even with the substantial addition of office space—5 percent more square footage is being added over the next few years—it is being occupied at an even faster pace and leading to an acceleration in net absorption and rents.  On the residential side, our   January 31–region continues to look much different than the nation, with the multifamily sector performing relatively better than the nation and the single-family performing relatively worse.  In Philadelphia, homeownership rates are still falling as millennials continue to move in and become an increasing share of the population.  Rents are rising, and vacancy rates continue to fall sharply.  We are also hearing anecdotal evidence of supply constraints in the housing sector. One notable change in our landscape is that manufacturers are reporting a steep increase in prices received.  That series has jumped to its highest level in the recovery, and it currently stands at 20 points above average, which loosely translates to an equivalent 2½ percent monthly rise in the PPI at an annualized rate. Regarding the nation as a whole, my economic outlook is a touch stronger than the staff’s and falls more in line with the private forecast displayed in the Tealbook.  I think we could see growth over the next two years of 2 percent or perhaps a bit higher, and I anticipate inflation returning to target perhaps by the end of this year.  Nominal wage growth has accelerated, and I think aggregation is masking a bit of the underlying strength in wages.  I think price pressures are a bit more robust than is reflected in the staff’s forecast, and we may need to be sensitive to this in our policy deliberations tomorrow and beyond.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Harker, believes that the overall economic outlook is more positive than it has been in a while and that price pressures are increasing. He also believes that inflation may return to target by the end of the year and that price pressures are more robust than reflected in the staff's forecast. This contrasts with the staff's forecast and potentially the views of other participants in the meeting.


Passage number 188.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Eighth District contacts report a large upswing in business sentiment.  They feel that an environment of less onerous regulation combined with corporate tax changes will improve business profitability during the next several years.  They tend to be less concerned about changes in trade and immigration policies.  Some CEOs expect to make major investment decisions as soon as more clarity is provided on the nature of the new fiscal policy program. Recent data suggest that the Eighth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Holiday sales, which are now in and complete, generally met expectations. District labor market conditions remain tight.  The most recent reading puts the District unemployment rate at 4.4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply presenting information and observations about business sentiment and economic conditions in the Eighth District.


Passage number 189.
  Nevertheless, inflation pressures remain moderate in key District MSAs. Relatively low commodity prices continue to put many agricultural portions of the District under financial pressure.  Real estate activity reports have been mixed, but contacts remain optimistic for 2017.January 31–Nationally, U.S. real GDP growth is now estimated to have been just under 2 percent for all of 2016, consistent with the St. Louis Fed’s regime-based approach to the economic forecast. We tend to agree with the staff forecast that growth is likely to remain relatively low, around 2 percent, through the end of the forecast horizon.  We’re unwilling, however, to interpret this as an above-trend growth rate but instead think of the 2 percent growth rate as being statistically indistinguishable from the trend growth rate.  Accordingly, we continue to forecast a 4.7 percent unemployment rate through the end of the forecast horizon, and we expect unemployment will fluctuate between 4½ and 5 percent during this period. In our baseline forecast, we think payroll employment growth is likely to slow more than is assumed by the Tealbook. We have treated possible fiscal policy changes at the federal level as an upside risk to the growth and employment scenario just outlined.  We have thought about it, but we have not included it as part of the baseline forecast at this juncture.  It is too early to assign meaningful probabilities to a growth-enhancing package of fiscal policy changes as of this meeting.  To the extent that there may be a measurable positive effect from fiscal policy change, we do not think it would come through deficit spending. Empirical evidence concerning the effects of deficit spending on growth are weak in our reading, especially on a medium-term sustainable basis. Nevertheless, we do think that some proposals currently being contemplated at the federal level may improve business capital investment and U.S. productivity growth.  We think those effects, if they materialize, would be most evident in 2018 and 2019.  This does have the potential to affect our monetary policy outlook. The St. Louis Fed’s inflation forecast remains at 2 percent over the forecast horizon.  In this dimension, we’re in broad agreement with the Tealbook outlook.  The Federal Reserve Bank  January 31–of Dallas trimmed mean inflation rate currently stands at 1.85 percent on a year-over-year basis. This measure has not moved very much in recent quarters, and this seems to indicate a rather limited scope for continued movement, although, of course, this bears watching, as always. Headline inflation measures have moved up, but we see limits on additional movements in these measures over the forecast horizon. On the basis of recent empirical evidence, we see Phillips curve responses of inflation to economic activity as being very limited.  We see the low inflation environment globally as being an important background factor.  We would be more worried if inflation expectations, according to market-based indicators, were higher than they are.  However, both the five-year and the five-year, five-year-forward TIPS-based measures of inflations expectations are just over 2 percent in recent days. As these are CPI-based measures, one might want to subtract up to 30 basis points to come to a reasonable estimate of PCE inflation expectations over the medium and long term.  That would leave us at only 170 basis points or so on both measures, still fairly low relative to Committee goals. All told, these considerations suggest that current U.S. macroeconomic performance is consistent with a low-growth regime, with constant inflation and a constant level of unemployment but with some upside potential, due to possible fiscal policy changes ahead. The current level of the policy rate is optimal, given this regime, perhaps with one additional move during 2017.  Since the upside for the policy rate is limited given this regime-based approach, I do not want to tie the end of reinvestment to the policy rate level.  Accordingly, now would be a good time, in my view, to end the balance sheet reinvestment and to take a step toward normalization of the yield curve. I’ll discuss this more tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the staff forecast and is generally optimistic about the economic outlook, although they do mention the possibility of upside potential from fiscal policy changes.


Passage number 190.
  January 31–MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Economic data since the December meeting have come in close to expectations, leaving the outlook broadly unchanged.  To me, that outlook is for growth of around 2 percent, job creation gradually slowing—but still above trend labor force growth—and inflation moving up ever closer to 2 percent. Consumer and business surveys remain upbeat. Housing prices are rising steadily and equity prices have also continued to move up.  After five years averaging 0.5 percent, productivity for 2016 is now estimated at nearly 1 percent, an increase that is small and preliminary but nonetheless welcome.  Taken together, these factors should provide ample support for the economy, the labor market, and inflation moving along the path I described. The risks to that baseline seem to me to be balanced.  In particular, I—unlike some others—do not see the risks as especially skewed to the upside for the next couple of years.  In fact, going where others have perhaps wisely feared to tread, I’ll say that the equity market for now appears to me to have fully priced in the upside case and that a significant correction would not be a surprise. It’s also going to be interesting to see how well the significant increases in business and household confidence hold up in the uncertain—indeed, chaotic—policy environment. The legislative calendar is extraordinarily full.  There’s no greater clarity on the prospects of a fiscal policy package, and the Tealbook’s assumption of a tax cut of 1 percent of GDP remains a reasonable “placeholder.”  As the record shows, tax reform is very difficult.  A big tax cut is possible but unlikely, on the basis of my own experience with the Republican caucuses in the House and the Senate. Anything is possible. In any case, fiscal policy changes may be enacted much later this year—indeed, early next year.  It’s possible. Any direct macroeconomic effectsJanuary 31–would not be felt until 2018 and thereafter.  For now, I continue to think of a supportive fiscal policy as an insurance policy against weakness and have not factored in any additional growth. The baseline forecast is for unemployment to decline well below the natural rate for an extended period.  I see that as a desirable outcome and don’t feel that we’re “behind the curve” or see any data suggesting that that is the case. The Committee has been quite patient, and that has served us well, but the risks are now two sided, and the pace of tightening will need to react more sensitively to incoming data.  Such an approach need not go too far in the opposite direction and emphasize only the risk of falling “behind the curve.” I’ll mention one factor that will be important to watch: labor force participation, which has shown welcome and unexpected strength, suggesting along the way a bit more room for growth.  We’ve now had three years with measured participation bouncing around between 62½ and 63 percent and remaining, overall, about flat despite demographic and other secular factors pushing down trend participation.  Since the labor market has been steadily improving through this period, my assumption is that some of the bouncing around is really a function of measurement, and the reality is that participation has been about flat. In any case, the question is, what signal should we take from this.  Over the three-year period, the flat participation rate means that we’ve picked up about a full percentage point against the declining trend, and, as many have pointed out, as a matter of arithmetic, much of that has been due to more people remaining in the labor force rather than the reentry of discouraged workers.  The weight of opinion today seems to be that labor force participation is likely to soon resume its long-time downward trend.  And I want to push back on that just a little—not at all because I’m sure that it’s wrong, but rather because I think there remains a good chance that participation will remain flat for a while longer or even move back up again.  January 31–The canonical paper by Stephanie Aaronson and various others here at the Board and at the Cleveland Federal Reserve discusses the possibility that the business cycle affects participation after a significant lag, and to the extent that that is the case, the current participation rate could still be held down by the effects of past slack.  This is plausible and would suggest a bit more room for growth.  In addition, participation has moved up 50 basis points or so above our estimate of trend late in the past couple of cycles, so it is not at all clear that we’re about to hit a wall on participation. The bottom line is, since high frequency movements in participation and unemployment may well be noisy, I wouldn’t react too much to short-term changes in either direction until we see a clear and sustained change. A final point.  Some of the downward trend in labor force participation is inevitable, but not all of it.  We can’t stop aging, but, at least in principle, the decline in participation by prime-age males need not be taken as a given, like death and taxes.  Depending on the underlyng causes, various policies can address the problem.  A June 2016 Council of Economic Advisers report identified poor labor prospects as a key factor.  More recently, Alan Krueger and others have suggested that poor health plays a role.  While a tight labor market could help those at the margin remain connected to the labor force, most of the policies that would target declining participation by prime-age males are in the hands of the Congress and the Administration, not in our hands.  But, again, I would avoid overreacting as labor force and possibly headline unemployment move around until we see a clear change in signal.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.  President Kaplan.

Passage number 192.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The economic situation has not changed much since our December meeting.  The incoming data have been reasonably in line with our prior assessments, and, not surprisingly, none of my directors or other contacts report any major changes in economic conditions.  Business optimism continues to be strong following the election, but it’s still too early to expect these more positive attitudes to find their way into tangible increases in economic activity. Comments made by the CEO of a heavy equipment manufacturer were pretty typical.  He said that construction equipment orders were running at twice last year’s pace, but, for now, the company has decided to run with a longer order queue rather than bring back sidelined workers to increase production rates.  The firm wants to see whether the stronger demand will continue before committing to expansion. This wait-and-see attitude also applies to potential fiscal, trade, and regulatory policy changes from the new Administration and Congress.  Everyone we speak with is waiting for more clarity.  And despite the optimism from much of the business community, representatives from the health-care industry, higher education, community, and labor groups express many concerns about intended and unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act repeal,January 31–changes in immigration policies, and the possibility of reduced funding for nonprofit institutions.  We haven’t factored any of these potential speed bumps into our outlook, but considering the fast pace of executive orders and items on the legislative agenda, there may be downside risks that could unfold quickly.  Uncertainty seems high. Meanwhile, multinational corporations continue to report improving international economic conditions.  The biggest percentage gains were in Latin America, with Brazil and Argentina coming off very low levels.  Europe also seems to be doing better.  Manpower’s CEO noted that the appreciation of the dollar benefited European manufacturers as much as it hurt those in the United States. Folding everything into the national outlook, our projections haven’t changed meaningfully since December.  Similar to the Tealbook, we have GDP growth running modestly above potential this year and next. Our best estimate is that there is still a touch of resource slack left in the economy.  However, in view of how flat the Phillips curve is within the relevant range, neither our estimate of slack nor any others I see are large enough, one way or the other, to make much of a difference in the inflation outlook.  So, at the moment. I don’t see projections of modest above-potential real GDP growth as much of an upside risk to inflation. Indeed, if anything, I’m still concerned about inflation failing to rise to target within a reasonable period of time.  Inflation expectations remain low.  We do not see any meaningful cost pressures in labor and other input markets, and the strengthening in the dollar over the past few months could weigh further on import prices. Adding it all up, my inflation forecast is the same as I had in December.  Core inflation does not reach 2 percent sustainably until the end of 2019. And an appropriately accommodative policy stance continues to be an integral part of my projection.  In particular, I assume only two increases in the funds rate in 2017 and no change in   January 31–our reinvestment policies this year. To support more aggressive funds rate normalization, I would have to become confident that we were on our way to achieving our inflation target earlier than 2019, as in my current projection.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Gooding.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 193.
 MS. GOODING.  Soundings from Sixth District directors and business contacts continue to be optimistic.  However, the optimism has waned somewhat since last cycle. Their focus has shifted to the uncertainty surrounding potential changes to fiscal, regulatory, and trade policies.  We’ve frequently heard that firms are holding off on making any significant changes to their business plans and are shelving capital investments projects until the details of these potential initiatives become clear. In general, however, our contacts have also noted little change in near-term business activity.  Most contacts confirmed ongoing tightening in labor markets.  In response to some difficulty finding workers, and in an effort to expand their set of work-ready candidates, many firms are partnering with area workforce development organizations or academic institutions to create custom training programs. Although many firms saw little in the way of pricing power, an increasing number of firms were confident that they would be able to pass through recent commodity price increases to customers. On nominal wage growth, District firms continue to report increases in the 2 to 3 percent range. Consistent with the incoming economic data, our forecast is largely unchanged.  We see GDP growth continuing at roughly 2 percent over the medium term and inflation returning to our objective.  Like our directors and business contacts, we see the risk to our outlook mostly associated with changes to fiscal, trade, and regulatory policy.  We have yet to mark in any fiscal January 31–stimulus over the forecast horizon, and we are waiting for the details to become more apparent. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some contention in the passage. The passage mentions that there is optimism among Sixth District directors and business contacts, but it also states that this optimism has waned somewhat since last cycle. Additionally, there is uncertainty surrounding potential changes to fiscal, regulatory, and trade policies, which is causing firms to hold off on making significant changes to their business plans. This suggests a disagreement or contention between the optimism expressed by some and the uncertainty mentioned.


Passage number 194.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Tenth District economy expanded modestly since the previous meeting.  Business sentiment has been much stronger since the November election, although our District contacts appear to be waiting for additional details on the future of the fiscal policy landscape before adjusting employment or capital spending plans.  While the outlook for agriculture remains weak, District energy activity accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Energy firms began hiring, and profits turned positive for the first time in more than two years.  Access to credit also improved, and overall expectations improved significantly with the recovery in oil prices and a degree of confidence that the announced production cuts will be realized. In our energy survey, District firms expect oil prices to approach levels by the end of 2017 that would support significant expansion in drilling activities. With regard to the national outlook, much like the Tealbook, my outlook for the national economy is little changed and continues to assume growth near 2 percent over the next few years, although my forecast does not incorporate assumptions about potential fiscal policy changes, in view of the considerable uncertainty about the nature and timing of such changes.  At this point, the prospects of tax cuts and more government spending pose upside risk to my growth and inflation forecast. While consumer confidence has risen sharply, my forecast takes little signal from this development, much like the Tealbook.  Namely, once we account for fundamentals like income growth and interest rates, analysis by my staff and that of other published research suggests thatJanuary 31–changes in consumer confidence have only modest predictive power for future consumption growth. Still, I expect consumption to be supported by a healthy labor market, rising housing and financial wealth, a historically high savings rate, and accommodative monetary policy.  With an economy near full employment, signs of wage pressure, stable to higher inflation expectations, elevated asset valuations, and buoyant consumer and business sentiment, the trend for inflation certainly appears to be to the upside.  On the other hand, downward pressure on inflation measures could result from a stronger foreign exchange value of the dollar if monetary divergence persists or as a result of possible trade policy reforms.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting information about the state of the economy and offering their outlook, but there is no disagreement or conflict with other perspectives.


Passage number 195.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Moderate growth continues in the Ninth District. There were strong employment gains in November and December in Minnesota, though North Dakota is not doing as well, as it is still struggling with the oil price retraction. In the Minneapolis Fed’s annual manufacturing survey, one-third of our respondents expect increased employment this coming year, while only 10 percent plan to cut.  The Twin Cities’ business survey indicated that finding qualified employees continues to be their greatest challenge, which many of us have heard before.  Although job growth is strong, wage growth still appears to be moderate.  Respondents in our manufacturing survey report average 2.6 percent wage growth from 2015 to 2016, and residential real estate is generally strong. In the national economy, the expansion continues, but growth is rather lackluster— Q4 real GDP growth came in fairly weak at around 1.9 percent.  It’s possible that drag coming from the strong dollar on net exports could continue to depress growth, looking forward.  NoJanuary 31–dramatic labor market news since our previous meeting.  The unemployment rate ticked up, and prime-age labor force participation also ticked up. A key question that I think we’re all wrestling with is how much labor slack remains.  The staff view is that unemployment is already above potential, but, in contrast, the CBO recently came out with a report that estimates that labor force participation is still below potential and employment is therefore 1.6 million below potential employment.  The CBO doesn’t expect the employment shortfall to disappear until around 2018. As some others have noted, according to the U-6, which includes part time for economic reasons and marginally attached workers, now at 9.2 percent, is still about 1 percentage point higher than prior to the recession. Overall, in my mind, the amount of labor slack remains uncertain.  The rise in prime-age labor force participation could continue.  I’m not yet convinced we have reached maximum employment. In terms of inflation, how are we doing.  There’s little change in core inflation over the intermeeting period.  Year-on-year core PCE inflation is still running around 1.6 percent or 1.7 percent, close to its average over the past several years.  Thus, on inflation, we are still below target, and in my mind it is too soon to declare victory.  What about the inflation outlook.  It’s a mixed bag.  Survey and market expectations remain low by historical standards.  Obviously, market-based expectations have ticked up since the election, but survey expectations continue to be low.  The dollar continues to strengthen, putting downward pressure on import prices.  On the other hand, there are some welcome signs of wage growth picking up, but they’re not picking up to alarming levels yet. There’s speculation that fiscal policy will become more expansionary, which, in turn, could drive up inflation, but in light of the uncertainty over the fiscal policy outlook, it’s tooJanuary 31–soon for me to build this into my own economic forecast.  By the way, we asked our own directors in our January meeting to ask their contacts whether they are actually changing their investment plans because of the election, and virtually none of them said they were changing their plans. They’re feeling optimistic, but it’s not translating into action yet.  Uncertainty remains high.  There’s risk to the upside—lower taxes, lower regulation—and to the downside in the form of protectionist trade policy. Experience of the post-Brexit United Kingdom suggests that uncertainty by itself is not necessarily a huge drag on growth, but how the uncertainty is resolved will affect the outlook and the appropriate path of rates.  In conclusion, I think we continue to make some progress toward our goals, but in my mind it’s too soon to declare victory. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents various data and viewpoints without any conflicting information.


Passage number 196.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair, may I. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage consists of a request and a response between two individuals, Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 197.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I actually had the occasion to reread some of the 2011 transcripts this week, too, because of a snarky newspaper article, basically, about some stuff that happened. But I remember the discussion really well about impediments, and the way I was thinking about it at the time—and I think this is consistent with the transcripts—is that it was an impediment to the pace at which the unemployment rate was likely to be able to fall and the extent to which monetary policy could influence it properly. So I don’t think I ever thought that it would be impossible to ever get it below 8 percent.  I’m not sure anyone around the table did.  But your point is well taken about thinking carefully about where we are and extrapolating out from there, and being a little humble about extrapolating too far ahead.  That part I agree with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is agreeing with and expanding on a point made by someone else.


Passage number 198.
 MR. EVANS.  It was 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 199.
 January 31–MR. LACKER. It was 9 percent.  Sorry. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The conversation seems to be a straightforward exchange of information where Mr. Lacker corrects himself and provides the correct figure of 9 percent to Chair Yellen.


Passage number 200.
 MR. WILCOX.  I’d be happy to dissertate at length but don’t feel compelled to.  I have no news. CHAIR YELLEN. Okay.  Then let’s turn to Thomas for the monetary policy briefing and start our policy round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a conversation where participants are discussing the agenda for the meeting.


Passage number 201.
 MS. BRAINARD.  In your panel in the middle left, does the much higher value of the term-premium-adjusted, market-based, long-run federal funds rate give you any pause as to the way your model is working.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Brainard is simply asking a question about the implications of a higher value in the panel.


Passage number 202.
 MR. LAUBACH.  That model is estimated over the period from 1991 onward.  In that model, the short rate will return to the sample mean over time.  That’s how you get the convergence.  But what you can tell is that the convergence must be very gradual, because, by 2020, you’re still quite a bit below the long-run mean.  So these models, in general—at least this version here—do not include factors that would have, technically speaking, a unit root or a literally permanent component. CHAIR YELLEN. Are there other questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Then let’s begin the policy go-round.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a conversation between Mr. Laubach and Chair Yellen discussing a model and its limitations.


Passage number 203.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for this meeting.  We have made clear that we will be proceeding gradually, and we tightened in December.  Furthermore, it is quite unclear how fiscal policy will unfold. Nonetheless, I believe that if the data remain consistent with the forecast, another tightening would be appropriate in March, particularly if we see further declines in the unemployment rate.  Since the statement provides no tilt in that direction and markets currently are not anticipating a move that soon, we may need to   January 31–consider communication outside the official statement if it becomes necessary to alter the expected path of interest rates. In my view, the Tealbook is the most likely outcome but only if we raise rates at the pace assumed in the Tealbook.  While there are risks of negative surprises, the Blue Chip consensus, the Tealbook, and my forecast all have the unemployment rate falling below 4½ percent even with policy that is a bit tighter than the median SEP in December. The risk of a significant overshoot on both elements of the dual mandate may well merit taking out some insurance against that outcome, which would entail more tightening than even the Tealbook assumes.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, supports alternative B for the meeting and expresses his belief that another tightening of interest rates would be appropriate in March if the data remain consistent with the forecast. He also mentions the need for possible communication outside the official statement if the expected path of interest rates needs to be altered. Additionally, he discusses various forecasts and risks, but there is no clear disagreement or contention in his statements.


Passage number 204.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  As I indicated yesterday, I think that my anticipated trajectory right now is one that was embodied in what I said in the SEP in December.  That hasn’t changed.  But I do think that we’ve got this odd combination of upside risks internal to the economy and downside risks external to the economy.  As I was thinking last night about what some of you said, it did occur to me that, to the degree that asset prices are already incorporating a fairly optimistic set of assumptions about what may be forthcoming in a fiscal package, there might actually be a little bit more downside risk just internal to the economy.  I think it’s really hard to figure out right now how much is animal spirits, how much is expectations of lower taxes, and how much is expectations of decreased regulation. So that leaves me kind of where I’ve been, which is thinking that the trajectory is one of gradual—a couple or three—rate increases this year but just acknowledging that, as the Chair said yesterday, the momentum in the economy could appear to be picking up on its own, or weJanuary 31–may get some further information between now and March as to whether fiscal and other policies are clarifying in such a way as to have more of an effect.  In the SEP, I always resist saying uncertainty is greater than usual, because uncertainty is a feature of life. But if we had had an SEP this time around, I think I would have checked the box for uncertainty being “greater than usual in the past 20 years.”  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of support for alternative B and an explanation of the speaker's reasoning.


Passage number 205.
 MR.  HARKER.  Wow, that’s a tough act to follow, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, very interesting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 206.
 MR. HARKER.  But well done.  As we’ve signaled that our normalization process would be gradual, I can support alternative B at this meeting.  Also, the current uncertainty surrounding economic policy, as well as the recent behavior of inflation, makes this a prudent course of action at this time.  However, as I alluded to yesterday, I do have concerns that inflationary pressures are higher than may be evident from the most recent data, and, if so, that may call for more than the two moves currently priced into futures markets. I want to be sure that we’re prepared to move should the data warrant, and that we prepare markets for that eventuality.  I don’t think our current forward-guidance language is up to the task, and we should seriously consider replacing the word “gradual” with something like “moderate” at the March meeting, as “gradual” has come, in my mind and to many in the market, to have a much too gradual interpretation. I’m also looking forward to our discussion at the March meeting regarding the cessation of reinvestment of maturing Treasury securities and MBS.  I found our past general discussions  January 31–regarding the balance sheet helpful, but I believe it is time for us to nail down some specifics. The process of stopping reinvestment could begin as early as the second half of this year, and we will need to prepare markets in advance.  Taking that need into account, we should begin preparing ourselves.  Issues such as whether reinvestment should be phased out, as well as whether shrinking the balance sheet should influence the future policy rate path, need to be discussed, and we will need to begin crafting language indicating our intentions.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker agrees with the gradual normalization process, supports alternative B, and expresses concerns about inflationary pressures. The speaker also suggests replacing the word "gradual" with "moderate" and discusses the need to prepare for the cessation of reinvestment of Treasury securities and MBS. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 207.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In light of my outlook and the progress on our dual-mandate goals, I view an upward path of the federal funds rate as appropriate.  The question is when to take the next step on that path.  If we had prepared the public for it, I would be advocating taking another step today.  However, since we did not do that, I can live with alternative B. I’d be more comfortable if we were at a higher level of the funds rate.  As I mentioned yesterday, I recognize there’s considerable uncertainty about the outlook, but I don’t think the proper reaction to that uncertainty is to stand pat and do nothing.  Rather, I think we should be prepared to set policy consistent with our outlook.  If and when some of the uncertainty is resolved or some risks are realized that change our outlook, then we should be prepared to change policy appropriately.  Under the circumstances, I suspect that over the next few years we may need to change our forecasts and our anticipated policy rate path more frequently than we have over the past couple of years.  I think that’s fine.  We should not hold ourselves to a standard of having to be prescient.  January 31–I think a higher level of the funds rate now would better position us to respond to changes in the outlook on either the upside or the downside.  If the outlook changes, we may have to reverse course, but if it is done systematically on the basis of the outlook and we articulate the rationale, then that’s not a problem. I note that a higher federal funds rate would also give us more flexibility to end reinvestments while still being consistent with our earlier communications that the criteria for stopping reinvestments would be based on the level of the funds rate.  I look forward to that discussion about reinvestment policy in March. I don’t believe we’re “behind the curve” yet, and I realize that the policy rate path that we anticipate does not require us to raise the policy rate at each meeting.  But, as we discussed last time, soft landings are hard to come by.  They’ve occurred only when monetary policy is preemptive and began to tighten before the unemployment rate fell below real-time estimates of the natural rate and when the shocks that caused the economy to slow were either small or beneficial. So it’s important that we remain vigilant against falling “behind the curve.”  Like the siren song, waiting for uncertainty to resolve before acting is always seductive.  But we have continued to make progress on our goals.  There’s a growing list of policy rules that suggests the current stance of policy is too accommodative and increasingly so.  The Board staff’s assessment of asset valuation pressures has risen from moderate to notable, and leverage is very high for speculative-grade corporate borrowers.  In this environment, if we accumulate enough delays, we could easily find ourselves “behind the curve.” I hope we avoid that shipwreck.  And if between now and March the data come in consistent with the forecast, I hope we will be open to moving the funds rate up. January 31–Regarding the statement language, I prefer paragraph 4 in alternative C to that in alternative B. In view of the progress to date, and anticipated further progress, on the inflation goal, I no longer think it necessary to continue to point out the shortfall of inflation from the goal or to emphasize we’re carefully monitoring progress, which, of course, we always are.  However, I understand that today may not be the day to make such a change.  It may be better to wait until we move the funds rate again. I continue to think we should find a way to back away from or clarify the “gradual path” language in paragraph 4.  If we look at the median path in the December SEP, we see a path that has the funds rate rising gradually toward and staying below its longer-run level.  That may be how the public is interpreting “gradual.”  However, in many individual forecasts, including the Tealbook, the funds rate moves above the long-run level before coming back down and converging to it.  Indeed, the Tealbook baseline has the funds rate moving up to 4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, 1 full percentage point above the longer-run level. The pattern is also seen in all of the alternative simulations.  So even ignoring the uncertainty regarding the policy rate path, I don’t think the public understands that the anticipated path includes an overshoot. In addition, there are a number of risks that, if realized, may entail a different policy rate path from that we currently anticipate.  As I mentioned, I think we need to be prepared for more changes to the outlook and appropriate policy rate path than we’ve seen in recent years.  This will be a communications challenge.  I think we’d be well served to eliminate the “gradual” language when we next change the funds rate or even sooner. Conveying the degree of uncertainty regarding our current assessment of the likely future policy rate path, in view of the uncertainty associated with the forecast and the inevitable shocks January 31–that will hit the economy, will also be helpful, and I’m glad that we will be publishing confidence bands around the SEP numbers, starting in March.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses disagreement with the current policy of not raising the interest rate and argues for a higher level of the funds rate. They also disagree with the use of the term "gradual path" and suggest eliminating it from the statement.


Passage number 208.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I agree with the case for alt-B expressed in the Tealbook. Our earlier statement said the Committee viewed a gradual path of rate increases as being appropriate policy, given our forecasts of economic activity and inflation. We have seen some further progress in labor markets, some upward movement in inflation, and, at least for the moment, some apparent diminution of risks from abroad.  But these improvements are no different than those expected in our earlier forecasts. Events are not evolving better than we expected, and the zero-lower-bound risk-management calculus continues to be relevant in this low-r* global economy. Accordingly, there’s no reason to change our guidance regarding appropriate policy, in my opinion.   For similar reasons, the time is not yet ripe to signal that any changes in balance sheet policy are forthcoming soon.  Since the first rate hike in December 2015, our policy statement has said that we plan to keep reinvesting maturing securities until we’re “well under way” with funds rate normalization.  The dealer survey seems to align around a range of 1¼ to 1½ percent. We had previously ceased reinvestments, I think, back in 2011, so this is not uncharted territory. With my inflation outlook not reaching 2 percent sustainably until 2019, I don’t see the need to adjust our balance sheet language any time soon. Finally, I still think the risk-management calculus remains important. We still are uncomfortably close to the effective lower bound, so a downside surprise would still be difficult to deal with.  On the other hand, we’re well positioned to react to unexpected strength in the economy.  Indeed, in the Tealbook, alternative scenarios of more expansive fiscal policy,   January 31–stronger domestic aggregate demand, and stronger international growth—in all of them, a moderately higher-than-baseline funds rate path was able to keep inflation well contained. This is especially noteworthy for the alternative scenario of more expansive fiscal policy, since it is the one that appears to have the highest probability of occurring at the moment. This would be a scenario we would observe in real time.  We would be able to see it rolling out as tax and spending bills were enacted, so there’s no risk that we would not observe its occurrence.  This clarity reduces the risk of being caught “behind the curve” and adjusting policy to meet our dual-mandate responsibilities.  So, Madam Chair, I agree to alt-B, and steady as we go at the moment.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses support for alternative B and agrees with the case expressed in the Tealbook. They also provide reasons for why they believe there is no reason to change policy or adjust the balance sheet language at this time. The passage ends with the speaker stating their agreement with alternative B and their intention to continue with the current approach.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 209.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for today.  I would describe this meeting as the dog that didn’t bark.  This statement is not setting up a March meeting move, and I think that’s probably the most significant thing that’s happening here that will be noted today and as this spills out through financial markets in the coming days. In my view, if we’re not willing to set up a March move or hint toward it at this meeting, then I would not try to do it during the intermeeting period unless we got data that were significantly different than what we were otherwise expecting, on the order of a standard deviation different from what we had previously thought.  Markets right now are putting the highest probability on a June move—perhaps one or two hikes this year, as Thomas’s presentation just showed us in panels 1 and 2, with a lot of diffusion associated with that expectation. After this meeting, we will all be asked whether March is on the table, with “on the table” becoming the most common thing that’s used to describe whether we might possibly move at a  January 31–meeting or not.  We will all, of course, have to answer that it is because all meetings are live, and what that may do is set off a wave of speculation about a March FOMC move.  That’s been a pattern that has developed—unfortunately, I think—repeatedly in the 2015 and 2016 time frame, and I don’t see any reason for it not to continue now. My own view is that fiscal uncertainty is unlikely to be meaningfully resolved by the March meeting.  In past political situations like the current one, key legislation was not signed until August.  In addition, details in a fiscal package do matter considerably for the future path of the economy.  And while I do think that some of the Administration’s policies have the potential to increase medium-term growth, there are also downside risks—especially through the trade channel should it trigger reactions from foreign economies on trade aspects of the global macroeconomy. The current strategy of the Committee has us putting upward pressure on the short end of the yield curve through changes in the policy rate in the quarters ahead but also simultaneously maintaining downward pressure on the longer end of the yield curve, at least according to our rhetoric, by maintaining a large balance sheet.  This sounds like our policy is to flatten the yield curve.  I’m not sure that it really is, and I’m not sure that it makes that much sense.  I think it’s time to carefully reconsider the Committee’s reinvestment policy. If we end reinvestment with only moderate policy rate changes—and we have only one rate change for 2017 in our assumptions in St. Louis—we would be normalizing the yield curve, albeit at a very low level.  But that low level is consistent with today’s regime of global low interest rates, low inflation, and low growth.  The staff analysis doesn’t acknowledge that there are multiple regimes and so always has us returning to a relatively high interest rate, higher-growth regime in the future, which I think is not the way to look at the data.  January 31–I think ending the reinvestment with only one policy rate change would be a more appropriate policy move in 2017 than to try to have a significant rise in the policy rate and keep the reinvestment policy as it is.  I look forward to the discussion of this issue at our next meeting in March.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing disagreement with the current strategy of the Committee regarding interest rates and the balance sheet, and he also disagrees with the staff's analysis of multiple regimes and future interest rates. He suggests ending reinvestment with only one policy rate change in 2017, which is different from the current approach.


Passage number 210.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  A great deal of information has reached us since our December meeting.  But it’s not information about the likely development of the economy—“likely” meaning expectation thereof—particularly with respect to employment and inflation, for the developments of the past seven weeks have not very much changed our short-term forecasts. The information that has reached us is primarily about decisionmaking in the new Administration.  That information has increased my uncertainty about future nonmonetary economic and other policies, and I suspect that many of us share that view. Today’s decision is clear—keep the interest rate where it is—though what comes next.  Well, we’re close to attaining both our policy targets, and the staff’s forecast for the years ahead sees a continuation of recent trends in both employment and inflation.  Provided that the economy develops approximately as forecast, we should continue normalizing monetary policy with respect to both the interest rate and then, possibly a bit later, the beginning of balance sheet reduction. The forecast sees the unemployment rate declining to 4.1 percent by 2019.  However, we have little, though not zero, experience of very low unemployment, and I would not be surprised if the Phillips curve begins to revive as unemployment falls further.  The conclusion that we should continue normalizing monetary policy remains correct if the Phillips curve turns out to be less flat at low unemployment rates than we have believed in recent years.January 31–The blue- and black-edged pages of Tealbook A—the Risks and Uncertainty section and the Monetary Policy Strategies section, respectively—present a very large variety of possible outcomes.  Our discussion yesterday and the Tealbook focus primarily on the possible effects of a more expansionary fiscal policy whose estimated effects on both unemployment and inflation are relatively small. But, as the Tealbook shows, many things could happen, and we shall have to remain alert to the potential effects of unexpected policy initiatives, and some expected ones, on the dynamics of growth and inflation.  And we will have to be no less alert to the possible effects of potential changes in financial regulation on financial stability. At the same time, we should be examining aspects of our policy apparatus to which we have become accustomed but that could possibly be improved.  Among those aspects, I would include the SEP, particularly the discussion concerning the implied forecast of the number of interest rate changes the Committee believes it will make in this and future years.  Many in the public mistakenly see this as a foregone conclusion.  We really have to get that clear. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer is expressing his uncertainty about future nonmonetary economic policies, but there is no mention of any disagreement or argument among the individuals mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 211.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Little has changed since the December meeting, so we appear to be continuing on the path of recent years—growth of around 2 percent, ongoing improvement in labor market conditions, and inflation now nearing 2 percent. And, as I mentioned yesterday, I see the risks associated with that forecast as balanced as of today. On that path, I see it as appropriate to continue gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate. In December, I wrote down three increases for 2017, and that still seems about right.  If the data are supportive, then I could see the March meeting as an appropriate time for another increase.  Obviously, it would need to be signaled in some way ahead of time   January 31–because the market will not be expecting it.  If the case is not quite clear by March, then it’s also worth considering a well-signaled increase at the time of the May meeting.  That would, of course, have the value of breaking the uncomfortable equilibrium of moving only at press conference meetings.  Again, assuming that things go on as expected and without weak incoming data or unexpected risks arising, waiting for the June meeting feels to me like a third-best choice. The discussion at the March meeting on the balance sheet seems likely to be a consequential one, and I do have some strong priors, but I look forward to taking what will no doubt be a deep dive into a coming wave of memos and analysis.  And my plan is to take Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments yesterday to heart and try to stick close to that “well under way” language that’s been in paragraph 5 of the statement since December 2015 and avoid taking too firm of a position before our discussions, which I look forward to. On the statement language, count me as a strong supporter of the blue “Measures of” addition.  I’m among those who raised that.  And on the other, I would say I do think it’s time to consider for the next meeting some of the other thoughts that have been raised about “gradual,” particularly about the inflation language, which I think we put in at a time when we really hadn’t shown much progress.  But, now, we have.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Gooding.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Powell is giving his thoughts and opinions on the current economic situation and the appropriate path for future interest rate increases. He also expresses his support for certain changes in the statement language. However, there is no indication of any disagreement or debate with other participants in the discussion.


Passage number 212.
 MS. GOODING.  Thank you.  I support the policy recommendation in alternative B, and I’m okay with the minimalist changes in the statement language.  The Atlanta Fed’s outlook has not changed materially, and we continue to think that two 25 basis point increases this year feel appropriate. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. MS. GOODING is expressing her support for alternative B and is also stating her agreement with the statement language changes. CHAIR YELLEN is thanking MS. GOODING for her input.


Passage number 213.
  January 31–MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written. In the period leading up to this meeting, I had made one particular suggestion in removing the word “only” before “gradual,” as we did in alternative C.  But I understand why we felt that we should leave the language as it is, and I’ll come back to that. I believe we’re making good progress on reaching our dual-mandate objectives.  I believe, though, that the risk of overshooting our full employment objective is real, and I do believe we’ll continue to make gradual progress on reaching our 2 percent inflation objective in the medium term.  In light of this, I believe we should be taking steps to remove accommodation in the months ahead.  And while I believe it’s appropriate to stand pat for today, I also believe that if the economy progresses as I expect, it will be appropriate to remove some amount of accommodation at our March meeting. I’m also cognizant that at the March meeting, we’ll have additional insight into how 2017 economic conditions are unfolding, and we’ll have greater insight into what fiscal and structural policies are most likely to be implemented by the new Administration. While there is certainly downside risk, I do believe that as these fiscal and structural policies are clarified, there’s probably more risk to the upside than to the downside from these policies to my baseline forecast. My views regarding March are in the context of the desire to remove accommodation in a gradual and patient manner.  I want to avoid a situation in which we feel the need to remove accommodation at a more accelerated pace.  I also believe that in 2017, it may well be prudent for us to allow more than three months between interest rate moves.  In that context, moving in March gives us optionality, in my view.  I believe not moving in March may restrict our options for orchestrating the gradual and patient removal of accommodation.  So if the economy  January 31–progresses as I expect, I would hope that between now and March we set the stage for forthcoming action in the near future.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and explaining their views on the gradual removal of accommodation in the future.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 214.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Consistent with the Committee’s ongoing guidance that rates will increase only gradually, I view today’s decision as appropriate.  I also see the wisdom of making minimal adjustments to the statement, although I would have preferred alternative C’s characterization of inflation.  Paragraph 4 of alternative B continues to emphasize the current shortfall of inflation from the 2 percent goal, language that was added in December 2015 when headline inflation was around ½ percent. With significant uncertainties about the scope, size, and timing of potential changes in fiscal policies, calibrating monetary policy will be more challenging.  I continue to support a gradual approach in removing accommodation but one that is considerably faster than one rate increase annually, especially if the labor market continues to strengthen. Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Ms. George, expresses disagreement with the characterization of inflation in the statement.


Passage number 215.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  The three metrics that I’ve been focused on to think about the appropriate stance of policy are the core PCE inflation rate, inflation expectations, and the headline unemployment rate—as some way of measuring whether there is still slack in the labor market and whether it is translating into inflation.  Since we last met in December, we really haven’t seen much action on any of these indicators, and we haven’t seen much action over the course of the past year, frankly.  Core PCE hasn’t moved very much.  Inflation expectations—some measures have come up, and some have gone down.  And the unemployment rate has held fairly constant.   January 31–I’m open minded as to March, but I want to see movement in some of those three measures to see if we really are reaching our target.  I know some members of the Committee think that we’re close on our inflation and employment mandates.  It isn’t clear to me that we are yet.  I don’t have a strong view, but I want to see more data that we’ve used up labor market slack.  Maybe the OMB is right—maybe there are another million workers who want to reenter the labor force.  I’d just like to see more data before reaching a conclusion. Lastly, on the balance sheet, I’m looking forward to our discussion in March.  I mentioned this yesterday—and I could ask the staff to consider this as they’re preparing their memos—which is the notion of, is it worth considering separating the announcement of a change in reinvestment policy and the actual implementation. I imagine the announcement itself is going to be a tightening action, but I don’t know how much of a tightening action it’s going to be.  And I could argue that there may be a benefit to our making some statement that we’re going to start rolling off the balance sheet six months later, and then seeing how markets react. If markets react aggressively, then we may want to delay federal funds rate hikes.  If markets don’t react aggressively, then we might want to continue with federal funds rate hikes.  I don’t have a strong view, but as staff members are preparing their analysis, if they could consider that, I would find that very helpful.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kashkari, is expressing his support for alternative B and discussing his focus on certain metrics to assess the appropriate stance of policy. He also mentions his openness to the possibility of reaching the target and discusses the idea of separating the announcement of a change in reinvestment policy from its actual implementation. However, there is no clear disagreement or contention with any other speaker or viewpoint.


Passage number 216.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide enough context or information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 217.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  We’ve reached or perhaps even exceeded full employment, and I have increasing confidence that inflation is on track to reach our objective. The language in alternative B positions us well to raise our funds rate target range in March, should the outlook evolve as I expect, or to delay action if conditions warrant. In thisJanuary 31–regard, I have several comments.  First, we shouldn’t get fooled if our first-quarter GDP growth forecasts fall between now and March.  As I pointed out yesterday, such a decline is a predictable aspect of a residual seasonality that’s shown up in the past several years. For the past three years, the Tealbook has revised down its real-time first-quarter forecasts between the January and March meetings.  So if history repeats itself and our first-quarter forecasts shift downward a bit, we should not take that as a signal that the economy is stalling or as a reason for policy delay. Second, here I’m going to echo some of the comments of President Mester.  Lack of fiscal policy clarity is not a reason to delay normalization in March.  It’s likely to be some time before we have clarity about the size, timing, and composition of fiscal stimulus.  But, as demonstrated by the Tealbook alternative scenarios, a larger or smaller stimulus would mainly affect the appropriate funds rate path in 2018 and 2019 rather than this year.  So I think we can focus on the actual data and the progress we have made on our objectives and not have to look for clarity regarding what fiscal and other policies will be in order to make another policy move. Finally, here I think I’m echoing President Kaplan’s remarks verbatim—I’m not used to going this late—another argument in favor of a March rate increase is to preserve our policy optionality.  So even if the appropriate policy rate path turns out to require, say, just two or three funds rate increases this year, starting out early gives us the flexibility to do that. And if the data surprise on the downside later on, well, we’ll just achieve a more gradual path by not having more rate hikes later in the year.  However, if the data suggest greater overshooting of full employment, higher inflation associated with more positive developments in the economy, or maybe fiscal stimulus—and, say, we need four increases—then we’ll be glad that we remained on the path of gradually raising rates in March.  Thank you.   January 31–CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing support for alternative B and providing their reasoning for why they believe a rate increase in March would be appropriate.


Passage number 218.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you.  A number of crosscurrents are affecting activity at present, and it will be useful to gather more information about how the economy is adjusting before undertaking a further removal of accommodation.  It will be useful to see if the increases in business and consumer sentiment are reflected in the incoming indicators of business investment and consumer spending; whether increases in mortgage rates have a noteable effect on the housing market; and whether the labor market, inflation, and inflation expectations improve further.  We may also learn more about the magnitude, composition, and timing of any forthcoming policy changes as well as other possible policy changes that could pose risks to the outlook to the downside or the upside. In the neighborhood of full employment, the increases in business and household sentiment and the prospect of expansive fiscal policy have changed the balance of risks to the outlook.  As a result, it is likely that continued progress in the labor market and on inflation will warrant further removal of accommodation. On the basis of recent indicators, we might expect that progress to continue to be gradual and steady.  Accordingly, a gradual approach on policy will remain appropriate as long as inflationary pressures stay muted, the economy remains short of our objectives, the neutral rate continues to be low, and downside risks from abroad are material.  However, if changes in fiscal policy lead to a more rapid elimination of slack, policy adjustment would, all else being equal, likely be more rapid.  Similarly, if stimulus or sentiment leads to more rapid progress toward our goals, the conditions we have set for a cessation of reinvestments will likely be met sooner than they otherwise would have been.January 31–In light of this, we should engage the question of at what point we consider the normalization of the level of the federal funds rate to be, as we said, well under way and whether, as a consequence, it will be appropriate to cease reinvestments. Providing further guidance to the market about the conditions that will bring about a decision to cease reinvestments, whether those reinvestments will cease all at once or taper gradually, whether the effect of that cessation of reinvestments on the size of the balance sheet will be smoothed to avoid large swings from month to month, and the likely appropriate dimensions of the balance sheet in the post-crisis “new normal” will all be valuable in helping prepare the public well in advance of any decision and minimizing the risks of excessive volatility occurring when the decision occurs.  It’ll also be helpful to discuss and communicate to the public whether we regard the balance sheet as a largely passive tool, subordinate to the short-term rate when the economy is removed from the effective lower bound, or whether, because it may operate on the economy somewhat differently than the short-term rate, it may be helpful in limited circumstances to use the balance sheet as an additional active tool, even away from the effective lower bound. Thus, I welcome discussion at the upcoming meeting about these issues to facilitate the achievement of a rough consensus in the Committee and to communicate that to the public in a timely manner. But these issues are for the future.  For the present, I support alternative B.  In that regard, I want to just note that I strongly support retaining language on inflation, because we have a very long-standing shortfall from our target and dropping that language would suggest that we are not actually serious about the symmetry of our target.  So I think that it is worth continuing this discussion.  It’s also worth noting that if dollar strength continues or increases,January 31–some of the progress on inflation that we’re anticipating may be suppressed.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

This passage does not contain any obvious contention or disagreement. It mostly consists of a discussion of various factors and indicators that the speaker believes should be considered before further decisions on economic policy are made. It also includes some suggestions for future discussions and considerations. Overall, there is no clear contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 219.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  The outlook hasn’t changed materially from the December meeting.  A move at this meeting would be a huge surprise, and it would also be inconsistent with our “gradual path” messaging.  So alt-B seems to be fully appropriate.  However, I think we do have to consider whether the current market expectations are consistent with the likelihood of a March move and whether alternative B will shift expectations in the direction we desire.  I concluded—and I think this is Thomas’s view as well—that, as written, alt-B is very neutral and is unlikely to shift expectations upward. I also conclude that we probably want a somewhat higher probability of a March move priced into the financial markets than we currently have—there’s only about a 20 or 25 percent probability of a March move.  Raising that probability also seems consistent with the sentiments I heard around the table about people’s own views of the likelihood of moving in March. The probability priced in right now seems low to me, in light of the fact that the economy is deemed to be growing at an above-trend pace.  We’re already close to full employment, and the fact that financial conditions—even though individual components have been moving around a lot, they’re really roughly unchanged from where we were a few months ago.  Stocks are up, credit spreads have narrowed a lot, and that’s been offset by the dollar appreciation and the increase in Treasury bond yields.  But, generally, I think the movements in financial conditions roughly cancel themselves out.  You also have the issue of household and business sentiment,  January 31–which has improved, and the likelihood that fiscal policy has become more stimulative.  So, to me at least, the risks to growth are shifting a bit toward the upside. So, what to do.  We could, at this late date, try to come up with language to make alternative B more upbeat and indicate that we are more inclined to an earlier move.  But I think that would be a mistake because it would be difficult for us to calibrate, and I think it would be hard for market participants to interpret.  What’s the urgency of communicating something forcefully in the February FOMC statement when the outlook for policy hasn’t changed appreciably.  So, instead, assuming the upcoming data are supportive, I would favor communications before the March meeting that raise expectations about the possibility of a March move. I note that the Chair has an excellent forum coming up for doing this in her Monetary Policy Report testimony.  And, of course, each of us can also play a role in shifting those expectations as necessary if we have to. CHAIR YELLEN.  I also have an early-March speech I’ll be giving in Chicago, which I could also use to do a little bit of shifting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 220.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Well, thank you for a very good round of discussion.  I think we had broad-based support for alt-B today.  There was one proposed change, this minor matter in blue—to add the words “Measures of” in paragraph 1.  I did hear some significant support for it.  Is there anybody who would have a problem with changing alt-B to include the bracketed language “Measures of consumer and business sentiment”. [No response]  Okay.  So let us do that.  And, Brian, do you want to then walk us through what we will vote on.  That will be the only change—to unbracket “Measures of consumer and business sentiment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 221.
”   January 31–MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As you indicated, this vote will be on the policy statement for alternative B as shown on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas Laubach’s briefing materials, with the inclusion of the phrase “Measures of” in the first paragraph.  It will also include the directive to the Desk as it is represented in the implementation note on pages 10 and 11 of Thomas’s briefing materials. Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Harker Yes President Kaplan Yes President Kashkari Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Now, we’re going to do something new that was described in Tealbook B.  If you read this discussion, starting at this meeting, whenever we have an FOMC decision on the funds rate, the Board is going to vote on the matters under the Board’s jurisdiction—namely, interest rates on reserves and discount rates.  The purpose of doing so is to reinforce the message of consistency of the Board’s decisions with the FOMC’s monetary policy decision.  So even if there’s no change in the stance of monetary policy, the Board will, from now on, vote on these matters to signal, in order to the public that our decisions are in accord and consistent with each other. So let’s proceed to do that.  I need a motion from a Board member to leave the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances unchanged at 75 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 222.
 MR. FISCHER.  I’m happy to make this precedent-setting proposal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that they are happy to make a proposal, indicating agreement and a positive outlook.


Passage number 223.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  Second.   January 31–CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Finally, I need a motion from a Board member to approve establishment of the primary credit rate at the existing rate of 1¼ percent and establishment of the rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas specified in the staff’s January 27 memo to the Board.  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward request for a motion.


Passage number 224.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "So moved" is typically used in a formal setting, such as a meeting or a legal proceeding, to indicate agreement or approval with a motion that has been proposed. In this context, "So moved" suggests that there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 225.
 MR. TARULLO.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Okay.  And that completes our work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statements made by Mr. Tarullo and Chair Yellen are met with agreement and without objection.


Passage number 226.
  Let me mention that the date of— MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The conversation seems to be cordial and respectful between the speakers.


Passage number 227.
 MR. LACKER. May I ask a question about this new procedure of the Board. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, of course.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen are having a normal conversation and there is no indication of any disagreement or conflict between them.


Passage number 228.
 MR. LACKER.  At a conference call at the very beginning of January 2001, the FOMC voted to reduce the federal funds rate target 50 basis points.  A number of Banks had put in for a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate.  The Board voted to approve those changes and, in its statement, invited other Reserve Banks to submit 50 basis point decreases, which Reserve Banks subsequently did and then the Board approved.  That was consistent with what I understood to be the current practice of the Board—acting only on requests of Reserve Banks.  We’re not changing that precedent, are we. CHAIR YELLEN.  No, we’re not changing the precedent. We change the discount rate only on the requests of Reserve Banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen are in agreement that the Board only changes the discount rate on the requests of Reserve Banks.


Passage number 229.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply expressing thanks to Chair Yellen.


Passage number 230.
  Brian, you’re— January 31–MR. MADIGAN.  I believe that’s been the precedent.  I don’t know if Scott wants to mention the Legal Division’s view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear expression of disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a belief and suggesting that Scott may have additional information to contribute.


Passage number 231.
 MR. ALVAREZ.  It’s a little more than the Legal Division’s view.  That has been the precedent, and, indeed, the Federal Reserve Act provides that the Reserve Banks must put in a recommendation for a rate every 14 days unless the Board requires that to be done more often.  And that was, I think, the legal statute that was used for the 2001 request.  But the Attorney General has stood by a Board interpretation from almost 100 years ago that the Board may determine the rate for the discount rate even without a request or recommendation from the Reserve Banks, and that would be the rate that would be established by the Reserve Banks.  I have found no situation in which the Board has in practice acted without a recommendation from a Reserve Bank.  But that is the state of the law.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides an explanation of the different views and interpretations of the relevant statutes, but there is no direct contention or disagreement mentioned.
