Passage number 26.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to accurately determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage based solely on the word "Second." More context is necessary to make an assessment.


Passage number 27.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In the absence of any objections, it'sapproved. [The next item on the agenda is] a preliminary report oncontemporaneous reserve accounting. Who is introducing this subject.Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that in the absence of any objections, something is approved, and then proceeds to introduce the next item on the agenda.


Passage number 28.
MR. AXILROD. I'll say a few words and Mr. Sternlight mightalso. We really have very little to add, Mr. Chairman, to our eight-page note. The memorandum takes the opportunity to explain how, underpresent procedures, one would construct paths under contemporaneousreserve accounting and review the paths in the course of the two-weekreserve period. The memorandum then goes on to suggest possibleadditional procedures or alternatives the Committee may wish toconsider, which introduce [various] degrees of automaticity to takeadvantage, so to speak, of the contemporaneous reserve requirements.These, in effect, would let misses in deposits, strong or weakrelative to the path, be reflected. In the case of strong deposits wewould have somewhat higher borrowings, and in the case of weakdeposits somewhat lower borrowings within the reserve period--to somedegree automatically, depending on the limits the Committee may wishto set, if indeed it wants to go in that direction. We suggested acouple of rather arbitrary procedures, that the Committee may want toconsider, in a somewhat limited effort to get at this under currentconditions, where there's some uncertainty about the meaning and theuse the Committee may wish to make of Ml, the variable to whichcontemporaneous requirements are tied. I don't know if Mr. Sternlightwould like to add a word or two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information and suggesting possible procedures for the committee to consider.


Passage number 29.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I think Steve summarized the note thatcame from us. But the little that I would add at this point is thatwe still would have, I assume, nonborrowed reserve targets for eachreserve period. I would see those as remaining the central focus ofDesk activity. With a two-week rather than a one-week period, ourperspective would change somewhat, but I think the main focus wouldstill be on the full reserve period. With a longer settlement period,we would probably give more attention to the profile of excesses ordeficiencies within the full period. To some extent, we still wouldlook at weekly reserve levels, but there wouldn't be the same need asnow to strive to meet those individual weekly targets. But weprobably would want to avoid sizable accumulations of excesses ordeficiencies within the two-week span. I don't see any need fordifferent operational techniques from what we work with now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply discussing the potential changes in focus and operational techniques that would result from a longer settlement period. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 30.
12/19-20/83MR. BOEHNE. Do you have some sense as to how much morevariability there might be in the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply asks for a sense of the potential variability in the funds rate.


Passage number 31.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I think it might depend on how one respondsto the point that Steve was outlining about the degree of automaticitythe Committee may want to permit to occur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is discussing a point made by Steve and suggesting that the Committee's response may vary depending on their view of the degree of automaticity.


Passage number 32.
MR. AXILROD. We have two problems to look at. We have alonger reserve period by one week; we have a two-week period. Rightnow within the reserve period we have some variability, particularlyon the last day of the week or before the weekend on special holidaysor something like that. What we can't tell is--and we've surveyed anumber of banks--[how banks may change] their reserve managementprocedures under contemporaneous reserve accounting. The answergenerally is that they don't plan to change anything they have beendoing, and they were doing different things. They're going toestimate their required reserves; I think they're going to be off to adegree. And then they're going to continue doing what they have beendoing. Those who tried to play the funds rate within a one-weekperiod are going to continue that and try to play it within a two-weekperiod. And those who wanted to stay in balance day-by-day are goingto try to stay in balance day-by-day. With a two-week period there isa greater opportunity to run bigger deficiencies or surpluses in thecourse of the period. That means there's more they have to make uplater. So, it seems to me there is some possibility of a lot morevariability in the funds rate within a period if banks happen to allowbig deficiencies to pile up and then wait until the 14th day, so tospeak, and have to make up twice as much as they previously did.That's one factor. On the average, in a two-week reserve period, ourresearch suggested we missed on our required reserves estimate by $100million or so, after some revision in the course of the period. Andthat would have almost an unnoticeable effect, I would suspect, on theaverage funds rate variability. Of course, if the Committee were topermit a more deliberate miss, that might add a little to it and therecould be some more effect. I'm not able to quantify it to any greatdegree, but I would suspect we would have somewhat more variabilitywithin the period and from period to period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the potential issues and challenges that may arise with a longer reserve period and how banks may adjust their reserve management procedures. The speaker acknowledges that there may be more variability in the funds rate within a period, but does not express any disagreement with this notion.


Passage number 33.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [With regard to] the miss in requiredreserves that is discovered at the end of the period, to what degreeis that related to a change in Ml and to what degree is it related toother factors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not expressing any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the relationship between the miss in required reserves and other factors, without taking a specific stance or arguing against any opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 34.
MR. AXILROD. Well, I was thinking of a miss in general whenI gave that $100 million figure--$100 to $200 million is what I thinkI have in here as the [average] miss. I don't have it refined at themoment between what might be so-called multiplier misses on governmentdeposits and interbank deposits and what might be just Ml itself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Axilrod explaining his thoughts on the average miss of $100 to $200 million.


Passage number 35.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Can you say anything sensible about thatwith further looking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is asking for further information or clarification, rather than expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 36.
MR. AXILROD. I think probably with some detailed looking wemight be able to break it [down].Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Axilrod is expressing his opinion and suggesting a possibility without contradicting any other point of view.


Passage number 37.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That might be worthwhile.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply suggests that something might be worth considering or doing without implying any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 38.
 Governor12/19-20/83MR. PARTEE. Am I right, Steve, that this doesn't begin untilthe first of February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply asks for clarification regarding the start date of an event.


Passage number 39.
MR. AXILROD. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The provided dialogue does not clearly indicate any disagreement or contention between the speakers. It is possible that there is disagreement present in the broader context, but based on this isolated passage, there is not enough information to determine if there is contention.


Passage number 40.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The date it begins is the first ofFebruary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states a specific date, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 41.
MR. AXILROD. The reserve maintenance period begins Thursday,the 4th and for deposits it's Tuesday, the 2nd of February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is providing information about the start dates for the reserve maintenance period. There is no contention or disagreement expressed or implied.


Passage number 42.
MR. PARTEE. So, we're talking about something that couldreceive attention again at the next meeting, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee is simply expressing his opinion that the topic they are discussing might be brought up again at the next meeting.


Passage number 43.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have a little problem here, itseems to me. It occurs to me that we better tell the market whatwe're doing; we should have a little statement. I don't know howwe're going to come up with a statement before the next meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing a problem and acknowledging the need for a statement to inform the market, but there is no indication of any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 44.
MR. GRAMLEY. One problem I had with the analysis is that itseems to imply that we're looking at Ml as our principal target. WhatI'm wondering is: What do we do in a world of CRR if we're continuingto target primarily on M2. It seems to me that we ought to have ananalysis of that. If we [use Ml], we would be changing our operatingtechniques in that event.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley is stating his problem with the analysis and questioning the focus on M1 as the principal target, suggesting that consideration should also be given to M2. He is requesting further analysis to understand what the approach would be in a world of CRR if the primary target is still M2.


Passage number 45.
MR. PARTEE. That was going to be my comment, too. Thisgives us the opportunity for paying more attention to nonborrowedreserves and letting shortfalls and excesses show through. But thatdoes seem to me to require some determination by the Committee as tothe amount of emphasis it wants to put on M1. That's why I askedabout the timing. It could be deferred somewhat. Also, the figuresmay be suspect for a while, given the [new] procedures and all that.Peter said we will be setting nonborrowed reserves just as we do now,but my impression is that what we set now is borrowings, notnonborrowed reserves. And if we really did set nonborrowed reservesagain, and then contemporaneously it ran off, that would put pressureon the discount window, as was our typical mode of operation when wevoted to put in contemporaneous reserves. So, I think it all needs tobe considered in that context. I guess I'm doing this as much asanything to remind the Committee that one of the decisions we need tomake is the attention to be paid to Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thoughts and concerns about the Committee's decision on the amount of emphasis to be put on M1 and how it relates to setting nonborrowed reserves. They are suggesting that these considerations should be taken into account when making decisions about M1.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 46.
MR. BALLES. That's a good point, Chuck. I would ask thequestion: If we went back to the approximately equal [weight]scenario that we had some years ago, that would not take care of allof the problems we're raising, would it. It might take care of what--half.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The mention of a "good point" and a counter-question suggests that there is a disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker is raising a different perspective or offering a different solution to the problems being discussed.


Passage number 47.
MR. PARTEE. I think the proposal, if I understood it fromthe staff, was that we might start off letting 25 percent of theovershoots and undershoots show through automatically and that mightnot be too inconsistent with something like equal attention to the setof the aggregates. But perhaps Steve ought to answer that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by MR. PARTEE seeking clarification from another person named Steve.


Passage number 48.
MR. AXILROD. In sum, the problem we had in analyzing M2 isthat if you are thinking of an automaticity in response, there is noneon M2 except to the degree that its Ml component moves. The onlyrequired reserves that move contemporaneously, after adjusting for12/19-20/83 -5-multipliers, are those on Ml. So, anything the Committee wants to dowith M2--that is if M2 were weak and the Committee wanted to moveborrowing or whatever--could be done quite independently ofcontemporaneous reserve accounting. You wouldn't need contemporaneousreserve accounting to do that. We were trying to think of things thatwere in some sense uniquely related to contemporaneous reserveaccounting. And with a lag we could observe M2 and make whateveradjustments in response to changes in M2 the Committee wished to seemade. But the question that arises with contemporaneous reserves isautomaticity--letting it happen if we aim at a nonborrowed or totalreserve figure. What happens is pretty much purely Ml, if we make theproper multiplier adjustments in a contemporaneous way. M2, to theextent it is affected, is only [affected] by Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an analysis and explanation of how M2 and M1 are related and how the Committee can make adjustments to M2 independently of contemporaneous reserve accounting.


Passage number 49.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I guess I was reading between the lines.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no evident contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that they were reading between the lines, implying that they were interpreting something that was not explicitly stated. However, this does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 50.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In a particular week we could make anadjustment for M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that in a particular week, an adjustment could be made for M2.


Passage number 51.
MR. AXILROD. Sure you can. There's no question about it.My only point was that that wasn't uniquely related to thecontemporaneous reserve accounting. That could be done either way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 52.
MR. PARTEE. That's why I thought you suggested 25 percent--to give some weight but not overwhelming weight to Ml behavior.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 53.
MR. AXILROD. That's right. And we did have in there at onepoint a paragraph that I took out about the various things to do ifthe Committee wanted to put some weight on M2. But that didn't strikeme as uniquely related to the contemporaneous reserve accounting. Wealways have done that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply explains a decision made by Mr. Axilrod to remove a paragraph that did not seem related to the topic being discussed.


Passage number 54.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without the full passage, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given information.


Passage number 55.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, if we don't make any more changesin our procedures than Steve and Peter have suggested, I think we'remissing a mighty good opportunity on our control mechanism. At leastsome of us supported this [change to CRR] primarily in the hope thateventually we'd be able to control total reserves better than we couldunder the lagged system. It's rather painful to me since I hadsomething to do with the lagged system and I hate to see the onecontribution I thought I had made go down the drain and turn out notto be a contribution. But in any event, I became persuaded that wecould control total reserves better under this system than we couldunder the lagged system. I recognize, of course, that the two-day lagimposes some of the same problems that we had with the full lag, butnot quite as much. And if we deemphasize Ml, then certainly we prettywell have to stick to the procedures that Peter and Steve were talkingabout. But I hope that this is just an initial step toward movingeventually to emphasizing Ml. If we assume that the presentnonborrowed reserve target procedures are going to be continued underthis new regime then, as I think Steve has indicated, with thisgreater variability in federal funds we ought to be prepared to letthat much show through to the extent that [the variability] resultsfrom unexpected changes in required reserves stemming from demand-induced changes in Ml. That would be a self-correcting brake onwhatever might be happening [to Ml]. I also think we ought to installas much automaticity in this as we possibly can. Right now, under our12/19-20/83present procedures, the Committee is really out of it once it choosesits initial borrowing target unless we have another meeting. And thisputs a tremendous burden on you, Mr. Chairman, in deciding the extentto which the borrowing target will be altered. I would greatly favora more automatic procedure because it would probably operate better.The only alternative is an ad hoc procedure. So, I think the 25percent is unduly low.Finally, it seems to me that if the system is going to workvery well at all, we have to force the banks to adjust during thatpart of the reserve maintenance period that overlaps the other period.This would mean that in the last two days of that reserve maintenanceperiod we ought not to let federal funds be subject to overly strictcontrol or else the banks and other depository institutions are notgoing to adjust during this two-week period at the beginning. If wedon't do some of these things, or move in that direction, we reallyhave put the banking system and now the thrift industry through atremendous amount of pain and suffering for something that's reallynot going to make us that much better off. We are not only going tohave a lot of trouble computing these things but, in my judgment,we're apt to get a lot of errors because it's frightfully complicated.We have to make use of these potential improvements in the mechanism,it seems to me, or else it's all for naught.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and opinions about the control mechanism and procedures, but there is no indication of disagreement with others.


Passage number 56.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 57.
MR. ROBERTS. It has been my assumption that the purpose ofcontemporaneous reserves, which have involved an enormous effort toput in place, is to improve control over the aggregates, particularlyMl. I don't want to repeat what President Black said; I'd like toassociate myself entirely with his views. I concur with him.I was going to ask the question, Steve: If the purpose isbetter control of the money supply, wouldn't we be better offtargeting on total reserves. I think we should [exercise] reducedflexibility rather than the other way around. The only problem that Ican see from that is increased volatility of interest rates, which Ithink the market would adjust to readily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 58.
MR. AXILROD. Well, if we had every multiplier adjustmentright, that would probably be the case. We don't normally get the mixeven in money supply type deposits--those at small banks and those atlarge banks--exactly right. So, that tends to throw us off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that the mix of money supply type deposits at small banks and large banks is not normally exactly right, which can cause some disruption or deviation from the intended outcome.


Passage number 59.
MR. ROBERTS. The multiplier differences are generally veryshort term, though, aren't they.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts is asking a question that seeks clarification or confirmation of information.


Passage number 60.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, that's right; they might average through.But on the technical side, the study we did a couple of years ago--before we had contemporaneous reserves, but even after we tried toallow for it--seemed to suggest, surprisingly, that nonborrowedreserves were probably better in controlling Ml on a month-by-monthbasis than total reserves so long as we didn't have exactly the samereserve requirement on all types of demand deposits. We have reducedthose variabilities. We only have three classes now: zero, a smallone, and a large one. Still, I would suggest that you would besurprised that total reserves would [not] do quite as well as youthink it would.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and stating their own suggestion based on a study they conducted. There is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 61.
12/19-20/83MR. ROBERTS. I'm thinking about our target in recent monthsand our actual experience and wondering about our control.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a statement made by Mr. Roberts expressing his thoughts and contemplations.


Passage number 62.
MR. BLACK. Steve, this gets closely at the point thatChairman Volcker was raising a while ago. Two kinds of demanddeposits are in there that are [not] normally in Ml: governmentdeposits and interbank deposits. I would think one could pretty wellestimate what they are going to do over an extended period of time; atleast what little work I've done on it suggests that. Insofar asshifts between large banks and small banks [are concerned], yes, inthe short run that is important; but over the long run I wouldn'tthink that really messes us up very much. The whole thing has beendesigned--at least I've perceived it this way and I'm sure others havealso or it wouldn't have [been adopted]--to control Ml because, as youmentioned, that's the only aggregate that is subject tocontemporaneous reserve requirements. All the rest, M2 and M3, aresubject to lagged reserves. So, we go into a reserve period andsupply what reserves are needed against those liabilities that havebeen lagged. Then we put in an additional amount to take care of theinterbank and government deposits plus what we think is necessary toachieve the right expansion in Ml. I believe that's manageable,although, of course, we have to agree that we want to control Mlbefore we can do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's understanding and belief about the management of different types of demand deposits and their impact on controlling M1.


Passage number 63.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no disagreement in the given passage; therefore, the answer is no.


Passage number 64.
MR. BOEHNE. Well, it seems to me that we ought not to usethe existence of CRR as a reason to go to M1 or not to go to Ml. Weought to give more or less weight to Ml depending on our judgment asto how good an intermediate target it is. CRR is a means to an end;it seems to me that we have the argument backwards when we say weought to put [more weight on] Ml because we now have CRR. There isprobably a case to treat Ml on the same footing as M2 and M3--not thatMl is particularly good, but it's not a whole lot worse than the othertwo. So, I think there is a case to give it equal weight. If we giveit nearly equal weight or equal weight, there is a case for somedegree of automaticity, and it strikes me that something like 25percent is not a bad way to start. It's a reasonable blend with whichto begin to experiment. But the main point is that we ought to judgeMl on its merits; I don't think whether we have CRR or not is a reasonpro or con to give additional weight to Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and discussing their reasoning behind it, but there is no disagreement with another point of view.


Passage number 65.
MR. BLACK. If you thought that was my [predilection], Ed, Imisled you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. Mr. Black is simply stating that his friend Ed had a mistaken belief about his preference.


Passage number 66.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 67.
MR. GUFFEY. It seems to me, as has already been said aroundthe table, that if we really are going to implement CRR and make itmeaningful, we have to elevate Ml to the essential, intermediatetarget we follow. I have two comments about that: First, I do notbelieve the informational content in Ml relative to income issufficient that I would be prepared to do that; and secondly, we'removing into a period where the commercial banks are learning how tooperate under contemporaneous reserves and that uncertainty wouldsuggest that at least for some period of time--maybe as much as sixmonths--we would want to continue to operate very much as we have inthe past. We may want to run an experiment along the side to see what12/19-20/83would happen if we adjusted 25 or 50 percent. But I would not runpolicy in the upcoming period--at least until July--given theuncertainty that falls out of CRR and the uncertainty that falls outof the relationship of Ml to the real economy. As a result, I wouldpropose that we not change operating procedures until we get a gooddeal more experience than what we will have on February 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing one individual's opinion and suggesting a proposed course of action. There is no indication of any conflicting viewpoints or disagreement among the speakers.


Passage number 68.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions Governor Gramley without providing any information or context about him.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 69.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I was not terribly sympathetic with theprocedures we followed from October '79 to October '82 in the firstplace and I haven't looked back on that period with any differentview. I'm even more reluctant to see us go in that direction now byelevating Ml even partially toward an intermediate target or byincreasing automaticity. That's not just a matter of week-to-week orday-to-day or even month-to-month variability in the funds rate thatwe would be looking at, but it's the fact that we're looking atrelationships between Ml and GNP since the fourth quarter of 1981 thatsimply have no parallel in prior history. To make it very simple, letme take the past several months. The staff has been anticipating asubstantial increase in the growth rate of Ml, as I have, because wehave such a strong economy. It hasn't happened. If we had had thekind of operating techniques that we did earlier and they wereaugmented by CRR, we would have experienced in the past couple ofmonths a very substantial decline in interest rates. And from myreading of the economy, we need a decline in interest rates and astimulus to economy activity to go with the fiscal stimulus like weneed holes in our heads. In my judgment, we're looking at a verystrong economy--an economy in which the risks are too much expansion,rather than too little, and more inflationary pressures. I recognizethat not everybody agrees with that, but that's my view. And that'swhy I would be very, very reluctant to see us go back to an automaticresponse pattern and the use of Ml as an intermediate target now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Mr. Gramley expresses disagreement with the procedures followed in the past and expresses reluctance to go in the same direction now. He also mentions that not everyone agrees with his view.


Passage number 70.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage based solely on the information provided ("Governor Wallich").


Passage number 71.
MR. WALLICH. There has been some change, at least in mythinking, and I think in the broader perception, of the desirabilityof very tight money control since we adopted CRR. We went to CRR, Ithink, in order to achieve this tighter control of the aggregates;we've seen that it can miscarry. I have become more concerned aboutwide fluctuations in interest rates and, therefore, more concernedabout the possible consequences of a rigorous application ofcontemporaneous reserve requirements on an M1 basis and on a fullyautomatic basis. We made this decision and I think we have to movesomewhat in that direction. Also, I don't think we can be quite asrelaxed about Ml as we had a right to be while it was misbehaving. Ithink it is beginning to establish somewhat greater credibility butit's certainly still under some degree of suspicion. So, since CRRdoes point toward Ml, with the relevant reserves that arecontemporaneous being for the most part against Ml, I think we can'tavoid giving more weight, though perhaps not full weight, to Ml. Ithink some automaticity is desirable because that's the nature of thewhole operation. If we didn't have automaticity, why have any form ofcontemporaneous or lagged reserve control. But I would not make ittotal; something in the range that has been suggested by the staffstrikes me as a reasonable compromise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Wallich is sharing his personal thoughts and concerns, but there is no opposition or conflict.


Passage number 72.
12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply provides a date and a name.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 73.
MR. CORRIGAN. Well, as almost everybody knows, I was neverpersuaded by the case for CRR to begin with and I'm still not. Inever thought it would make that much difference in terms of how wellwe could control Ml even if we decided that we wanted to control M1and nothing else. I do agree with Mr. Boehne's point, however, thatthe logically prior decision here is what we want to do with Ml. Butquite apart from that, I must say that my hunch is that we're going toend up with more [interest rate] variability than Steve and Peter seemto expect. That's just my hunch; I can't prove it either, but I thinkthat's the way things are going to go--that we're going to have morenoise and little or no improvement in the control of Ml. So, if Ireally had my druthers, I'd drop the whole thing. But I don't thinkwe can do that. I think it does argue, though, for what I would calla "go slow approach," particularly for the first few months. I havealways liked a degree of automaticity but I would be willing tocompromise that in the interest of trying to get this in place in anorderly way. I suspect that the full impact on data flows and on theoperations of cash managers of big banks and small banks has not beenfully digested in spite of the enormous amount of work that has beengoing on around the Federal Reserve in trying to get people up tospeed on this. In short, I don't think the operational impact eitheron us or on the banks has been fully digested up to this point. Thatagain would argue, in my way of thinking, for a go slow approach. Asfar as our own operations are concerned, I must say that I did notwalk away from reading the memo with a great deal of confidence thatwe know what we should do ourselves, much less that we know how thebanks will respond to what we do. Maybe I missed something but thebottom line is that I'm distinctly uneasy about the whole thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Corrigan expresses skepticism and hesitation towards the idea of controlling M1, stating that he was never persuaded by the case for CRR and does not believe it would have a significant impact. He also suggests that there may be more interest rate variability than others expect and that the operational impact of the decision has not been fully understood. Overall, he expresses uneasiness and a preference for a "go slow approach."


Passage number 74.
MR. AXILROD. We were pained, Mr. Corrigan, to leave optionsfor the Committee and not make a recommendation that would sound as ifwe were certain about how we're going to approach it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Axilrod and his colleagues did not want to make a recommendation that would sound certain about their approach.


Passage number 75.
MR. CORRIGAN. Well, I'm not thinking so much of your 25percent [suggestion] in there. I'm just thinking of what lies behindall that. This question of whether we have a miss because of what youcall multipliers as opposed to a shift in money demand is a profoundlyimportant question. Which side of that coin one is on [is important]even on a week-to-week basis. It seems to me that it's going to havevery, very sizable implications for the amount of noise in the moneymarket.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a reflective statement expressing the importance of understanding the relationship between multipliers and shifts in money demand.


Passage number 76.
MR. AXILROD. Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a simple reference to a person's name.


Passage number 77.
 Chairman, there is one thing--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you going to give us a little analysisof it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is asking the chairman if they are going to provide an analysis of something, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 78.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, but I thought in the context of thisdiscussion that there is one thing that perhaps is not clear enough[about] the automaticity in response to Ml. For example, if M1 wereweak by an amount that said borrowing would drop, say, $50 million inthat week, we did not necessarily concede that the next week we wouldstart off at a lower level of borrowing. That would be a matter ofdecision for the Committee. So, for example, if M1 were weak and M2were on track or strong, with any automaticity in there, borrowing12/19-20/83might be $50 million [lower one] week but the next week we could startoff with borrowing where it was earlier.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply clarifying a point and explaining the decision-making process in regards to borrowing levels.


Passage number 79.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We always come within $50 million anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is stating a fact that "We always come within $50 million anyway." It does not involve any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 80.
MR. AXILROD. That's right. And the next week if Ml werestrong, borrowing would be up $50 million and it could fluctuate; wewouldn't make judgmental adjustments of borrowing unless the wholebunch of the aggregates seemed weak or strong relative to theCommittee's anticipation or whatever rule the Committee might want touse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the conditions under which borrowing would be adjusted.


Passage number 81.
MR. PARTEE. When you say $50 million, where do you startoff--where you were before. I don't quite understand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply asking for clarification or further explanation.


Passage number 82.
MR. AXILROD. Well, suppose we started off a week at $650million, as we have been doing, and we got all the multipliers correctand all that and by the time we were through the two-week period, Mlin fact was weak to the extent that borrowing dropped $50 million andended up at $600 million. Then the question comes up: What level ofborrowing do we start the next week with. I'm saying, unless theCommittee says otherwise, we would start at $650 million again andthen if Ml is strong that makes up for that and we would be up to $700million of borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement of Mr. Axilrod's opinion or suggestion about what level of borrowing to start the next week with.


Passage number 83.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. To put it in perspective: $50 millionwould imply a $500 million dollar weakness in Ml from where we were,roughly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement explaining the perspective of the situation.


Passage number 84.
MR. PARTEE. I guess I would have thought if we had letborrowing drift down from $650 to $600 million because of a weaknessin Ml one week, that if Ml were then strong the next week, thusoffsetting the [previous weakness], we'd drift back to $650 millionfrom $600 million. It seems we might get a progressive movement if wealways went back to where we thought we should have been.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting their own thoughts and speculations without contradicting or challenging anyone else's ideas.


Passage number 85.
MR. AXILROD. Well, that's [an issue] we are raising. TheCommittee can decide whether it wants to cumulate, which would be togo up to $650 million [in this example] or stay at the $600 million asthe way to take account of M2 and M3 and everything else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply raising an issue for the Committee to consider and decide upon.


Passage number 86.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we had a week in which Ml, according toour perfect seasonal, went up by $5 billion--if you could imagine aweek of that sort--when we were thinking it was going to go up $1billion, borrowing would go up by $400 million, all that beingperfectly arranged.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The scenario described is theoretical and is presented without any conflicting viewpoints or debate.


Passage number 87.
MR. AXILROD. If we took the full 100 percent; at 25 percentwe'd be better off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a hypothetical scenario and suggests that being at 25 percent would be beneficial.


Passage number 88.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't quite understand this taking a 100percent or 50 percent. You're not going to know what the figure is;you don't know what to take 50 percent of.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their confusion or lack of understanding about a concept, but there is no conflicting viewpoint or argument being presented.


Passage number 89.
MR. AXILROD. We have our estimates. You're right that thereis always going to be the noise from the errors in the estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not demonstrate any disagreement or contention. It simply acknowledges that there will always be some degree of error in estimates.


Passage number 90.
-10-12/19-20/83MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I agree with the statementsof Governor Gramley. I opposed moving to contemporaneous reserveaccounting on the grounds that it didn't make sense unless onebelieved that Ml was a sensible target for policy. But now that we'vemade this investment, I think we ought to look upon it as a sunk costand as something that we will have in place in the event we everseriously want to go to pursuing Ml again. I don't think the factthat we've made this investment should automatically push us intochanging the way we're currently running monetary policy. I agreewith Lyle: I think it would have been a big mistake if we had hadthis in place 6 months ago and had pursued a much more aggressivelyeasy policy, which we would have had to do. I don't think we cansubstitute this new system, in this context, for the good judgment wehave been using.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Morris agrees with Governor Gramley's statements and expresses his own opinion on the matter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 91.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think it is analytically correctthat we went out and bought a potato digger but we don't have to plantthe potatoes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage presents a statement that is followed by a contrasting thought. The speaker acknowledges the correctness of purchasing a potato digger but suggests that there is no necessity to actually use it by planting potatoes.


Passage number 92.
MR. PARTEE. We can plant them; we don't have to water them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "we can plant them; we don't have to water them." The speaker is expressing a possibility or option without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 93.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 94.
MR. KEEHN. Well, it seems to me that CRR more than implies ahigher level of control of the aggregates and, whether we like it ornot, it's going to be with us on February 1st. There has been anenormous effort expended by us and by the commercial banks. And Iwould hope that for all of this trial and tribulation and money we'dbe able to deliver something. It seems to me that all this does implya much greater emphasis on Ml than we have been giving it recently.We have been through a period of significant adjustment; I think wewould be making a mistake if we did not use this as an opportunity tomove to reemphasize Ml. I would in no way suggest that we ought toput the system on automatic but I wouldn't lose the opportunity. I'dbegin to reemphasize Ml as our principal aggregate. I would plant thepotato.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and making suggestions, but there is no indication of disagreement or argument with anyone else.


Passage number 95.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're going to plant a small field. Mrs.Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents a scenario where someone is going to plant a small field. It does not involve any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 96.
MS. TEETERS. As you well know, I objected to CRR all the wayalong and I associate myself with reservations about Ml as a majortarget in policy and about its relevance to GNP. But I'm moreconcerned that if we go to any degree of automaticity, we're going toget increasing volatility in the interest rates. Can you give us someestimates, Steve. If we go to 10, 20, 25, or 50 percent automaticity,what degree of volatility will we reintroduce into the interest ratestructure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Teeters, expresses her objection to CRR and her reservations about Ml as a major target in policy and its relevance to GNP. She also expresses concern about the potential volatility in interest rates if any degree of automaticity is implemented. This suggests that there is contention and disagreement among the speakers regarding the use of automaticity and its potential effects on interest rates.


Passage number 97.
MR. AXILROD. Well, Governor Teeters, our best guess hasalways been, that we get 20 to 25 basis points per 100. It seems alittle less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact or an estimation without any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 98.
MS. TEETERS. Per 100 of what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement by Ms. Teeters, without indication of any conflicting views or opposing arguments.


Passage number 99.
MR. AXILROD. A hundred million dollars of borrowing. Wethought [a change of] something like $400 to $500 million in borrowingwould result in a one percentage point [change in interest rates].-11-12/19-20/83Now, we've gone through $400 to $500 million of borrowing withvirtually no movement in the funds rate in the process of which we'vedeclared that there were shifts in the demand for borrowing, shifts inthe demand for excess reserves. And making those judgments has tendedin some sense to moderate these movements, or the banks have just notcared. We haven't gotten those kinds of movements. So, I would notreally want to swear on a stack of Bibles that a $500 millionborrowing change will give you 1 percentage point. But I would saythat with a $50 million change in borrowing within a week one is notgoing to discern the effects relative to the noise. It has toaccumulate to begin to move the funds rate in some sort of trend way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and uncertainty about the effects of borrowing on interest rates.


Passage number 100.
MS. TEETERS. Well, what are you referring to as "noise". Iwas interpreting that as being volatility in the interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Ms. Teeters is seeking clarification or a definition of the term "noise" to better understand the speaker's intentions.


Passage number 101.
MR. AXILROD. I meant the variation [at the end of astatement period.] Mr. Sternlight aims at a nonborrowed reserve pathconstructed from some borrowing assumption and some knowledge of thedemand for excess reserves. The noise that I meant was what happensto it on the last day of the statement week when the factors affectingreserves other than his actions vary by $2 billion, say, or whenrequired reserves relative to expectations change by a lot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a clarification and discussion of a specific concept.


Passage number 102.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For reasons other than a change in Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there are reasons other than a change in Ml, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 103.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, and changes that we hadn't allowed for; wewere estimating but we missed. And that will either add to that $2billion or subtract from it; they could be offsetting. To the degreethat it adds, there is going to be a result in the relation in freereserves or nonborrowed--they are the same--that is different fromwhat we were aiming at. That's a kind of noise in the system, I wouldsay. The additional noise is how banks decide to manage theirreserves over a two-week period. If they suddenly get it into theirheads that the funds rate is going down when it isn't, they are goingto get themselves into a deep hole and at the end of the statementweek they are going to have to borrow a lot. Over a 14-day periodthey might have to borrow, instead of $3 billion on the [last] day, $6or $7 billion. That will put a lot more pressure on the funds ratethan they have been used to. So, over a two-week period there is alittle more capacity for noise, depending on how banks manage theirreserves and what [rate] expectations they have for one reason oranother.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. Mr. Axilrod is discussing the potential for changes and variability in the estimated $2 billion value, which could either add to or subtract from it. Additionally, he mentions the possibility of banks mismanaging their reserves and the potential consequences for the funds rate. These discussions highlight points of disagreement or uncertainty in the topic.


Passage number 104.
MR. ROBERTS. Even banks learn.SPEAKER(.). Over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 105.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. More slowly than most other people.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "More slowly than most other people" does not indicate contention or disagreement. It is a comparative statement about the speed at which someone does something, without any opposing viewpoints being presented.


Passage number 106.
MS. TEETERS. Well, I think one of the great costs of theperiod from '79 to '82 was the high volatility of rates--not only theshort-term rates but the long-term rates. What I'm really concernedabout is that I simply don't want to get back into a situation inwhich that sort of volatility reoccurs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses concern about the volatility of rates in the past and states that they do not want it to happen again in the future.


Passage number 107.
MR. AXILROD. I didn't mean that as "noise".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Axilrod clarifying his intention behind a previous comment.


Passage number 108.
 I meant whatseems to me to be the product of the controls of---12-12/19-20/83MS. TEETERS. But the more automaticity we build into thesystem, the greater the volatility is going to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a cause-and-effect relationship without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 109.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're almost bound to get more volatilityin the very short run, whatever we build into this. I think--we'llsee--that just [the nature of] this system is going to give us morevery short-run volatility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply states that there will likely be more volatility in the short run regardless of any specific actions taken. It does not present differing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 110.
MR. AXILROD. Probably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states a fact about Mr. Axilrod without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 111.
MS. TEETERS. But one of the things that was most damagingwas that the short-term volatility got translated into the long-termmarket.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating a fact about the damaging effects of translating short-term volatility into the long-term market.


Passage number 112.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It probably happened over a longer periodof time--volatility over a month, two months. I'm not sure. That'san open question. But I think within a two-week period we're going toget more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is unsure about the specific timeframe but believes that more information will be obtained within a two-week period.


Passage number 113.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Unless we offset it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 114.
MS. TEETERS. Unless we offset it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting or contradictory statements. It is a straightforward statement by Ms. Teeters without any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 115.
MR. BLACK. We should get more variation in the federal fundsrate concomitant with that. If we hit our target on a more regularbasis, I wonder if we'd really have that much volatility in othershort-term rates. I can see very easily that we would in the federalfunds rate. And I'm not sure it follows in longer-term rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black is expressing his thoughts and uncertainty about the potential impact of getting more variation in the federal funds rate on other short-term and longer-term rates. He is not contradicting or disputing any previous statements or arguments.


Passage number 116.
MR. GRAMLEY. That was the argument that was used in October'79: You don't have to worry much because most of the variation wouldbe in the funds rate, a little in the short-term market rates, but thelong rates would hardly react--particularly after the markets have anopportunity to adjust. And that just didn't happen at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about what happened in October '79, without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 117.
MR. BLACK. But we didn't hit our targets as regularly as Iam talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black is simply stating a fact about not being able to hit their targets regularly.


Passage number 118.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The mention of "Mr. Forrestal" alone does not provide any information about contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 119.
MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, I'm one of those whonever really understood completely how CRR was going to give us moreprecision with respect to the monetary aggregates. But that's waterover the dam, as other people have said, and I think we have to goforward with the program. But I think there's going to be an awfullot of confusion out there right up until February 1st, particularlyamong the smaller and medium-size banks. That confusion is going toreign supreme for some weeks after we introduce this system. So, Idon't think we ought to go in any way to any automaticity at thispoint. I would much prefer to see us go slowly. Automaticity has acertain amount of logical appeal, but I think the timing is wrong interms of the implementation of CRR. The other point that I reallywould like to make--and perhaps this also has been said--is that Idon't think we ought to be looking at the question of CRR'srelationship to Ml. The question ought to be asked the other wayaround. The threshold question it seems to me is: What target doesthe Committee really want to focus on. We ought not to be pushed intoone or the other because of a technical accounting system. And I-13-12/19-20/83happen to think at this point in my membership on this Committee thatM1 is a pretty good target and one that has a pretty good relationshipto GNP. Others have argued that around the table before. But it's aquestion that we now have an opportunity to look at in great depth andI think we ought to seize the opportunity before CRR becomes effectiveto zero in on what we really want to target on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Forrestal, expresses confusion and skepticism about the effectiveness of the CRR (Compensating Reserve Requirements) system in providing more precision with respect to monetary aggregates. He also disagrees with the idea of automaticity in implementing the system and instead suggests a slower approach. Additionally, he argues for considering the target of the Committee's focus, suggesting that M1 is a good target with a relationship to GNP, while others may have different perspectives.


Passage number 120.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no specific passage provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 121.
MR. BALLES. I guess I'll resist the temptation of asking,Mr. Chairman, why we decided to go back to CRR in view of all of this.But passing beyond that, first I'd like to associate myself with theview that Ed Boehne expressed so well: Just because we have CRRdoesn't mean we necessarily should revert to Ml as the primaryintermediate target. However, I consider it personally a ratherfortunate piece of timing in that I'm convinced--as some others arearound the table, though many are not--that we are in the process ofwitnessing a new behavior of Ml where it's going to be more reliable.We're beyond that stage where velocity dropped in that unprecedentedmanner in '82 or early '83 and, therefore, we now can begin to relymore on Ml, as we used to do. If that's the case, and it happens thatit has come along just at a time when we could have some automaticityin Ml--not complete in my view--then some automaticity would not bedamaging; it probably would be desirable. I wouldn't want, as SiKeehn said--I think it was you, Si--to go fully automatic. But Ithink it's time we went partly that way. I come out, bottom line, inmuch the same way as Si Keehn and Ted Roberts and Bob Black did.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Balles, expresses disagreement with the idea of reverting to M1 as the primary intermediate target, while also agreeing that M1 could be more reliable now. He also disagrees with going fully automatic but suggests going partly that way.


Passage number 122.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without having access to the specific passage in question.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 123.
MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I join those of our colleagues whohave been accepting the hypothesis that we will have more volatilityin short-term rates, perhaps spilling over into long-term rates, by acloser adherence to M1 targeting, or by CRR. And if indeed there isto be some degree of increased volatility as a result of our moving inthat direction, it seems to me that the risks in 1984 and in 1985should be kept in mind and would mitigate against our moving in thatdirection. I'm thinking, of course, of the international debtsituation, of the efficacy of business fixed investment as asustaining force in the expansion, of housing, and obviously ofcommercial construction, which I think is going to be the next REITdisaster and which is susceptible to the influence of [interest]rates. It seems to me that there is some potential reward, but it'srather a paper reward, of controlling M1 better. But how long is itgoing to take us to learn what velocity is going to be and what trendline is going to emerge--either the old one or a new one. How long isit going to be before we can see what the relationship of this new oneis with regard to the economy. I think we may, as a group, have amore favorable look at M1 and at a more automatic procedure later. Iam sure that many in the markets will continue to feel, surmise,believe in, or have faith in M1 and its close relationship witheconomic activity. As long as that belief is out there, it'ssomething we have to deal with. But now with the unknowns with regardto velocity and M1 and the risks to this economy by increasing thevolatility of interest rates, I simply think we should wait.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker (Mr. Martin) expresses concern about moving towards M1 targeting or CRR, suggesting that it could lead to increased volatility in interest rates. He mentions several potential risks in the economy that could be negatively affected by this volatility. On the other hand, he acknowledges that some people may still believe in the close relationship between M1 and economic activity. Overall, the speaker seems to advocate for caution and waiting before making any moves towards M1 targeting.


Passage number 124.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me draw several conclusions. Ithink it is logically or otherwise correct that simply because we-14-12/19-20/83adopted contemporaneous reserve requirements, for better or for worse,we don't have to arrange our policy from now until eternity to takemaximum advantage of that operationally. That's a separate decisionand logically comes first. Secondly, I do have the sense that there'senough uncertainty about this [CRR] that we're not going to want to doanything very radical in the very first months of its introduction.There may be very little change. Thirdly, I think we really have tosay whether we're going to do anything very different or what we'regoing to do because there will be [a lot of] confusion around. And ifthis process begins on February 2nd, inevitably I guess we're going tohave to say something before then.As a footnote, I want to be reminded that we may have toadvance the next meeting, anyway--which will be convenient for thisreason, I suppose--because I might have to testify before the LincolnDay recess in the Congress. If so, that doesn't give us enough time[between] the meeting as it is now scheduled [and] the testimony. Idon't know that for certain at the moment, but we may have to get backwith you to see about a date roughly a week earlier [than nowscheduled]. If we do that, we can then decide precisely what we wantto say, although even then it will be getting kind of late, I suppose.It might be that there will be a lot of questions. I would prepare atleast one version or maybe two or three versions of precisely what anannouncement might say as to how we're going to handle this at leastfor some transitional period while we at least make sure that thestatistics come in in an orderly and predictable way.Then, finally, I think the question is: What weight do wewant to put on the different aggregates, which is the natural subjectof the discussion at the next meeting in terms of setting targets;we're going to have to discuss it anyway. People probably havedifferent opinions about whether we will want to make any majorchanges, but it is a natural focus of the discussion. But even if weput a lot of weight on Ml, I wouldn't be prepared to put full weighton it for at least a brief transitional period to gin up an operating[procedure] just because we have contemporaneous reserves, simply toget the operating bugs out at the extreme.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is presenting their own thoughts and conclusions on a particular subject, but there is no indication of opposing viewpoints or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 125.
MR. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, I agree with you on thatentirely, but I think we've left unsaid here one point that isimportant. And that is: In this interim high-risk period of 6 monthswe've built very wide latitudes on reserve requirements and we'veessentially made the smaller banks immune to the process, which Ithink reduces the risk. It doesn't eliminate it, but it certainlyreduces it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. Mr. Roberts agrees with the chairman on most points, but raises a different perspective on the potential reduction of risk in smaller banks.


Passage number 126.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we'll see how it goes. I don't havea good feel for it. On Ml itself, just to make one substantive point,I have some feeling that it's getting a little better but I don't knowwhy. It has been way off on the low side, and seeing it come backfrom that I guess makes everybody feel a lot more comfortable. But wehave one quarter of an exceptionally large rise in velocity now. So,while I have a feeling that maybe it is going to be reacting a littlemore normally, we surely can't prove it by any figure we've seen atany particular point in the past quarter anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 127.
MR. MORRIS. I think Ml is a random walk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Mr. Morris is presented as his personal opinion about the nature of Ml, without any opposing views being mentioned or contradicted.


Passage number 128.
-15-12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not quite willing to say that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It appears to be a neutral statement or observation.


Passage number 129.
MR. BOEHNE. I'm surprised to hear you say that, Frank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Boehne expresses surprise, but it doesn't necessarily imply disagreement.


Passage number 130.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd hate to have to pick out today whatthe trend is going to be over the next three years, even though I havethe feeling that it may be a little more reliable. I'll know morethree years from now. Well, is there anything else to be said on thissubject.We will see once we set the date of the next meeting, but wemay either have to circulate something to you in writing before thenor have a telephone call or something because I do have the suspicionthat people in the market and everybody else are going to ask whatthis is going to do and how we are going to conduct ourselves. Theywill ask whether we are going to do something radically different andwe ought to tell them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily discusses the speaker's uncertainty about predicting trends and their consideration of how to communicate their plans to others in the market. There is no argument or disagreement present in this passage.


Passage number 131.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, could I make one more observation.On this automatic part, suppose we've agreed that Ml deserves a littlemore emphasis than it now has; if it runs above target andconsequently required reserves are higher than the path, we can eitheradjust the borrowing up automatically or we can do it on an ad hocbasis. Since we've not been emphasizing Ml to any great degree, theseadjustments in the borrowed reserve targets have all been on an ad hocbasis. There's no way the Committee can realistically participate inthose decisions. That has to be left up to you in consultation withSteve and Peter or however you want to do it. And that is the point:That is the only alternative to some kind of automatic adjustmentmechanism, if in fact we're going to pay any attention at all to Ml.I think we ought to focus on that part of it. I'm quite willing todelegate that to you, but I'm not sure whether I'd be that willing todelegate it to your successor, whoever he might be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is making an observation and expressing willingness to delegate certain decisions.


Passage number 132.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On this M1 issue, I don't know what thefigures look like, but I was looking at this so-called experimentalseasonal, for what it's worth, that we publish figures on. Themonthly figures look quite different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses uncertainty about the M1 issue and states that the monthly figures appear different.


Passage number 133.
MR. AXILROD. We publish them weekly. Yes, [they lookdifferent]. In terms of absolute variations, though, be aware thatthe average absolute variation of the experimental, both monthly andweekly, is just about equal to the average absolute variation of theregular series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Axilrod simply provides information about the average absolute variation of the experimental and regular series. There is no expression of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 134.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They look erratic in different ways.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is neutral and does not imply any disagreement or contention. It simply states that "they look erratic in different ways."


Passage number 135.
MR. AXILROD. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple affirmation.


Passage number 136.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the way I see it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "That's the way I see it" indicates that this is the speaker's personal opinion or perspective, without indicating any disagreement or contention with others.


Passage number 137.
MR. AXILROD. Very different [timing].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that the timing is different.


Passage number 138.
MR. ROBERTS. We don't get growth in December on thisexperimental [version].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 139.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, and it shows a sizable growth inNovember, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about a sizable growth in November, expressing their opinion about it.


Passage number 140.
 That brings it to---16-12/19-20/83MR. AXILROD. And the weekly changes in the experimentalseries are sometimes larger than in the regular series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is providing factual information about the weekly changes in the experimental series. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 141.
MR. ROBERTS. The seasonals wouldn't affect the reserverequirements, would they.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking a question to seek clarification and information.


Passage number 142.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, because the target is set forth inseasonally adjusted figures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, because there is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage. The statement simply provides information about the target being set in seasonally adjusted figures.


Passage number 143.
 We live in an eerie world of seasonaladjustment, but when they are converted into--MR. ROBERTS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is merely stating a fact about living in a world of seasonal adjustment.


Passage number 144.
 They're real, but they're converted--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but they're converted from a targetthat is seasonally adjusted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact that the data points mentioned are indeed real.


Passage number 145.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, could I ask Steve about that point.Steve, what do you think about the merits of the experimental[seasonal] versus the regular one. We've done some work that suggeststhat the seasonals are probably bad for the last part [of the year].Hence, we didn't have as much of a burst in Ml earlier and we haven'thad as much of a slowdown since then. What one believes on that makesa lot of difference, I think, in where one comes out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Black simply asks Steve for his opinion and presents some evidence to support his own viewpoint.


Passage number 146.
MR. AXILROD. Well, my memory is that if you look at the twoseries on a quarterly basis, the pattern doesn't look very different.There are small differences, but not big ones. There is somewhatslower growth, I think, in the experimental [series]. I'm not sure ofthis in the second half, quarter-over-quarter. But month-to-month, ifyou look at the second half, the growth rate in the experimentalseries drops somewhere around July--I may be off by a month--and thenwith the exception of one negative month where it's -0.5 percent, itfluctuates between 3 and 7 percent. So, it tends to look as if it hasdropped down to a new 5 percent or so growth rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is presenting information and observations about the growth rate of the experimental series. There is no apparent contention or disagreement.


Passage number 147.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" is simply identifying the chairman, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 148.
 Yes, it looks much more like a drop to aplateau than--MR. AXILROD. Whereas the other series looks like it wasgoing along strongly and suddenly it dropped to 2 or 3 percent forfour months. It gives a slightly different look to Ml. Up to thatpoint I had been getting prepared to recommend to the Board that wedrop the experimental series, mainly because it wasn't showing anyless volatility. I had the feeling, therefore, that it was justproving that weekly and monthly seasonals are difficult to get at andthat Ml is an inherently volatile series. That's how I wouldinterpret Ml. But now it looks as if the experimental series has madea comeback. It seems to me that it still has some value and I wouldtend to recommend that it be continued, but certainly onlyexperimentally. It hasn't demonstrated--and we haven't found--a wayto make the weekly seasonal variation less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker initially expresses their intention to recommend dropping the experimental series because it wasn't showing any less volatility and they believed it was proving that weekly and monthly seasonals are difficult to get at and that Ml is an inherently volatile series. However, the speaker then acknowledges that the experimental series has made a comeback and believes it still has value and should be continued, albeit only experimentally. This shows a change in opinion and a disagreement regarding the value and volatility of the experimental series.


Passage number 149.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The only thing I conclude from it is that,as Steve is suggesting, weekly and monthly seasonals are verytreacherous and we shouldn't assume too much. But [the results] arequite different, depending on which seasonal one uses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their conclusion and acknowledging that different seasonal data can lead to different results.


Passage number 150.
-17-12/19-20/83MS. TEETERS. Well, that argues even more strongly againstany large degree of automaticity. If our current data are highlyvolatile, we don't quite know where we are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is providing an argument against a large degree of automaticity based on current data being highly volatile.


Passage number 151.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we're back in that old dilemma: Ifwe wait too long, we've waited too long; and if we react too quickly,we've reacted too quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
This statement is acknowledging a common dilemma without expressing any disagreement or contention. It presents a situation where there is no clear answer and highlights the difficulty in finding the right balance.


Passage number 152.
MR. BLACK. It's hard to argue with that one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black's statement suggests agreement or a lack of contradiction.


Passage number 153.
MR. AXILROD. As a technical point, Mr. Chairman, a two-weekreserve period has the advantage of averaging through a little, insome sense; it has the disadvantage of delaying [us] ever so slightly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing the advantages and disadvantages of a two-week reserve period.


Passage number 154.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is there anything else to be said on thissubject. We will turn to Mr. Kichline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement that there is nothing else to be said on the subject and that they will turn to Mr. Kichline. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 155.
MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It appears to be a straightforward statement.


Passage number 156.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. We can have some Committeediscussion, which I would hope would focus as much as possible on whatrisks, probabilities, or otherwise, people may see looking out 6 to 12months ahead either on economic activity or on prices. Mr. Boehne.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage suggests having a discussion about risks and probabilities related to economic activity or prices in the next 6 to 12 months. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 157.
MR. BOEHNE. I think if I were sitting where Jim is sitting,I would probably come up with about the same forecast, but I suspectthat the economy is going to turn out to be a good bit stronger nextyear than the standard forecast. I think that what we have here is acumulative self-feeding momentum that will deliver a stronger economyso that the total, in effect, is stronger than seemingly theindividual parts. I've talked to a lot of people from a lot ofdifferent industries in my District in recent weeks and I think termslike euphoric and ebullient and buoyant are very descriptive [of theirviews]. If I heard these kinds of reports from my good friend BobBoykin I would say: "Well, that's Texas." But when I hear them inPennsylvania and around the Third District, which has generally beenon the slow side, that tells me something about what is happening tothis self-feeding momentum and to the psychology. My board, whichgenerally has been on the bearish side--we have some industries thathave been hit fairly hard--in its meeting last week was concerned forthe first time in memory that perhaps things were moving along tooquickly to be sustainable.Now, having said that on that side, I also think the risk ofmore inflation is greater. I think that's definitely where the risksare and also that we likely will get a stronger economy. Also, I finda great sensitivity to interest rates out there--a view that [higher]interest rates could shut this down fairly promptly. For what it'sworth, I have the sense that if interest rates went up 1 percentagepoint or so, it probably would dash some of these expectations but nota great deal; but if the increase were in the 1 to 2 point range, Ifeel it really would have a major effect on this psychology. A goodmany people I talked to think that if we had something in theneighborhood of a 2 percentage point increase in rates, that couldreverse things fairly quickly. I'm not saying that that is scientificfact or even that it is true; I'm simply giving you a sense of howpeople view various kinds of increases in rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and observations, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 158.
-18-12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're not going to tell us whether youagree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 159.
MR. BOEHNE. Well, getting ahead of ourselves, I think thereis room for a little snugging but it ought to be very cautious--justenough to deflate the bubble a little but not all that much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Boehne suggests that there should be caution in making adjustments, but does not express any disagreement with anyone else's opinion.


Passage number 160.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions a person's name.


Passage number 161.
MR. CORRIGAN. I didn't know I had put my hand up, but I'llgo ahead anyway. I put my comments in two categories. First, for thepast couple of days I have had in the Bank the CEOs--and strictly theCEOs--of a good cross section of major industrial companies in theNinth District, including some of the really Blue Chip companies up inthe Minnesota area. I have been getting from these people almostastonishing reports of very pronounced stretch-outs in deliveries thathave materialized just in the past six months. One of the bigcomputer manufacturers, for example, said that six months ago he couldpick up the phone and get anything he wanted just like that. Now, sixmonths later, he's looking at delivery delays of six months to a yearon things that were simply available with a phone call a few monthsago. There were reports of very, very strong final sales. And thisseemed to be the case across the board, in everything from wood,construction materials, soft goods, computers--you name it. One ofthe very substantial food companies indicated that their soft goodsoperations--not the foods in some cases--were showing unit sales inDecember up 40 percent from a year ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply reporting on the feedback they have received from CEOs of major industrial companies in the Ninth District.


Passage number 162.
 There was a--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What company was that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply asks a question without any conflicting statements or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 163.
MR. CORRIGAN. It was Some of their softgoods-- and things likethat were up 40 percent in unit terms.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 164.
MR. PARTEE. Their sales to retailers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions a statement made by Mr. Partee regarding sales to retailers.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 165.
MR. CORRIGAN. They own the retail outlets in some cases, soit's a mix of both their own retail outlets and their supplies toretailers. I think it's fair to say that in one way or another everyone of these CEOs reported building price pressures. The good news isthat they all at least indicated that they were holding the line ontheir wage cost [increases] for 1984--other than a bank, whichwouldn't surprise you. Other than a bank, every one of these roughlytwenty or so firms reported that their plans were for compensation in1984 [to rise by] 4 to 5 percent or less. They also reported, againalmost without exception, very severely depleted inventories either intheir raw materials or, in the case of those in retailing, in items onthe shelves. Perhaps most disturbing of all to me: There was a trulyuniversal expectation among these people that we would have sharplyhigher inflation and interest rates by the end of 1984. Believe it ornot, some of these people even spoke in terms of a "buy now" attitudecreeping back into the picture for fear of the outlook toward the endof 1984. That was my rather clear impression, with the exception ofthe wage side, which would suggest that the risks for both the economyand inflation are very much on the up side. There was deep concern,even among the people in this group whom I know to be very close tothe current Administration, that the deficit situation is totally outof control--that there is no prospect whatsoever for being able to-19-12/19-20/83deal with it in the near term or the long term. Again, at least amongthis group, there was a sense that it was just very, very [important]that the Federal Reserve do what it could to hold the line.Abstracting from those comments, I still obviously feelpersonally that the risks are on the up side in the economy. We knowexports are a soft spot and there certainly is, I think, morefinancial vulnerability out there than meets the eye. I don't thinkthat problem is behind us by any means. But the thing that gives methe greatest cause for concern right now is that I can't quite figureout for myself what really is happening with inflation. In the lastsix months the rate of increase in the consumer price index hasdoubled--more than doubled. It is now running at 5 percent or alittle better, and I can't see that there is any great influence ofspecial factors in there. Maybe Mr. Kichline knows something that Idon't know, but I can't find them. I don't think that the markets ingeneral have quite caught up with the fact that the consumer priceindex now seems to be rising at a rate of 5 percent or a little more.On the other side, we haven't seen any pickup in the deflator; andcertainly wholesale prices continue to look very good. One of thethings that I look at myself as a barometer of price pressures is thespread between the rise in the GNP deflator and the behavior of unitlabor costs in the economy as a whole. Very seldom does that spreadexceed 2 percent and it's unprecedented for it to exceed 2 percent inthe early stages of the recovery. But we're looking at a spread ofsomething like 3-1/2 percent, which I would interpret as a greatdesire on the part of businesses to make themselves whole from therecession or to get themselves whole [before] the recession they thinkis going to come in 1985. The bottom line, from my perspective, isthat we may already be seeing a build-up in price pressures in theeconomy that if carried forward in 1984 would be very, verydisturbing. That's about what I think, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that there is a "universal expectation" among the CEOs that there will be sharply higher inflation and interest rates by the end of 1984. However, the speaker himself expresses concern and uncertainty about the inflation rate and mentions that the consumer price index has doubled in the last six months. This indicates disagreement or contradiction in their views on the state of inflation.


Passage number 166.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but the passage you provided is incomplete. Could you please provide the complete passage so that I can determine if there is contention or disagreement?


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 167.
MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, as far as the Board staff'sforecast, we would not have a whole lot of difference in views. Interms of the risk: If it's wrong, it's probably a bit wrong on thedown side; I think the economy is possibly a little stronger than thestaff has indicated. I'm hearing much of what Jerry is hearing; theredoes seem to be a real concern about the possibility of inflationreaccelerating if the pressures are not already there. Looking at itfrom our part of the country, it still is a bit of a mixed bag. Weare getting strength now from some of the areas that had been slowcoming back [from the recession]. Of course, housing has been one ofthe strong factors [in the expansion] and that is levelling off. Andthat is a good sign because I think we had gotten ourselves into anoverbuilt and risky situation in terms of the land boom. I know thishas been commented on before, but it is still is going on. Thenewspaper has been running a series of articles on what is apparentlya real scandal involving condominiums. [Developers] built over 5,000condominiums in just one little area out by a lake but increased[prices] 600 percent in one day through land clipping. They areselling the condominiums at a rate of 42 units a month, so they have a6- or 7-year supply. The small savings and loans around the statehave been drawn into this. They are very exposed; even the goodoperators--or those who were supposed to be good--seem to be caught upin it. The president of a title company told me--and he sees a lot of-20-12/19-20/83these deals in north Dallas--that he bought a piece of property for$17 million. He was going to close on it a week ago last Friday.Before he closed, he sold it for $34 million and that transaction wasclosed last Friday. I don't know what somebody sees in it that theseller wasn't seeing.On the energy side, drilling in particular is showing alittle strength. In the natural gas area, which has been quite aproblem, there is some feeling that the bubble is about to [burst] andthat maybe by late '84 that will have leveled out a bit. On theagricultural side, by the time one puts together the pluses andminuses it turns out to be a little better than was anticipated.Again, though, it's pretty uneven if you look at our District as awhole. Northern Louisiana and New Mexico are showing a littleimprovement; it's still rather tough out there. On the unemploymentsituation, we're below the national rate, but the state of Texas as awhole has an unemployment rate of 7.4 percent while for Dallas/FortWorth it's 4-1/2 percent and going down. So, my bottom line would bethat there is some strength and that we are seeing some sectorsbeginning to come back that are taking up the decline. In housing, weare anticipating that the financial side will be a concern; of course,our banks and other major institutions are not reporting very goodresults for the fourth quarter and they are making rather substantialloan loss provisions for 1984. There is a lot of concern that 1984 isgoing to be a bit hard, primarily [because of concern] that theturnaround in energy will not occur before the operators, the servicecompanies, and so forth are going to have to [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Boykin, disagrees with the Board staff's forecast, stating that he believes the economy is possibly stronger than indicated. He also mentions concern about the possibility of inflation reaccelerating, which suggests a difference in views on the future state of the economy. Additionally, Mr. Boykin expresses concern about the housing market and the potential financial impact on banks and other institutions, which may differ from the views of others.


Passage number 168.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any evidence or indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 169.
MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, you asked for comments with regardto some of the downside risk aspects of the economy. Let me mentiontwo or three, beginning with the projections we have with regard tocommercial property development in the fixed investment sector.President Boykin mentioned the speculation in land. I want to takethat one step further into the commercial property area where the so-called syndications-- companies and others have sales of$50 million, $100 million, $200 million at a time--have bid up theprices of commercial property and brought on to submarket aftersubmarket a supply of this kind of space, which is having its effecton the existing commercial properties in those submarkets. I believethat the IRS review of so-called tax sheltered investments, if itresults in any kind of substantial change in the tax position of theseinvestors in the syndicates, particularly these privately offeredlimited partnerships, could result in a very substantial contractionof ownership of commercial property and development--the mortgagesthereon--in this country. And I think we're headed for a verysubstantial setback there.As far as housing is concerned, I have never seen in myexperience with mortgage portfolios over more years than I would liketo admit the poor quality that one sees in mortgage portfolios today--if we subject them to any kind of analysis. The builders who havegotten people into these mortgage arrangements and who now havewithdrawn their subsidies--their so-called buydown arrangements--haveleft a situation in which the value, if I may use that term, ofresidential property is no longer rising despite what we see inscattered statistics. And, therefore, the position of those-21-12/19-20/83households as far as payors are concerned is under severe pressure.So, the losses that the private mortgage insurance companies aretaking continue to go [up]; the quality of the residential mortgageportfolio has deteriorated; and there are further losses out there inthe future with regard to these situations.In terms of inventory, I had the opportunity recently, as didPresident Corrigan, to spend some time with business people--retailersin several parts of the country. I take it, Jerry, that you weretalking about manufacturers in the big companies. But the informationI got at the retail level--here I'm shifting from comments on risk tocomments regarding inflation--is that particularly because of theavailability of overseas sources for the retailers, so far they havenot faced the kind of price pressures that you indicated in othersegments of the private sector. Quite the contrary, at this stage ofthe recovery they find that they can get to sources [of supply] andthey don't have to maintain a heavy inventory and have no plans tomaintain a heavy inventory. So, once the Christmas selling season isover, they will have some bare shelves. But some of them are willingto trade off at the margin what they consider minor market sharelosses for the rigid control of their inventory. On the plus side,what I have picked up on these matters has been an emphasis onproductivity--the profitability, say, of the auto companies in theMidwest. They are looking toward break-even points at much much lowerlevels than before, in part because they have taken out of theircosts--as they express it--several billions of dollars.So, it seems to me that we have a downside risk in themortgage market and in the thrift institutions. Savings banks arestill very deeply in the red on an operating basis, despite theinteresting kinds of ways that their accountants let them "report" and"disclose" to the public. The savings and loan industry--maybe 40percent of it--is still in the red on an operating basis. To add toPresident Boehne's comments with regard to interest rates: Ifinterest rates go up 100 to 150 basis points, that would move theproportion of the thrift industry that is having operating losses tosomething like 75 or 80 percent. Housing doesn't stabilize--allgeneralizations are false including that one--it either goes up orgoes down. And my guess is that it's going to go down because of thequality of mortgage paper and because we have now used up that backlogin demand for housing that resulted from low levels of housing startspreviously. So, I think there are several downside areas in theeconomy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is expressing concerns and predicting potential negative outcomes in the economy, while others may have different perspectives or opinions on these issues.


Passage number 170.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 171.
MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Boehne detects someoptimism in his District. I would say that in our District there iseuphoric ebullience everywhere. I'm not sure that that actuallyreflects the reality of the situation but confidence levels are very,very high, not only among business people generally but among ourdirectors at both the branch level and at the head office level.Virtually every sector continues to strengthen; we're certainly in anexpansion phase of the business cycle in our part of the country andapparently in the nation as a whole. In all of our importantindustries employment and orders are up substantially. The retailershad very, very vigorous sales over the Thanksgiving holiday and thatgave rise to great optimism regarding the Christmas season. And that-22-12/19-20/83seems to be borne out by the tremendous traffic in and out of theshopping malls in all of our major cities. Interestingly, it's notjust people parking in the parking lots this year and going around andlooking; they are actually buying. My retail contacts tell me thatsales at this point are very, very good. Housing is quite good.Business lending by the major banks in our area has improvedsubstantially; consumer lending has been good for some time and that'sremaining quite healthy. There are a few trouble spots that we'vementioned before, particularly in the agricultural sector and in theexport sector. There are parts of the District that are not doing aswell as others; but even representatives of those areas are veryencouraged by the improvements that they see. The only places aboutwhich I have real concern are the rural areas where unemploymentcontinues to be very high, and I don't know that that is going toimprove very much. The great concerns among people that I talk to aretwofold: basically, interest rates and the deficit. And they gotogether.Coming to your question about what the concerns are lookingout six months, I would differ from Jim's forecast only in degree. Iwould think that growth in 1984, particularly in the first half, isgoing to be somewhat stronger than the staff forecast. And goingalong with that, I think inflation continues to be a risk that is outthere for the next 6 to 12 months, and my projection of interest ratesand of inflation would be somewhat higher than the staff's. Let mesay one other thing in terms of inflation: I think that highercorporate profits are going to be translated at some stage over thenext few months into wage pressure. Certainly some of the give-backsfrom the unions are going to decrease and there probably will be somepressure for actual increases in wages as a result of the goodperformance of corporations over the next several months. On theother side of the inflation picture, we have had relatively slowmonetary growth and the wage picture and commodity prices are not allthat bad at the moment. So, I guess those factors temper my concernsomewhat. But I come out on the bottom line feeling that we're goingto have a stronger economy in '84 than is projected by the staff andthat we're going to run the risk of higher inflation than is beingprojected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the general optimism and confidence levels in the economy and only differs in degree when it comes to growth and inflation forecasts.


Passage number 172.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as only the name "Governor Wallich" is mentioned.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 173.
MR. WALLICH. Mr. Chairman, since you asked us to addressourselves to uncertainties, I see some very critical ones in the wagearea, the dollar area, oil, and developing countries. But even thoughmost of these happen to be risks that fall on the down side, they arenot of a kind that one can guard against by leaning toward the upside. So, I think that the principal risk is really of more inflationthan we anticipate. I agree with Bob Forrestal that these profits arealmost bound to convert themselves into wage increases, particularlylater in the year--September, I think--when we get to the UAWcontract. With productivity gains diminishing quite abruptly earlythis year, capacity utilization diminishing at a surprising rate, andunemployment diminishing at a surprising and a very gratifying rate,all that points in the direction of upward pressure. Now, the otherside is what may or may not happen to the dollar. If the dollarshould go down abruptly, our exports will rise with a considerablelag. Our interest rates will rise very rapidly--not necessarilybecause the Fed does something about it but because capital imports-23-12/19-20/83can be seen in advance to be diminishing and the benefit of keepinginterest rates down will disappear--and that could produce aconsiderable downward bias [in the dollar]. The LDC situation,[though] much improved, is still with us. It is still a majoruncertainty. The oil situation I mentioned because people who watchwhat is happening in the Persian Gulf seem to think that the danger ofa closing of the straits [unintelligible] is greater than it has beenin the past. That would [result in] an increase in prices and areduction in economic activity--the same [sort of effect] as [thatfrom] the other oil shocks. That [potential] situation has a very[low] probability but very high risk if it were to occur. On balance,if you add these up, we have a number of risks on the dollar side; wecan't really guard against them by leaning in the other direction.And the danger of wage increases and price increases is one that wecan take into account and should guard against now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, believes that the principal risk is more inflation than anticipated and emphasizes the possibility of wage and price increases. However, he acknowledges that others may see the risks on the dollar side, such as a downward bias in the dollar and potential oil shocks. This indicates a difference in opinions or perspectives on the main risks and how to guard against them.


Passage number 174.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 175.
MR. KEEHN. Well, as I've reported for the last year or so,the Middle West has been very slow to join this particular party. ButI do think there has been a significant improvement over the last fewweeks or months, and at this point we really are on board. On theconsumer side, all the current reports we get for retail sales arevery, very strong, and double-digit increases are fairly common. Justwandering around stores, as I have done the last week or so, one cansee that the traffic is very, very high. Even in the industrialsector there is an improvement; most of the basic sectors in theMiddle West are doing better. They still are at comparatively lowlevels; compared to, say, 1978 or 1979, they are operating at 40 to 50percent of what they used to think was a good level. But still, thatis an improvement from what they were experiencing just a year ago.So, I think on the industrial side, there is improvement also.With regard to the risks, I think they are the same ones thathave been pointed out. Interest rates are high. I think people areamazed that we've had as good a recovery as we have had so far at thisparticular rate level. That suggests in their minds, and mine aswell, that if there were any significant increase in rates, it wouldhave the impact of shutting this [recovery] down somewhat. On theinflation side, I think there is a high level of suspicion that thestated rate of inflation somewhat understates what people think is amore practical rate of inflation. On the price side, most of thepeople I've talked with are sitting on the price button ready to go assoon as they can get increases across. The operating ratios are lowenough that they can't pull it off; but as these ratios begin to creepup, I think they are going to try to push price increases forward asfast as they can. On the wage side, most of the people I've talked tosuggest that they are still able to get 6 percent settlements by andlarge but they are having to work very hard to accomplish that. Andas has been pointed out, there is an expectation that as profits beginto improve in a very significant way, that will form a prettydifficult environment in which to continue to pull off these verytough settlements. But as I add up these risks, I still think thefundamentals are in place for a continuation of recovery. The risks,[as] we look at them, are not significant enough to have a majorimpact on what I think is going to be a pretty good 1984--not verydifferent from what the staff forecast suggests.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 176.
-24-12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It appears to be a mathematical expression related to Governor Rice, but it does not involve any opposing opinions or conflicting statements.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 177.
MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, most of what I wanted to say hasalready been said in one way or another--especially by GovernorWallich. However, my assessment of the downside risks is not quitethe same as his. I'm not quite as guarded in my outlook. It seems tome that activity is likely to continue strong over the next year,particularly in the first half of the year, and to decelerate somewhatin the second half but still expand at an acceptable rate withunemployment continuing to fall. So, I don't see business activityfalling off to unacceptable levels over the period of the next year.I'm a little more optimistic on the inflation outlook than I thinkmost people have expressed. I don't share the same worry with respectto the wage outlook. I think the wage picture is probably still oneof moderation. It's hard to see that profits are going to continue toexpand at such a rate as to weaken the resistance to higher wages andimprove really significantly the bargaining position of labor. So, Iwould expect continued moderation in wage increases. The energypicture looks pretty good and the outlook is for moderate--notrunaway--increases in food prices. So, if there are going to be anystrong inflationary pressures, it's hard for me to see where they aregoing to come from. So, I see the inflation outlook as reasonablyfavorable--pretty much as the staff has forecast. Along with thevulnerabilities listed by Governor Wallich, I would simply emphasize,as others have pointed out, that the major vulnerability is higherinterest rates than we now expect--that is, higher than in theforecast. A number of people have pointed to that, and I think thereis possibly a real danger of interest rates being substantially higherthan they are now forecast. The reasons for that, obviously, are thedeficit, the increase in private credit demands, and the falling offof capital inflows. All of these possibilities would operate towardputting upward pressure on interest rates. And if that happens, Ithink the economy will be very vulnerable and possibly in danger ofsome damage from that development. I don't, however, expect rates toincrease substantially, although I recognize that as a possibilitythat could affect the forecast, as I pointed out. On balance, I wouldsay that the probability is about 50 percent on being able to maintaincurrent levels of interest rates; and if we're able to do that, Ithink [the economy] will be in good shape.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. While Mr. Rice agrees with some points made by Governor Wallich, he states that his assessment of the downside risks is not quite the same and that he is more optimistic about the inflation outlook. He also mentions the possibility of higher interest rates, which he sees as a major vulnerability, while others may not share the same concern.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 178.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might ask Mr. Kichline to comment on thepoint Mr. Corrigan made earlier, which is the inverse of this profitspoint. Is it true that labor costs are going up much less--orhistorically very little--compared to prices at this stage. You don'thave to address it now unless you want to. We'll turn to GovernorPartee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions that Mr. Kichline and Mr. Corrigan have contrasting views on the topic of labor costs compared to prices. This suggests contention or disagreement among the individuals mentioned.


Passage number 179.
MR. PARTEE. Well, you asked for a different hypothesis onwhat is going on. A surprise this afternoon is the amount ofebullience reported in Minnesota, which I would think would be in acold deep freeze, and in Pennsylvania, which has not been a boisterousstate over the years. My only comment in response to that would bethat businessmen are inclined to look at their performance comparedwith a year ago; that still is the way that 90 percent of thebusinessmen look at their activity. We have now completed a year ofrecovery and, therefore, the November-to-November increases are aslarge as any they've seen--in fact the largest they've seen for thewhole period of the recovery. And they probably are the largest they-25-12/19-20/83are going to see anytime in the expansion; [the increases] will godown from here rather than up. So, I'm wondering whether we're notpicking up a degree of false optimism in the business community andwhether in fact it doesn't lay us open to the possibility that highexpectations will be frustrated in the months to come. I see that atleast as a possibility.Now, as I look at the projection, the greatest problem I havewith it--I've had it before--is that the saving rate is too low. Ithink it ought to be higher; I would expect it to be higher givenincome performance, given incentives to save that we have in theeconomy now, and given the general notion of maintaining some kind ofreasonable ratio of financial saving stocks to total income. The waywe would get the saving rate higher is either by having higher incomeor lower expenditures than are being forecast by the staff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 180.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Or use the Federal Reserve numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is mentioning the option of using the Federal Reserve numbers, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage itself.


Passage number 181.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I can't even understand what is involvedin that argument since we haven't been briefed on it, so I can't dothat. We could have higher income to the extent that there is moredemand in the economy outside the consumer sector, principally perhapsinventory demand. That's a possibility; we could have more inventorydemand and more income generation as a result of that and, therefore,higher savings can result from higher income than is being projected.On the other hand, we could have lower income if productivity gains inthe short run are going to be considerably stronger than the staff hasprojected, which certainly seems possible, or if the wage rateenvironment stays placid. There are a lot of indications that it ispretty placid and, therefore, it seems to me that is possible. Now,if we have a reduction in consumer spending relative to income in themonths ahead and if businessmen are expecting very good gains--gainsthat are too large for them really to anticipate getting--they will bedisappointed in the months ahead. That would provide a basis for aneven smaller rise in business activity than is being forecast by thestaff and that's consistent with the Ml numbers. Therefore, slowgrowth in Ml--to bring in the monetarists in the crowd--is consistentwith this last hypothesis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of different possibilities and hypotheses.


Passage number 182.
MR. BOEHNE. Do you believe it, Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 183.
MR. PARTEE. I don't know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 184.
MR. RICE. Isn't that what you want.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show contention or disagreement as Mr. Rice is simply asking a question about someone's desires or preferences.


Passage number 185.
MR. PARTEE. No. I think that the staff projection would bean almost ideal outcome, if we could get the staff projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MR. PARTEE indicates his agreement with the staff projection.


Passage number 186.
MR. RICE. What about 1 percent less growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement asking about a potential decrease in growth.


Passage number 187.
MR. PARTEE. I don't think so. I wouldn't want 3.3 percentrather than 4.3 percent growth for the next year. I think somethingon the order of 4 percent is fine. I would like to have maybe alittle more real growth and a little less inflation than in the staffprojection, but I think it's a very good projection. I think weprobably would find that we can't live with a number a good deal lowerthan that for very long, particularly in the environment we'll havenext year. But I think it is a very good [outcome]. If I were asked-26-12/19-20/83to state what my objective is for the economy in the next year, Iwould not be far off the staff projection. Anyway, I was trying tomake a case for a smaller rise [in business activity]. You asked forsomething far out; there is a far-out scenario.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The person speaking is expressing their agreement with the staff projection and stating that they wouldn't want a lower growth rate. They are also stating that they would like a little more real growth and less inflation, but overall they agree with the projection.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 188.
MS. TEETERS. But is your assessment of the situation thatgrowth would be lower than the staff projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is disagreement between the speaker (Ms. Teeters) and the staff projection on the assessment of the situation. Ms. Teeters believes that growth would be lower than the projection made by the staff.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 189.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, that it would be lower because a rise inthe saving rate would cut consumption, and consumption would have afeedback effect on business attitudes--considering that they're overlyoptimistic now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee suggests that a rise in the saving rate would lower consumption and have a feedback effect on business attitudes, indicating that business attitudes are overly optimistic. This contradicts the assumption or belief held by others that business attitudes are not overly optimistic.


Passage number 190.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The staff already has factored in amuch smaller rise in consumption--by $33 billion dollars, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement about the staff factoring in a smaller rise in consumption is presented as a personal opinion rather than a point of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 191.
MR. PARTEE. I know, but their saving rate continues verylow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the saving rate of a certain group is very low.


Passage number 192.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only mentions Governor Gramley, but does not provide any information or context about any disagreements or contentions involving them.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 193.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I'm on the opposite side of Chuck. Ithink there are a couple of areas in which the staff forecast islikely to be a bit low on the real side next year. One of them isbusiness fixed investment. I can't demonstrate any evidence of thisother than a gut feeling, I guess. The staff forecast is well abovewhat the surveys of intentions to spend are indicating, but thosesurveys have been practically useless in terms of the trend ofbusiness fixed investment in recent years. Given the kind ofconfidence we hear about and given cash flows, I think we're going tosee more investment next year than the staff has forecast. The secondarea is inventories. I have heard over and over again the story thatJerry Corrigan is telling us--that inventory/sales ratios are soblooming low now that delivery times are lengthening--and I thinkwe're going to see some price reaction to that early on in 1984. Thestaff forecast, incidentally, has a build-up of inventories andinventory investment to what might be called a normative relationshipwith GNP of around 1 percent of GNP. That means, in effect, however,that the inventory/sales ratio shows no improvement whatsoever; itstays at its third-quarter 1983 level, which I think is the lowestinventory/sales ratio ever in terms of GNP. My guess is that if finalsales continue to be fairly strong--and I think they are likely to be--that we're going to see some efforts to build up inventory more thanthe staff has indicated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Gramley is expressing a different opinion from Chuck and the staff forecast regarding business fixed investment and inventories. He believes that the staff forecast is too low and disagrees with the surveys of intentions to spend. He also disagrees with the staff forecast regarding inventories and believes that there will be more effort to build up inventory than indicated.


Passage number 194.
 Secondarily, I worry about--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just make sure that's correct; Ijust want to have it confirmed. You have $35 billion a quarter--ormore than that--on average. That would be no increase in theinventory/sales ratio.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of concern and a request for confirmation.


Passage number 195.
MR. KICHLINE. In 1972 dollars the inventory/sales ratio wasaround 3.03 or 3.04 and it stays flat throughout 1984. So, in realterms it is unchanged.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a fact about the inventory/sales ratio without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 196.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What am I looking at--unreal inventories.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in the passage. The statement is a simple question asking what the speaker is looking at.


Passage number 197.
MR. KICHLINE. You're looking at book [values].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the person is looking at book values.


Passage number 198.
-27-12/19-20/83MR. GRAMLEY. The other area I worry about is that the laborforce may well continue to show the kind of very slow growth we'veseen during the course of 1983. In the staff forecast, growth of thelabor force doubles in 1984 so we get less progress in reducingunemployment than I think may take place. If it turns out that we getmore real growth and a greater drop in unemployment relative to thegrowth rate, then I think the prospects are for a worsening of priceinflation as the year progresses--more than what the staff isforecasting. I don't think the risks are for huge overruns on eitherside; one percent more in real growth and maybe 1-1/2 percent or so onthe price side is the most I can see. But if we were to get that kindof situation, then by the last half of the year we would be looking ata rate of price inflation between 6 and 7 percent and we would begoing into 1985 with a much higher level of resource utilization andwith the near certainty that, unless something slows it down, the rateof inflation would worsen. And that's what I think we need to focuson.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their concern and opinion about the potential outcomes of the labor force growth and its impact on unemployment and inflation.


Passage number 199.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 200.
MS. TEETERS. Well, as I listen to the discussion around thetable, I come to the conclusion that how 1984 turns out is right smackin our laps, [given] the sensitivity of the economy to interest rates--the current levels and changes in interest rates. If they beginmoving upward and if that gets translated to the mortgage markets, wemay as well shut that one down. So, our decisions about whereinterest rates should be and their movements during the year are goingto be the crucial factor in determining whether we achieve thisforecast or not. I agree with Chuck that this forecast would be theideal outcome. And if we could achieve it, we could say that weactually were conducting monetary policy in a way that created asituation [that maximized the prospects] of a return to relativelyfull employment. But I do emphasize that I think the economy is nowso sensitive to interest rates--particularly starting from the levelthat they are--that a move of 100 basis points would completely turnaround the forecast in practically every sector. There is also builtinto the forecast a 10 percent decline in the international value ofthe dollar, which does have direct price implications for next yearalso. So, the whole combination of this, I think, turns on thedecisions that are made by the FOMC over the next three months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Teeters is expressing her agreement with Chuck's forecast and emphasizing the importance of interest rates in determining the outcome.


Passage number 201.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm out of names. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any ideas or statements that can be challenged or disagreed with. It is simply a statement of the speaker's personal situation and lack of ideas.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 202.
MR. ROBERTS. Just a very brief comment, Mr. Chairman: In myexperience with businessmen, they always extrapolate the present and[unintelligible]; for example, it causes them to underestimateinventory/sales ratios because they always assume that sales are goingto continue as [they see] them now. I'll talk tomorrow about leadeffects that we ought to be considering here. I'm not that optimisticabout the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates disagreement or contention. The speaker expresses skepticism and suggests that businessmen have a bias towards optimism when extrapolating current conditions for the future. They are not optimistic about the economy.


Passage number 203.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe you ought to tell us more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that more information should be provided.


Passage number 204.
MR. RICE. Why aren't you optimistic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rice is simply asking a question about why someone is not optimistic.


Passage number 205.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, I just wanted to introduce the idea thatthe liquidity flows through the economy, as I'm sure everybody aroundthis table knows, operate with differential lags. I've been concerned-28-12/19-20/83all year about inflation later this year and in 1985, which I think isgoing to happen. I was not concerned about the fragility of theeconomy and that is because of the flow of liquidity through theeconomy. We've had a real constraint for some time on Ml, whether youlook at it as 13 percent in the first half and 5 percent in the secondhalf, or whether you look at it as 4 or 5 months with no growth. Ithink that by the second or third quarter of next year we're going tosee some restraint in the economy, with an output effect flowingthrough on a near-term basis and then an inflation effect late nextyear. It's the worst of all possible worlds. I would anticipate thatwe will have real growth in the 3-1/2 percent area next year and thatwe still will have troublesome inflation late in the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is sharing their perspective and concerns about inflation and the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 206.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I guess we come out somewhatdifferently. The New York Fed staff's forecast is for stronger growththan in Mr. Kichline's forecast. So much of this is "iffy" that Iwon't bother going into the components and how they arrive at theirforecast; they arrive at it, incidentally, with a much higherproductivity guess. I'm particularly impressed, unfortunately, by theincreased talk I hear in the financial markets about risinginflationary expectations. And I hear a lot of it. So, from thatpoint of view, there's a fairly clear implication for some snuggingup, possibly. On the other hand, though, the thing that bothers me isthat the exchange rate is getting to be a looming menace in adifference sense. The higher it keeps going the more precipitouslyit's going to drop when expectations regarding the exchange rate turnaround. It's going to drop at a time when we're nearer capacityutilization and it will have a much bigger inflationary impact. I'mnot even talking about the developing countries burden. I think it'sa real time bomb.So, I am in a quandary as to where these conflicting analyseswould lead one. If one were looking just at the domestic scene, Ithink it would be important to affect the psychology and curb somewhatthese rising inflationary expectations. I don't think that a quarteror a half percentage point is going to bring that much of a change inhousing and the real economy that it is going to slow down themomentum that much, but I think it would have a very salutarypsychological effect. However, I don't know whether it would push theexchange rate up even further. It would be my guess that it would andI just don't know if we can afford to be that asymmetric in ourmonetary policy in regard to exchange rates. When they are fallingprecipitously, we are all willing to tighten monetary policy; whenthey are rising into the stratosphere, we're not prepared toliberalize monetary policy--for reasons I understand, of course, andwith which I sympathize to a large degree. I don't know how to cutthis dilemma. The easy way out would be to say: Let's wait a fewmore weeks until what is happening becomes clear. But Ted Robert'sscenario--even though we don't believe that it's the most likely one--certainly is still in the realm of possibility. I don't think therewould be any chance of a recession, but there could be some slackeningof growth. At the present time we think there is enough momentum thatgrowth probably will be coming in higher than the 4.3 percent; we'rethinking more in terms of 5 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker discusses different forecasts and conflicting analyses, particularly in regard to inflationary expectations and the exchange rate. They are unsure of the best course of action and express a dilemma in making a decision.


Passage number 207.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 208.
-29-12/19-20/83MR. GUFFEY. With regard to economic activity in the TenthDistrict, I think we've joined the national recovery certainly, withthe exception of two major sectors: agriculture and energy. And bothof those will take much longer to work out. The agriculturalsituation will depend largely, I think, upon some drop of the dollar--if and when that ever occurs--to encourage exports; and energyeverybody knows about. But by and large I think the view ofbusinessmen and market makers in our part of the country is noteuphoric but it is very strong as to the outlook six months or sohence. In talking to those individuals, they are almost consumed withthe federal budget deficit problem and the fact that the FederalReserve is really the only player on the field and that inflationaryexpectations are just under the surface--whether they come fromcorporations and businesses taking the opportunity to try to increasetheir prices and hopefully make them stick or from wage pressures.[The view is] that inflationary expectations could take hold and be areality, particularly in the markets, unless the Federal Reserve isvery visible.In general terms, we would expect the staff forecast to bethe best of all worlds if it could be achieved. But our bestexpectations are that growth will be somewhat faster in the first halfof the year and then slow down toward the latter part of the year.With regard to inflation, our projection would be higher than thestaff's and as a result--this may be ahead of the discussion--Iprobably would join those who say a little snugging up now would serveus well in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that their projection for inflation would be higher than the staff's, indicating a difference of opinion on the potential level of inflation.


Passage number 209.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Kichline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided.


Passage number 210.
MR. KICHLINE. On Mr. Corrigan's point, we don't have a charthere. We have all sorts of numbers but he has the chart. We do havevery clearly, though, a situation where we assume that unit laborcosts in 1983 are rising about 1 percent and our deflator forecast issomething like a 4-1/4 percent increase. So, it's a very wide spread.It shows up in corporate profits, and corporate profits in this cycle--for the first four quarters of the recovery, assuming our fourth-quarter forecast is correct--have risen more than in any other postwarcycle. They are close to the increase in 1975, but are substantiallyabove the cyclical performance for the first year of a recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Kichline about the numbers and forecasts related to unit labor costs and corporate profits.


Passage number 211.
 Twocomments with regard to that spread--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I may just interrupt you: The increasein profits is stronger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing additional information or clarification by interrupting the conversation with a comment.


Passage number 212.
MR. KICHLINE. Correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Correct" indicates agreement with the previous statement or question.


Passage number 213.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How about the relationship of profits toGNP or corporate product.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage mentions the relationship between profits and GNP or corporate product but does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply poses a question without expressing any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 214.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, it's up because the profit share andnotional margins have been rising. We think it will be at the highestlevel at the end of this year since 1977-78--a six-year high. So, ithas done very well as a share or absolutely. Two particular comments:First, going back to the staff's inflation presentation, we believethat corporations essentially price off some notion of unit labor costand a markup over that. In effect, what they're doing is looking atsome notion of trend growth in productivity; and trend growth in-30-12/19-20/83productivity, we think, is better than they may be using. So, it isshowing up here in terms of attempts to price fairly aggressively andthey're getting more profits than they might otherwise think. Mysecond point is a technical comment: In measuring the GNP deflator,as you know, import prices are subtracted out in the short run. Inthe first half of this year import prices actually declined and wereabout unchanged in the third quarter, so that for much of this year wethink that substraction process has artificially raised the GNPdeflator because the benefits of those import prices measured inconsumption, investment, or whatever, come along with a lag. So, ourstory is that this has been an unusual year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply sharing their analysis and observations.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 215.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But then the consumer price index shouldbe lower but it's not; it's higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a disagreement or contention because the expected outcome of the consumer price index being lower is contradicted by the fact that it is actually higher.


Passage number 216.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, it's higher than the deflator but thereare different weights and other things going on. Obviously, serviceprices, for example, are very important. We suspect that 1984 will bea year that returns much more to normal in the sense that our forecasthas unit labor costs and the deflator rising about the same amount, sothat the gap we're seeing now we think will evaporate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing an analysis and projection regarding unit labor costs and the deflator rising at the same amount in 1984.


Passage number 217.
MS. TEETERS. Jim, a technical question about this largeincrease in profits we are talking about and the increase in the shareand the probable effects that this could have on wage demands over thecourse of the year: If corporations end up with higher profits,doesn't that take some of the pressure off price increases also.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Ms. Teeters is simply posing a technical question and seeking clarification regarding the possible effects of increased profits on wage demands and price increases.


Passage number 218.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, if we go back to the notion that somesense of normalcy is restored, which I think is happening here--profits have been very weak for the last 3 or 4 years--and if indeedproductivity is improving, I think it all depends ultimately on thecontext of the market situation that we have. In our forecast,markets generally will not be so tight as to allow corporations topass aggressively through whatever price increases they might want.There is restraint both domestically and from the import side. So, Ithink on profits you're right. Ultimately, how it works out willdepend in part on how this economy evolves in 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges the possibility that the listener's statement about profits is correct and agrees that the outcome depends on various factors.


Passage number 219.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How are profits in the manufacturingsector alone. You can cover that tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a directive or suggestion to cover the topic of profits in the manufacturing sector on another occasion.


Passage number 220.
MR. KICHLINE. Okay, in detail.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "Okay, in detail" suggests an agreement or willingness to proceed with a detailed explanation.


Passage number 221.
MR. CORRIGAN. Well, when you consider the automobileindustry alone, it's going to make $5 billion this year. I suspectthe profits in manufacturing are up too--just as sharply, in terms ofincreases in profits, as the rest of the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presenting a fact about the automobile industry's profits without any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


Passage number 222.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They probably are up pretty sharply, but Idon't know where they are in absolute levels.Well, I think we might as well quit for the evening, ifnobody else has anything to say on this subject, and turn [tomorrow]to a preliminary discussion of the 1984 ranges. I don't find myselfas excited about this forecast and its idealized aspects as some otherpeople do here. My ideal forecast always has a declining inflationrate. Thinking back to our discussion last month, we didn't draw much-31-12/19-20/83 -32-of a conclusion. This is the time to come to a conclusion, I suppose,in terms of inflation strategies as well as other objectives of ourlong-term forecast. We'll put that on the table bright and earlytomorrow. Nine o'clock is bright and early.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their own thoughts and opinions on the subject.


Passage number 223.
[Meeting recessed]12/19-20/83December 20, 1983--Morning SessionCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can begin with a discussion of the 1984ranges. There was some discussion in the Congress about requiringranges for 1985, or two years ahead, and we might want to considerwhat we might say about 1985, at least in a qualitative way, when wepresent the 1984 ranges. Obviously, we don't have to decide this nowor even be that precise about 1984 now. But if anybody has strikinglydifferent feelings than are encompassed in the preliminary ones--or aradically different way of looking at things--this would be theappropriate time to bring it up. I think the Bluebook paragraph ortwo about this was a good discussion of the various considerationsthat have to be brought to bear. It does fit in with our inflationdiscussion last time about what we think our responsibilities are andwhat the practical possibilities are for dealing with inflation over alonger time-frame because these kinds of things are reflected in thelong-term targets. I don't know whether you have anything to add, Mr.Axilrod, to your comments in the Bluebook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting a discussion about the 1984 ranges and considering a qualitative approach to discussing the 1985 ranges. They mention that if anyone has different feelings or a different perspective, now would be the appropriate time to bring it up. Overall, the tone seems cooperative and open to different viewpoints.


Passage number 224.
MR. AXILROD. I don't have much, Mr. Chairman. I could verybriefly point out what we were trying to do there. As you mentioned,in the first instance we were trying to discuss the tentative rangesin terms of their consistency with regard to inflation objectives.Obviously, the 1984 tentative ranges are consistent with furtherprogress in reducing inflation assuming, as is clear there, that theCommittee is looking toward lower rates of inflation than the 5percent that is currently projected for 1984. And that, of course,would have particular relevance for anything the Committee might wantto say, qualitatively or not, for 1985.On some more technical points with regard to the ranges: For1984, the Ml range of 4 to 8 percent is a reduction, of course, fromthe range for the second half of 1983 and we think it implies, giventhe 9 percent nominal GNP, a velocity increase on the order of 2percent without any interest rate rise--somewhat lower than the trendfor the postwar period years, which is around 3 percent or so but ithas occurred in a period of rising short-term rates. Now, thevelocity of Ml, as everyone knows, is going to be very uncertain andprobably will be very different if there are significant interest ratemovements up or down from the levels projected. But given thisprojection of very little interest rate change, we think an Mlincrease around the middle--or more likely in the upper part--of the 4to 8 percent would be the likely outcome, consistent with theprojected nominal GNP.I ought to point out two other things: As noted in theBluebook, the [tentative 1984] M3 range was decreased to 6 to 9percent. The problem may be that it would squeeze M3 down pretty muchif a considerable part of the credit flows continue to go throughfinancial institutions. We had two reasons for thinking it would bepossible to get M3 growth at 9 percent or below. One had to do withthe continuing efforts by banks to raise funds abroad throughEurodollars and not domestically through CDs, which would tend to holddown M3 growth, particularly if foreigners put their money in dollarsabroad. With regard to M2, I would also point out that a 1/2 pointreduction in the range from 7 to 10 percent to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percentmight not be considered an effective reduction since the 7 to 10percent range included 1/2 to 1 percentage point of further shifts-33-12/19-20/83related to the money market deposit accounts. And so far as we couldjudge, the amount of shifting in that 7 to 10 percent probably was onthe order of 1/2 to 1 percent, but those estimates are always verydifficult to make. Thus, a reduction of 1/2 point to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2percent is not, in a sense, an effective reduction. Counterbalancingthat, of course, is what we observe to be a normal reduction invelocity growth of M2 in the second year of a recovery, which wouldfor any given nominal GNP require somewhat higher M2 than mightotherwise occur. I think those are all the preliminary comments Iwould have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply giving an explanation of the ranges and their implications.


Passage number 225.
MR. WALLICH. Could I ask you a question, Steve. When we setthese targets tentatively in July, I think all of the aggregates wereat the tops of their ranges. That is still the case for M2 and M3,more or less, but Ml has dropped to almost the bottom of its range.So, in effect, we've had a base drift of about 3 percentage points,haven't we. If we took this not just as a monitoring range but as atarget, and if we wanted to arrive at the same level of Ml at the endof the target period, the end of the fourth quarter of 1984, we wouldreally have to go not to 4 to 8 percent but 7 to 11 percent. I saythat not because I intend to propose this, but just to indicate howbase drift seems to change, if I'm not mistaken, what one thinks isthe right thing to do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is just making a statement and providing information about the base drift of M1. There is no conflicting opinion or argument presented.


Passage number 226.
MR. AXILROD. Yes. I have not made that calculation; I wasplanning to make it for the Committee at the February meeting when weknew the actual outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Axilrod is simply explaining that he has not yet made a calculation, but was planning to do so at a later meeting.


Passage number 227.
MR. WALLICH. But something of that kind is the case, isn'tit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 228.
MR. AXILROD. Yes. If the center of the 5 to 9 percent rangewere where you wanted to start from, I'm not sure what the rate ofgrowth would be. We can calculate it while we're waiting here, but itwould be a higher rate of growth than from where you are now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The disagreement arises in discussing the rate of growth, as the speaker expresses uncertainty about the rate that would be achieved starting from the center of the suggested range compared to the current rate of growth.


Passage number 229.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think we've been fairly consistentin ignoring those kinds of considerations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement expresses a personal belief or opinion about a consistent approach to ignoring certain considerations.


Passage number 230.
MR. PARTEE. That's been done and they did [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. The statement "That's been done and they did [unintelligible]" is not sufficient to indicate any conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 231.
MR. WALLICH. Yes, then we drifted up; we're drifting down.I think the down is money in the bank, so to speak.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wallich simply states his opinion that the downward trend refers to money in the bank.


Passage number 232.
 And we shouldn'tlet go--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but that would only be if youattributed some special importance to 7 percent or whatever it is. Ithink what we said at the time was that we would be perfectly happywith low growth if velocity were high and we'd be perfectly happy withhigh growth if velocity were low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a conditional statement and expressing their stance on the issue.


Passage number 233.
MR. WALLICH. Well, it doesn't change the calculations, doesit, because velocity may still change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich is making a statement about calculations and it does not indicate any disagreement or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 234.
 We can't expect that the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It changes the arithmetic, but I don'tthink there's any great significance to 7 percent. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is merely stating that they do not believe there is any significant meaning behind the 7 percent mentioned.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 235.
-34-12/19-20/83MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I have a lot of problems withthis, as you might surmise. It seems to me that the only range thatwe can have much confidence is going to be predictably related to a 9percent nominal GNP growth is the range for credit. I've been arguingfor a couple of years now that the changed character of M1 means thatits relationship to the nominal GNP is not predictable. And it seemsto me that I have two years of pretty good evidence on my side. Toassume, as apparently is being done here, that we will get a more orless normal return to historical Ml velocity--I hope that turns out tobe the case if that range is adopted--is an act of faith rather thanan assumption with any scientific basis. I think the ranges for M2and M3 are even worse, because the history of the last 25 years showsthat in the second year of expansion on the average M2 and M3 velocitydeclined by 2-1/2 percent. Therefore, if one wanted to have the rangewide enough to finance a 9 percent nominal GNP growth, the upper limitought to be 11-1/2 percent. I'm not persuaded that the staff has madea very strong case to the effect that M2 and M3 velocity are going tobe so much different in '84 than in the past. Also, this year beingan election year, I would hope that we could adopt targets that wewouldn't have to be changing just before the election. We abandonedthe M1 target in mid-1982 and we rebased our Ml target in mid-1983.To do it in mid-1984 might generate the implication that the FederalReserve was changing course for political reasons. So, I think it'smore important this year than in most years that we have somereasonable degree of confidence that the targets we're setting arecompatible with our nominal GNP objective. I don't think we can havethat confidence for these ranges for Ml, M2, and M3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Morris, expresses disagreement with the assumptions and ranges being proposed for M1, M2, and M3 in relation to nominal GNP growth. He states that the relationship between M1 and nominal GNP is not predictable and that there is no scientific basis for assuming a return to historical M1 velocity. He also argues that the ranges for M2 and M3 are even worse, as historical data shows a decline in velocity during the second year of an expansion. Additionally, Mr. Morris expresses concern about changing the targets just before the election, suggesting that it could be seen as a politically motivated decision.


Passage number 236.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You'd like to see them all higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage expresses a preference or desire for something, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 237.
MR. MORRIS. I don't know. I don't know where to set a rangefor Ml or what base [period] to use for it. I would rather eliminateMl as a target. As for taking the position to call it something else--say, a monitoring range--to my observation the market doesn't seemto notice the difference between a monitoring range and a target. Ithink the Ml numbers there are probably sounder than the numbers forM2 and M3. I just am not persuaded that the performance of M2 and M3is going to be that dramatically different from all previous secondyears of expansion in the last 25 years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Morris is expressing his uncertainty and lack of knowledge about setting a range for M1 or what base to use for it. He suggests eliminating M1 as a target and considers calling it a monitoring range instead. He also shares his personal opinion that the M1 numbers are probably more accurate than those for M2 and M3, but he is skeptical about the potential performance of M2 and M3 compared to previous years of expansion. There is no conflicting viewpoint or disagreement presented in this passage.


Passage number 238.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you have evidence on the second year ofexpansion for the previous 25 years, Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking Mr. Axilrod if he has evidence of the second year of expansion for the previous 25 years.


Passage number 239.
MR. AXILROD. I don't have the rates of growth at hand; Ihave the velocities at hand. They are almost impossible to analyze,of course, because of ceiling rates and all that. In the second yearof expansion velocities of M2 were negative. That is, there weredrops in velocity on the order of 3 percent after the first quarter of'61 in the second year of that expansion, 1 percent in the early '70s,and about 3-1/4 percent after the '75 trough. And 1980 is irrelevant,of course. Before the '60s, in the '50s, there were increases invelocity of about 1 percent. And those were all decelerations so tospeak from the first year; some of the decelerations turned intonegative velocity. We have assumed also a deceleration in velocity ofM2. So, it's not inconsistent with this kind of cyclical experience.But we have the velocity continuing to be positive, which I think isprobably also reasonable given the changed institutionalcircumstances. It also happens to be generally consistent with what-35-12/19-20/83we can make out of our models; both the Ml and M2 changes aregenerally consistent with our new Ml demand equation and the estimatesthat come out of our model for time and savings deposits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and analysis about the velocities and growth rates of M2 and M1, and concluding that the velocities continuing to be positive is reasonable and consistent with their models.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information given in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 241.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I want to respond to your commentthat we might want to say something qualitative about 1985. Eventhough I know that we don't want to imply an automatic quid pro quo,which would be a tighter fiscal policy and easier monetary policy, itdoes seem to me that we have an obligation to spell out the overallterms [unintelligible] of the economic profile of 1985--if we decideto go that far--and that we ought to do it by starting out withdifferent assumptions: meaningful action to reduce the budget deficitand the absence of that. It seems to me that we have an obligationnot simply to preach this but to show our best view of whatdifferences there would be in the economy, even though I know it's notclear beyond 1985.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and proposing a course of action, without explicitly disagreeing with anyone or presenting conflicting views.


Passage number 242.
MR. BALLES. Tony, could you speak up a little louder please.Some of us can't hear you down here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The request for Tony to speak up louder is a polite and neutral request, implying that the speaker simply cannot hear Tony well and would like him to speak louder for better clarity.


Passage number 243.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm sorry. I was just saying that ifthe Chairman is going to spell out qualitative views in regard to1985, we ought to describe the scenario in general terms if there ismeaningful action to reduce the budget deficit and if there is not.With regard to the monetary aggregates, it seems to me that at thevery minimum we should raise the M3 range 1/2 point to make it equalto the M2 range. I think it's a little restrictive for the samereasons that Steve has described. And it looks strange; I don't thinkit makes any sense to have it lower than the M2 range. In general,even though I'm sympathetic to what Frank says, I don't see thattactically at this point we can afford to drop everything but thecredit target. I think that would be interpreted in some quarters asbeing politically motivated. I'm [not] quite as cynical as I was afew months ago as to the markets reacting differently to a monitoringrange as against a target range for Ml. I have the sense that themarkets are being somewhat less knee-jerk in their reaction to theweekly Ml figure. So, it seems to me it would be appropriate tocontinue with our present structure of the three target ranges--forcredit, M2, and M3--and a monitoring range for Ml. That's all I haveat the moment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 244.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Horn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, as the passage only mentions "Mrs. Horn" and does not provide any context or statements that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 245.
MS. HORN. With regard to saying something about 1985, Ithink that is a good context in which to talk about our views on thereduction of total spending over a period of years. I'd at leaststart out with Frank on that, but I think nominal GNP has to bereduced over a period of some years. And if we're talking in thecontext of 1985, then I think one can distinguish it from being anannual target. And that really is our strategy: a gradual reductionof total spending in the economy. Then, from that I would go on anddiverge from Frank and say that money is important because it gets usthere and that the rate of growth of money would be gradually reducedover time in order to accomplish this total spending strategy. Inthat respect, I think what is in the Bluebook is reasonable. I wouldgo much along the line that already has been put forth, and that is-36-12/19-20/83that reducing the money supply is important over time and where wecome within the target ranges depends on what happens to velocity. Wehave some ideas about that but we don't know ahead of time. In somesense that kind of communication deals with what we need to say to themarkets, which is how we're going to react next year to surprises. Weshould be very open to saying that there are these uncertainties andthat when we get surprises this is the basic structure within which wewill look at those surprises.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing their agreement with Frank on the need for a gradual reduction of total spending in the economy and the importance of reducing the money supply over time. They also acknowledge uncertainty and the need to communicate this to the markets.


Passage number 246.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 247.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think we really have twoquestions that we have to address today. The first, of course, iswhich aggregate or aggregates we're going to emphasize. And thesecond is what the numerical ranges for those targets ought to be overthe coming year. As I suspect most of you would think, I stronglyfavor returning to Ml or increasing the emphasis on it. I'd make itthe primary target. It seems reasonable to me to suppose that, giventhe sharp increase in the velocity of Ml in the fourth quarter, theprobability is much greater that the traditional relationship betweenMl and GNP may be resuming. In addition, I think one has to judge Mlagainst the alternatives. And it seems to me that the case for M2 andM3 and almost anything else I can think of is really not as good as itis for Ml, despite the imperfections that Ml obviously has had in thepast. If the Committee does agree to increase the emphasis on Ml,then I think we ought to consider lowering the 8 percent top that wetentatively set for next year. If we approach the target from thestandpoint that the Bluebook does in paragraph 12--the paragraph Stevewas mentioning a while ago--an 8 percent growth at the top, given theprojection of nominal GNP of 9.1 percent from the fourth quarter ofthis year to the fourth quarter of next year, would imply a rise invelocity of only 1 percent. That is not a figure to which I wouldattach a very high degree of probability given the recent resumptionin velocity [growth] of Ml and also the probable absence of anyfurther major changes in the regulatory area. More fundamentally, 8percent seems to me just not really consistent for any long period oftime with our stated objective of dealing over the long run withinflationary problems. So, what I'd really like to do is to knock acouple of points off that. That's probably not going to be acceptableto this group, in which case I would argue that we ought to put thetop maybe at 7 percent, or if we want to be a little devious say 4 to8 percent but that we're just going to use the [lower] half of therange. But I don't like that [latter] approach, really.So far as M2 and M3 are concerned, I could accept keeping thepreliminary ranges where they were set in July, although as Stevepointed out a minute ago and as the Bluebook mentioned, that doesn'treally represent any reduction in the rate of growth in M2 for 1984.So, I think 6 to 9 percent would be a preferable figure and would givea stronger signal to the market of our anti-inflationary resolve.They will look at that and will be aware that if we stick to ourtentative 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range, we really haven't made anyeffort because of the way the base was set. So far as M3 isconcerned, if there are these technical reasons for raising thatrange, which seem plausible to me, then I wouldn't mind having it at6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. For 1985, clearly, the purpose ought to be tocut whatever ranges we adopt still further, in keeping with our oftenstated objective of working down the rate of growth in the aggregates-37-12/19-20/83over the long run. So far as figures are concerned, I think we haveto wait until we decide what we want for 1984 before we try to put any[specific] numbers on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Black argues for the emphasis on M1 as the primary target and suggests lowering the 8 percent growth target. He also expresses skepticism towards M2 and M3 as alternatives. However, he acknowledges that his suggestions may not be acceptable to the group.


Passage number 248.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only mentions Governor Wallich without providing any information or context about their actions or beliefs. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 249.
MR. WALLICH. As for the 1984 targets, I see no reason tochange what we did in July. As far as the Ml target is concerned, wealready have an implied reduction of 3 percent in those targetsthrough the base drift, as I said before. I see 4 to 8 percent asmeaning 6 percent on average; that implies a velocity gain of 3percent and nominal GNP of 9 percent, and that seems to me aboutright. I would like to restore Ml partly but not fully yet and Iwould like to maintain the wider range, given the uncertainty. I havenothing to say on M2, M3, and credit.As regards 1985 and the possibility of some sort ofreciprocity between fiscal and monetary policy, I think there's anelement of realism here, as Tony says. Analytically, if we raise therate of growth of money it would just lead to higher prices in thelong run. But it's also true that if the budget is tightened andmoney remains on course, the drop in interest rates is not going to besufficient to overcome the reduction in demand. So, what we ought tohave is a temporary acceleration, if one could do that, of theaggregates. I am quite skeptical of that degree of fine-tuning. AndI really would prefer, tactically and strategically, to say that ourcollaboration comes from allowing this interest rate drop to takeplace that a reduction in the budget deficit is bringing about,recognizing that there's some risk on the down side that the interestrate drop may not be enough to keep GNP on track. Looking further,[beyond] 1985, I think we should aim at ultimate price stability. Ithink we're all aware that there are high costs. It's not very likelythat we will achieve that on a steady trend. It's much more likely tohappen as a result of another recession before which there will besome acceleration of inflation that will then lead to a sharper dropin prices, hopefully to the neighborhood of stability. But we can'tplan on that, so we have to plan on some kind of downward trend in theaggregates to achieve reasonable price stability.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinions and views on monetary policy targets and the need for collaboration between fiscal and monetary policy.


Passage number 250.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage given.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 251.
MR. CORRIGAN. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would agree that in someways the key question before us now is 1985 rather than 1984. Wecould get lucky and get through 1984 in reasonably good shape, but Ithink the prospects of being able to keep the economy growing on anoninflationary--whatever that means--way in 1985 at this juncturewill be very, very [low] for all the reasons that have been mentionedbefore: the deficit, the likely build-up in business externalfinancing certainly by that time, and at least in my judgment a clearrisk that the inflation rate itself will have broken through the 5percent or higher threshold by the end of 1984. In that setting I dothink that if we were lucky, we could squeeze through 1984 withsomething that might look like the Greenbook forecast. But unlikeothers, I would not be particularly sanguine about that result. Icertainly don't consider it optimal by any stretch of the imagination;indeed, I guess I would argue that if we really want to try to insurethe continuation of a pattern of a growing economy in 1985, the bestthing we could do to produce that result might be to introduce a-38-12/19-20/83little more restraint in 1984. I'm under no illusions about theextent to which any of this can be done, or fine-tuned, but that wouldbe the direction of my thinking.More specifically, in the context of the tentative 1984targets, I am inclined to the view that the upper end of the Ml rangeis too high. As best I can understand the credit aggregate, I thinkthe upper end of that is too high as well. I don't have anyparticular views on M2 or M3, although I certainly would not beallergic to the symmetry in M2 and M3 that I think Mr. Solomonsuggested. There is another question that is laced in and out of allof these, and that's whether we want to do anything in terms of movingin the direction of suggesting through your oratory at least--perhapsa little more directly than we have in the past--that our primary,though by no means exclusive, objectives are more in the areas ofprice and financial stability. I don't know if you're game for thatright now but if we can begin to nudge ourselves in that directionwithout going overboard, I think it could serve the purpose of thisCommittee and the economy very well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses disagreement with the idea that the economy can be kept growing in an noninflationary way in 1985. They also express disagreement with the proposed targets for M1 and credit aggregates for 1984.


Passage number 252.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I'm unable to generate a response without the passage you mentioned.


Passage number 253.
MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, we did have a good discussion atthe last FOMC meeting about certain relationships and certain theoriesof inflation and inflation's forces and factors. It seems to me thatthat discussion is relevant to an outreaching for 1985 and to someextent to our considerations for 1984. There is some validity to thenotion that by 1985 the changes in Ml [will be behind us], howeveruncertain its velocity and however difficult it is to anticipate theresults of contemporaneous reserve requirement accounting, and thatwhat we do in the balance of this year and in 1984 will have a bearingon the conditions and activity in 1985. I would, therefore, notforget Ml regardless of the uncertainties that I mentioned, but Ibelieve they are such that we should not yet move Ml up in importancein the exposition of our policies and how we are going about[implementing] them. It seems to me that the market is focusingsomewhat more on free reserves and on borrowing levels than previouslyand that the almost obsession with Ml has diminished somewhat; I thinkthat's probably salutary. Perhaps that means the market has a betterunderstanding of what we're really trying to do. So, I wouldn'tforget Ml; I would keep it among the targets, certainly, but I believethe uncertainties are such that we need a wide range for 1984 and,therefore, the 4 to 8 percent is acceptable.With regard to your question on 1985, I would join those whosupport your presentation of perhaps a bit stronger language regardingour reluctance to fund total expenditures, a part of which is the 40percent that is [spending by] the federal government. But I'd like topick up those additional tens of billions that are off-budgetfinancing and look at the situation as one in which the financing ismuch more than 40 percent and getting up to the 50 percent or betterlevel. So, I would caution that our 1985 targeting of the aggregatesand our policies, framed in view of Ml changes and credit changes, arenot likely to be such as to fund the levels of spending that privatedemand and public demand unreined would imply. It seems to me that weare in a position of increasing that warning. I would also supportsome language indicating that, when we know what the actual growth in-39-12/19-20/83the aggregates was in 1984, our policy would most likely be to reducethe targets for 1985 from the actuals of 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's opinions and beliefs about inflation, monetary policy, and the market's understanding of the Federal Reserve's actions. There is no disagreement or argument being presented.


Passage number 254.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do you mean lock ourselves in on thatone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question seeking clarification or confirmation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 255.
MR. MARTIN. I would have language indicating that, given thetotal spending that seems likely to occur in the absence of remedialaction on fiscal policy, we would find it difficult in the publicinterest to fund all of that spending and that our targets would mostlikely take the form of [lower figures than the actuals in 1984]. Iwouldn't use any numbers, Tony. How do we know what the actual 1984performance is going to be. I was reviewing last year's Bluebook--nooffense intended--and I don't know how in the world we can set numbersfor 1985 when the 1984 actual is likely to be way off the expected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Martin, disagrees with using specific numbers for targeting spending in 1985 because he believes that the 1984 actual numbers are likely to be significantly different from the expected numbers.


Passage number 256.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unable to determine without the passage.


Passage number 257.
MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I too think that 1985 is goingto be a critical period, and I think it is important that we give themarkets some qualitative description of our intentions for 1985. Thatmeans that 1984 targeting is going to be all the more importantbecause of the carryover from that year into 1985. But I hope, as Ithink Governor Martin was just saying, that we will resist anyCongressional or other pressures to quantify the targets for 1985.Our strategy for both years should be, as has been stated before, anobjective of having a steady and gradual reduction of the rate ofmoney growth over time. The long-term plan, it seems to me, is tokeep inflation in check and to achieve price stability in the longrun, and that objective is equally applicable to 1985 as to 1984.With respect to the 1984 targets themselves, I guess it depends onwhether we look at the rate of growth in money that we have had from1982 until recently or whether we look at business expansion. Eitherway, as I said yesterday, I believe the rate of growth in the economyis going to be stronger than many people think and, therefore, thedanger of recession in the latter part of '84 is perhaps not as strongin my mind as in others. I also remember the discussion of inflationat the last meeting, and I'm concerned about that. The other thingthat I would say in a general sense is that I believe the markets aregoing to be looking at what we do for both years--certainly for '84--and our credibility is going to be very much looked at over the nextseveral months as we announce these targets for '84.Specifically, on the numbers themselves, I would agree thatM1 should be elevated to a more prominent position in our thinking. Idon't get very hung up on whether it's a monitoring range or a targetbut I think we ought to look at it more carefully than we have. Iwould drop that top number, as others have said; 7-1/2 percent seemsto be an appropriate number. The other two aggregate ranges seem okayto me. And I agree with Mr. Solomon that having some symmetry betweenM2 and M3 makes some sense, so I would agree with the tentative '84numbers [for the M2 range] in the Bluebook--6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent--but I'd use the same numbers for M3. But, again, I would move thattop of the M1 range down from 8 percent to something in the 7 to 7-1/2percent area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Forrestal, expresses agreement with the strategy of steady and gradual reduction of the rate of money growth, and suggests specific ranges for the different aggregates.


Passage number 258.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 259.
-40-12/19-20/83MS. TEETERS. Well, I agree with [Governor Martin]. Let metake the 1985 issue. First of all, I really don't think we canforecast. As I look back over the past 5 years, we've missed turningpoints and almost everything that has happened--well, not everythingthat has happened because I think that we have to forecast and thestaff has done a good job. But to lock ourselves into something thatis as far off as two years, with all the variety that can go on, Ithink is a mistake. This year we have changed targets and we'veaccommodated to changes in the economy as they have occurred, aschanges in the various aggregates have come along, and as our forecasthas changed. I must say that from my point of view the marketsresponded [well] to what was a very reasonable shift in policy. We'vekept them informed about what we were doing. And rigidly settingtargets, particularly out two years, when we have a changing economydoesn't make much sense to me at all. If you remember the exercisesof 4 or 5 years ago when we ran the econometric model [to evaluate]probabilities, we found that we are pretty good at forecasting thenext quarter or the next two quarters. We begin to lose that andbecome less certain three quarters out and even more uncertain fourquarters out; and by the time we get to a year-and-a-half or two yearsout, the econometric models give us almost random numbers. We mightas well do what the Administration does for their 5-year projections,which is to take an annual rate of growth, just string it out, and putin a hopeful inflation number, because those forecasts for 2, 3, 4,and 5 years out don't have any reality to them. So, to lock ourselvesin now to something for 1985 doesn't make any sense. I think we cantalk about it. We can talk a great deal about the fiscal policyproblem and what that implies for monetary policy, but I don't thinkwe have to lock ourselves in.As for the 1984 targets, [many of] you seem to assume thatwe're going to be all right in 1984. I think there are a lot ofhazards out there. We still don't know what Ml is doing. I think weneed a wide range on it; I'm not terribly satisfied with 4 to 8percent, but I certainly wouldn't lower it and I wouldn't narrow it.As for M3, that aggregate always grows at a rate close to 9-1/2percent, so it is ridiculous to try to do something else with it. Itseems to me that we might as well face the reality and put thosenumbers up to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent and know that it's going to be atthe top of the range and may be a bit over it. I think we havetroubles ahead. I hope that they will be met with as much flexibilityand as much openness as we've done this past year. I would stay withthese targets but raise the M3 numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 260.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 261.
MR. GRAMLEY. I would join with those who see trouble ahead,but I don't think 1985 is going to be the critical year; I think 1984is. If we were to get through 1984 with an outcome on the price sideno worse than what the staff is forecasting, then we would be inreasonably good shape going into 1985. But, as I said yesterday, Ithink the risks are all on the up side. I think we're probably goingto see somewhat stronger growth and more pickup in the inflation rate.And if we let that genie get out of the bottle in 1984, it is going tobe awfully hard to put the cork back on in 1985. I can live withthese targets or I could live with a somewhat lower range for both Mland M2. But I want to remind the Committee how far these are from thekinds of ranges one would have to adopt ultimately if one were going-41-12/19-20/83to get price stability. If, for example, we interpret price stabilityas being something like 1 to 2 percent--the rate of increase we saw inthe early 1960s--that allows 2-1/2 to 3 percent for potential growthof real GNP. Hack off 1-1/2 percent for a trend increase in velocitynot related to interest rates and we are talking about 2-1/2 to 3-1/2percent for growth of Ml and maybe 1 percentage point more or so forgrowth of M2. So, we're a long, long way from where we're going tohave to be if we're really serious about getting the inflation ratedown. And if we're not serious about getting the inflation rate down,we ought to decide that and adopt a course of policy in accordancewith that view--for next year, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 262.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you serious.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question seeking clarification.


Passage number 263.
MR. GRAMLEY. Over the long run, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley is simply stating that over the long run, something is true.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 264.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is no passage provided to analyze contention or disagreement.


Passage number 265.
MR. GRAMLEY. Oh no, not for 1984. I think we have to bepragmatic. We have an inherited inflation rate so what we have tostrive for is to do no worse than see a tiny bit of acceleration ofinflation along the lines the staff is forecasting, and then see if wecan do a little better in 1985. But if we let inflation getconsiderably worse in 1984, then in 1985 it's going to get worsestill.For reasons I talked about yesterday, I think that M2 oughtto be our principal target. The relationship between Ml and GNP maytend to reestablish itself on a more stable basis than we've seenrecently, but I'd like to wait for that to happen. As far as targetsfor '85 are concerned, I would not be inclined to put out any numbers.I would like to see us make qualitative statements to the effect thatwe will attempt over time to bring down the rate of growth of moneyfor reasons having to do with bringing down the rate of inflation, notas an end product in itself. But I think we ought to put out somewarnings that we're serious about this business. And if we're not, weought to tell the public that also.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, is expressing his own views and strategies regarding inflation and monetary policy targets. There are no conflicting perspectives presented in the passage.

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What would you expect to happen inthe real economy in '85 if we made a significant cut in the moneytarget for '85 and the Congress had not or was not taking any actionon the fiscal side. I'm not necessarily disagreeing with you. It'snot a provocative question; I'm just asking what your honest guess is.Would we have a recession in '85.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for an honest guess about the potential outcome in the real economy if a significant cut in the money target for '85 occurs and Congress does not take any action on the fiscal side.


Passage number 267.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I have never believed that one can findmacroeconomic reasons for thinking that fiscal stimulus and monetaryrestraint are enough to push the economy into recession. Fiscalstimulus unleashes economic expansion; monetary restraint holds itback. And it's the balance between the two that determines whether ornot the economy grows and whether we have more inflation or less. Ithink the main problems are on the micro side. They have to do withthe damage high real interest rates create in the international area,to the thrifts, to the rate of business investment, and that sort ofthing. I wouldn't be inclined necessarily to say that a continuationof current fiscal policy--that is, the current services projection ofthe growing deficit--together with more monetary restraint would push-42-12/19-20/83us off the cliff into recession. It sure as heck would create a lotdamage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their belief that fiscal stimulus leads to economic expansion, while monetary restraint holds it back. They also mention that the balance between the two determines economic growth and inflation. The speaker then acknowledges potential problems on the micro side but does not challenge their initial statements.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide an answer without the full passage or context. Can you please provide more information?


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 269.
MR. BOEHNE. Well, I think we are having a lot of discussionabout a world that we would like to see rather than the world thatwe're actually in. The idea of gradual reductions in money [growth]over time that will bring down inflation neatly and avoid recession isa world we wish we were in. In reality we bring inflation downthrough recessions. That's where progress has come in the past and Isuspect that's where it will come in the future. If we're talkingabout further reductions in inflation over the next several years,then I think we're talking about a recession. It's not that we likerecession, but it seems to me that the two go hand in hand. Havingsaid that, I think we still have to be somewhat idealistic and put outthe message of lower growth in the aggregates, but I don't think wereally ought to kid ourselves. As far as the strategy in 1984 isconcerned, I think we ought to continue to look at a number ofvariables and be cautious of any particular one. I think Ml is stilllargely unpredictable and has an unpredictable link with GNP. Somecase can be made that it may not be as unpredictable as it was in1983, but I don't see any evidence that would [warrant] elevating itto the premier status it once had. I think there is some case forgiving it somewhat more equal status but I would prefer to keep it ina monitoring status, largely for tactical reasons. There has beensome weaning of the market from this variable. I don't think it's asmuch of a shrine as it once was and that is helpful in this judgmentalworld that we have for monetary policy. So, I would keep M2 and M3 asthe targets and M1 as a monitoring range.As far as the specific numbers, I don't have a real quarrelwith the specifications that we set in July, although I think Nancy isquite right that M3 grows at 9-1/2 percent whether we like it or notand we simply ought to realize that and at least have 9-1/2 percent bewithin the range. As far as Ml goes, I think a real issue is how muchM1 is like the old M2. To the extent that it is more like the old M2,then I think higher growth rates are more acceptable, so that a rangeof 4 to 8 percent does not disturb me. I think we do have an M1 todaythat looks more like the old M2 with its implications for velocity.Now, I like the idea that has been put forth by several people for1985--that we ought not talk about just one kind of outlook--because Idon't think a [forecast] for 1985 by this group or any other group isworth very much. I think it would be a very good vehicle forunderscoring the importance of doing something about the deficit ornot doing something about the deficit and I would take that as itsmain objective. To have at least a couple of outcomes--one in whichwe get some help from the fiscal side and one in which we don't--Ithink could serve a positive purpose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker is expressing disagreement with the idea of gradual reductions in money growth to bring down inflation. They argue that in reality, inflation is brought down through recessions. They also express disagreement with the idea of elevating M1 to a premier status and prefer to keep it in a monitoring range. Furthermore, they disagree with the notion of setting specific numbers for monetary targets and suggest considering different outlooks for 1985 instead.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. A single word or name does not provide enough context to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 271.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, Mr. Chairman, with respect to 1985 or anylonger-term period, I would be very cautious about expressing specificmathematical ranges unless we were required to do that by theCongress. I would rather see us have a qualitative objective, whichis to reduce inflation steadily until we've eliminated it eventuallyover whatever period that might encompass.-43-12/19-20/83As for 1984, I think the 4 to 8 percent range, in view ofwhat is developing on Ml, is probably too wide. I would be inclinedto say 4 to 7 percent, except that for whatever reasons our directedgrowth of Ml has tended to be to the lower end of the range ratherthan otherwise. So, because of that tendency, I would be inclined tosay 5 to 8 percent, raising the bottom figure. My reason is that I'mconcerned about the recent slowdown that we've had in Ml, as I saidyesterday, whether measured as 13 percent in the first half and 5percent in the second half or measured as 4 to 5 months, essentially,of no growth. In terms of the leads here, I think we have a probableslowdown in the economy in the second and third quarters already builtin; and because of the surge in money late last year and earlier thisyear, I think we have an increase in inflation built in late next yearor early in 1985. And I don't want us to be like the businessmen Irefer to who extrapolate the present and fight the ebullience of theeconomy right now. I would rather see us get Ml growing again at amoderate pace. Alternative B, which essentially suggests about a 6percent [MI growth] pattern, is acceptable to me; it may be slightlyon the high side, but I think unless we get that going we will have acost in terms of real output in 1984 and we should not be sanguineabout 1984. I would like to see us accept the fact that theaberration in velocity caused by a recession, lower inflation, andlower interest rates on these new deposit accounts may now be ending.We see a sharp rise in velocity here in the fourth quarter. I thinkwe should get onto a trend line assumption of velocity, since itclearly can't be predicted in the short run, and build our moneygrowth rates around that. If you accept that as on the order of 3percent, then the 6 percent accommodates the 9 percent nominal GNP.So, I would like to see us remove Ml from the so-called monitoringrange [status] since it really is the one variable that we can controlmost directly. I'd place it at least equal with the other aggregatesand preferably give it primary status. More importantly, I'd like tosee us do something to get it growing again. We have a forecast of 8percent in December but we've had forecasts of increases for monthafter month that haven't materialized. I note that we have beendecreasing reserves in November and December and it seems to me that'san expected result of that type of policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion and perspective on inflation and monetary policy.


Passage number 272.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 273.
MR. KEEHN. I can't remember the exact words we used when weannounced the preliminary targets for 1984 but I have a hunch that thewords we used suggested that the reduction in the ranges wasconsistent with our long-term program to reduce the level of priceinflation, and at this point I really don't see that we have a basisfor changing them [again]. To make a significant downward reductionin the ranges would imply a higher level of restraint than we wouldwant to have in mind. To increase them by any magnitude wouldindicate a very fundamental shift in policy, which I think would be abig mistake. So, I would be inclined to go with the ranges as we haveannounced them. For the reasons that Steve has suggested and thatGovernor Teeters has suggested, I would be inclined perhaps to reversethe ranges for M2 and M3. But I would at this point place a muchhigher reliance on Ml. I think we should put more emphasis on Ml andthat particularly relates to the conversation we had with regard toCRR yesterday. In light of the timing involved, we are getting to apoint where CRR is going to come into place pretty rapidly, and-44-12/19-20/83perhaps we should begin to [increase the focus on Ml] as soon as todaywhen we talk about the intermeeting targets.Regarding 1985, I think it's far too early to be specificabout what we would suggest by way of ranges for the year but I thinkwe want to continue to emphasize the long-range program we have inmind. I certainly wouldn't give Congress any reason not to deal withthe fiscal problem and I would not in any way suggest that if theydon't deal with it, we will have to back off on our objective for1985. I would say that we have every intention of continuing theprogram and that we will continue to reduce the ranges, but I wouldn'tbe specific with regard to amounts this far in advance of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing his own thoughts and opinions about the targets and ranges, without any conflicting views being presented.


Passage number 274.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 275.
MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I join those who wouldnot want to make quantitative announcements as to 1985. But I alsowould like to see us maybe quantify the time that we're lookingforward to moving toward price stability; I'm talking about a 5- or 6-year program with a gradual reduction over that period of time, yetaccommodating what may be happening in the real economy. It seems tome that we have since 1971 or 1972 continued to say that we are movingtoward price stability by reducing the money supply gradually overtime. But there has never been a program set forth by this group thatI know of in which people could look and find a result at the end orlight at the end of the tunnel. If we were talking in terms of arather specific program in the sense of an horizon over which to reachprice stability--whatever that may be, whether it's 1 or 2 percent orzero--then it seems to me that we could work into that kind of publicdiscussion what the likely outcome would be if nothing is done aboutthe budget deficit. At this point to quantify targets for moneygrowth for 1985 seems to me to be far in advance of anything we couldpredict. But in a longer-term picture it's [quite] reasonable toassume that there will be less money growth in '85 than '84 by someamount.With regard to the 1984 ranges proposed in the Bluebook thatwere set tentatively in July, I have no problem with the Ml range of 4to 8 percent. As a matter of fact, I take a little comfort from that4 percentage point spread in the range. As for M2 and M3, I wouldprobably opt to drop M2 to the same range of 6 to 9 percent [shown forM3] in the Bluebook. My reason for that, as has been stated aroundthe table before, is that it is inconsistent to have an M2 rangethat's greater than the M3 range. And it's very difficult to explainthat M3 is lower than M2 simply because we hope to fund some of thecredit needs through Eurodollars, which also implies a continuingstrength in the dollar and assumes further that European countries andother developed nations would continue to be operating at a very lowrate of economic growth. That is a picture that I think we can avoid,whether it be true or not, simply by making the M2 and M3 rangesconsistent with each other. And I would opt to have them at 6 to 9percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, disagrees with the proposed ranges for M2 and M3. He argues that it is inconsistent to have an M2 range that is greater than the M3 range and suggests that they should be made consistent with each other. Therefore, there is contention in this passage.


Passage number 276.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage "Governor Partee" does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 277.
MR. PARTEE. I'm fairly optimistic. As I said yesterday, Ithink 1984 will be okay as a year. I don't really think that it'sgoing to be as vigorous as Lyle, for example, has suggested.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Partee expresses his optimistic view about the year 1984. He mentions that he does not think it will be as vigorous as Lyle has suggested. While there is a difference in perspective between Mr. Partee and Lyle, there is no active contention or disagreement presented in the passage.


Passage number 278.
 I also-45-12/19-20/83don't think it's going to be as weak as I suggested it could beyesterday--MR. MARTIN. Christmas is over already.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating two separate thoughts or opinions without any disagreement or contention. The first part expresses a change of opinion regarding the strength of something, while the second part acknowledges that Christmas has already passed.


Passage number 279.
MR. PARTEE. --in the particular configuration that I wasworking out. I'm not greatly concerned about 9 percent as a nominalGNP number fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. I think it's one we cankey on. So far as I can see, the figures that the staff has given usare pretty consistent with about a 9 percent GNP number. So, I thinkthe target growth rates as specified for 1984 are in the ballpark.But we ought to do this in terms of what we think would produce orwould be consistent with about a 9 percent GNP growth.Regardless of what happens next year, though, I really dothink 1985 is going to be more of a problem. It will be the thirdyear of a recovery--if the recovery lasts all year. And that's arecovery that is getting pretty old; it's getting to the time when theinflationary pressures get greater. It certainly is going to be atime when pressures in credit markets ought to grow because of theincreasing private demand. And I would agree with Lyle that the roleof the deficit in that really is to affect credit market conditionsmore than it is to affect the economy as a whole, which has pluses andminuses from fiscal policy but may in the short run at least be aboutoffsetting. So, if we see the year of 1985 developing as one in whichwe may have credit-crunch type conditions--and that is generally nowbeing forecast in the market--do we want to say that we're going toreduce our growth rates for the aggregates because we have someconcept of a long-run non-inflationary environment, and thus ensurethat there will be a credit crunch in 1985. I doubt that we want tosay that. So, I would avoid a specific number for 1985 for thatreason, because we do want to give as much encouragement as possibleto the hope that there might be some fiscal action before 1985 isover. Again, it seems extremely unlikely that there will be any bigfiscal move taking effect in the first part of '85; it might takeeffect in the spring or the summer of '85. When we don't know whatthe timing would be, even if there is any fiscal policy action--exceptthat it seems unlikely that it would be at the very beginning of theyear--that makes it extremely difficult to state any kind of policytradeoff. So, I wouldn't specify anything for '85.I think Ml has done quite a lot better than some peoplearound the table give it credit for. But in this period it'scertainly true that it doesn't look [consistent with] the GNP number,but that's because it doesn't have the stability characteristics thatM2 or M3 or total credit have and that make them glide along at a morenormative number that isn't too far, usually, from the GNP number.But I think that the performance of Ml has not been that bad and hasbeen more indicative of what is going to happen in the economy thananything that M2 has shown over the last couple of years. I was goingto say, Nancy, that M2 is 9 percent every year, good or bad, but youalready said M3 is 9-1/2 percent regardless. So, I can't say thatexcept that it seems to me also true. M2, by the way, I thinkshouldn't show the decline in velocity characteristic of earlierperiods when we've had disintermediation because, after all, 80 to 90percent of the total is now interest sensitive. And I think the[depository] institutions will be very competitive in the rates theyoffer as credit demands increase. They certainly will try to keep the-46-12/19-20/83flows coming in and, therefore, I think we could expect that M2 willshow even more stability than it has shown in the past as theinstitutions operate on M2 as they have operated on M3 in the past--and that is to be a source of funding. So, I would give more statusto Ml. I would adopt the staff's proposals, which I guess are prettymuch the same as we had set in a preliminary way last July. And Iwould be quiet about specific numbers for 1985.One other point: I want to agree with Ed Boehne in that Idon't think we can expect to make progress every year on the rate ofinflation anyhow. I think we have to look at it as a full cycleprocess. And if we can keep the inflation rate from accelerating muchbeyond 5 percent, or certainly keep it from accelerating beyond 6percent in the course of this cycle, then we can go down to zero inthe next recession. And we'll have a much better posture for having amuch less inflationary cycle the next time around. But I don't thinkit's reasonable to say we have a 4-1/2 percent inflation forecast fornext year and in 1985 we'll bring it down to 4 percent and in 1986 to3-1/2 percent and in 1987 to 3 percent. We just can't do that. Thedynamics of the economy won't permit it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It is primarily a statement of the speaker's opinions and thoughts on various topics.


Passage number 280.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 281.
MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, I think the concept of pricestability should be the overriding objective. And having said that, Ithink whatever words we use for 1985 obviously should reflect that. Ialso would not want to use specific numbers. But it does seem to methat the targeting for 1984 comes at a very critical juncture,certainly in terms of credibility. We have said that we will bringinflation down through a gradual reduction in the growth rate ofmoney. In order to solidify that position and make it believable, Iwould be inclined to bring the Ml range down more in line with whatBob Black was suggesting, possibly to 3 to 7 percent. I think thatwould be a very clear signal that we do remain committed. I happen tobe willing to put more emphasis on Ml, and I think it is morebelievable, and thus that it would be positive to do that. I thinkthat [range] would also be consistent with enough [Ml growth] for the9 percent nominal GNP growth. On the M2 range, I would be inclined toshade it down to 6 to 9 percent since the 6-1/2 and 9-1/2 percentdoesn't represent any real reduction. And on M3, I would probably goback to the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent because its growth just always is9-1/2 percent. It seems to me that would give a better picture. ButI would argue very strongly for shading down the Ml target for 1984.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Boykin, is presenting his own opinions and suggestions for the targets of M1, M2, and M3 growth rates for 1984. He is suggesting different ranges and emphasizing the need for price stability. Other members of the discussion may have different perspectives and ideas, leading to potential disagreement or debate.


Passage number 282.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given phrase "Governor Rice" does not provide enough information to determine if there is any contention or disagreement present. It simply mentions the existence of a governor named Rice without indicating any conflicting or opposing views.


Passage number 283.
MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I agree with almost everythingGovernor Teeters said. I'm just not able to look much beyond 1984and, therefore, I'm unable to say anything specific about 1985. Iwould just like to be able to say in general terms that we hope thatthings develop in 1984 in such a way that we can continue to move inthe direction of price stability in 1985.As for 1984, I think that our tentative target ranges arerealistic--that is, they are consistent with the staff forecast andwith what I expect to happen, with the exception mentioned by Nancythat the M3 range could and should be raised in order to avoid thepossibility of squeezing. So, with the exception of that minor change-47-12/19-20/83of raising the M3 range by 1/2 percentage point, I think these rangesare good, satisfactory, and realistic. I think we should reiterate invery strong terms our commitment to long-run price stability. And Ithink it's important that we demonstrate that commitment by thetargets that we select, which we've done in this case. We've reducedthe ranges for 2 out of 3 and if we can continue to do that, theinflationary expectations will be affected in a manner that would bepositive from my point of view. So, I'm satisfied with the targetranges presented except for M3. And incidentally, I'm also encouragedby the recent behavior of M1 velocity. But I'm not yet ready toresurrect M1 to full target status. I would like to watch it for awhile longer. Perhaps in July we might consider that restoration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with Governor Teeters and expresses satisfaction with the target ranges presented, with the exception of the M3 range. The speaker also mentions being encouraged by the recent behavior of M1 velocity but is not yet ready to restore M1 to full target status.


Passage number 284.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 285.
MR. BALLES. Sometimes, Mr. Chairman, it helps to get outsideof one's own group and kick around these kinds of problems with a fewknowledgeable outsiders, which we did at our Bank earlier this monthat a conference on monetary targeting and velocity. That was held inview of the major, unprecedented decline in velocity in '82. I'm justgoing to give a few highlights that I think may be of interest to thisgroup. A number of people who are in the room were at that conferenceor participated in it, including Steve, who was our lead-off speaker,and Frank, who chaired the panel. I made some remarks and we had someprofessors making remarks and so forth. One of the things that Ifound particularly interesting about that meeting was a comment by anofficial of the Bank of Japan who looked at what was happening inmonetary targeting across a number of countries in different parts ofthe world. Very briefly, he concluded that in those countries whereregulations--especially on deposit interest rates--have been binding,the financial innovations [aimed at] getting around those regulationshad a really major distorting effect on the various monetaryaggregates used in those countries. On the other hand, he set forth aclass of countries that had deregulated in the face of risinginflation and interest rates and found that there had been much lessdistortion in the monetary aggregates in those countries. I foundthat cross-country analysis really quite interesting because it seemedto me to be consistent with the U.S. experience. In particular, inour own country we look back at 1974 and 1975 when there was a greatdeal of financial innovation, if you remember, [to get] around theregulatory ceilings on interest rates. Ml was badly distorted. Thereis no doubt that that was about the time that I became a proponent ofM2, but of the M2 of that day. But in this more recent period of 1982and 1983 when, as you know, we had considerable deregulation and itwas proceeding quite rapidly, it's our view in San Francisco at leastthat Ml was quite little distorted on balance. The big distortions,to our surprise in a way because we expected the opposite, came in M2and in M3.Another thing, as far as I'm concerned, that came out of thatconference was something of a compromise point of view, I guess, onwhat did happen to Ml during that period in 1982 when its velocity wasdropping by an unprecedented amount. When everything is said and donethere really have been two basic explanations here and among theacademics as to what was going on. Perhaps this is a bitoversimplified, but one explanation is that it was a business cyclephenomenon--the build-up of precautionary balances and that sortthing, which in turn caused velocity to decline. The alternative-48-12/19-20/83view, which we lean toward in San Francisco, is that the big drop invelocity was a direct response to the major decline in the rate ofinflation and hence the major decline that occurred in market interestrates in the latter half of 1982--that that in effect caused theopportunity cost of holding money to drop sharply and led to not ashift in the demand for money but an increase along a given demandfunction in the amount of money that people wanted to hold in relationto income. Well, whichever one of those explanations might eventuallywin men's minds or whichever of those explanations is true, the realpoint, as I thought about the conference and its aftermath, is thatthe phenomena to which they were referring are over. That is, therecession is over; we're coming out of it. We don't expect anotherbig drop in inflation and interest rates, as much as I would like tosee that--something that could cause velocity to drop. I don't see adecrease in the amount of money demanded on the horizon either. Butthat reinforces my belief that we're well on the way toward [returningto] the more normal behavior of Ml that we had historically.In view of that background, I come out bottom line in muchthe same way that Messrs. Black, Roberts, Keehn, and Partee have here.I would restore Ml to more importance, perhaps even primaryimportance. I have to say that I'm getting a little nervous about ourcredibility being undermined in the academic community and amongserious students of money and monetary policy by our continuingofficially to set M2 and M3 targets because they know as well as we dowhat some have already mentioned around the table here: that M2 andM3 go on like Old Man River at about the same rates of growth almostirrespective of whether the economy is in a strong upswing or whetherit is in fact in the middle of a recession. I'm not against havingsome extra targets we're almost bound to hit. The best thing I cansay about M2 and M3 in terms of keeping them as targets is thatthey're almost impossible to miss. I guess that's not without somemerit compared to a target that jumps around. But, frankly, Iwouldn't give very much weight to them. I think the more we continueto do so the more we're going to undermine our credibility out therewhere it counts, or at least in some areas where it counts.Specifically, I would go in the direction that was implied inthe Bluebook that perhaps it's time to reduce the spread of the M1range from the 4 points that we now have. You all recall that manyyears ago a spread of 2 points was par for the course. I don't thinkwe need to jump down that far that fast, but I would urgeconsideration of reducing that spread to 3 points. At this time Idon't believe we're trying to make final decisions, Mr. Chairman, butcertainly I would not at this moment want to see that 3-point spreadcentered any higher than 6 percent and might even favor aiming at a 5percent midpoint. If we're going to have a 6 percent midpoint, whichis about the most I would go for, we could consider a range of 4-1/2to 7-1/2 percent, if we were willing to adopt only a 3-point rangerather than a 4-point range. It's not without precedent that we haveranges that have a fraction of a half. We did that just a couple ofyears back, so that wouldn't be a particularly troublesome innovation.In terms of M2 and M3, I guess I really don't care. I could take whatis in the Bluebook or some of the modifications that [have beensuggested] here because I don't think they mean much. They don'tindicate what is going to happen in the economy; we have very littlecontrol over them. So, for all the reasons that I've talked abouttoday and that others have talked about, and in light of the paper I-49-12/19-20/83circulated to you a couple of months back, I think the time has cometo restore M1 to at least equal weight, if not more.

No. I don't know of any this large.But there certainly are lags; these things don't correspond exactly.And it's really the reversal in direction that is usually most pickedup by the markets when they are looking at some [unintelligible]. In1978 when the dollar was sinking one reason we felt that we couldprobably undertake a major intervention that would stick--and we didit in November '78--was because the current account deficit was nolonger increasing and indeed was beginning to shrink in response tothe more competitive dollar that we had in the year-and-a-half beforethat. So, I don't know of any such situation; in fact, there's noquestion about it. These numbers are so huge now that there's nothingcomparable. The largest current account deficit that we ran in the-50-12/19-20/83late '70s was in the neighborhood of $15 billion. We're looking nextyear at a deficit of probably $80 billion. And there is no otherindustrialized country that has run a deficit of more than $15 to $18billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states factual information about the size of current account deficits and does not involve any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 302.
MR. BOEHNE. It's as if we're skating on a frozen lake and wejust keep skating and we know we're going to get to the point wherethe ice isn't very thick out there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is using a metaphor to describe a situation but does not express any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 303.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think it's a sustainablesituation in the long run. One can make an argument that it's not atime bomb--that when the dollar comes off it will come off graduallyand moderately. I don't believe that. I believe that the longer itgoes up and stays up, the faster it will come down when expectationschange. What I don't have any feeling for is the comment that Ifrequently hear--and I think Henry said this--that when the inflow ofdollars stops because of the change in expectations about the exchangerate, that is going to have a very major upward effect on our interestrates. I'm not sure that that's so. I don't know what the interestrate effect of that will be because it is sometimes argued that thebanks can bring enough back in the Eurodollar market that we wouldn'tget that much of a movement in interest rates. I don't know whetherPaul has a view on that. We may end up with just a very big impact onthe exchange rate and a very minor impact on interest rates from thecessation of the inflow of foreign funds. What do you think, Paul.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no clear disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own doubts and uncertainties about the potential consequences of the situation described.


Passage number 304.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's a danger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. "I think it's a danger" is a statement expressing a personal opinion or belief, but it does not necessarily imply disagreement or contention with anyone else.


Passage number 305.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 306.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On both sides.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 307.
MR. WALLICH. Is the result the cessation of capital imports.Capital imports can't cease overnight, of course, because our exportsaren't going to go up overnight and imports aren't going to go down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Capital imports can't cease overnight" is simply stating a fact and does not imply disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 308.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage is not providing any opposing viewpoints or conflicting information. It simply presents a statement without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 309.
MR. WALLICH. So in that sense while we unwind this $80 to$100 billion current account deficit we will have upward pressure oninterest rates all the time but not the full pressures at thebeginning of the process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement that explains the potential impact on interest rates during the unwinding of the current account deficit.


Passage number 310.
MS. TEETERS. I might also add that the Europeans have theattitude that the dollar is going to drop sharply at some point. Theyare as much confused as we are as to why it hasn't dropped [already].But their real concern is that they perceive that [drop] as a sharpappreciation of the D-mark. They are very upset about theimplications of a sharply appreciating D-mark in the European MonetarySystem because there is no way to foretell what the relationships ofthe other currencies to an appreciated D-mark would be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It presents the perspective of Europeans and their concern about the potential appreciation of the D-mark in the European Monetary System. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 311.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 312.
 At a minimum it probably will forcemuch more rapid devaluations of the weaker currencies in the EMS. Andit might even make it almost intolerable, depending on the Italian andFrench policies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The mention of "depending on the Italian and French policies" suggests that there may be differing views on how these policies could affect the situation, leading to contention or disagreement.


Passage number 313.
 It certainly will mean much more strain on the EMS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement does not indicate any form of disagreement or contention. It simply states that there will be more strain on the EMS.


Passage number 314.
-51-12/19-20/83MR. TRUMAN. The answer to President Boehne's originalquestion is that there certainly are other examples. We have theJapanese at the moment. They have had a very strong current accountand a relatively weak [currency]--at least relative to the dollarexperience. We've had the British experience. I'm not sure exactlywhich way the British current account [is going now], but certainly inthe early Thatcher days sterling was very strong and the currentaccount was pretty good because of oil. But it was a period when thecurrency was moving in an unsustainable direction in the absence of[unintelligible] of the current account. It subsequently hasreversed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. President Truman is simply discussing different examples of countries and their current account balances and currency strength. He does not express any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 315.
MR. ROBERTS. It was fascinating to read in the paper thismorning that the OPEC countries have a $31 billion deficit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a piece of information without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 316.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Everybody has deficits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. The statement is a general claim that suggests that everyone has weaknesses or areas in which they are lacking. It does not introduce opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 317.
MR. ROBERTS. But the OPEC world, remember, was going to endwith a $100 billion surplus.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. The statement is a simple reminder of a previous understanding, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas being presented.


Passage number 318.
MR. WALLICH. The sum of the deficits is $100 billion inexcess of the sum of the surpluses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact about the sum of deficits being $100 billion more than the sum of surpluses.


Passage number 319.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other questions or comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is simply a statement inviting further questions or comments.


Passage number 320.
MS. TEETERS. I have one other question about intervention.What makes you decide when to intervene. What is the trigger. Is ita certain degree of movement in the rates, or what, that triggersthis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply asks a question about intervention and what triggers it.


Passage number 321.
MR. CROSS. No. We keep getting asked this question over andover. What happens actually is that, of course, we are monitoring[the market] all the time. When we see a situation where it looks asif rates could be moving too rapidly or are very volatile--kind ofgaping, with one transaction here and then the next buy or sell ordermoving out of the range entirely--or just generally unsettledconditions in the market, then we talk to our colleagues at the Boardand our colleagues at the Treasury. And usually at very, very highlevels in the Treasury Department there's a decision as to whetherthey feel that it is or is not a disorderly market. Certainly, one ofthe factors that goes into their thinking is the attitude of some ofthe other monetary authorities. On the occasion when we intervened inDecember [our action] followed some intervention by the Bundesbank--indeed some intervention where the Bundesbank had come in at the endof their day and intervened in a way that was going to affect the DMin our market. They had called us up to tell us about it and to seeif we had any concerns about it and we decided, again afterconsultations, that it would be appropriate for us to go in. But weintervened in a modest way. These have all been very modesttransactions; $50 million worth of DM, at a time when the market is asbig and as active as it is, is not going to reshape the world.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the process of how they monitor the market and make decisions about intervention.


Passage number 322.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In fact, there is a Machiavelliantheory which, of course, nobody here subscribes to: You can arguethat intervention in this penny ante amount is simply a way ofdiscrediting intervention as a policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is stating that nobody subscribes to the Machiavellian theory, suggesting that there is no contention or disagreement regarding this theory among the individuals referred to in the passage.


Passage number 323.
-52-12/19-20/83MR. CROSS. It shows some evidence of being willing toparticipate but in a very modest way. And I don't think anybodythinks that these amounts have any great impact. It can temporarilysettle a situation if we do enough of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their opinion that the amounts being discussed are modest and do not have a significant impact. They do not mention any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 324.
MR. WALLICH. How often did the Bundesbank operate in NewYork directly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 325.
MR. CROSS. On one occasion. This was a very unusualsituation in which the dollar was moving at a very, very rapid ratejust at the time our market was opening, and they did intervene onthat occasion in the amount of about $500 million. Subsequently, theyhave intervened in the market through the New York Fed, with us actingas agent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is only stating a fact about the intervention of the dollar in the market.


Passage number 326.
MR. WALLICH. How often did they do that, more or less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is a direct question and does not contain any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 327.
MR. CROSS. Once or twice--not often.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that something occurred "once or twice." There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 328.
MR. RICE. Do we have any problem with their coming into theNew York market and operating there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply asks if there are any problems with a certain action.


Passage number 329.
MR. CROSS. Well, we like to know what other central banksare doing in our market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Cross merely states that they like to know what other central banks are doing in their market, suggesting a desire for information and collaboration rather than a conflicting viewpoint.


Passage number 330.
MR. RICE. So long as we know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rice's statement is a simple acknowledgement or agreement.


Passage number 331.
MR. CROSS. For a number of the central banks--the Japanese,the Swiss--when they do, which is very rare, we act on their behalf.And that to me is the best way to handle it. Then we can do theoperation for them and know what is happening and handle it. And theGermans did operate that way subsequent to this one occasion when theyacted directly; they were trying to make a big splash and to show theworld that they were out there selling all these dollars.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 332.
MR. RICE. We prefer to have them do it through us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a preference for someone to do something through the speaker.


Passage number 333.
MR. CROSS. I do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their own opinion or point of view.


Passage number 334.
MR. WALLICH. Peter, could I ask you: Is it right to saythat that $50 million peanuts was sterilized automatically the sameday or the next day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 335.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Probably for the reserve effect it would bea couple of days later; it was folded into all the other reservefactors that we take account of.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is explaining a probable timeframe for a certain effect and mentioning that it is considered along with other factors.


Passage number 336.
MR. WALLICH. But you wouldn't have done anything on thatday, I suppose, if you hadn't been planning to do something anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a straightforward statement and does not involve any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 337.
MR. STERNLIGHT. No. There wouldn't have been an immediatereserve impact anyway. But we would have acted as soon as we had theinformation and folded it into all the other reserve factors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explicitly states that there wouldn't have been an immediate reserve impact and agrees with the idea of acting as soon as they had the information.


Passage number 338.
MR. CROSS. We settled two days later anyhow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "We settled two days later anyhow" simply indicates that the situation was resolved after two days.


Passage number 339.
MR. GUFFEY. I'm told that the Russians have been very activein foreign exchange markets, acquiring dollars. I'd just like to ask-53-12/19-20/83Sam how much of the rise in the dollar value vis-a-vis the mark, forexample, can be attributed to those apparently rather substantialactivities by the Russians.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for information or clarification about the influence of Russian activities on the rise in dollar value.


Passage number 340.
MR. CROSS. Well, it's very hard to say. Certainly, theyhave been active, particularly in the past couple of weeks, in buyingdollars. For what reason, I don't know. We have been trying to keepa log of what we hear and find out about their activities to see if wecan figure out what their approach is. But in the past couple ofweeks they have been buying very heavily in the dollar. And, as Imentioned, the Bundesbank has done really quite a large amount ofdollar sales--over $1-1/2 billion. The Russians have been buying avery large chunk of this on the other side, we think. One thought isthat they have some big year-end dollar needs, just as many othershave big year-end dollar needs. But I don't really have a goodexplanation as to why they're doing it. They seem to be buying a lotof dollars and selling some sterling, for example. Earlier this yearthey were operating on different sides of the market. We're trying toget a better assessment of their approach, but right now we reallydon't know what their purpose is in buying dollars. But they havebeen buying them heavily in Europe, in New York, and in the Far East.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating the facts and expressing their lack of understanding of the reasons behind the activity.


Passage number 341.
MR. KEEHN. Paul, are you going to cover later the currentstatus of the various external financing packages of Brazil, etc..
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Keen is simply asking Paul if he will discuss the current status of Brazil's external financing packages later.


Passage number 342.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I thought maybe we could do that after themeeting [at lunch]. Meanwhile, we have to ratify these transactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply suggesting a plan to do something after the meeting and then acknowledging another task that needs to be completed.


Passage number 343.
MS. TEETERS. I move that we ratify the transactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Ms. Teeters is making a motion to ratify the transactions.


Passage number 344.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Second.

Passage number 345.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Mr. Sternlight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "without objection" indicates that there was no opposition or disagreement from anyone present. The mention of Mr. Sternlight does not provide any further information to suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 346.
MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix.] That concludesmy report on operations, Mr. Chairman. I do have a recommendationabout leeway for the next period. Specifically, I think it would beadvisable to retain the $5 billion intermeeting leeway for changes inoutright holdings that was adopted at the last meeting. Thedifference is that this time the enlargement would be needed to copewith seasonal declines in currency and deposit levels. Also, if theintermeeting period extends into early February, we would come up tothat final phase-down step of reserve requirement ratios for memberbanks coming out of the Monetary Control Act. That's all I have, Mr.Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a report on operations and a recommendation.


Passage number 347.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Comments or questions. In view of greatsilence, we can ratify the transactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "In view of great silence, we can ratify the transactions" is presented as a conclusion or decision based on the lack of comments or questions, rather than a conflicting viewpoint.

MR. PARTEE. So moved.SPEAKER(.). Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Partee and the Speaker are in agreement with each other, as indicated by the statement "So moved" by Mr. Partee and the response "Second" by the Speaker.


Passage number 349.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. The leeway question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "Without objection" suggests that there is agreement and no objection from anyone.


Passage number 350.
MS. TEETERS. So moved.SPEAKER(.). Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker moves to approve something and another person seconds the motion.


Passage number 351.
-54-12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "Without objection" indicates that there is agreement or consensus among the parties involved. Mr. Axilrod's name being mentioned does not imply any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 352.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, my briefing will focus on M1--notbecause I want to overstress it, but because Ml is the aggregaterecently showing the most variable behavior relative to norms, so tospeak. That's what is perhaps most in need of analysis, particularlysince in the recent past its variations over a period of months haveoften provided good signals to follow. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the focus of the briefing and the reasons behind it.


Passage number 353.
]MR. BLACK. Could I ask just one brief question, Mr.Chairman. On your experimental weekly Ml seasonal, Steve, do you havea figure for December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a question being asked about a specific figure.


Passage number 354.
 I gather it would be not too far off from--MR. AXILROD. Yes, for December [in] the regular series wehave 2.3 percent, a drop from 6.7 percent in November. That compareswith our projection of 8.1 percent. So, there is a big difference inseasonals in November and December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting statistical data regarding the unemployment rates in November and December.


Passage number 355.
MR. BLACK. Only 2.3 percent in December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a numerical figure without any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 356.
MR. AXILROD. Yes, it's about a 5-1/2 or 6 point difference.There's a very big seasonal. The seasonals, month-to-month, are verydifferent, as you can see in the series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the difference in seasonality in the series.

Passage number 359.
MR. CORRIGAN. I just have one, Steve. Is it a reasonableproposition to you and Peter to say that where you think you are nowin the borrowings is $650 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 360.
MR. STERNLIGHT. That's the objective, yes. Some weeks comein above and some weeks below.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply stating a fact.


Passage number 361.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That was a pretty erratic intermeetingperiod in terms of where the borrowing and the net borrowed reservescame out. The average is not too bad over six weeks or so; it is nottoo good [in relation to the intended level] in between.We have already had quite a lot of discussion--by implicationbut not in precise terms--of where we should go in the short run. Imight say: The housing starts figures came out this morning. Just toget that on the table, Mr. Kichline, can you describe those.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing factual information about borrowing and reserves, and does not present any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 362.
MR. KICHLINE. Yes. In November, housing starts rose 100,000to 1-3/4 quarter million units, annual rate, from an upward revisedlevel in October. Both single-family and multifamily starts rose inall regions in the country, mostly in the West. Permits also rose alittle and the permits for October were revised up a little as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply provides factual information about housing starts and permits.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 363.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, permits did not rise very much. I donot know if this is terribly significant, but the flash GNP will becoming out this afternoon--no, it won't be out until tomorrow. I donot know what it is, but there is a suspicion in other places that it-55-12/19-20/83may be a little higher than our staff has projected. But I do notknow for sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage includes conflicting statements about when the flash GNP will be released and uncertainty about the accuracy of staff projections.


Passage number 364.
MS. TEETERS. It's not a very good number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement that does not invite further debate or opposing views.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 365.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not even a very good number in myopinion after it is no longer the flash. Unfortunately, it can beinaccurate in both directions. But it will be a pretty strong memory.I suspect we are getting a little seasonal pressure in themarkets. I think [whether or not] the reserve positions change, onewould expect seasonal pressures from the middle of December probablythrough the end of the year. We [typically] have a very erratic--ormaybe [simply] erratic--money number early in December; nobody knowsquite what is going to happen through the first week or two of Januarywhen we have often had very erratic numbers. This is well reflectedin the quite different signals that our two seasonal adjustmenttechniques provide. In trying to sort all of this out, and just togive you something to aim at: Given the strength of economicactivity--until there's a little more evidence that it is going theother way, if we ever get it--given the nervousness of theinflationary expectations, and given that the latest money supplyfigures look a little higher anyway, I don't find myself in any moodto ease. I am talking about a very short time perspective of severalweeks. Whether one would want to tighten up slightly is debatable, Isuppose. Part of my problem with tightening is that in announcing it,as we inevitably would have to do sooner or later, [the announcement]may exaggerate whatever one's intention was, unless one had a prettystrong intention. I find myself in a position where I think thatmaybe what we can say is that we will maintain the existing degree ofrestraint at least for the time being and if things turn out to be onthe ebullient side, economically and with the aggregates, we couldmake a small tightening move in coming weeks or wait for a little moreevidence. That is the way I would tend to write the directive--in asort of one-sided way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker is discussing the possibility of easing or tightening monetary policy, and there is disagreement or uncertainty about which course of action to take. The speaker mentions the strength of economic activity and inflationary expectations as reasons not to ease, but also mentions the possibility of tightening if things turn out to be "on the ebullient side." This indicates a lack of agreement or consensus on the appropriate course of action.


Passage number 366.
MS. TEETERS. Well, the end of the year is going to placesome upward pressure in the market area anyway, isn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Teeters is simply stating a fact about the market that could potentially create upward pressure.


Passage number 367.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know whether it will be morethan what we have, but I would think that if we maintain this for thenext week or 10-day period maybe, it might remain under some pressureboth because of seasonal pressures and because the Treasury is doing alot of financing between Christmas and New Year's Day. Then I thinkthat seasonal [pressure] would be over.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their uncertainty and thinking, without conflicting viewpoints or disagreement with others.


Passage number 368.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I think the pressures may linger a day ortwo [longer].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 369.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, maybe into the first couple days inJanuary--so, maybe [for the next] two weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply mentions a possible time frame without any conflicting statements or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 370.
MR. ROBERTS. Paul, when you say you wouldn't ease, do youmean in terms of our current borrowing standard. You're not talkingin terms, say, of looking at 2 percent money growth in the fourthquarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply seeks clarification on a statement made by Paul, without expressing disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 371.
-56-12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I am talking about the borrowingassumption. And I am talking about, I presume, without beingabsolutely precise--we can discuss it--measuring the prospects for anytightening subsequently so far as the aggregates are concerned againstthe standard of something like "B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the borrowing assumption and measuring prospects for tightening against a certain standard.


Passage number 372.
"VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. This is halfway between existingpolicy and snugging up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement that presents a position that is neither fully aligned with existing policy nor fully aligned with "snugging up."


Passage number 373.
MR. ROBERTS. I think "B" is a liberalization of majormagnitude, if we can get it done, as against what we have been doing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or arguments that express disagreement or contention. It simply presents Mr. Roberts's opinion about the potential impact of action "B" as a liberalization.


Passage number 374.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I haven't focused closely on thosefigures. I was thinking of something in that area, but we may want tolower or round some of those to whole percents. These figures for M2and M3 are pretty close, I guess, to the staff's December projection;they don't involve any particular change in trend from what we havebeen having for M2 or M3. M1 would obviously be a little higher, butprobably lower than--well, who knows what the December figure will be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their lack of focus on certain figures and discussing the possibility of rounding or adjusting them. They also mention that the figures for M2 and M3 are close to the staff's December projection and there is no change in trend. The passage ends with uncertainty about the December figure for M1.


Passage number 375.
MR. GUFFEY. For purposes of this discussion, I would agreeto adopting the "B" alternative as it appears in the Bluebook. Inview of the discussion and the feeling about the potential for somereemergence of price pressures, I would opt to snug up marginally orhave some nuance or whatever it may be of [snugging]. Rather thantake a $650 million borrowing level, I'd go maybe to $750 million,which implies about 1/4 percent more [on the funds rate] than what wehave been shooting at in the past. If I understand what has been saidaround the table, particularly from Peter, the pressures that arecoming on because of technical matters at year-end might move us to afunds rate of 9-1/2 percent or a bit above. I am really suggestingthat with a $750 million borrowing level we essentially would validatethat level after the technical pressures subside and end up withsomething over 9-1/2 percent and certainly not greater than 9-3/4percent. It would, in my view, present a picture that the FederalReserve has some concerns about the strength of the economy and thepotential for a reemergence of price pressures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their agreement with adopting the "B" alternative and their preference for a slightly higher borrowing level. They also mention that they believe there may be pressure to increase the funds rate due to technical matters at year-end. Overall, the speaker is presenting their perspective and suggesting a course of action.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 376.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have just one comment on that. I don'tthink we can aim at the federal funds rate as closely as one quarterof 1 percentage point. We take our chances on that a bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses their belief that aiming at the federal funds rate with as much precision as one quarter of 1 percentage point is not possible.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 377.
MR. FORRESTAL. I came into the meeting feeling prettystrongly that any easing of policy would be a mistake. I have notheard anything in the last two days to change my mind on that score.By the same token, I don't think that any substantial tightening ofpolicy is appropriate. The decision in my mind is whether we have aslight tightening of policy, something implied by "B" or "B-," Isuppose one could say. What those numbers are, I am not quite sure.A $700 or $750 million borrowing level probably would be a degree ofsnugging rather than a tightening. I think there is a lot of merit inwhat you said about waiting to see what develops in the next week orso. So, I am happy with "B" or something slightly less than "B,"moving a bit toward "C.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker begins by expressing their belief that easing policy would be a mistake, but later states that they do not think substantial tightening of policy is appropriate. This indicates a disagreement or uncertainty about the appropriate course of action.


Passage number 378.
"MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, if we did not have these Mlnumbers and were looking just at the real economy and what is goingon, I think we would have moved long ago toward a posture of more-57-12/19-20/83restraint than we have now. I can understand people's concern aboutMl, but I think we have to recall that what we are looking at is astock, not a supply; it is an intersection of demand and supply. Wehave to try to figure out where the weakness is coming from. Onecould well argue that it was coming from restraint on supply if wewere seeing either a significant slowdown in the growth of nominal GNPor a rise in interest rates or both. None of those things ishappening. Indeed, when the staff runs its model and tries to figurewhat money growth is taking place in the fourth quarter, consistentwith the old relationships that we used to have between Ml and GNPbased on the old standard Ml demand function and the econometricmodel, the answer is 8.3 percent. And I dare say that if we werelooking at 8.3 percent growth of Ml in this quarter, given the historyof very large growth for the last two years and the continuingtendency for the economy to far outrun our expectations, we would bemoving toward restraint. I don't see any strong reason for waiting.I think we ought to begin moving now toward a tighter posture. Iwould opt, therefore, for something between "B" and "C." I might goeven a little further than Roger--up to an $850 million borrowinglevel. I wouldn't want to see the fed funds rate go over 10 percent,but I wouldn't mind at all if it stayed in the 9-1/2 to 10 percentrange.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 379.
MR. KEEHN. For the reasons that you outlined at the outset,I would be very much in favor of alternative B. Having said that, Iwould be in favor of modifying the directive, as I have suggested acouple of times so far, to indicate greater emphasis on Ml. Also, itdoes occur to me that this [directive] will be coming out probably inlate January or early February after we have embarked on a majoroperating change, and I think we ought to reflect that now. So,again, I'd change the directive. I'd leave the borrowing level atabout $650 million, but I would change the fed funds range to 7 to 11percent--not to indicate any policy change but simply to give us moreroom in which to operate, because I have a hunch that the funds rate,at least for the next few weeks, will rise pretty close to that 10percent ceiling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Keehn, is expressing his support for alternative B and suggesting modifications to the directive for greater emphasis on Ml and to reflect a major operating change. He also suggests changing the fed funds range to provide more room for operation. There is no indication of contradiction or disagreement with any other person or viewpoint in this passage.


Passage number 380.
MR. WALLICH. I would go to $750 million on borrowing and I'dbe quite satisfied with 8 percent growth of M2 and M3. And if thatleads to 6 percent on M1, that would seem to me in line with theranges that we are about to set, possibly. On the funds rate, I donot particularly want to see it higher, except marginally. But Ithink we have to have a little more room on the up side, if it's notgoing to be totally confining. So, I would say 6-1/2 to 10-1/2percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich is expressing his own views and preferences regarding borrowing, growth rates, and the funds rate. There is no indication of any conflicting opinions or opposing arguments from other individuals in the passage.


Passage number 381.
MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I have observed that theunemployment rate, with the most recent data we have and the staffprojections through 1984, brings us to a position well above the so-called natural rate of unemployment that we reviewed at the last FOMCmeeting. Also, in contrast to some of my colleagues, I observe very,very little evidence of a reigniting of inflation. You cannot find itin commodity prices, in gold, or in the usual indices. If you acceptthe staff forecast quarter-by-quarter of the real GNP, it comes downnicely. One would wonder, as has been observed here previously, whatbetter configuration of a moderation in economic expansion one wouldseek in contrast to what has been projected here. It seems to me thatalternative B, which is essentially the status quo with a $650 million-58-12/19-20/83borrowing level, not $750 million, and with growth of the aggregatesas indicated is consonant with an expansion period that is almosttextbook. I would join my colleague Governor Rice in the hope that wecould restore Ml to the pantheon on Olympus in July, having the expost expertise that we all will acquire so readily in looking backwardover [the intervening] period of time. I don't think this is a timeto signal to a nervous market that we see inflation coming back whenonly the Wall Street gossip would join us in that expectation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is expressing agreement with his colleagues and providing evidence to support his viewpoint.


Passage number 382.
MR. BOEHNE. Well, I don't want to overstate what I'm aboutto say, but it seems to me that we have to rely to some extent on whatwe think is going to happen down the road, simply because of the lagsinvolved. We can be wrong, however, about the future we see.Therefore, to some extent we have to ask ourselves which mistake iseasier to undo if we make it. As I look out into 1984, it seems to methat it would be easier to undo a little too much restraint now. Inother words, it would be easier to ease later in the year than itwould be to tighten because we waited too long. I think the risks inthe domestic economy are on the side of more growth than we expect,more inflation than we expect, and more accommodation on the part ofmonetary policy. So, for no other reason than just to curb a ratherbuoyant psychology out there, I think some very modest move towardtightening would be appropriate between now and the next meeting. Theorder of magnitude I would come down for is something like a "B-,"with $750 million or so on borrowing. I think that such a modest movewould get lost in the year-end churning that we're going through, soit seems to me that some time in January would be the appropriate timefor the tightening to emerge.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 383.
MS. TEETERS. I think we need a period of continuousstability. My perception of the economy is that, yes, it hasrecovered in the typical fashion, but the recovery could be veryeasily upset with rising interest rates. I think we can afford towait to see what is going on. I would add to my concerns that anyupward movement in the interest rate is going to make the exchangerate worse. I agree with Tony that the more it goes up the harderit's going to fall--it's going to be rather precipitous--and that thatwould increase our problems of adjustment during 1984. So, I wouldsimply take alternative B, the $650 million on borrowing, and the 6 to10 percent funds rate range; I'd keep a fairly moderate stance at thispoint and let the year-end pressure do its thing but then come backout of it in the 9-1/2 percent range [on fed funds]. And we canreadjust; the [next] meeting is not that far away. I would also pointout to you that if we tighten now, the policy record from this meetingwill be released probably on the day that the Chairman testifies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 384.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 385.
MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, in terms of the strength of theeconomy, I think one could make an argument for some snugging up atthis point in time. I think the evidence in housing is that thatsector has adapted pretty well to the current level of rates. I don'tthink there is room in the economy, given the strength of the capitalgoods sector, for any substantial revival in the strength of housing.But at the same time I could accept alternative B as written or somesnugging up; I don't feel a strong conviction as to which one isright.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Morris, states that there could be an argument for tightening monetary policy ("snugging up") due to the strength of the economy. However, he also acknowledges that he does not feel strongly about whether alternative B (presumably a looser monetary policy) or some tightening is the right choice. This indicates a lack of consensus or agreement on the appropriate course of action.


Passage number 386.
-59-12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It mentions Governor Partee without any discussion or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 387.
MR. PARTEE. I think it's premature to tighten today. Iagree with Pres and Nancy that the economy still has quite a lot ofroom in it--that we don't really have any signs of inflation except inthe hype that the market is putting on the question. And it would bewrong to move in response to that. If we were closer to fullutilization, we would have a little less tolerance to a mistake on theup side. I thought Ed Boehne was going to conclude that since ourforecast is reasonable we shouldn't change policy. But he surprisedme by saying that since the forecast is reasonable we ought to tightenup. I guess I don't agree with that unless unusual strength developsin the period ahead. That is, we can't really stand more surprises onthe up side of our expectations; we could stand some surprises on themoderately lower side. So, I think your original proposal is a quitegood one. I don't see why we ought to bias the result by starting outwith a higher borrowed reserve figure than we have currently. I thinkwe ought to put it in at $650 million or thereabouts and then if, infact, things strengthen quite a bit in the weeks to come, we ought tolet the borrowing run up with the strengthening that occurs. I wouldfeel a good deal more willing to see some snugging if we could getsome strength from Ml. We haven't had it--except for last week--and Iguess if we did get now a rather meaningful expansion in Ml, thatwould be another signal that perhaps the economy was stronger and thuswe ought to snug. So, I would do just as you suggested in thebeginning, Paul, but with $650 million--I don't know that you spoke tothe borrowing number--as the beginning borrowing number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is an individual expressing their opinion and agreeing with the original proposal.


Passage number 388.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information or statements that suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 389.
MR. CORRIGAN. Let me just add a point that I forgot tomention earlier. In terms of emphasis on the various aggregates, Itoo would put a little more emphasis on Ml--not restoring it to itsformer grandeur but nevertheless putting a little more emphasis on it.Having said that, I would also add that I'm not sanguine that themarket has learned its lesson. The relatively dispassionate reactionto Ml that we've seen over the past few months is nothing more than areflection of the fact that Ml isn't anywhere near the top of thetarget; that is, people are more tolerant of its behavior.As far as policy goes now, I am in the camp that says thebell has rung and recess is over and it's back to school. I've beenthere for some time. I do, therefore, favor a modest move now. Iview something along the lines of what Roger said as satisfactory; butpending developments in the intermeeting period, I probably would bewilling to go as far as Governor Gramley suggested. There are risksin that, certainly. I think the most pronounced ones are on theinternational side, with the exchange rate and the implications forthe financing costs of developing countries. That is the single thingthat gives me the most pause for concern and caution. As I saidyesterday, I think we're by no means out of the woods in terms ofdomestic financial problems in a context of rising interest rates,which is one of the reasons I'd rather try to do a little somethingnow in hopes of not having to do more later. Certainly, there aresome political risks, particularly in a context in which M1 doesn'tseem to be growing at a very robust rate based on our own numbers.But, again, I feel rather strongly that the risks on the other sideare greater at this juncture; in my view at least, the economy and-60-12/19-20/83inflation may be more of a problem than others see it to be. I alsoagree with the thrust of Ed Boehne's remarks. If we do something of amodest nature now, it's pretty easy to reverse it if indeed eventswarrant that. On the other hand, if we don't do something now, Ibelieve it becomes harder to do it later and I also believe we run therisk that we will have to do more later rather than less. So, I do myown balancing of these risks and I must say that I come out on theside of moving up now, say, to $750 million or maybe a bit more. Andfor the intermeeting period as a whole, pending developments, Iprobably would be willing to go further--certainly not above 10percent on the federal funds rate, but if we had to go to 10 percent,I'd go to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their own views and weighing the risks and benefits of taking a certain action.


Passage number 390.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 391.
MR. BALLES. At the risk of being accused of looking at thehole rather than the doughnut, I would quickly like to repeatsomething I said last month--Chuck is smiling--that these[unintelligible] looking figures on the macroeconomic statistics arenot capturing all of reality. My deputy chairman came back from arecent meeting of the Conference of Chairman and Deputies andaccording to his tabulations there were 6 to 9 Districts that reporteddistinctly spotty trends in the economy. Yes, indeed, a lot of thingsare going well. But a lot of things aren't going well, and they'reconcentrated in areas such as agriculture, export industries, and soon. So, on a broader basis, my own reading of the economy is thatthere is not really much risk of a major significant reacceleration ofinflation. Therefore, I would come out similar to the way thatGovernors Martin and Teeters and Partee have come out. I think itwould be premature to snug. I would be in favor of alternative B andwould like to see that borrowing assumption no higher than $650million. The hoped for turnaround in M1 is still a forecast, not afact. And if it proved unfortunately not to be an accurate forecast,I would begin to get a little more worried than I was last month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker acknowledges that there are some areas of the economy that are not going well, but overall, they do not see a significant risk of inflation. They express agreement with other governors' views and mention a preferred borrowing assumption.


Passage number 392.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Did you say you would like to see theborrowing above $650 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is a question seeking clarification on whether the person mentioned previously expressed a desire to see borrowing above $650 million. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 393.
MR. BALLES(.). No. I said I would not like to see it anyhigher than $650 million as the initial figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Balles simply states that he would not like to see the initial figure any higher than $650 million.


Passage number 394.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I need more context or the specific passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 395.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think there's a difference, eventhough it's a nuance, between "B," retaining existing policy, and yourproposal, Mr. Chairman. Since I indicated yesterday that I was tornbetween retaining existing policy and a very slight snugging up, Ithink your approach tries to bridge that. You said you would maintainat least the existing degree of restraint and you would have morerestraint depending on the continued strength of economic recovery andyou would drop out the section on lesser restraint so that thedirective is somewhat asymmetric. Basically, that poises us to dosome snugging but it doesn't actually do the snugging. We would stickwith the $650 million for the time being but if we see continuingstrength in the economic recovery, and particularly if that'sreinforced by money numbers, then we would do the snugging up. Idon't know--we wouldn't need a conference call then, would we, at thatpoint. Based on that directive, that would permit some snugging up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different approaches and expressing agreement with the Chairman's proposal.


Passage number 396.
-61-12/19-20/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'd need one, I think, if we wanted to gothe other way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that if they wanted to go the other way, they would need a reason or justification for doing so.


Passage number 397.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The word "Right" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple word that does not imply any conflicting opinions or debates.


Passage number 398.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in the given passage fragment "Mr. Boykin." We would need more information to determine if there is any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 399.
MR. BOYKIN. I would align myself with those--I think JerryCorrigan said it very well and others--who would start moving against[inflation] now with a $750 million initial borrowing assumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Boykin, is expressing agreement with Jerry Corrigan and others who believe in starting to move against inflation by borrowing $750 million.


Passage number 400.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Since there is no specific passage provided, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 401.
MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I would support your originalproposition whereby we hold our position where we are now and couldapply more restraint if it seems necessary. So, I would supportalternative B, borrowing at $650 million, and a funds rate roughlywhere it is now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing support for the original proposition and suggests adopting alternative B, which aligns with the current position.


Passage number 402.
MR. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, although I'm concerned about thefact that we haven't been able to get M1 growing, I would be willingto accept the staff forecast for December and the 6 percent growth inthe first quarter implied in alternative B and would accept yourproposal of not increasing restraint at this time. Along with Mr.Balles, I would prefer that we make it very clear that if we don't getthat expansion in Ml, we will look to lesser restraint promptlybecause I think another full quarter of this would put us in adangerous position where we may be looking at a decline in output bymidyear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses concern about the lack of growth in M1 and suggests accepting the staff forecast for December and the 6 percent growth in the first quarter. They also agree with the proposal of not increasing restraint at this time. The speaker acknowledges that if they do not see the desired expansion in M1, they will consider lesser restraint. There is no clear sign of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 403.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Horn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I cannot analyze or provide information about specific passages or individuals as I don't have access to personal data or context. My programming is focused on providing general information and assistance. If you have any other question or need help with another topic, feel free to ask!


Passage number 404.
MS. HORN. I also think your proposal is a good one, perhapscoming from my view that forecasting is a very tricky business,compounded by the District I come from. Although we've certainly seenimprovement, we're one of those very spotty Districts. And even inthe firms where we have seen improvement, I would say the attitude ischaracterized not as any kind of euphoria but as concern about thefuture. Perhaps coming from my view that Ml does continue to tell ussomething, I would not like to see snugging up occur at this time. Iguess I feel that the danger of inflation in the future may well bereflected in an early way in some of the collective bargainingagreements, and because we have a very difficult [collectivebargaining] calendar next year we need to watch [these developments]very carefully to see if more snugging is required at that point. Forall those reasons--the state of recovery and the future of therecovery, what Ml is telling us, and the fact that I think we haven'tyet seen the collective bargaining process start leading us into avery dangerous area--I favor the proposal you made, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the proposal and provides reasons for her support.


Passage number 405.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage provided is incomplete and does not contain any text or information. Therefore, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 406.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I've been waiting in hopes thatsomeone would say all I wanted to say, and Ted Roberts came veryclose. No economist is going to agree 100 percent with anybody, so Iwould come out right where he did except I'd rather use 5-1/2 percentthan 6 percent on a quarterly average basis [for Ml]. I would stressmainly that if we don't get this growth in Ml in December, we really-62-12/19-20/83ought to have a conference call and take a look at it because if thathappens, I believe the slowdown might be more real than I now think itis and that maybe we ought to move a little against it. So, I wouldreally go with your original position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Black, agrees with the previous speaker, Ted Roberts, but proposes a slightly different percentage for M1. He also suggests that if there is a lack of growth in M1 in December, it may signal a real slowdown and a need for further action. Overall, there is no disagreement among the speakers in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 407.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me try to clarify my originalposition in the light of all these comments and see whether we can getcloser. I am partly influenced by the fact that it's just Ml that isvery low and if we write into a directive that we want to increaserestraint and have to reverse that very shortly because Ml falls outof bed, it would look peculiar and would be difficult to explain. Imust confess that I have that a little in my mind. These seasonalpressures are convenient in the sense that we're getting a little moreseasonal restraint for a couple of weeks. I think the split we havein the Committee is between [waiting or not waiting]--not necessarilywaiting until we see [the outcome of] collective bargaining agreementsor that kind of thing, which would take some months. But if we reallyget a confirmation of strength in Ml, particularly by early January--let's say December comes out more or less as projected and we getanother Ml bulge at the beginning of January, so that January growthis beginning to look high and we aren't getting any economic news tosuggest anything less than the ebullience we [currently] see--I'dbegin moving in a modest way as early as that. I'm talking [aboutmoving] maybe in the first week or second week in January.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates a potential split or disagreement in the Committee regarding whether to wait or not wait to take action based on the outcome of collective bargaining agreements or other factors.


Passage number 408.
MR. ROBERTS. "Bulge" being growth over 6 percent, say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a definition or clarification of the term "bulge."


Passage number 409.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That would have to be projected forJanuary, but I mean if Ml got off to a [high] start in January. Rightnow I would say that we should try to make sure we don't get below the$650 million [in borrowing], which means obviously that we would erron the side of more tightness. Borrowing might be more likely to comeout above than below $650 million, but we would not be aiming abovethat level.Well, let me look at these [specifications]. I would notmind myself knocking the halves off of the alternative B growth rates,or [making them] a little less, if that makes people happier. Let mecome back to the federal funds rate later. Specifically, what I wouldput in the directive is a first sentence that reads: "The Committeeseeks in the short run to maintain at least the existing degree ofreserve restraint." This would be explained more [fully] in thepolicy record part. We could move up M1 if you want to. On the Mlsentence, [leave out the reference to] the relatively slow growth inOctober and just move up that whole sentence on Ml and the creditaggregate to follow the sentence on M2 and M3. That's a very subtlechange; I don't think anybody will notice it. They haven't evengotten it yet that it has been moved down. Then I'd make the nextsentence read something like: "Somewhat greater restraint would beacceptable should the aggregates expand more rapidly within thecontext of continuing strength of economic activity." I'd leave outanything about the down side; if something happened and we reallywanted to ease--if Ml came in very low, for instance--we'd have tohave a meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly consists of suggestions and explanations for potential actions or changes.


Passage number 410.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Suppose we get the continuingstrength or ebullience in the economic recovery but we don't get M1growth, would you still do a little snugging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a hypothetical scenario presented as a question, without any conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints being expressed.


Passage number 411.
-63-12/19-20/83MR. MARTIN. And the same lack of any [new] statisticalevidence of inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply stating that there is a lack of new statistical evidence of inflation.


Passage number 412.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know what we're likely to get inthe next two or three weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the future and what is expected in the next two or three weeks. There is no contention or disagreement present in this statement.


Passage number 413.
MR. KICHLINE. We should get the CPI tomorrow as well [as theGNP flash].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kichline simply states that they should be getting the CPI (Consumer Price Index) tomorrow along with the GNP flash.


Passage number 414.
MS. TEETERS. And the first Friday in January we get theunemployment rate. That's about it, isn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement of information.


Passage number 415.
MR. WALLICH. If you wait until you see it, you've missed it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a matter-of-fact statement about missing an opportunity if one waits too long to act.


Passage number 416.
MR. MARTIN. Do you want to be too soon or too late.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking about the desired time for something.


Passage number 417.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you exclude food and energy from thePPI, it was still a rate of only 3 percent. And capital goods was, Ithink, a pretty good figure all around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage. The speaker simply states a fact and expresses their own opinion without conflicting with anyone else's perspective.


Passage number 418.
MR. MARTIN. And OPEC is having a terrible time trying tohold the cartel together.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a fact about OPEC's struggle to maintain their cartel. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement within the passage.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Of the business news that we will get,part of it we'll get tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply states that a part of the business news will be received tomorrow.


Passage number 420.
 But we're now looking at just thefirst week of January and obviously I can't answer--MR. KICHLINE. We do get the employment surveys on January 6,which is the first Friday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states the date and indicates that the speaker is unable to answer a question. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 421.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Suppose they came in strong. Suppose wegot a further decline in unemployment and a sizable increase in Ml;that certainly would be a factor on the snugging side. Now, if the[un]employment rate retreated .2 or .3, which I suppose it could justbecause it was down so sharply the previous two months, we'd weighthat in the balance a little on the other side. If the consumer priceindex is high, I don't have to tell you on which side of the balanceI'd throw that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a hypothetical scenario being discussed.


Passage number 422.
MR. PARTEE. It's rather hard to think that we'll get muchnews except for unemployment. Obviously, there's going to becontinuing strength in the economy. The question is: Is it going tobe surprising strength.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, Mr. Partee is expressing his belief that there will be continuing strength in the economy. He does not mention any disagreement or contention with others' views, nor does he present any contradictory information. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 423.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We would be in somewhat of a dilemma, Isuppose, if the employment numbers came in very strong and Ml came inweak. Then what do we do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It presents a hypothetical scenario and asks a question for consideration.


Passage number 424.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I think what you do is lean in thedirection of the way the economy is going. I think all the evidenceis pointing in the direction of an economy that continues tooutperform our expectations. I don't know what the flash GNP is goingto show, but the housing starts figure this morning alone is going toadd several tenths to real GNP growth in the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, expresses his opinion and observations about the direction of the economy.


Passage number 425.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wouldn't be surprised if the GNP growthin the fourth quarter came in around 7 percent. That's my favorite-64-12/19-20/83statistic. If it comes out 7 percent, it will be the most rapid threequarters of economic growth that we've had in the postwar period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the author's belief and prediction about the GNP growth in the fourth quarter.


Passage number 426.
MR. MARTIN. If it comes out 6-1/4 percent, as forecast, itwon't be the most rapid.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin is simply stating a fact or prediction about a potential outcome.


Passage number 427.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It will be just in that ballpark. Thenyou would say it's about as fast as we've ever had.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that something will be "just in that ballpark" and that it is "about as fast as we've ever had."


Passage number 428.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If it comes out at 7 percent,inflationary expectations will increase another notch, even though theactual hard data won't show [more inflation].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that if the inflation rate reaches 7 percent, inflationary expectations will increase, even though there may not be a corresponding increase in actual hard data indicating more inflation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 429.
MR. CORRIGAN. On this point about prices: If you go backand look at the 6-month period ending in April, the rise in theconsumer price index with or without food and energy--any way youslice it--is something like 2 percent. In the six months ending inNovember, any way you slice it, it's 5 percent or more. Now, I admitthat the wholesale price index isn't showing the same thing, but theconsumer price index is what gets into social security, otherpensions, cost of living adjustments, wage expectations, and the wholeball of wax. I find it very, very difficult to accept the notion thatthere is no evidence that price increases have started to go up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes
The speaker, Mr. Corrigan, is disagreeing with the notion that there is no evidence of price increases going up. He presents data from the consumer price index to argue that prices have indeed risen, contradicting the opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 430.
There is a doubling of the rate of increase--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think there's any question:Prices have gone up [faster] from the midst of the recession and itsaftermath.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a clear observation without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 431.
MR. CORRIGAN. But if the consumer price index is giving theright reading, we're already at 5 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the consumer price index without any opposing opinions or disagreement.


Passage number 432.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The question is whether it's giving theright reading.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence simply presents a question without expressing any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 433.
MR. CORRIGAN. I don't know if it is, either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "I don't know if it is, either" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests uncertainty or a lack of knowledge about a specific topic.


Passage number 434.
MR. GRAMLEY. Prices always move with a lag and they alwaysare glacial in their performance unless something spectacular happenson fronts like food or energy. The underlying factor drivinginflation is wages, and wages are well known to be very sticky; theymove glacially. What we do now is going to affect wage bargainingthroughout 1984 and 1985. That is what we have to worry about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It provides an explanation of how prices and wages typically move and how they are interconnected.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 435.
 Andas the economy continues to get stronger--MR. ROBERTS. I think that is worrying about fighting thelast war. The inflation that we're going to experience here comesfrom things that have happened in the past. If we have a verysluggish Ml series, just because contemporaneously the consumer priceindex is registering a change that reflects past conditions it wouldbe a mistake to react to that, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts disagrees with the idea that the economy getting stronger will lead to inflation. He argues that inflation will come from past conditions and reacting to the current consumer price index would be a mistake.


Passage number 436.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But you're talking only about thelast four months of sluggish M1 growth. I don't understand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement expressing confusion or lack of understanding about a specific topic.


Passage number 437.
MR. ROBERTS. No. I'm saying that the prices that will beflowing through the economy are a function of past money growth--say,in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact or explanation.


Passage number 438.
-65-12/19-20/83MR. GRAMLEY. If you look at what has happened to Ml overlonger periods, I suppose you'd look back at the past four years--Iwould at least--and say that Federal Reserve policy was heavilyresponsible for the improvements on the inflation front that we havebeen experiencing. And yet if you look at the figures, you will findout that growth of money in the past four years was every bit as rapidas it was in the previous four years. You have to explain pricesother than just by what has been happening to the money stock.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply acknowledges that looking at the growth of money over the past four years, it has been as rapid as in the previous four years. They are suggesting that there must be other factors aside from the money stock that explain changes in prices. There is no direct contradiction or disagreement presented.


Passage number 439.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, the trend growth of money is about 8percent. I don't know what period you would pick, but you would get apretty closely correlated price change over any longer period of timewith the growth of money.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a fact without any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply presents the trend growth rate of money and suggests a correlation with price changes over time.


Passage number 440.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think that is not what the figures have beenshowing recently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement expressing a personal opinion about the recent figures.


Passage number 441.
MR. ROBERTS. You might pick out a cycle and have adeviation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by someone, Mr. Roberts, suggesting a course of action.


Passage number 442.
MR. GRAMLEY. I'm thinking of the period since the FederalReserve made its historic decision in the fourth quarter of 1979. Thegrowth rate of Ml since then is almost exactly the same as it was inthe previous years. The previous four years were a period ofsubstantial build-up of inflation and in these recent four years therehas been a substantial unwinding. You have to explain that on groundsother than just Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting a statement and asking for an explanation, but there is no opposing viewpoint or argument being presented.


Passage number 443.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, one way to explain it is that the patternhas been very erratic, which is continuing this year with 13 percentgrowth in the first half and 5 percent in the second half.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply explaining the pattern of growth, stating that it has been erratic and providing specific percentages for the first and second half of the year.


Passage number 444.
MR. GRAMLEY. We get inflation down with erratic patternstoo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states Mr. Gramley's opinion or point of view without any conflicting perspectives.


Passage number 445.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, it creates a different situation thanjust, say, averaging a year. If you had one [half] at 20 percent andone [half] at 0 and average that out, I don't think it's the same ashaving a 9 percent year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts is simply stating that averaging out a year with one half at 20 percent and one half at 0 percent is not the same as having a 9 percent year.


Passage number 446.
MR. BLACK. I have some figures here that I think supportboth positions, depending on the period you take. In the four yearsbefore 1979, 7 percent is the least squares rate of growth; since thenit's 6.8 percent. But the first part of that latter period--thatwould be from '79 to about mid-'81--it was 5.1 percent. And sincethen to the fourth quarter, it is 10.5 percent. So, that supportsyour position. It also supports Lyle's.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting figures that could be interpreted as supporting both positions.


Passage number 447.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. None of it sounds to me like it supportswhy the inflation rate was 12 to 13 percent and now is 4 to 5 percent,but that's beside the point. We need to make a decision here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mentions that the speaker does not find some information supportive but acknowledges that it is beside the point. It then directs the focus towards making a decision.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 448.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Maybe the conclusion is that you needan erratic enough policy to eventually bring about a recession thatbrings down the inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement suggests that an erratic policy is needed to bring about a recession that reduces inflation. This viewpoint may be argued against by those who believe that a stable and predictable policy can effectively control inflation without the need for economic downturns.


Passage number 449.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have described the intentions here aboutas clearly as I can. What I am proposing, as I understand it, is a-66-12/19-20/83pretty quick finger on the trigger if things move in the one directionand no finger on the trigger at all if things move in the otherdirection. It doesn't mean we can't have a meeting. What we'retalking about is that this snugging up, if that is the right term,might well come about early in January. The range of what we'retalking about [on borrowings] is $750 to $800 million, depending uponjust how the numbers look.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is explaining the author's proposal and intentions, without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 450.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'd be reluctant, though, to raisethe federal funds range for the same reason, even though I know we'regetting near the higher end of it. But it seems to me that we're notgoing to hit the higher end and I think it would give the wrongsignal. I think we can continue using the [current] range as long aswe retain a money market directive and the markets know it has verylittle relevance. When we had a more automatic feedback reaction frommoney supply movements, then it was a reasonable constraint. But whydo we bother to continue to put the range in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their reluctance to raise the federal funds range and their belief that the current range can continue to be used. They are not presenting any conflicting ideas or disagreeing with any previous statements.


Passage number 451.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'll give you three alternatives,none of which I feel strongly about: either 6 to 10 percent or 7 to11 percent or eliminate it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker is providing three different alternatives and states that they do not feel strongly about any of them, indicating there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 452.
MR. BLACK. I'll support Mr. Roberts on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Black is expressing his willingness to support Mr. Roberts, indicating agreement.


Passage number 453.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think we need a range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The statement does not present any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas. It is a simple statement expressing the opinion that a range is needed. There is no contention or disagreement indicated.


Passage number 454.
MR. MORRIS. I think it could be eliminated if you tell themarket we're following a fundamentally different policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Morris is suggesting a possible solution to eliminate something, but there is no indication of disagreement or opposing views.


Passage number 455.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the problem in eliminating it rightat this point. Who wants to eliminate it. Only two Committeemembers. We won't eliminate it; that proposal has not attractedsufficient support. A 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent range doesn't send me.I think we could hit 10 percent. It wouldn't bother me terribly if wedo; I don't think we'll hit 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and lack of support for eliminating something, but there is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 456.
MS. TEETERS. Ranges have never been confining.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a statement of fact, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 457.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No. I don't think it's going to confineus all that much either. I think we could hit 10 percent; if we hitit consistently over a period of time we probably would have aconsultation. But I don't think that in itself is going to affectanything too much, so I think we're talking about cosmetics here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any signs of contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their opinion that a certain factor would not have a significant impact and refers to it as "cosmetics."


Passage number 458.
MR. BOEHNE. It seems to me that raising it could convey thewrong impression. I think the subtleties that we're talking abouthere are just that--very subtle. And after all these months if itwere raised to 7 to 11 percent, I think it would overstate what islikely to happen and it would also be released in February, whichmight not be the most convenient time for it to be released.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Boehne is expressing his own opinion and discussing the potential implications and timing of raising something (not mentioned in the passage).


Passage number 459.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't feel strongly about this. There'ssomething to what you say. The only argument I see on the other sideis that we're so close to the top of the 6 to 10 percent range, itlooks a little funny keeping it there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is validity in what the other person is saying, but also presents an alternative viewpoint.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 460.
MR. WALLICH. If we're going to raise the borrowing, eventhough that number is not published, the text of the directive will-67-12/19-20/83indicate that it is consistent to have some reaction in the fundsrate. It is peculiar to leave it unchanged when the rate is so closeto the top anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wallach suggests that if borrowing is raised, there should be a reaction in the funds rate, while someone else argues that it is peculiar to leave the rate unchanged.


Passage number 461.
MR. PARTEE. We're not going to raise borrowings--are we.--unless we decide to snug up, which is getting along into the period.Then the funds rate may go up and then we'll change the range. That'sthe order in which it ought to occur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is merely explaining a possible sequence of events.


Passage number 462.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think changing the range would not send thewrong signals; it would send the right signals. I could live with 6to 10 percent, but I prefer 7 to 11 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, expresses a personal preference for a specific range (7 to 11 percent), but also states that they could live with a different range (6 to 10 percent).


Passage number 463.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How many prefer 7 to 11 percent. Four.[Secretary's note: Messrs. Gramley, Keehn, Morris and Wallich.], Howmany prefer 6 to 10 percent. Six or seven--an enormous difference.Well, that suggests we leave it at 6 to 10 percent, but it's not alife or death difference as far as I'm concerned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply presents the number of people who prefer each percentage range and acknowledges that there is a slight difference in preference, but it is not significant.


Passage number 464.
MR. GUFFEY. Just a matter of clarification: When you makethe statement--I'm paraphrasing--that if things go in one directionyou have the finger on the trigger, are you talking about theaggregates or are you talking about economic activity. Or do you haveto combine those two things before you pull the trigger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and asking for further explanation.


Passage number 465.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, to some extent you have to combinethem. But we're not going to get all that much news on the economy,as we suggested. I think that if the aggregates, particularly Ml, arerunning a little high and we haven't in all likelihood gotten adverseeconomic news, the present sense continues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing a personal opinion or analysis.


Passage number 466.
MR. GUFFEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 467.
 So we are relying a little more heavily on theaggregates because--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just because of the timing. We could getsome very sour economic news.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining that they are relying on aggregates more heavily due to timing and the possibility of receiving negative economic news.


Passage number 468.
 If suddenly everybody stops shoppingbefore Christmas and sales don't look so good--MR. GRAMLEY. Because they've run out of money.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a hypothetical scenario and provides a potential explanation for the sales decline.


Passage number 469.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --and the unemployment rate goes up threetenths of a percent and employment doesn't do much and the industrialproduction figure for December goes up only two tenths of a percent,all that would give me a little pause. But I don't expect that tohappen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their expectation and discussing potential scenarios.


Passage number 470.
MR. PARTEE. It used to be that in Chicago department storesales were negative the week after Christmas; returns exceeded sales.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any elements of contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the sales and returns in Chicago department stores after Christmas.


Passage number 471.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Only in Chicago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply mentions something about Chicago without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 472.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The provided passage does not contain enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 473.
 If that should be picked up by the newspapers--negative sales--MR. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, do you suggest taking out thismodifying phrase about lesser restraint in the context of asignificant shortfall of growth in the aggregates. It's in there now.-68-12/19-20/83If we were to have December flat and January developing flat in moneygrowth, wouldn't you want to have that leeway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a conversation where one person asks a question and the other person responds with a suggestion. There is no conflicting opinion or argument.


Passage number 474.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, what we would have to do is have ameeting. The proposal is to leave it out simply to indicate thatthere is still some bias toward a little tightening rather than thereverse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is discussing the idea of leaving something out of a proposal to indicate a bias towards tightening instead of the reverse. However, it is not explicitly stating any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 475.
MR. ROBERTS. But if that happens, you would probably have ameeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Roberts is making a statement, and there is no opposing view or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 476.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, if they were really flat, I thinkthat's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses agreement with the idea that if something (presumably pancakes or similar objects) were genuinely flat, it would be considered correct.


Passage number 477.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Shouldn't we put in "Merry Christmas"or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement is a question, expressing a suggestion or idea for consideration. It does not indicate any controversy, opposition, or debate.


Passage number 478.
MR. MORRIS. By the time they read it, it's too late. Weshould say "Happy Valentine's Day".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Morris, is suggesting that instead of saying "Happy Valentine's Day" to someone, they should have said it earlier since by the time the message is read, it would be too late. This statement reflects his opinion or suggestion but does not involve conflict or disagreement with others.


Passage number 479.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The Committee in the short run seeks tohave a merry Christmas.Well, what about the specifications for the aggregates. Wecan take straight alternative B or, as I said, I'd be just as happy toknock off the halves. Or we could have something different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing different options or alternatives without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 480.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It doesn't make any difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "It doesn't make any difference" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses the idea that something does not have any impact or influence.


Passage number 481.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Very little.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement as it states a fact or opinion without presenting any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 482.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. So why spend any time on it. Infact, the advantage of knocking off the halves is that it looks lessprecise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence simply states a perceived advantage of knocking off the halves.


Passage number 483.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You get round numbers; that is preciselyright.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 484.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information or statement about contention or disagreement involving VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.


Passage number 485.
 People who know what we're doing--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you want to knock off the halves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
