{"2013FOMC20130130meeting.txt": [" MS. PIANALTO.  Simon, I have a question about the expectations for the path of the 10-year Treasury rate over the next few years.  It appears from the 10-year Treasury forecast on page 95 of Tealbook, Book A, that the Board staff is predicting a distinctly steeper yield curve than the Blue Chip consensus over the forecast horizon.  For example, at the end of 2014, the Tealbook has the 10-year Treasury a bit below 3\u00bd percent, while the Blue Chip has it slightly above 2\u00bd percent, which leaves a difference of about 75 basis points at the end of 2014.  Does the Desk have any insights as to whether market participants are more in the Blue Chip forecast camp.  And, if the yield curve does steepen more along the lines that the Board\u2019s staff is forecasting, do you see any financial stability issues arising from such a sharp and unanticipated climb in that 10-year Treasury", " MR. POTTER.  The Blue Chip economists and the Blue Chip financial are a little bit more sanguine on the future path of the 10-year compared with where the Tealbook is.  I won\u2019t speak for the Tealbook, but I believe they are taking into account the term premium and where short rates will be; and that is a rigorous modeling exercise.  I am not quite sure how the people who contribute to the panel derive theirs; they might have lots of different considerations.  In talking to market participants who are not forecasters, you do see rising concerns, as we have for the last four years, that rates will be moving up and will lead to financial stability issues.  I would say it is a little bit more intense this year\u2014I don\u2019t know if Bill would probably agree with me. However, this year there is some feeling that money will be moving into the stock market and that the kinds of risks that are out there don\u2019t seem as salient as they have more recently, which seems a more positive story.  We haven\u2019t heard any compelling financial stability issues or problems that would come right now from a mild increase in interest rates.  However, for a sharp one, I think there is a lot of uncertainty out there because we have had low rates for such a long time, so just the fear from that might cause some disruptions", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman, a two-hander", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  My view would be that the market doesn\u2019t have a huge vulnerability to an increase in long-term rates, but the risk of a big increase in long-term rates is probably considerably higher than normal.  It\u2019s more a fear about the big increase as opposed to the fact that people have particular vulnerabilities to long-term rates going up", " MR. PLOSSER.  I have a question.  At the last meeting in December, we switched our forward guidance from dates to economic-state-contingent policies.  And it seems to me that we ought to try to think hard\u2014and I am going to talk a little bit about this in the SEP discussion tomorrow\u2014about not using questions or data that focus on the dates and try to move our presentations of both data and questions toward what we want them to focus on, which is economic conditions.  With that in mind, it seems like question 11 on the dealer survey focuses on when they think liftoff is going to be.  So it gets the dealers thinking about dates instead of economic conditions.  My question for the folks on the Desk would be, as you form these questions, does it make sense to reconsider how we are asking them and what questions we are asking in order to get things aligned with the way we are trying to conduct policy", " MR. POTTER.  That is a really crucial issue that we think through, and we don\u2019t want to ever signal anything with the survey.  We did ask an extensive question on the economic thresholds, and we learned there that the most likely economic situation when the fed funds liftoff happens is around 2 percent for the PCE inflation rate and around 6\u00bd percent for unemployment.  We investigated a little bit whether people interpret it as a threshold or a trigger.  They definitely, on average, seem to interpret it as a threshold.  However, you get some dealers who have quite different views about how we will react.  One dealer, despite being questioned many times, really thought the first liftoff would occur at 5 percent for the unemployment rate, basically independent from inflation, and thought that the participation rate was a driver there.  What is in chart 11, I think, captures some of that nuance.  So as an unconditional distribution, in that sense, I think it is useful for us.  Plus, we can use it as a metric to compare with previous meetings.  But when it comes to the asset purchases, I think one thing we could do is ask a probability distribution question that doesn\u2019t have the end of the year in it.  Using the end of the year, we thought, was reasonably neutral, but one could try to redo that.  Most of the questions do not have specific dates in them", " MR. BULLARD.  The United Kingdom", " MS. WILSON.  Some of that is cyclical.  In other words, we don\u2019t expect that to last; going forward, we expect that to improve somewhat.  In recessions, especially severe recessions, you see some decline in potential output related to capital deepening and a big pullback in investment.  That has lasted a lot longer and been a lot deeper than we had anticipated", " MR. BULLARD.  I see.  But you didn\u2019t have an independent measure of financial crisis entered into this.  It\u2019s just the severity of the recession", " MS. WILSON.  If I include a financial-crisis variable, it shows up as insignificant, and in some cases with a positive coefficient\u2014that is, both with the wrong sign and insignificant.  Even if I just run a regression in which I have recovery level, and I just put a financial-crisis dummy in, it doesn\u2019t show up as significant", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Employment growth has increased in most of our states and industries.  While uncertainty about fiscal and regulatory policy has tempered hiring decisions, these effects have been more than offset by relatively positive expectations about future sales and profitability.  For the District as a whole, growth reflects strong auto sales and a rebound in residential and commercial real estate markets.  Commercial construction activity, in particular, outpaced the nation throughout the fourth quarter of last year.  Vacancy rates have continued to fall, with notable improvements in sales, absorption, and rents.  In the ag sector, despite the severe drought, farm incomes are near historical highs, thanks in part to record crop insurance payments.  The volume of land sales remains exceptionally high, and prices continue to rise.  Looking ahead, livestock operators will likely see rising incomes, while crop producers face declines.  With grain stocks at historical lows, ag commodity markets are likely to be volatile.  A soft spot in the District is manufacturing.  After falling throughout the fourth quarter of last year, manufacturing activity contracted modestly again in January, but production expectations remain relatively optimistic for the months ahead.  Energy and consumer discretionary spending also softened\u2014energy as a result of the relatively low domestic prices, and consumer spending particularly in the areas of leisure and hospitality. For the national economy, I continue to see economic growth at a moderate pace, and my outlook for the medium term is largely unchanged.  I\u2019ve been particularly encouraged by the improvement in the housing market and how it has surprised to the upside.  Looking back at the first quarter of last year, the median estimate from the Survey of Professional Forecasters called for \u00bd percent decline in house prices for 2012.  The forecast was based on the Case-Shiller 20-City Composite Index that now looks likely to come in about 5 percent above its year-ago level.  So it is encouraging to see that home prices have risen substantially more than anticipated.  Likewise, residential construction activity has exceeded expectations.  In terms of the labor market, I think we\u2019ve been seeing some notable improvements.  The three-month average change in private nonfarm employment is 181,000, which is a pace consistent with a steadily declining unemployment rate.  And although volatile, initial claims for unemployment insurance are also at their lowest level in almost five years.  The unemployment rate, I would note, has also fallen faster than many expected. Despite the improvements in housing and labor markets, the pace of real GDP growth remains slow.  Although much of the weakness in the fourth quarter last year and the first quarter this year appears to be transitory, I am not expecting much above 2 percent growth for this year.  The Board staff\u2019s memo on reasons for the weaker-than-expected recovery supports my own sense of things, as it emphasizes the surprisingly slow pace attributed to lower-than-expected growth in potential output.  So the combination of these factors suggests to me that we should anticipate seeing improving growth ahead but also that we will need to be cautious about attempting to push the economy back to its pre-crisis trend. Inflation is likely to remain below 2 percent over the near term, but with open-ended asset purchases at their current level and a zero funds rate well into 2015, I would expect inflation to rise above 2 percent in the medium term.  And while longer-term inflation expectations are currently anchored, I would note that a tradable measure of the five-year, five-year ahead level of breakeven inflation remains about 30 basis points above its level prior to the September FOMC meeting, and at the upper end of its historical range.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The major challenge I see ahead for us is how to stop buying assets when the time comes, and by that I mean, how to communicate about it and how to rationalize it to ourselves and the public.  Unlike our other asset purchase programs, this one is open ended, so it won\u2019t end itself and we don\u2019t have any precedents to fall back on.  So I think it is worthwhile giving this some thought and discussion as we go forward, even if we don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to face this issue.  In our statement, paragraph 4 spells out three considerations that could justify ending our asset purchases.  First, obviously, is a substantial improvement in labor market conditions, and I anticipate robust discussion in future meetings about whether observed improvement in labor market conditions has been substantial enough to warrant the end of purchases.  One problem we could face, as has been pointed out before yesterday and today, is that we get conflicting signals from unemployment and employment growth.  In that connection, I\u2019m struck by the charts in Part A of the Tealbook that suggest to me that the staff\u2019s unemployment rate forecast has improved in the last three meetings almost entirely because of reductions in their forecast of labor force participation.  And I agree with President Lockhart that if the unemployment rate were to fall, but without a substantial increase in employment growth, we\u2019d be harder pressed to justify citing labor market conditions.  In that regard, I think our understanding of trend versus cycle in labor force participation is a bit murky at this point.  So I believe future research on labor force participation in the months ahead would be useful.  Apart from labor market conditions, we can invoke the efficacy and costs clause of paragraph 4.  I think that it makes abundant sense\u2014as you have directed, Mr. Chairman\u2014for us to spend more time discussing these in upcoming meetings.  An expanded record of those discussions in the minutes can help prepare the public for ending the purchases when the time comes. I recognize that the staff will be preparing memos for the next meeting.  I\u2019m looking forward to some more full discussion there.  But in the meantime, I\u2019ll make a couple of observations.  First, I\u2019ll just say that, to me, the most obvious class of costs associated with our asset purchase program involves the implications for the exit process.  And on this, I\u2019d note that our official pronouncements in the past have been resolutely confident about our capacity to withdraw monetary stimulus when the time comes in a way that prevents an increase in inflation.  But if we keep going, at some point, our balance sheet is going to become so large that the consequences of small errors in the pace and timing of tightening become quite significant.  So I think it would be useful for us to acknowledge publicly\u2014and for you to acknowledge in your press conference, Mr. Chairman\u2014that one of the potential costs of future asset purchases is that further expansions of our balance sheet raise the risk of compromising our capacity to withdraw stimulus in a timely way.  Concerning efficacy, I think it would also be helpful to acknowledge publicly\u2014as you did in your last press conference, Mr. Chairman\u2014the relatively humble state of our understanding of the effects of our asset purchases.  The theoretical accounts we have of how our asset purchases affect real activity have always faced some serious challenges.  For example, the limited arbitrage assumptions underlying some accounts are hard to reconcile with the empirical observation that apparently a huge range of investors appear to be capable of operating in virtually any segment of the U.S. Treasury market.  I\u2019ll also mention that Governor Stein has made the useful point\u2014it was enlightening to me\u2014that even if our purchases drive long-term yields below the expected sequence of short-term yields, it may not have much of an effect on business investment.  And what I\u2019ll call the strong form of the Stein critique says that the sequence of expected short-term yields will be the relevant hurdle rate for a firm\u2019s physical investment opportunities, even if the firm is capable of borrowing at a lower long-term yield, because the sequence of short rates represents an investment option always available to them, even if their longer-term cost of funding is lower.  I think this is worth taking seriously, because it would imply that our asset purchases may be having little effect on firms\u2019 investment, even if we can lower long-term yields.  And more broadly, I believe it would be useful to back away from resolute certainty about our purchases having a discernible effect on economic growth right now. Concerning the statement language, I support \u201csuggests\u201d and \u201cpaused,\u201d I\u2019m against \u201cfiscal issues,\u201d and I support President Lockhart\u2019s suggestions about deleting \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201cas always.\u201d  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, did I understand you to say that the unemployment improvements were mostly on the participation side", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B today.  As I indicated in yesterday\u2019s go-round, I continue to see gradual improvement in the economy and labor markets, and I see inflation remaining close to our longer-term objective of 2 percent.  Our previous asset purchase programs have almost surely contributed to the improved outlook for economic activity, and up to this point, at least, the associated risks appear manageable.  Moreover, as was discussed yesterday, the unemployment rate has declined somewhat faster than most of us had anticipated last fall, and the staff\u2019s estimate of the GDP gap has narrowed.  The cumulative effect of these developments heightens my interest in evaluating the benefits and costs of additional asset purchases.  I have growing concerns that additional asset purchases will not have an appreciable effect on real economic activity and that the costs and risks associated with a sizable further expansion of our balance sheet are likely to outweigh the benefits.  I\u2019ve been concerned for some time now that our asset purchases could be creating undue risks for private investors, for financial firms, and for us.  These risks are greater, it seems to me, in the low interest rate environment, which we expect to last for quite a while longer, and these risks could compromise financial stability, market functioning, and our ability to exit in a safe and timely manner. The Tealbook discussion of the case for alternative C provides an excellent characterization of my views about the risks.  Because we\u2019re planning to have a thorough discussion of the risks and benefits at our March meeting, I\u2019d like to suggest a few risks that I think are worth considering.  First, some of my contacts tell me that financial institutions and investors are prepared to sell assets very quickly and get the first-mover advantage in a rising interest rate environment.  So I\u2019d like us to explore how well prepared banks and other financial companies are for a rise in interest rates and how robust the financial system is likely to be.  Second, I\u2019d like to know whether we see evidence that financial institutions are taking on undue leverage and credit risk to compensate for lower-than-expected returns on fixed-income assets.  And, finally, I\u2019d like us to have a more complete picture of how our enormous presence in the agency MBS market might affect the housing market when the time comes to implement our exit strategy and we begin to unwind our MBS position.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support alternative B.  Unlike the Tealbook assumption, I expect that we will need to continue our Treasury and MBS purchases at the current pace for some time to come, certainly past the middle of this year.  In thinking about this, I\u2019d like to refer to alternative A in the chart on page 2 of Bill\u2019s handout.  If you look at alternative A, which is assumed to have the purchases going out further, and if you look just at inflation and ignore for the moment unemployment, alternative A actually does a better job over the next decade of hitting the 2 percent inflation target, on average, than alternative B or C.  So I feel that from a point of view of trying to achieve even just our inflation objective, continuing these purchases longer is right to do.  Importantly, our policies have contributed vitally to the current historically low levels of long-term mortgage, auto loan, and other interest rates, which are helping the economy gain traction.  And I\u2019d like to say that I agree with everything President Rosengren said earlier in this go-round. As I mentioned yesterday, low rates are energizing a positive feedback loop in residential and commercial real estate, which is providing critical impetus for a faster recovery.  If we were to end our asset purchases prematurely, we could disrupt this progress.  Not only would that impede economic revival, but it would also put further downward pressure on inflation, which has been running persistently below our 2 percent objective.  The Tealbook box on Japan provides a sobering reminder of the potential long-term costs of timid and self-doubting monetary policy.  In response to persistent deflation and economic stagnation, the Bank of Japan announced a series of measures in the past that proved inadequate to deliver their inflation objective or faster growth.  Like Sisyphus trying to roll a bolder up a hill, the Bank of Japan\u2019s halfhearted efforts\u2014too little, too late\u2014failed to make lasting progress.  The lesson for us is clear:  Despite the uncertain costs and benefits of LSAPs, doing too little poses as great a risk as doing too much. With regard to the statement language in paragraph 2, I would omit the bracketed phrase regarding fiscal issues.  I would also omit the word \u201csignificant\u201d as a modifier of \u201cdownside risks.\u201d  The risks are still to the downside, but global and domestic strains have unquestionably eased notably since December.  I would not make the change recommended by President Lockhart regarding paragraph 4; I would leave it as is.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  I\u2019d raise one other thing: the second sentence does not say anything about inflation.  It says that \u201ceconomic growth will proceed at a moderate pace\u201d and that the unemployment rate will get to levels we think is consistent with our dual mandate.  By not saying anything about inflation, the implication is that this may come at the cost of inflation being not consistent with our dual mandate.  I doubt markets have picked up on that, but, as a matter of grammar\u2014and we haven\u2019t been scrupulous about this in other places\u2014I would just point out that it\u2019s not crystal clear", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like others, it seems clear to me that policy will need to remain accommodative for some time to encourage and support the projected pace of economic growth and employment as various sectors complete the deleveraging process and demand returns to more normal levels.  Our current policy, of course, goes well beyond accommodative and continues to provide an unprecedented level of easing, with open-ended asset purchases and zero interest rates well into the future.  After effectively deploying asset purchases during the crisis to arrest deflationary pressures and stabilize markets, we are now continuing asset purchases to accelerate the recovery and bring down unemployment faster to achieve our objectives.  My concerns with this policy are certainly not with its intentions and desired outcomes, but with the efficacy with which asset purchases can in fact accelerate the decline in the unemployment rate.  My concerns remain focused on the unintended consequences or possible side effects associated with this extraordinary level of accommodation in a growing economy.  Certainly, our asset purchases have contributed to some degree to the housing market recovery, although they occurred relatively late in the year, and it\u2019s not clear that it\u2019s a primary factor behind the better-than-expected improvement.  We\u2019ve seen lower secondary mortgage rates, although those rates have backed up substantially over the past month.  Primary mortgage rates also fell a bit after the September meeting but have risen recently.  I continue to be concerned about the number of potential costs of our current purchase program, such as market functioning, complicated exit, balance sheet normalization, financial imbalances, and the potential for higher longer-term inflation expectations.  I, too, look forward to discussing these issues in March and hope we can clarify the efficacy and costs of this policy, including the points that President Rosengren made about the cost of prolonged high unemployment. I appreciate that these risks are particularly difficult to quantify today and, in some cases, to describe with any precision.  They are not staring us in the face today, and it may be well into the future before we realize them.  And the ability to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy search for yield is most challenging.  One issue that does concern me, though, is the emerging shift in strategy by individual and institutional savers, banks, insurance companies, and pension funds to recast their portfolios and products as the near-zero-rate environment becomes untenable for safe returns.  Examiner findings in my own region suggest that banks are beginning to extend the duration of their portfolios, which will make it more challenging for them to adjust when rates begin to normalize.  Other institutions and investors are also placing more emphasis on strategies that entail greater risk, moving away from traditional, investment-grade products and toward riskier lending or equities.  Whether this increased risk proves healthy and supportive of economic activity, only time will judge.  However, having spent a fair part of my Fed career examining banks, I know how difficult it is to identify the tipping point in real time when a healthy shift toward risk becomes excessive and potentially damaging.  Our actions today contemplate continuing a policy that I believe is too accommodative and poses more risks than benefit in achieving our objectives for sustainable economic growth.  The recovery is continuing, and we are making slow progress toward our objectives.  As we see the recovery take hold, I am concerned that the continued high level of monetary accommodation proposed in alternative B increases the risk of future economic and financial imbalances and, over time, could cause an increase in long-term inflation expectations. I, too, would suggest keeping the language as is in alternative B, and I would support President Lockhart\u2019s suggestion on the word \u201csignificant", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B, and I consider it appropriate at this meeting to make only modest changes to the statement.  In paragraph 2, I do very much like the shift from the negative rationale for our purchases\u2014namely, that without them, economic growth might not be strong enough to see improvement in the labor market\u2014to the more positive rationale that with the program we do expect to see gradual improvement.  My preference would be not to add the bracketed clause in this paragraph.  Although there certainly remain large unresolved fiscal issues, it seems problematic to me to insert this clause now, just four weeks after agreement was reached on tax issues and concerns about the debt ceiling are receding.  I could support the suggestion of removing the word \u201csignificant\u201d as well in this sentence. We\u2019ve linked the pace and duration of asset purchases to the goal of a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  I certainly don\u2019t think that criterion has been met.  The unemployment rate has declined a bit, but with the moderate economic growth the Tealbook forecasts, there is not yet an expectation of significant improvement over the coming year.  My own outlook is similar to the Tealbook\u2019s, so I do not now anticipate sufficient progress in the labor market to terminate this program for this reason before the end of 2013, and I, too, envision total purchases that will come closer to alternative A than alternative B.  Of course, I intend to keep reevaluating the outlook. With respect to the efficacy of our asset purchases, I see them as definitely having lowered primary mortgage rates, which is contributing to a surge in refinancing and is aiding recovery of the housing market.  And I agree with the comments of Presidents Williams and Rosengren and others about the broader beneficial effects.  Because the minutes surprised markets, the reaction also provides something of a read on the program\u2019s efficacy, at least in terms of its impact on asset prices.  The most recent Desk survey suggests that there was only a modest shift in market expectations concerning the ultimate size of the program.  We would not have expected a major market response, but key financial variables did move in a manner consistent with a small tightening of policy.  During the two hours subsequent to the minutes\u2019 publication, yields on 10-year Treasuries moved up about 5 basis points, the S&P 500 declined about \u00bd percent, and the dollar appreciated three-tenths of 1 percent versus the yen and four-tenths versus the euro.  Because the benefits of our asset purchases come about largely through the transmission to asset prices, and from there to the real economy, for what it\u2019s worth, this bit of event-study evidence is consistent with past assessments of their likely benefits. With respect to the costs of our asset purchases, they do not seem to be impeding the functioning of financial markets.  With respect to risks, we are seeing some increased risk-taking in financial markets, although I also remind myself that within limits, a greater willingness to bear risk is something we want in order to promote the recovery.  As Governor Stein noted yesterday, interest rate volatility has declined, and there are reports of a rise in the use of leverage.  I, too, worry that investors may resort to strategies to enhance returns that could subject them to significant losses if interest rates were to rise sharply.  As Governor Stein discussed, if these investors are highly leveraged, this could create systemic risk.  A prolonged period of low interest rates may be spurring such behavior, along with a diminution of perceived tail risk, but I doubt that this is importantly attributable to our asset purchases per se.  We do need to watch these developments carefully; use our supervisory tools, such as stress tests; and consider what other tools we could deploy should we conclude that they pose a significant threat to financial stability.  But at the same time, we need to keep firmly in mind that there are large social costs and serious downside risks that would be associated with the failure of the economy to return toward maximum employment over the next few years or with a prolonged decline in inflation below our 2 percent objective.  And I certainly agree with Presidents Rosengren and Kocherlakota and others\u2014and with the remarks that you made yesterday, Mr. Chairman\u2014about the potential impact of such a prolonged period of slow recovery on the long-run potential of the economy. With respect to the potential for losses on our balance sheet and a possible suspension of remittances to the Treasury, I agree with the comment you just made\u2014we certainly need to communicate the possibility of such outcomes to the public soon and clearly.  At the same time, I would certainly emphasize the rationale for this program and its expected benefits.  I think the publication of the Carpenter et al. FEDS working paper is certainly a good step in this direction. Considering the federal budget situation overall, I believe and would forcefully argue that the program is strengthening, not weakening, federal finances by lowering the interest cost to the Treasury of new issues; by diminishing the potential for inflation to undershoot our target, which would result in an unanticipated redistribution from government to domestic and foreign holders of Treasury debt; and, of course, by strengthening the economy and thereby boosting tax revenue.  We would hardly be the first country to experience such losses in the conduct of monetary policy, and we can learn from other countries\u2019 experience.  The central banks of Switzerland, Chile, and Israel, for example, all have maintained their independence and the support of their governments and the public in spite of incurring losses in their conduct of monetary policy.  Importantly, these central banks were understood to be pursuing objectives in the national interest.  Even with negative capital, a central bank can continue to conduct policy successfully, except in very extreme cases. Overall, then, my assessment of the efficacy and costs of our asset purchases has not materially changed since we started the program in September.  I therefore think it\u2019s appropriate to leave the expression of our commitment in paragraph B(4) unchanged.  I consider it important for us to communicate more clearly to the public our assessments of the efficacy and costs of our asset purchases.  Should we at some point decide that we need to scale back these purchases, even though a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market has not yet materialized, I definitely think we will have to explain to the public why and how our assessment of efficacy and costs has changed, and a failure to do so would severely damage our credibility. Turning to forward guidance, I believe the market has responded well to the adoption of thresholds, although there is some confusion out there about whether 6\u00bd and 2\u00bd are thresholds or triggers.  I agree that it\u2019s appropriate to drop the calendar date today and allow the market to take over the job of judging when the thresholds may be reached.  I anticipate that we will be able to leave the forward guidance as is for quite some time.  Certainly, today, with the unemployment rate far above 6\u00bd percent, inflation expectations well anchored, and my forecast for inflation one to two years ahead running well below 2\u00bd percent, I consider the status quo appropriate", "   MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I have to return to our adoption of the consensus statement on policy yesterday.  I was happy to abstain without comment, but I was told after the meeting that that\u2019s an unacceptable way to proceed and I need to make a comment for the record.  So I\u2019m going to do that now.  First I would say that I admire the way that Narayana formulated his understanding of the statement yesterday in his comments, and I\u2019d be happy to embrace that or, for that matter, the speech of then Governor Bernanke to which Narayana alluded.  But nothing that has happened in the last year has changed my view that the document itself made vagueness a virtue to an excessive degree, and, ultimately, I don\u2019t think it has advanced the cause of achieving or communicating greater consensus in the policy views of the Committee as a whole.  But it certainly hasn\u2019t made things worse than they were before, so I\u2019m content to continue to abstain. Turning to monetary policy issues, I first want to make one point, which is not about the statement itself but refers to some earlier comments.  There were a few people who said earlier that we shouldn\u2019t identify potential costs to the balance sheet position of the Fed that mean we would not be paying any remittances to Treasury, because that would suggest that we wouldn\u2019t any longer have the LSAP as a policy measure.  To be fair to our colleagues\u2014including Betsy, who just did this\u2014I don\u2019t think what they\u2019ve done is to say there\u2019s some absolute level beyond which, under any circumstances, they wouldn\u2019t be willing to go.  They have identified the political costs, as Betsy articulated them, as a cost to be taken into account.  But she did say that if there were more dire economic circumstances, she might be willing to do more, and I presume the reason for that is, at that point, her judgment of the balance of benefits and costs would have changed.  So, Jeff, I don\u2019t think anybody is suggesting that that issue is, in and of itself, dispositive.  I think it\u2019s just a matter of people differently valuing costs and benefits. Turning now to the monetary policy action itself, I was struck by what Narayana said in his intervention, because it returned to a theme that I at times have addressed and that Bill Dudley has at times addressed, which is the desirability of thinking forward several meetings, or part of the year, and trying to, in a strategic fashion, think through how we\u2019re going to act and communicate our actions.  Some of you may recall that even though I was obviously in favor of greater accommodation in the 2009\u201310 period, I was cautioning against what I then characterized as the impulse to have to throw a maiden over the cliff to a dragon in every meeting, just to be perceived as having done something.  And I thought what Narayana did a little while ago was to present a possible strategic approach that couples a shift in LSAP policy with a complementary change in the thresholds.  Now, Narayana may well favor the change in the thresholds even without the LSAP policy, but the point is that he was trying to think of them together and think of how we\u2019re going to move over the course of the next several meetings.  And I think that strategic perspective is really important for us to maintain when we\u2019ve got a bunch of novel types of actions, including now both the thresholds and the open-ended LSAPs, on the table.  That strategic perspective is very much worth discussing in March and June\u2014and thereafter, if necessary.  For today, I think it counsels minimal changes in the statement, certainly in the policy portions of the statement.  Now is not the time, in my view, to move even incrementally on policy, largely because of the overinterpretive propensities of the folks out there who\u2019ll be on CNBC as soon as the statement is released this afternoon and who will follow on for the next couple of days.  As I think I\u2019ve said before, these guys make Kremlin watchers look as though they just weren\u2019t paying attention.  And they just do overinterpret any little shifts in language to reflect more of a policy change than we certainly intend. Paragraph 4 could certainly have been drafted differently.  I, frankly, was a bit surprised back in September that some people didn\u2019t ask for changes in the drafting of it, but it became what it is.  And I believe it would be ill advised at this juncture to change it, because people will read into it a shift in policy that I don\u2019t think reflects the view of this Committee today.  So I wouldn\u2019t make any changes in paragraph 4, even though I fully anticipate a discussion of these kinds of changes and issues in March and June.  Of course, paragraphs 1 and 2, almost by necessity, change every meeting because they\u2019re supposed to be retrospective and prospective.  Mr. Chairman, to my memory, nobody has commented on the blue language in paragraph 1", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I support alternative B.  I feel strongly that we should make very few changes to the statement at this meeting.  We don\u2019t want to inadvertently imply any change in our policy stance or thinking.  The fact is, we don\u2019t really know much more than we knew at the December meeting in terms of the likely near-term trajectory of the economy.  I think making changes now might signal lack of resolve and could undo some of the improvement in financial conditions that we\u2019ve seen and that we are, in fact, seeking.  So I would not take out the \u201cas always\u201d in paragraph 4.  Also, I would not add the reference to \u201cfiscal issues\u201d in paragraph 2; adding the \u201cfiscal issues\u201d is odd timing because we didn\u2019t add it when we were staring at the fiscal cliff.  To add it now seems inappropriate to me.  On paragraph 1, I generally agree with Governor Tarullo, but I come out in a very different place in terms of those two words.  I actually favor \u201csuggests\u201d and \u201cslows.\u201d The reason is that while I understand the reasons for wanting to do \u201cindicates\u201d and \u201cpaused,\u201d to me, that puts way too much weight on a single indicator:  the fourth-quarter preliminary GDP number, which was minus 0.1 percent.  It\u2019s going to be revised, and GDP is the average of a quarter over the average of the previous quarter.  The reality is, Hurricane Sandy came along and disrupted activity in late October and early November.  I think most of the data show that the economy probably was growing in the rest of November and December.  So I don\u2019t want to put too much weight on the fourth-quarter GDP numbers.  I would prefer \u201csuggests\u201d and \u201cslows\u201d\u2014\u201csuggests,\u201d because all of these data are revised", " MR. TARULLO.  But what you just said would have suggested a pause early in the quarter and the beginning of an acceleration.  \u201cSlowed\u201d seems to indicate a deceleration", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But for completeness, I just wanted to give an alternative perspective. Now I want to say something more significant.  In our evaluation of our asset purchase program, I think that we really do need to reevaluate our June 2011 exit principles.  I would agree with Governor Raskin on this.  I believe we could alter the principles in a way that would potentially enable us to have more monetary policy accommodation at a given balance sheet size, that we could alter them in a way that could lower the risk of a future interest rate spike that could threaten financial stability, and that we could alter them in a way that reduced the risk of future balance sheet losses.  The way I started to think about this conceptually is that we wrote down those exit principles a long time ago in a very different set of circumstances.  We need to see now if those exit principles still put us at the efficient frontier in terms of these tradeoffs that we\u2019re making across all of these different variables.  Let me give you some examples of what I have in mind.  For example, we might decide not to sell the agency MBS.  If we announced that change, it would have a number of potential benefits.  One, it would make policy more stimulative because our balance sheet would be bigger for longer.  It would reduce the risk of financial stability disruption of a sharp rise in mortgage rates or a negative effect to market functioning in the agency MBS market.  It would also reduce the risk of negative net income and the need to put a deferred asset on our balance sheet.  So, eliminating the agency MBS sales could actually be an improvement in a whole bunch of different dimensions, and I think we need to consider it. That\u2019s a very simple one, but you could argue that our considerations could take us even further in this direction.  You might want to commit to keep our balance sheet fixed in size for some period of time, or you might want to peg the balance sheet to a given fixed duration.  If we really are saying that there are limits to how far we want to go in terms of the size of our Treasury asset purchases, then maybe we have to think about other ways to make policy more stimulative.  I think we\u2019re on a road that has two tracks.  On one track the economy starts to show improvement in the first half of the year, and then on that track, it\u2019s pretty simple to know what to do.  We start to taper purchases, and the tapering actually sends a very positive message that we\u2019re becoming more confident about the economic outlook, so therefore we can purchase less Treasuries.  That\u2019s a very easy road.  The road I think we need to prepare for, though, is the one on which the economy doesn\u2019t show improvement, and we become increasingly uncomfortable with continuing to expand the balance sheet without limits.  If that were the case, we need to think about what we would do to both dial back the purchases at some point in time and replace them with something else that would make it clear that we weren\u2019t backing away from our commitment to achieve our dual mandate objectives.  I hope that in March we could talk about the exit principles as part of this discussion, because I really don\u2019t think those exit principles are anywhere close to the efficient frontier in terms of where we are today regarding what we\u2019re trying to accomplish with all of these different constraints that we face.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It does say \u201cinformation received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December,\u201d and so there\u2019s a lot of other input besides just the GDP numbers.  All right.  I think we have made an important decision.  \u201cSuggests\u201d and\u2014so we\u2019re going blue, is that what we\u2019re doing.  All blue.  Excellent.  All right. That being resolved, the more substantive question\u2014and I\u2019ll address everything that was raised\u2014was on the risk statement.  I explained the reason for possibly including \u201cunresolved fiscal issues\u201d at this point, but most people felt this was the wrong time to do it or that we missed our chance, if we were going to do it.  So I accept that.  And a lot of people suggested removing \u201csignificant\u201d before \u201cdownside risks.\u201d  I think the thrust of the meeting was consistent with that.  So, notwithstanding an aversion to change, I guess I would agree with that.  Let\u2019s eliminate \u201csignificant\u201d and eliminate the bracketed language about fiscal issues", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  I think there was a clear sense of the Committee that the risks were less skewed to the downside\u2014a number of people said they were closer to balanced at this point.  Is that okay.  Is there any objection", " MR. FISHER.  Can I ask a question, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  How do you think the market would react to us no longer providing this information that we were providing in the past.  There\u2019s a path-dependency issue here, I think", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I take your point about the date-based guidance, but I guess I have a problem with imagining us giving them nothing, just taking this away and having it replaced with nothing.  That seems really hard for me", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I found President Kocherlakota\u2019s comments intriguing.  If we were to start from scratch right now, we\u2019d probably pick a different set of charts than what we have.  And so I think that highlights the challenge:  At a time when the strategies we\u2019re following are evolving relatively quickly, locking ourselves down on too many variables may not make sense.  While I agree with President Kocherlakota\u2019s comment, I also agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that taking away particularly the information that people outside of this room find most useful\u2014which is, when is the fed funds rate going to go up.\u2014would be a fairly difficult thing to do.  I view it as a constrained optimization problem.  And as a constrained optimization problem, what I take from that is a word of caution about how quickly we add more things.  But I don\u2019t know that we can take too many things away from what we\u2019ve already provided.  With that caveat, let me just briefly go through each of the five questions.  I would highlight that with less than half of the group, we don\u2019t have consensus on any one of the questions at this point.  I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll help much with that.  For question 1, I think the median should be provided for the SEP for all participants.  It may be less critical to show the median for some of the subgroups, as, I believe, the memo highlighted.  For question 2, I think it is important for our communication to clearly convey the likely policy path if the economy evolves as we expect.  This is best summarized by the assessment of voters supporting the policy decision.  So, given that we\u2019re showing the interest rates, I would make the distinction.  For question 3, fan charts are popular with economists but seem like an awkward way to discuss policy with the public.  If we presented fan charts, how much of the discussion of those charts is likely in press conferences or speeches made by participants.  I frequently do PowerPoint slides.  I\u2019ve never used a PowerPoint slide that had fan charts in it for the general public.  I could do it for economists, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s that useful for the general public at large.  For question 4, I do not believe an SEP fan chart for the federal funds rate would be particularly useful.  And for question 5, we\u2019ve been trying to focus our statement more on economic outcomes.  The idea of an open-ended quantitative easing, and then providing a range of forecasts of balance sheet size, will get everyone, once again, to focus on the size of the purchases and calendar dates.  So rather than focus on size, we should try to better explain what we mean by substantial improvement in labor markets and to provide a more detailed description of the costs and benefits of asset purchases and how we think those costs and benefits could potentially change over time.  That\u2019s the purpose of the March meeting, but I don\u2019t think that transparency on something that, at this point, we don\u2019t have much of an agreed framework on makes much sense.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I\u2019m going to agree with everyone here, and therefore I agree with no one.  I appreciate the staff memo and the communications subcommittee work concerning possible changes to the SEP.  In general, I did not see very much here that I thought would improve the SEP report.  I think there is considerable risk that tinkering further with the SEP will simply muddy the waters.  So, in that sense, I agree with President Lockhart\u2019s characterization of what we need to do here\u2014just be less ambitious for what we can get out of the SEP. I do support one aspect of the possible changes\u2014namely, the fan charts for the forecasts.  I would support this only if we use historical forecast errors.  In this sense, I\u2019m agreeing with President Lacker.  On this dimension, in contrast to what others have said here, the public needs to be continually reminded of the amount of uncertainty around macroeconomic forecasting.  I don\u2019t think you can do enough reminding of the public about how much uncertainty is out there.  And so every opportunity that we have, it needs to be emphasized over and over again that lots of things can happen, that lots of things do happen.  If you just look at history, you\u2019ll understand that.  I think that that\u2019s an important element, and therefore I would support more representation of uncertainty in the SEPs via historical forecast errors. I also support President Plosser\u2019s and President Kocherlakota\u2019s comments to the effect that we should deemphasize the liftoff aspects of the SEP.  I see this aspect as counterproductive because, again, anytime you\u2019re talking about the date of liftoff, you\u2019re risking the idea that you\u2019re sending this pessimistic signal that you think the economy is going to be bad far out into the future, rather than just saying, \u201cWell, we\u2019re hoping for better economic outcomes, and when we see those better economic outcomes, and not before, we will think about tightening policy.\u201d  So I think that in the spirit of getting rid of that pessimistic signal, I would want to deemphasize the liftoff date aspects of the SEP. The general difficulty with the SEP is very apparent.  It is an aggregation problem across views that are not very amenable to aggregation.  In this sense, I agree with what President Evans was just saying.  I continue to think that the longer-run solution here is to produce a monetary policy report, which is essentially a staff forecast blessed by the Chairman.  The embedded monetary policy assumption should be the one assumed by financial markets at the time of the forecast.  The Chairman is naturally going to choose a forecast in the middle of the Committee views.  Committee members would then be free to say which aspects of the forecast they agree with and which aspects with which they find themselves disagreeing.  In my view, this method would provide considerably better communication to the private sector.  Again, using President Lacker\u2019s characterization, we want to paint a picture of the future, and, at least in general terms, describe what the Committee is thinking about and what the Committee envisions.  And I think that something like the process I just outlined would do that most effectively. On giving forward guidance on the balance sheet, I especially wish to avoid anything that would interfere with the open-ended, state-contingent nature of the current policy, and in this sense, I agree with President Rosengren.  Giving an indication of the total amount of purchases expected would, in my opinion, be a step backward in this regard because it would deemphasize the state-contingent approach. On voters versus nonvoters, I don\u2019t have a strong opinion, but I will say this:  What we are doing a lot here around this table is taking policy actions that include commitments over long horizons, such as several years.  If we go in the direction of distinguishing voters and nonvoters, then I think logic requires that the dots reflect those who are going to be voting in that particular year.  If we do not do this, then markets are naturally going to ask a lot of questions about, \u201cWell, what have you got highlighted here.  And what about the out years in which there might be more action on the policy front\u2014who\u2019s going to be voting at that time.\u201d  So I want to stress a sentence I wrote down here:  Everyone is a voter over the time horizons we\u2019re talking about here.  We\u2019ve gotten away from the way this Committee used to operate, with a meeting-by-meeting approach to monetary policy decisions, when we just did something that day and didn\u2019t worry too much about the full continuity of the policy.  And one of the hallmarks, I would say, of the Bernanke era is to take the full time path into consideration because that\u2019s an important consideration in policy.  If we do that, then I think the whole Committee is involved in that process. Finally, I agree with the intriguing comments of President Kocherlakota that we may just want to take the projections about future policy variables out of the SEP entirely.  I do think it has put us in perhaps more of a box than we would like, and maybe it\u2019s not served the purposes that we originally intended.  It could be done if markets are prepared ahead of time, and I don\u2019t really see that as being the biggest problem.  If we think that\u2019s a better way to communicate, then that\u2019s the way we should go.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Eric, I don\u2019t think much has been clarified since your intervention, and so my conclusion here is that it doesn\u2019t feel to me as though there\u2019s much of a basis for making any changes beyond, possibly, one of the median projection changes, at least at this moment.  So rather than go through all of the questions, let me just say a couple of things.  First, it\u2019s a little hard for me to believe I was once such an enthusiast about the SEP", "   MR. PLOSSER.  Can I interrupt"], "2013FOMC20130320meeting.txt": [" MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This, as you said, is not the place to have a discussion of the substantive recommendations, but I do have some concerns about some of the substantive recommendations, mostly springing from what I think might be a quite de facto differential application of them to people without personal staffs as opposed to people who do have personal staffs, which is a bit of a presidents/Governors distinction.  And so maybe there could be some forum or opportunity for an elaboration of some of those comments, whether in Janet\u2019s subcommittee or elsewhere", " MR. TARULLO.  \u2014but I guess I\u2019ll get explicit about it.  The issue is that, in short, when one is dealing with the press or a member of Congress or anybody outside the organization and one is staffed, the question becomes, who is the staff responsible to, and who are they supposed to be helping out.  And with the structure we\u2019ve got at the Board, we have a kind of collective staff.  A member of the Board of Governors does not have someone who is responsible for his or her position, in some sense, but also is interested in helping that individual communicate effectively his or her views, as opposed to the collective views of the Board.  It puts the collective staff in an awkward position because they have multiple loyalties, and I just think it\u2019s something that needs to be thought through a little bit in this context.  That was really the basis for my observation. I assume it\u2019s fine for John or Charlie or someone.  They\u2019ve got a staff who will keep them on the straight and narrow, on the one hand, but also they can have fair assurance that there aren\u2019t divided interests that somebody has to serve and that just put the staff in an awkward position", " MR. POTTER.  We thought of it ourselves.  Remember, it\u2019s without policymaker input", " MR. POTTER.  Yes", " MR. ROSENGREN.  My question is for Nellie as well.  I really enjoyed the discussion of agency REITs.  I thought it was a very nice discussion.  And I\u2019d like you to speculate a little bit about how what\u2019s happening with agency REITs interacts with monetary policy actions.  Let me tell you how I\u2019m thinking about it and see if it\u2019s consistent with the way you would think about it.  MBS purchases flatten the yield curve.  So that should make the carry trade less profitable.  If you stop MBS purchases, it would presumably steepen the yield curve relative to what it otherwise would be.  And to the extent that it also slows down the economy relative to what it otherwise would be, we reach 6\u00bd percent unemployment later.  So we would continue for longer our very short-term interest rates, which, in my mind, would increase the incentive for agency REIT expansion.  My question is, am I thinking about this right\u2014that actions that delay liftoff aggravate the concerns of the agency REITs", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019d like to change topics just a little bit from financial stability.  I want to thank the Board staff for addressing my question from the last meeting about the implications of the re-estimation of the output gap that they have been doing for the optimal control exercises.  I thought their results were very instructive, and I appreciate that.  My takeaway from those exercises, though, is that we must be cautious in using the optimal control paths depicted in the Tealbook as very precise guides to policy.  The paths are highly model-specific, which is why I\u2019ve always been interested in the robust rules literature.  Moreover, as the exercises illustrate, these optimal paths calculated in real time depend on lots of different factors.  Two of the important ones that I think the staff memo highlighted are the estimate of the output gap and also the projected trajectory of that gap.  And, of course, the projected trajectory of the gap is a feature of the model, the dynamics built into the model, and the forecast that comes out of the model.  So, all else being equal, I think, overestimating the gap would lead to policy being overaccommodative relative to what it otherwise would have been. What the staff exercises show\u2014and I believe the staff noted this\u2014is that the incorrect dynamics of the model or unforecastable future negative shocks cause the trajectory of the gap to be different from what they had thought it was going to be.  And that led to the conclusion in the memo that optimal policy should have been, perhaps, slightly tighter in the near term, but much looser for longer, given the real-time data we have seen.  So I think that when the gap gets revised or reality sets in, the optimal control path will be different.  But I think of those two effects as logically separable. The effects are well illustrated in the charts.  In hindsight\u2014for example, in 2010\u2014the Fed staff was projecting too large of an output gap.  But they were also forecasting that the gap would close much quicker than in fact it has ended up doing.  This means that the real-time optimal control path in early 2010, in hindsight, was perhaps too accommodative in the early trajectory, but it called for us to tighten sooner than we should have ex post as the data played out.  Similarly, in hindsight, at the beginning of 2012, the staff was projecting too large of an output gap.  But there has been little revision in the trajectory of the gap going forward, so it\u2019s about the same as it was.  What that means\u2014and it shows up in the graphs\u2014is that the real-time optimal control path in early 2012 called for a policy that was in fact too accommodative in 2013 relative to what we now think was optimal.  So I think those two examples illustrate the different effects that result from the trajectory versus the level of the output gap. The bottom line for me from this analysis is that when we view these optimal control exercises, we need to take into account the kinds of risks and uncertainties that we are facing.  It\u2019s not just about measurement of the gap, as the staff points out; it\u2019s also about how the forecast plays out.  One of the things that we face is making judgments as a Committee based on these forecasts and these optimal paths.  And so I\u2019m still quite interested, for example, in having the staff provide some measure of uncertainty or forecast error that feeds into these optimal control policies for us to think about.  Now, I realize that the reality is that those are likely to be quite large and maybe humbling, in some sense.  But I think the nature of that uncertainty, if it\u2019s reflected in some way in our discussions more explicitly, would allow the Committee to have different types of discussions instead of only focusing on these modal values that come out of the paths.  So I hope that the staff would continue to explore options or opportunities to give us more degrees of uncertainty about how these paths might look under different scenarios or forecast errors, if you will.  But again, I want to thank the staff for all of that work", " MR. FISHER.  And then lastly, with regard to Cyprus, you can\u2019t look at Cyprus without looking through the lens of organized Russian crime or corrupt Russian bureaucracy, including the president himself.  That will determine the outcome of the election.  I would suggest that", " MR. KAMIN.

Can I follow up on that, Mr. Chairman", "  REITS are required to pay out 90 to 95 percent of their\u2014 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  There\u2019s no buffer to support that day when things go in the other direction", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tenth District economy continued to grow since the last meeting, but at a slower pace than the nation.  The mandated federal spending cuts appear likely to hit our region harder, as the share of federal government spending grants in employment is larger than in the rest of the nation.  Based on our February manufacturing survey, concerns about these cuts already seem to be negatively affecting production in both defense and nondefense sectors.  The index declined moderately, in part because of bad weather and a continued modest decline in energy-related manufacturing.  Many contacts, however, indicated the recent changes in fiscal policy were having a negative impact on their businesses, including several producers of nondurable goods who noted a decline in consumer demand.  In general, the survey showed firms in a variety of industries are continuing to express caution about adding workers and taking on more debt.  However, housing activity in the region continued to grow strongly, and prices for single-family homes were up solidly from year-ago levels. Activity in Colorado is particularly strong, where house prices are up over 10 percent from year-ago levels.  Office absorption in the region also continues to rise.  Farmland prices continue to rise rapidly despite a greater supply of land coming to auction last year.  Because of anticipated year-end tax changes, prices for cropland increased another 25 percent from year-ago levels.  Agricultural commodity prices also remained high, boosting farm incomes.  Finally, in the energy sector, activity is shifting away from drilling and toward pipeline construction.  For example, drilling activity is expected to basically be flat in 2013, while pipeline construction is expected to more than triple in the year ahead. In terms of the national outlook, my forecast assumes that higher taxes from the fiscal cliff deal and full sequestration are likely to subtract from growth this year.  However, with continued growth in private demand and improving labor markets, I expect a moderate pace of growth over the next several years.  The continued improvement in the labor market is particularly encouraging, including its surprise to the upside, and housing markets continue to recover with higher home prices and housing starts. With the rise in residential construction activity and new single-family homes for sale near 50-year lows, there may be potential bottlenecks in certain sectors feeding into housing construction.  For example, one of my directors described the reduction in builders\u2019 ability to rapidly expand production of raw materials used for housing construction, such as lumber, because capacity was cut dramatically during and after the recession.  His assessment was that capacity in some of these sectors was unlikely to expand until the level of residential construction activity rises another 25 percent.  Until then, the expected price pressures would build for materials and inputs into housing construction.  Some lumber prices as well as building paper and board have increased about 30 percent over the past year.  These pressures and low inventory levels are likely to further support rising residential construction, construction employment, and home prices. Despite the improvements in housing and labor markets, I expect full sequestration and higher taxes will weigh on growth in 2013, and for that reason, I reduced my forecast for growth to 2 percent for this year.  I am concerned about the degree of fiscal tightening but do note that large-firm optimism, as noted in the Business Roundtable, as well as small-firm optimism from the NFIB, has rebounded despite the fiscal cliff deal and sequestration. I expect inflation to remain below 2 percent this year and then rise above 2 percent in the medium term given our current stance of policy.  While longer-term inflation expectations are currently anchored, I continue to watch the five-year, five-year-ahead level of breakeven inflation, which has averaged 2.8 percent since the September FOMC meeting, compared with 2.5 percent from January to September.  Thank you", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My views about the U.S. economy have not changed much since we last met.  I continue to expect that economic activity will improve gradually this year, supported, importantly, by accommodative monetary policy.  Like many of you, I have been encouraged by some of the spending and labor market indicators that we have received in the last several weeks, but I have not yet seen definitive indications that we have reached the stage of the recovery where that improvement is self-sustaining, especially if fiscal policy continues to be a drag on activity.  Last week\u2019s report on consumer sentiment was especially sobering.  With households still so pessimistic about employment prospects, income expectations, and the ability of the government to help, the recovery still seems in need of policy support. There is one aspect of the economy that I have been watching particularly closely in terms of whether there will be negative effects on growth and housing.  It is spring break, the kids are home, and the focus is on the future of our labor markets\u2014in particular, the growing number of Americans who are burdened with staggering student loan debt. As our colleagues at the New York Fed have reported, student debt nearly tripled between 2004 and 2012 and now stands at close to $1 trillion.  The share of 25-year-olds carrying student debt has risen from just over 25 percent to more than 40 percent during that same period.  The trend toward higher levels of debt seems likely to continue until the cost of higher education somehow becomes reduced.  All else being equal, this rise in debt could curtail spending by these individuals as they divert resources to make debt payments.  In other words, instead of buying cars and starter houses, newly minted graduates will be trying to pay off their student loans.  Parents are often the guarantors of their kids\u2019 student loans, and they are worried about the prospects of their children finding jobs that pay enough for them to make the monthly payments on their student loans, which makes them, too, reluctant to be spending. Of course, it has historically been the case that when students have taken on debt, they have also greatly increased their human capital and their expected permanent income.  Given the increased earning potential that a college degree is generally thought to confer, this increased income potential, even with increased debt, might be a good tradeoff.  But it is not such a good tradeoff if the perception of current labor market conditions among students and their parents is that there is not increased earning potential at the time of graduation.  Do we know that students are well equipped to do the cost\u2013benefit analysis associated with taking on student loans and making sound decisions.  I have only my children and their friends as reference points, and, hence, my worry.  [Laughter]  Just as we saw many homeowners get in over their heads leading into the financial crisis, believing that homeownership was the American dream and a reliable source of wealth, I\u2019m curious as to whether students and their parents are not being careful enough when incurring new levels of student debt, believing that any college education will be a reliable source of future wealth. If these students and their families come to discover that the classes they have taken and the degrees they have received are not as lucrative as they had hoped, this could represent a downward shock to their understanding of their lifetime resources, and thus to their consumption spending relative to if they had not gone to school.  College graduates who carry large student debt burdens might also find it difficult to buy a house.  The combination of more-stringent underwriting standards by mortgage lenders and higher debt ratios suggests that the current cohort of would-be first-time homeowners may be nearly shut out of the housing market. While this is surely distressing for those households, it may be a second-order concern from a macroeconomic perspective.  As long as the households have the higher income they expected to accompany their new degrees, they will want to live somewhere other than their parents\u2019 basement.  If they aren\u2019t able to obtain a mortgage, then they will presumably move into rental houses and apartments, leading to demand for and construction of these dwellings.  They might very well decide to consume fewer housing services\u2014for example, a two-bedroom apartment instead of a three-bedroom house.  But they likely will live somewhere.  Again, however, to the extent that students have overextended themselves, which is very hard to know at this point, the demand for housing could be curtailed as recent graduates reassess their earnings prospects. At this point, I consider this issue just a possible risk to my baseline projection, but it is one that I think bears a close watch as the labor market gradually improves and recent graduates assess if their recent employment and income woes are merely cyclical or something much worse.  Thank you", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic news since the last meeting has been broadly, if marginally, better.  I would point to housing prices, sales and starts, private-sector employment, new orders for capital goods, auto sales, and equity prices.  Orders are strengthening in a number of industrial sectors, particularly those with any connection to housing.  Business executives are more optimistic in my conversations with them.  Another positive is that while fiscal policy is a little bit tighter than the previous Tealbook assumed, we have so far avoided a highly disruptive confrontation.  So far.  Financial conditions remain generally healthy and supportive of growth.  There is a return to at least normal levels of risk-taking.  The situation in Cyprus, though, reminds us that Europe retains the ability to threaten financial stability. Speaking of financial stability, I want to echo Nellie\u2019s earlier note of caution again.  We have put in place strong incentives for risk-taking.  We should expect that dealers and investors will take more and more risk as time passes.  Dealers will assume balance sheet risk and accept risk through a variety of underwriting terms or they will watch their competitors do the business.  Investors will assume that the Fed has bounded their downside and take more risk through leveraged credit risk and duration. Serious financial instability reduces growth in a nonlinear way.  And I don\u2019t think that we are close to that point, but it is out there and visibility is poor.  And you are starting to see those elements of risk that I described.  They are very visible in Nellie\u2019s presentation, and in Fabio and Matt\u2019s observations, and in my own conversations as well. I continue to believe that the long-awaited years of above potential growth are coming, perhaps soon, and I\u2019m modestly more hopeful that 2013 will prove the year in which the economy finally crosses that line and begins to absorb excess capacity.  I have, therefore, grudgingly marked up my growth forecast for 2013 to be more in line with the Tealbook.   I still harbor one particular cautious thought.  The debt ceiling has to be raised by the end of the summer.  The influence groups have mostly given conservative members a pass on the fiscal cliff and on the continuing resolution.  Many think that they will not do so with the debt ceiling.  The result could be a very serious confrontation, one with a great deal of downside risk to the forecast and no prospect at all of commensurate benefits. So the Tealbook forecast is for strengthening in the back half of the year.  I hope that is right, of course, but the debt ceiling and, thus, the economy could put that at risk.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. PALUMBO.5  Yes, I\u2019ll start.  The handout is called \u201cMaterial for FOMC Review of Efficacy and Costs of Asset Purchases.\u201d  Large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs) by the Federal Reserve stimulate aggregate demand to the extent that they make financial conditions more accommodative by lowering interest rates paid by businesses and consumers, and affecting asset prices.  Our memo about LSAP efficacy begins by summarizing the recent evidence on these financial market effects, which I will briefly review. Quite a number of papers have found that the Federal Reserve\u2019s asset purchases have significantly lowered Treasury yields.  Putting quantitative estimates from that literature on an \u201capples to apples\u201d basis isn\u2019t easy, but they do seem to span a considerable range.  In our Tealbook projections, we have been relying on the analysis of our Board colleagues Canlin Li and Min Wei, which suggests that a good central assumption is that a hypothetical LSAP cumulating in $500 billion of purchases will initially lower the term premium embedded in 10-year Treasury yields 20 basis points\u2014a value that is reported in line 1 of the table at the top of your first exhibit.  Subsequently, the downward pressure on term premiums is expected to gradually fade away.  Lowering Treasury yields is the first step in the transmission of balance sheet actions to broader financial conditions. With regard to mortgage-related rates, the evidence points to considerable pass-through of the lower Treasury yields and supports our central assumption that a $500 billion purchase program, split roughly 50\u201350 between Treasury securities and agency MBS, would lower both agency MBS yields and conforming 30-year fixed mortgage rates around \u00bc percentage point.  5 The materials used by Messrs. Palumbo and Lebow, Ms. Wei, and Mr. Faust are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). Moving to the effects of LSAPs on interest rates paid by businesses, the empirical evidence has been focused on corporate bond yields, generally finding substantial, though often incomplete, pass-through from Treasury yields to those on investment-grade corporate bonds; significant pass-through to yields on speculative-grade bonds is less apparent.  As you can see in the table, we have adopted the central assumption of a 15 basis point effect on investment-grade bond yields and no effect on speculative-grade bond yields. Another transmission channel for LSAPs operates through the foreign exchange value of the dollar; by lowering the yields on U.S. investments, LSAPs tend to cause the dollar to depreciate, particularly against the currencies of advanced foreign economies.  Research by the Board\u2019s staff supports a central assumption that a $500 billion purchase program would lower the major currency index for the U.S. dollar almost 1\u00bd percent and push down the broad dollar index about \u00be percent. Regarding equity prices, we read the evidence as pointing to a significant effect from the Federal Reserve\u2019s asset purchases but a fairly wide confidence interval around any particular point estimate.  Studies focusing on effects in relatively narrow event windows indicate increases in broad stock prices in the range of 1 to 2 percent for asset purchases expected to lower term premiums on the 10-year Treasury yield 20 basis points, which is where our central assumption lies.  These studies likely miss some of the effects of LSAPs on equity prices to the extent that they materialize over longer periods of time, as we think occurred following the first two rounds of LSAPs, which were undertaken when uncertainty and risk premiums were exceptionally high but subsequently moved down noticeably.  The evidence also indicates that the earlier rounds of LSAPs led market participants to expect a more accommodative stance of conventional monetary policy, which could have produced a particularly strong transmission to equity prices.  But because the Committee was already using explicit date-based forward guidance about the federal funds rate in September 2012 and shifted to quantitative thresholds in December, the most recent round of purchases may have had a smaller effect through such a signaling channel. Before handing off to David, I should underscore that I\u2019ve focused on central assumptions for the size of these effects, but we recognize that the confidence intervals surrounding each of these estimates are wide and the relevant research about them continues to expand.  That said, we are confident that the overall effect of LSAPs on financial conditions is positive.  David will continue our presentation", " MR. LEBOW.  The next step in the transmission channel is from the LSAP-induced changes in interest rates and asset prices to real activity and inflation, discussed in the middle-left panel.  Because of the lags inherent in the transmission from financial conditions to the real economy, it is impossible to provide direct evidence of real effects akin to event studies for financial variables.  So we start from the presumption that the response of the economy to changes in LSAP policy will be about the same now as it has been in response to conventional monetary policy moves in the past, and that econometric models can therefore be useful guides. Our \u201cbenchmark\u201d estimates of the effects of LSAPs on the real economy depend on numerous assumptions, a few of which are shown here.  First, we assume that the federal funds rate remains at the Tealbook path for five years, an assumption that helps isolate the effects of LSAPs alone.  I\u2019ll return to this assumption shortly.  Second, we assume that FRB/US provides a reasonable description of the macroeconomy in the current environment.  Of course, other models would deliver different answers.  I should note in this connection that we have in recent months adjusted the asset-pricing equations in FRB/US so that the movements in interest rates and asset prices following an LSAP are similar to those that Michael just described; as noted in the memo, forcing the model to exactly match our baseline financial effects has almost no effect on the simulation results. As shown at the right, in the benchmark scenario, a $500 billion asset purchase program, with the same composition of Treasury securities and MBS as the Committee\u2019s current asset purchases, raises the level of real GDP four-tenths of 1 percent after three years, reduces the unemployment rate two-tenths of 1 percentage point at that time, and adds one-tenth to inflation.  These figures are somewhat smaller than we believe occurred with the first rounds of asset purchases, because, as Michael said, financial market participants likely interpreted those earlier purchases as also signaling a more accommodative stance of the FOMC\u2019s federal funds rate policy, and because the earlier LSAPs probably helped boost confidence at a time when financial markets were especially stressed. Of course, different assumptions would generate different estimates, and the bottom panel lists a variety of reasons\u2014and by no means is this list exhaustive\u2014to think that the effects could be smaller or larger than the benchmark estimates.  First, the effects of low interest rates on real activity could be attenuated in the current environment.  For example, with credit availability still constricted in some markets, fewer potential borrowers may be in a position to benefit from lower interest rates than during more normal times. The effect of LSAPs on economic conditions might also differ from the benchmark FRB/US simulation because LSAPs affect the pattern of interest rates at different maturities differently than conventional monetary policy actions do\u2014in particular, LSAPs largely affect longer-term financing rates and do not affect shorter-term rates in the same manner as a lower trajectory for the federal funds rate.  The FRB/US spending equations generally are based on 5- or 10-year real interest rates, but some spending decisions likely depend on shorter-term rates, which we think would be less affected by LSAPs.  Alternatively, as Governor Stein has noted, changes in longer-term interest rates brought about by changes in term premiums might have smaller effects on spending than those associated with changes in expected future short-term interest rates. Moving to the middle column, one reason why the LSAP effects could be larger than the benchmark estimates is that FRB/US does not allow LSAPs to directly affect house prices.  If LSAPs do boost house prices, they could lead to stronger activity through wealth effects and higher consumer confidence.  Moreover, higher house prices could ease the lending constraints for some homeowners, leading to a financial accelerator dynamic that is not captured by the FRB/US model. Another reason why the benefits from the LSAP program could be larger than the benchmark estimates involves the possibility that the high levels of unemployment could become structural over time, for example as workers lose skills or labor market attachments\u2014so-called hysteresis effects.  If the support from monetary policy helps prevent such hysteresis effects from taking hold\u2014a channel absent in the FRB/US model\u2014the benefit to the policy could be quite a bit larger than in the benchmark simulation. Finally, let me return to the assumed path of the federal funds rate.  As I noted, in the benchmark simulation, we forced the actual path of the federal funds rate to follow the Tealbook baseline for the first five years\u2014which we view as a \u201cneutral\u201d assumption.  But of course, the announcement of a further expansion of the portfolio might lead the public to revise their expectations for the future trajectory of the federal funds rate, thereby changing bond yields and asset prices today.  For example, given the current threshold-based forward guidance, investors and others might reasonably anticipate an earlier liftoff because the LSAP would induce stronger economic conditions.  We estimate that an endogenous response of this type could trim the real effects by about half relative to the benchmark estimates.  Alternatively, if the public viewed the asset purchases as also signaling a lower path of the federal funds rate, similar to what we think occurred with the earlier LSAP programs, the effects of the LSAP would be larger than in the benchmark case.  These alternative results highlight the importance of the Committee\u2019s communications regarding its intentions for the future path of the federal funds rate in conjunction with changes to its asset purchases.  Min will now continue our presentation", " MR. LACKER.  Could I respond, Mr. Chairman.  I agree wholeheartedly.  Empirical work is exceptionally valuable, but there are limits to what it can tell us.  It can\u2019t tell us, in essence, why we\u2019re seeing what we\u2019re seeing.  It can tell you that we see this, but it can\u2019t really explain it without some coherent, artificial world in which it happens that you can put your hands on and dissect and understand the causal chains of", " MR. BULLARD.  Sure\u2014yes.  Actually, if I could just follow up on this.  On exhibit 4, Jon, is this the same thing\u2014a one-time, unanticipated announcement of a $500 billion program with a certain contour that the market completely understands", " MR. BULLARD.  Yes", " MR. BULLARD.  But you say that you also have a long-run neutrality assumption", " MR. BULLARD.  So there must be no effect in the long run", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Governor Tarullo asked which of these episodes are instructive for the current decision about LSAPs, and I was going to mention this in my go-round, but it seems more live at the moment.  I sent an e-mail to Bill English and the staff to talk about the June 2003 episode, and my own take on the characterization of that was somewhat different than the way they read it.  Chairman Bernanke, you were an important element of what was going on back in the spring of 2003.  But it seemed to me as though the big increase in Treasury rates following the June 2003 meeting was one of great disappointment by financial markets, not just because they got 25 basis points less than they were expecting, but also because they had positioned themselves in bond markets for future asset purchases, which speeches by Governor Bernanke and Vince Reinhart\u2014we don\u2019t send Bill English out to give speeches on policy, do we", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m going to jettison the notes that I had prepared that go through questions 1 through 4 in order, in part because I have the advantage of coming toward the end here, having listened to most of you.  I guess I sometimes have difficulty figuring out exactly what the purpose of some of our go-rounds is, and this is one of those occasions.  Sometimes the go-round is, I think, designed to give the Chairman a sense of whether a particular initiative is worth pursuing or not.  Sometimes the go-round is very focused on the monetary policy statement and thus quite concrete.  This one was a little odd because we\u2019re talking about a program that\u2019s already in tow, and to a considerable extent, I heard people who were strong supporters of the program when we started it giving a lot of reasons why it was actually a good thing, people who were pretty strongly opposed to it giving a lot of reasons why the costs are pretty high, and people who are ambivalent expressing a fair degree of ambivalence, which isn\u2019t altogether surprising. The difficulty that I think we all share is the mirror of what Betsy was saying a minute ago.  She was talking in terms of her own decisionmaking or feeling not to have had an occasion to make a decision at the margin.  I think what has been missing\u2014and I have nothing to offer on the point, and I want to be clear about that\u2014is a framework that is more probabilistic or at least roughly quantified that allows us to make judgments at the margin.  Proceeding with another few months\u2014what difference does that make.  Not proceeding with another few months\u2014what difference does that make.  Most of the costs and benefits that everybody has been talking about are either at a macro level or very specifically focused on where we are right at the moment.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s surprising.  This is a big initiative that really doesn\u2019t have precedent except if you think of the \u201930s and the immediate post\u2013World War II period, which had a very different set of economic conditions.  But it still makes many of us\u2014I guess, myself included\u2014a little bit uneasy, precisely because we don\u2019t have precedents from which we can at least begin our analysis of effects at the margin.  But I think we just need to live with that, and I guess, to the degree that future staff work is going to be trying to support our decisions, I believe it would be most useful if the staff can help us make those kinds of decisions.  I will say that I haven\u2019t heard anything today that suggests big differences in costs, for sure, of a couple of hundred billion more in purchases one way or the other.  It seems to me that a lot of the concerns are with the balance sheet when it gets to a certain level or with a trajectory which may not have an obvious ending point and thus raises the prospect of a very large balance sheet\u2014as Betsy suggested, and probably some yet to come will suggest. I do have a couple of very specific things to say, for what they\u2019re worth.  First, I agree with the many people who have said that, to some considerable extent, the financial stability considerations here are about all of what we\u2019re doing now\u2014zero-interest-rate policies, forward communications, as well as LSAP purchases.  I would also drop a footnote here without elaborating on it.  I\u2019m not as sanguine about supervision as a surrogate for taking action on financial stability, but I think that\u2019s actually a very complicated set of issues that we should probably just discuss at some other time.  There is one thing, though, that I keep hearing both from a lot of market participants or people who work for market participants and\u2014maybe more tellingly, since they\u2019re not talking their book\u2014from at least several academic economists who are actually pretty favorably disposed to sustained low interest rates and the LSAP program generally:  a very specific concern about market reactions when markets see a fairly clear signal that we\u2019re going to stop, much less reverse.  Now, the thing about this is, this is going to be an issue whenever we do it.  It does seem an issue that\u2019s principally about communication, in the sense of getting a wider distribution of expectations about when we might stop before the moment at which we communicate that we\u2019re going to stop.  But I have been struck by the number of people who, in a more or less unsolicited fashion, say to me that they think that\u2019s actually a pretty significant issue.  That was the context, by the way, in which the Fed watcher from the \u201990s communicated his recollection of that period. The second thing I would say is about the remittances and all.  I guess I agree with\u2014well, I\u2019m not sure how many people said what I\u2019m about to say.  I think it\u2019s really hard right now to know what the political consequences of this would be.  Think about it.  If the exhibit is correct, we\u2019re some years away from that.  We don\u2019t know what the economic environment would be.  In a good economic environment, many sins are forgiven, hopefully\u2014that\u2019s number one.  We don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to be elected President in the fall of 2016, or the identities of the President and the Secretary of the Treasury or the Administration\u2019s attitude will matter.  We don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to control the Congress in 2017.  So I think it really is hard to make an assessment, which suggests that it shouldn\u2019t weigh too heavily on our sense of what the merits are. On the other hand, I definitely agree that\u2014Jeff and Richard were the first two who said it, and I think a number have said it since then\u2014trying to do remittance smoothing has a pretty high probability in the near term of eliciting a pretty negative reaction.  It would have to be understood as more akin to banks not paying dividends in order to husband their capital than to corporations trying to smooth their earnings to deceive their shareholders.  And I have a feeling that the latter might jump to people\u2019s minds, particularly if it comes on the heels of the Fed talking about the fact of, \u201cWe may have negative remittances at some point in the future.\u201d  So I think that\u2019s an option we probably want to steer away from.   That\u2019s really all.  I\u2019m not even sure that was constructive, but that\u2019s all of the constructive things I have to say.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Okay.  All right.  Could I just have David remind us what the assumption is about the market reaction when markets learn that their expectation was wrong in the Tealbook", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  My preferred policy would be to continue the current pace of asset purchases through this year as long as we expect to miss on both elements of the mandate over the medium horizon.  Financial stability does not appear to be at risk from our actions to date, and I see no significant empirical evidence that financial instability is greater now than it was in the fall of last year.  Furthermore, the staff studies support the view that benefits exceed the costs at this time.  Were we to decide to taper in the future, I would emphasize that actions taken starting last September had substantially reduced tail risk as well as improved the outlook sufficiently to begin a slow taper. The 12-month change in the overall PCE chain index stands at 1.2 percent through January, 0.8 percentage point below our 2 percent target.  The unemployment rate is 7.7 percent, 2\u00bd percent above my estimate of full employment.  Most forecasters, including the Tealbook, currently expect a very gradual return of both inflation and unemployment to their long-run desired levels given the policies we have already enacted. To be sure, we have put in place considerable stimulus between our extended period at the zero lower bound and our sequence of large-scale asset purchases.  But even given all that, the progress toward normalcy is frustratingly slow.  Our actions for the foreseeable future should be as aggressive as they would be if we were missing our key goals in the other direction by as much.  If inflation were 2.8 percent, the unemployment rate were below 3 percent, and the forecast envisioned a three-year-plus period to return to our mandate-consistent outcomes, I have no doubt many, myself included, would be advocating for more-aggressive action.  We should be no less aggressive in pursuing policy that will increase the speed through which we achieve mandate-consistent outcomes when the unemployment rate is high and the inflation rate is low. I do agree with President Kocherlakota\u2019s characterization that last September we did somewhat promise to do whatever it takes.  I think that actually has helped us quite a bit, particularly through all of the fiscal problems that we experienced at the end of the year and through the sequester.  One reason that we haven\u2019t had more buffeting from some of the fiscal shocks was because of the monetary policy promise that we did make. Now, I think that people have been emphasizing the modal forecast for unemployment, but I really would emphasize in your press conference, if you want to prepare the market for possible tapering, that the tail risk really has significantly diminished from where we were last September.  The economy is continuing to grow, despite much more fiscal austerity than many people anticipated.  If you had told me last fall that we were going to have a sequester and the tax increase that we had, I would have expected a much weaker first half than what we\u2019ve actually seen.  Europe has definitely continued to be weak, but despite the election results in Italy and the turmoil in Cyprus, peripheral Europe to date has actually weathered the storm surprisingly well, so that the yields on Spanish and Italian debt have been pretty well behaved, given the sequence of shocks that we\u2019ve had. If we\u2019re to reevaluate whether we still need a \u201cdo what it takes\u201d strategy, I think if that was the discussion we were having at today\u2019s meeting, we probably wouldn\u2019t say right now that we\u2019d do what it takes, because I believe a lot of that tail risk has diminished.  Even though I think it is appropriate to continue with a more aggressive policy than it seems like many others are comfortable with, if we are going to prepare the markets for some tapering in or after June, then emphasizing the change in tail risk as well as the change in the labor market outcomes would make sense.  Thank you", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly support alternative B and support continuing our current pace of asset purchases.  I will say, like President Williams, I\u2019m not really a fan of paragraph 3 the way it\u2019s structured.  Adding the language, \u201cbased on its outlook for the labor market and inflation, and on its current assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of additional asset purchases\u201d\u2014I know that, on the merits, that\u2019s true.  We\u2019ve talked about how efficacy and costs are a basis for evaluating these programs, but it\u2019s really kind of \u201cin your face,\u201d it seems to me.   It reminds me of a time when, many years ago, I let a doctor talk me into having an X-ray.  I thought I didn\u2019t really need it, and he was going to inject something\u2014I don\u2019t know if it was radioactive, but it was something that caused me concern.  He said, \u201cOh, this is nothing.  We\u2019ll go ahead and do that.\u201d  He wanted to pay for his X-ray machine.  This was in the \u201980s.  Of course, before he did it, he took me into his office.  He showed me a piece of paper, and he said, \u201cNow, you have to understand, there is a risk that you may die because of this.\u201d  And I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I needed it anyway,\u201d but I did let him talk me into it.  I just think it\u2019s unnecessary", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Were I not afraid of surprising the public, I would advocate beginning to taper purchases at this meeting.  The meager benefits of the current pace of purchases and continuing those to year-end, as indicated in the Tealbook, seems hardly worth it to me, given the prospective risk that we might be taking.  Now, of course, such a move would be a surprise, and, therefore, I can get comfortable with alternative B at this point.  But I believe tapering at the next meeting or in June is likely to be appropriate if the conditions warrant.  The minutes of today\u2019s meeting will reflect our discussion and should serve as notification, or at least a heads-up, that asset purchases might well be slowing in the not-too-distant future. Mr. Chairman, I agree with your comments about the labor market, and it\u2019s important for you to convey those at the press conference.  I\u2019m very supportive of that.  I\u2019m also very supportive of your talking about the point that reducing the pace of purchases is not reducing the level of accommodation, it is reducing the rate at which we are trying to increase accommodation.  There is a lot of confusion about what constitutes the level of accommodation versus the rate of change in accommodation.  Making that distinction in your press conference would be very helpful. Part of the problem we have with our flow program is that we\u2019ve set up expectations that confuse stock effects with flow effects again.  And we talked about this when we initiated the flow program, about what the expectations might be of what the ultimate stock would be at the end, and we deliberately chose not to talk about that.  And we seem to have people arguing that because we let the market establish those expectations, now we can\u2019t surprise them.  That was endogenous to the decision we made in the flow program, and we created the problem for ourselves. Interestingly enough, on the other side of that same argument, I also could support faster tapering.  If you really believe in the stock effects and the term-premium effects, the pace of our exit from our balance sheet really doesn\u2019t matter.  Once we establish the size that we are going to unwind it from, the effects are there, and it may not make any difference whether we taper it slow or fast.  Now, of course, whether we taper slow or fast may matter for other things.  It may matter for our remittances.  It may matter for market functioning or effectiveness.  It may interact with the effectiveness of interest rate tools such as IOER and other things, and how we manage our balance sheet.  So there are other reasons to worry about the pace at which we would exit, but the argument for term premium is that once we decide the total size, the pace really shouldn\u2019t matter on that side of the equation. At the time we begin tapering our purchases, we should also announce a change in our reinvestment strategy, which would help us on the exit.  We could take a minor step toward reducing the duration of the SOMA portfolio by reinvesting both MBS and Treasuries into shorter-term Treasuries.  That would help.  We would keep the portfolio large, but it would gradually begin changing the mix.  This would also help us if we choose an exit strategy where we do not sell MBS.  By gradually reinvesting into Treasuries, we are going to change the composition of the portfolio, and that may help us and give us more flexibility as we move forward.  This could mitigate some of the costs. Finally, I just want to make a note about communication.  Communication is always a very important part of our policy, and it is going to become more important as we navigate the end of purchases and our exit strategy.  And a lot of the conversation the past two days has focused on how we manage that communication.  One element, though, I have become increasingly concerned about is that the broad communication surrounding asset purchases, with its focus, in many cases, on how our policies are increasing stock prices or housing prices and working to help the economy through so-called wealth effects, is going to make our communications even more difficult when we agree to end purchases.  I\u2019m concerned that through our discussion of asset prices, we are creating a condition that is helping to foster buoyancy in asset prices.  But when the time comes to withdraw, we then run the risk of a sharp correction in the markets, which could dash confidence and set back the recovery.  By emphasizing the boost in asset prices, I believe we are implicitly sending a signal to the markets and the public that we are taking responsibility for asset prices.  I do not think this is a healthy strategy, and it could create a dangerous dynamic for the conduct of monetary policy in the future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I\u2019m sorry to intervene in this way, but I am not following the line of argument that President Plosser advanced.  I was hoping he could clear it up.  If we had a given stock of holdings of assets, say $3\u00bd trillion, if we sell that all off in one day, I think it has less accommodation associated with it than if we sold it off at a dollar a day for the next 3\u00bd trillion days, whatever that is.  [Laughter]  If we end up holding that stock of assets for a longer period, then it will end up having a bigger downward effect on the term premium because we are holding that stock of assets for longer.  That was my understanding of the term premium effect", " MR. PLOSSER.  It depends on when you start it.  Also, that\u2019s not the argument we gave when we went into this.  That is changing the terms on which we entered into the LSAP purchases in the first place", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast assumes that the labor market continues to improve further over the course of this year.  I expect fiscal policy will generate some headwinds, but private-sector demand and housing markets appear poised to support growth going forward. Accommodative monetary policy can serve to encourage and support this projected pace of growth.  Alternative B, however, continues a policy that I believe is too accommodative and poses growing risk to the achievement of our economic objectives in the long run.  As I mentioned in the discussion on asset purchases yesterday, the pace and open-ended approach to our current program appear to provide small benefits while carrying a number of risks as currently calibrated.  Given the improvements in the outlook for the labor market that we have seen from declines in initial claims for unemployment insurance and from the pace of private nonfarm payrolls, I believe we should start laying the groundwork for bringing asset purchases to an end. I do remain concerned that the incentives to reach for yield continue.  And although our dashboard may not signal near-term warnings, the time frame over which we have assured markets that rates will remain exceptionally low gives ample time for further acceleration.  While I am confident that our staff will remain vigilant in looking for indicators of excessive risk and our supervisors will do the same, I continue to hear from community banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and individual savers who find the extended low rate environment extremely challenging and are actively looking for riskier alternatives.  The staff memo on the experience of Japanese financial institutions and retail investors offers a perspective but with a number of differences that make it difficult to compare.  My own experience tells me that these risks can be hard to quantify and describe with any precision because they can arise in sectors of the financial system that are loosely monitored or poorly understood and are certainly beyond the scope of our supervisors to address. I have raised these concerns not to suggest monetary policy should respond to specifically address such risk, but to ensure they remain at the forefront of our assessment of the efficacy of our policy stance in general, relative to achieving sustained economic growth.  Monetary policy has its limits in achieving full employment on its own.  And as our discussion yesterday highlighted, clarifying the framework for our open-ended purchase program will be important.  I would prefer that we start now to taper asset purchases and tilt the mix toward Treasury securities in order to conclude the program by year-end.  We could then slowly begin to normalize rates in order to minimize the buildup of financial imbalances, a mispricing of risk, and higher long-term inflation expectations. Finally, as to the statement, I am not proposing any changes, but I do think President Williams raises some very good points about issues of clarity versus uncertainty in that statement.  Thank you", "  Because we\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to keep rates low until\u2014 MR. BULLARD.  No, I do think that that has been helpful.  That has been helpful and has helped to mitigate this problem, but I still think that if you try to make a lot of promises out into the distant future, you face some risk that you\u2019re saying that the economy is going to be bad into the future", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I fully support maintaining the federal funds rate target at 0 to 25 basis points.  I wanted to say something positive.  [Laughter] I remain unconvinced about the value, efficacy, benefits, or whatever we call it, of asset purchases now, and I\u2019d favor moving toward tapering as soon as possible.  I think it would be feasible at this meeting, but I appreciate the comments about surprise and all. I want to comment about one thing.  We\u2019ve talked a lot at this meeting, and it came up at the previous meeting, about the notion of holding MBS to maturity.  One idea that I think I heard in yesterday\u2019s discussion was that one value this would have is that it would take sales off the table, and that would help with regard to the risks posed by agency MBS REITs.  To me, connecting our holding of MBS to the risks of agency MBS REITs is a terrible precedent and a dangerous notion.  It suggests that market participants should look to buy whatever we buy and then box us into not being able to sell, because they can lever up and make themselves fragile and then box us into not selling.  And I think that\u2019s kind of a moral hazard that we should treat exceptionally cautiously.  If anything, that suggests we should sell sooner and get out of it more gradually before the risks in the agency MBS REITs get larger.  More broadly, that dilemma is why I\u2019ve argued against us holding things other than Treasuries.  This is why I think historically we\u2019ve wanted to stay out of markets because our decisions about disposition of those things\u2014I know we all recognize this\u2014have distributional implications that are tangential to monetary policy. Now, there was a lot of discussion yesterday about the relationship between financial stability concerns and monetary policy.  Market participants have all sorts of views, and they take positions based on all sorts of views, and some of those are levered.  And so investors are investing in entities that are taking positions based on some views about how financial asset prices are going to evolve, and some of those outcomes are going to depend on decisions we make.  For financial stability, you want resilience in the market, and you want to view those folks as likely to suffer the consequences of the decisions they make.  You don\u2019t want them perceiving there to be some put involved.  I think the farther we go in holding non-Treasury assets and the longer we hold them, the greater is the market\u2019s dependence on our having them in our portfolio and having them not be in private-sector portfolios.  I think that it\u2019s going to make the adjustment to us backing out of those assets more costly for them.  For me, this suggests we should shift our portfolio away from MBS sooner rather than later.  I\u2019d even consider just swapping them out for Treasuries in a steady program over time. So in this connection, I would note that our foray into housing finance began at the end of November 2008.  The situation was really in the depths of the crisis, where considerations about the disruption and functioning of markets were very real.  The functioning of the MBS market is not at all a concern in the same way now.  If anything, we view it as functioning well now, and our purchases might impede functioning rather than aid functioning.  It looks like our housing finance journey may last more than a decade.  You know, if we hold these to maturity, it will be more than 10 years that we\u2019ve been involved in holding MBS.  Obviously, it has nothing to do with market disruption now.  I think it has to do with aiding the housing market. I\u2019d also note in this connection a statement that we issued jointly with the Department of Treasury in the first half of 2009 in which both of us avowed that it was inappropriate for the Federal Reserve to steer credit to particular sectors.  It just seems clear to me that housing per se is a particular sector as articulated in that document.  And I\u2019ve always had a hard time squaring our MBS purchases with that joint statement.  Is that statement not operative anymore or what.  I think we owe it to the American public, and we haven\u2019t done it at all, but we owe them an explanation squaring our MBS purchases with that document or else rip it up and tell people it\u2019s defunct.  Those are my comments, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think once again Narayana put his finger on the issue that we face with this statement but, more importantly, maybe, with the next several meetings.  He characterized the tension between the cap and credibility.  I\u2019m going to put a slight gloss on what he said because I think that there was a sense among many, though not all members of the Committee, that the reception of the September and December actions was not quite what they thought they were signing up for in agreeing to those actions.  Thus, they were in a situation in which I think a critical mass, although, again, not all of the Committee, wants to reshape some of the external expectations even while trying to maintain the very important value of credibility. To achieve that, I think what we should collectively be aiming for here in this statement and in the Chairman\u2019s press conference is what he referred to in his opening remarks this morning as providing some optionality.  Now, optionality does not mean a change in policy, although it will mean some change in perceptions.  If you think about it, if you hold a position and you get no options, that\u2019s your position.  If you hold a position and you have an option, you may sell.  So it will, in some sense, dial down expectations a little bit at the margin.  But I think\u2014and here I\u2019m not speaking personal policy preferences but just trying to put together everybody on the Committee\u2014there\u2019s probably a majority, though certainly not everybody, who would feel more comfortable if the external expectations were not $500 billion but maybe closer to the $750 billion or $800 billion that Bill talked about at the last meeting, and not everybody likes that.  Well, how do you get there.  I think you do have to create a little bit of optionality so that you retain the ability in the next couple of press conference meetings if you want to dial down, to taper some.  But, at the same time, if the majority of the Committee decides not to do that, you would not have already moved so as to undermine that credibility. I think in a way, John, ironically this is a moment in which a little bit of uncertainty in those who read the statement and hear the Chairman\u2019s press conference is actually sort of a good thing.  On the one hand, I, personally, would not want to say anything strong enough to send a signal that has everybody speculating after this meeting, \u201cthey may be tapering, they may be tapering.\u201d  On the other hand, if optionality is the aim, then you\u2019ve got to do a little bit to, again, emphasize improvement in the labor market and suggest that we\u2019re going through a decision process, at least during press conference meetings.  So how does the statement feed into that.  Well, I think there have been a couple of changes, and as Betsy says, probably the most important is the last clause in paragraph 4. With respect to the proposals a couple of people made to go back to the language of the earlier statements, again, personally, I don\u2019t have a particularly strong view on it one way or another.  Over the coffee break, as I was listening to people, I got a sense that some of those who feel like expectations got out ahead of where they and the Committee are were of the view that the introductory language in the beginning of paragraph 3 gave a little bit more prominence to the efficacy and costs issue than they felt had been heard by the public before.  By the way, is the decision to have no doughnuts an effort to get people to act more quickly within the meeting so they can get to lunch.  If so, it was a brilliant tactical decision.  [Laughter]  Again, I\u2019m not expressing my own preference, but if one option is to go back to paragraph 3 of the earlier statement, another option might be, in accordance with Charlie Evans\u2019s suggestion, to eliminate the single word \u201ccurrent,\u201d which at least pulls it back a little bit.  Then, as Dennis and I think some others referred to, balance that by also eliminating \u201ccontinue to\u201d in paragraph 4. Those are very minor changes that probably don\u2019t go to the center of what John is concerned about, but I would end by saying part of our aim now should be to try to come together with a working consensus on what we\u2019re saying and the kind of optionality that we\u2019re trying to create for ourselves.  We do all have different views, obviously, but it\u2019s important that no matter which of our views prevails, that the Committee as a whole does maintain its credibility.  Part of that at this point means preserving some optionality, else we risk a situation in which some months from now, there\u2019s a real split that gets emphasized to the world, which I actually think would be decidedly suboptimal.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No.  I\u2019m just saying that our exit strategy, what we decide about that, has implications for the current level of accommodation"], "2013FOMC20130501meeting.txt": [" MR. EVANS.  Right.  Thank you.  If I can ask about consumption.  The Tealbook forecast has fairly subdued investment.  Given what I hear from business contacts, that seems reasonable; if anything, the Tealbook may be on the optimistic side.  Despite the weakness in business investment, the Tealbook forecast has a pretty decent growth in consumption and housing.  The story that goes along with this is that of a virtuous cycle:  Consumption increases because disposable income rises; disposable income rises because employment goes up; employment goes up because consumption increases; and that feeds on itself. I\u2019m having a little bit of trouble with the chicken and the egg problem here.  Which one is going to go first.  How long can this cycle go on without participation by businesses.  If they\u2019re cautious about investment, won\u2019t they be cautious about hiring.  A lot of firms are telling me that they\u2019d rather install technology than hire workers.  And then on top of that, you\u2019ve got the fiscal drag from the payroll tax increase. Can you make me feel better about this", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes. One of the results is that the participation rate does have a cyclical component, but it\u2019s lagged considerably behind the unemployment component", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right", " MR. KAMIN.  Well, I think that echoes back to the point I made earlier to President Lacker, which is that there was an awful lot of movement in markets in anticipation of the announcement of a large program.  People expected a very large and very aggressive program, and, as your data show, those data move up from something under \u00bd percent, in terms of expected inflation, to something like 1\u00bd percent now.  So that is pretty substantial.  Now, logic would entail that when the program was announced, and it was even bigger, that inflation expectations would rise even more, but they didn\u2019t.  So it\u2019s a bit of a mystery.  As you pointed out, the market is not too liquid, so it\u2019s a little hard to decipher these things.  My best guess, as I say, is that most of it was baked in the cake, and market participants didn\u2019t quite know how to react to that remaining hunk of unexpected purchases; we\u2019ll just have to follow it closely", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  If I could just follow up on that.  So that makes the fall and then snapback in JGB yields more problematic, it seems to me.  Because if you don\u2019t have expected inflation as the explanation for the return to the previous level, the initial response to the announcement looks sort of spurious and transitory.  And if that\u2019s true, that sort of undermines our approach to estimating the LSAP effects in the United States because we use these little, narrow announcement effect windows, which is what I was getting at", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. Also, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s correct to say that in the United States, we rely just on event studies.  For example, the estimates reported in Tealbook, Book B, about LSAP effects on term premiums are uninformed by event studies.  Those are based on a model", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think, as many of you have already noted explicitly or implicitly, the data since the March meeting raise exactly the kind of question that a lot of us anticipated during our last meeting, namely, whether the burst of stronger job and other numbers in the preceding months was going to be followed by a relapse.  I wasn\u2019t going to say anything about labor markets.  I was actually going to go to some of the issues that Charlie Evans has already raised, but because many of you have commented on labor markets, I thought I would say a couple of things. A few weeks ago, I began the proverbial deeper dive into what\u2019s going on in labor markets.  And it\u2019s pretty murky down there, and the murkiness is not just near-term murkiness.  I\u2019ve been talking with a bunch of non-Board labor economists.  I talk to the Board labor economists all the time, but I\u2019ve been talking to a bunch of non-Board labor economists, and three things come through despite the variations in their views.  First, they readily confess to not really understanding what was going on in labor markets before the crisis and recession, that is, the decline in dynamism of U.S. labor markets over the preceding 10 to 15 years.  Second, they all have the intuition that there is less distinction between cyclical and structural factors than we might otherwise have thought.  And they have the intuition that what we\u2019re going through right now is having an effect on structural trends, but they find it difficult to specify exactly what. But third, they all seem to think that no matter how that debate turns out over the coming years, we are nowhere near, at this point, whatever full employment would look like, particularly when you  April 30\u2013take into account the kind of analysis Janet just did of effective underutilization as opposed to just nominally stated underutilization.  They will say things like, \u201cWell, you know, it may be that there\u2019s been a good bit of structural damage, but that\u2019s not showing up now. It\u2019s not going to show up for a while.\u201d  So talking to me as a monetary policymaker, they say \u201cdon\u2019t worry about that now.  There may be other things to worry about\u2014and maybe next year or the year after\u2014 but not right now.\u201d I think we\u2019re all going to have to dive down to those murky depths over the next couple of decision points, but my guess is that it is going to be hard to come to a highly precise sense of how much is cyclical, how much is structural, and whether there are huge amounts of slack or just moderately huge amounts of slack.  And so we\u2019re going to have to move some on intuition. One of the other two things I did want to note is that, as Charlie observed earlier, even though the jobs number may have been the most eye catching, maybe the more significant trend over the last couple of months is in business investment.  We\u2019ve had a couple of years now where businesses seem to have been compensating for the collapse of investment during the worst stages of the crisis and recession, but capital expenditures now seem to be leveling off as they return to something approaching their historical averages.  And I thought it was interesting that one of the newsletters put out by one of the financial firms last week noted that a lot of large businesses are saying that they\u2019re essentially done with investment until they see enough additional demand to justify more spending.  That is, they\u2019ve caught up with the spending that they didn\u2019t do during the recession that they needed for replacement or other purposes, but now they\u2019re done until there\u2019s a reason to undertake something new. On the other hand, housing remains pretty strong.  Consumer spending and confidence have held up, really, remarkably well considering how weak income growth has been.  I don\u2019t   April 30\u2013know how much longer it can go on.  I mean, the saving rate is now down to 2.7 percent, and in the last 25 years or so, the only time it spent any appreciable time below 3 percent was the middle of the last decade, when everybody thought they would get rich by their houses appreciating. It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s sustainable, but it has been good news to this point.  So I think we\u2019re just, now, going to sit and see the degree to which March is an anomaly or a portent of the kind of setback that has occurred, now, three previous times during the recovery. Looking ahead, I think it may prove hard in the near term to disentangle the factors that are going to affect the pace of recovery for the better part of the rest of this year.  You could reasonably ask whether the recent burst of stronger activity was principally the result of a snapback from Hurricane Sandy and the drought and some other temporary factors, or whether it reflected an underlying momentum that has built up as deleveraging has proceeded fairly far and other residual headwinds have abated.  But even if the underlying momentum idea proves valid, the sequestration, on top of the fiscal measures adopted at the beginning of the year, is, in any case, going to be pushing down pretty hard on the brake pedal, just as things were starting to get going.  For me, this means that the information over the next several months is likely to be inconclusive.  Now, if we get reasonably strong numbers in the face of the greatest effects of the sequestration in the second and third quarters, that would be a pretty good indication that the underlying momentum story has some force to it.  But if we get poorer numbers, it\u2019s going to be hard, I think, to determine whether the momentum story is still the right one and just going to take a little time to show forth, or whether there still is an underlying absence of momentum.  So we may not be able to make a judgment for a while, until we\u2019re able to look through the maximum effects of the sequestration to see if it\u2019s masking basic strength in the economy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  April 30\u2013MR. STEIN.  I think the sign is right locally.  In other words, with the March number, it went in the right direction, but globally it has kind of gone the wrong way.  Since September, it\u2019s not gone the way we would have predicted", " MS. DUKE.4 Well, first, I\u2019d like to point out that Jim Clouse didn\u2019t get any dinner because he was waiting for all of the new submissions. First of all, I\u2019m not in favor of making any changes to policy at this meeting, but I would like the statement from this meeting to leave us in the best possible position to start tapering in June if the data cooperate. I found the memo on changing the pace of purchases to really be quite helpful.  Knowing that I\u2019m a lot more concerned than most of you about the cost of a very large balance sheet, I\u2019m still willing to admit that, when I reviewed the memo on changing the pace of asset purchases, I found that issuing a statement that said we had run up against an unfavorable cost\u2013benefit tradeoff sounds an awful lot like defeat, whether it\u2019s a collective statement from the Committee or whether it\u2019s individual members of the Committee dropping off of this train as each reaches his or her own particular pain point.  But at the same time, the likelihood of getting to the substantial improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions that we originally set as a threshold to end purchases seems like a very long way away, especially if we discount resilience to fiscal drag and expect monetary policy to offset 4 The materials used by Ms. Duke are appended to this transcript (appendix 4). April 30\u2013sequestration.  So I do see an attractive middle ground, and I thought we were converging on a middle ground at the last meeting\u2014that is, the option of stepping down purchases just a bit in response to progress toward our goals\u2014not the \u201csubstantial improvement,\u201d but progress toward our goals.  This would give us a positive message, and, because the pace could always be increased again, I don\u2019t think it comes at a large cost.  And it would give us a better signaling mechanism and allow us to regain control of expectations. As Governors Stein and Powell pointed out yesterday, and as the Tealbook graphs illustrate, we have made noticeable progress since September. It doesn\u2019t rise to the threshold of substantial improvement that would indicate an end to purchases, but it is noticeable.  And the longer we wait to react to the noticeable progress, the less plausible it becomes as a reason for tapering and the more remote becomes our opportunity to point to that progress as a positive result.  So if the progress we\u2019ve seen so far doesn\u2019t justify a step-down, my question is, what does it take, and what\u2019s the likelihood that we\u2019re going to see even greater progress, as we go into the year, than we saw so far. The longer we wait to adjust the pace, the higher the markets will interpret that bar to be, and there\u2019s a real possibility that we could miss out on a window of good news by waiting for better news. I\u2019m not saying that we plan to taper in June regardless of the data, but if we did have some positive revision to March and got some decent job growth, I think we should at least consider signaling that we\u2019re happy with the direction, especially if it comes in spite of the fiscal drag.  I think we could pull that off without hurting our credibility if we prepare the ground. Markets expect us to taper sometime, and we\u2019re the ones who are going to have to teach them what to view as positive or negative. I don\u2019t think a small deceleration in the pace of purchases would have a big effect on efficacy. In fact, when we first launched the MBS program in September, I believe that theApril 30\u2013original pace in the Tealbook was $30 billion a month, and it was only in the last few minutes of the meeting that it was increased to $40 billion to make it sound a bit more muscular.  The big effect of tapering comes from adjustment to market expectations, which is exactly what I intend. I\u2019m still truly bothered by the wide gap between market expectations and the assumptions in the Tealbook that reflect the staff\u2019s interpretation of the broad center of the Committee.  So I think transparency demands that we reconcile the two, and I can see two ways for this to happen.  We could start tapering as a signal to rein in market expectations as progress is made, or we could stop pretending to believe that we anticipate a program that\u2019s much smaller than the market anticipates and instruct the staff to adjust the Tealbook assumptions accordingly. I thought the minutes of the last meeting were pretty clear about the number of members who expressed support for tapering sometime this year and ending by year-end 2013, but Fed watchers completely discounted that signal and even increased their expectations for the timing of the adjustments and the ultimate purchase size. Since the day we launched the program, I\u2019ve been concerned that, rather than driving market expectations, we would be driven by them.  The market now seems to expect an unbroken streak of wins, with any stutter along the way restarting the count, and we appear to be on track to validating that expectation.  So I\u2019m in favor of alternative B, but I would like the statement for this meeting to build on the concept of adjusting purchases that we introduced in the press conference and the speeches after the last meeting. I think that the change I\u2019ve suggested would serve two purposes.  It would set up a smooth transition to tapering in June, if that turns out to be appropriate, and it would communicate to markets that adjusting purchases is a more serious and imminent option than they now seem to expect.  Even if markets assume that it\u2019s a signal that we might increase the April 30\u2013flow of purchases in response to soft data, I still think it would serve a worthwhile purpose.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Yes, if I could follow up\u2014there is this correlation.  Obviously, some sectors are much more interest sensitive than others.  A broad array of risk-free rates fall in recessions, and demand falls; demand rises, as sectors are stimulated by lower interest rates, and April 30\u2013they come back.  The way we\u2019ve done things in the past preserves a neutrality or an unbiasedness across different interest rate sensitivities. A corollary of us pushing mortgage rates below what they otherwise would be is that, in this recovery, small businesses, for instance, may be paying more than they otherwise would.  If it\u2019s aiding housing, it\u2019s surely shifting resources from somewhere else.  And I just don\u2019t see the analytical basis for thinking that that\u2019s going to lead to a better recovery than one that\u2019s neutral, in the traditional sense, about where the recovery is going to take place", " MR. FISHER.  That\u2019s helpful, Mr. Chairman.  There is a limit out there; I\u2019m trying to get my arms around what it might be, because one argument could be that, as we go through time, if we haven\u2019t seen the improvement that we\u2019d like to see on the labor front, we just continue the process.  And I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what the fence line is. Now for my comments on policy.  I was pretty clear yesterday that, with regard to policy, I maintain that the efficacy of our current policy is questionable and will prove less efficacious as long as there is enormous uncertainty about fiscal policy and regulatory policy and until the fiscal authorities come forward with initiatives on the tax and spending and regulatory front that regear\u2014again, I\u2019m not advocating austerity; I want to make that clear\u2014the economy so as to take advantage of already ultra-abundant and uber-cheap capital that we have engineered in order to create jobs. And one of the most disturbing statistics for me is that, in the last 10 years, in the two middle income quartiles, we\u2019ve seen job destruction in the United States, not job creation.  The important thing for me is to have a monetary policy that matches or is properly utilized by the fiscal authorities and that is directed so that the middle class, working men and women, are the beneficiaries\u2014not just the rich, so that the rich get richer. I mentioned Japan\u2019s Abenomics last year and the third arrow.  Clearly, we need a third arrow\u2014structural change\u2014and no further amount of monetary accommodation will solve that problem.  Businesses simply cannot make decisions under conditions of total uncertainty, and they are operating in a fog of uncertainty.  If you look at the cap-ex numbers, we\u2019re back to 2007. What we want to see is additional cap-ex with real job-creating capacity and commitment,April 30\u2013and I just don\u2019t believe that will be made until that uncertainty fog has lifted. We at the Dallas Fed have been looking carefully at this issue and are working with Professors Baker and Bloom of Stanford and with Professor Davis of Chicago.  They\u2019ve tried to put some numbers on the price of uncertainty.  You may or may not buy their theories.  We\u2019re going to have a conference on that, which is coming up.  But there is a price to uncertainty, whether it is the 1.5 million workers whom, they claim, fiscal uncertainty has waylaid or a shaving of GDP growth by 2.3 percent. Again, I feel very strongly, Mr. Chairman\u2014and I realize I\u2019m in a minority\u2014that, in continuing down this path, in terms of efficacy, that efficacy is diminished until we have a matching partner on fiscal policy.  And in fact, I think it becomes counterproductive, particularly if we don\u2019t define what the limits may be.  I don\u2019t believe the market\u2014they have a sense of what the limit might be, but remember the expression \u201cQE Infinity\u201d after we went on the last one. So we need to have some better definition and better communication here.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had it. Now, I did mention yesterday that our 11th District surveys were less than buoyant.  I referred to Carteresque malaise among business leaders.  It may be temporary, or it may be a more permanent phenomenon, but it is afflicting decisionmaking.  And again, I don\u2019t believe that further monetary accommodation can change that.  Yes, the markets might have a reaction if we were to indicate\u2014even to the degree Betsy has suggested, which I support\u2014that we might begin to taper.  As Jim pointed out yesterday in response to questions, we might have market reactions.  But as Governor Stein argued yesterday, I don\u2019t believe we should allow ourselves to be placed in an expectational trap. Mr. Chairman, you referred just now to the Blue Chip economists.  What\u2019s their record for accuracy. It\u2019s not very good.  And fulfilling a commitment April 30\u2013expectation\u2014you\u2019re right, but I believe we should condition that expectation.  We should not let market expectations control the decisionmaking process, and we should simply do what\u2019s right for the economy.  I believe that the right thing to do is to begin tapering now.  But as I don\u2019t have a vote, I don\u2019t expect people to listen to me at this table today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B today, although I continue to have some reservations.  Throughout this round of asset purchases, I have felt that economic and financial conditions warrant a purchase program smaller, and probably shorter in duration, than the one the primary dealers appear to anticipate. The staff assessment shows that the primary dealers anticipate a program nearly of the size that\u2019s assumed in alternative A. I continue to think that some caution, in the form of a slower rate of purchases, is appropriate, given the potential complications of a larger balance sheet and the gradual improvement in labor markets that has occurred and that I anticipate will continue. At our upcoming June meeting, our purchase program will have been under way for nine months.  In my view, the June meeting will be an appropriate time to evaluate how substantially the labor market data have improved since we began the purchase program. As a Committee, we have discussed at length the possibility of a smaller program.  However, so far, as we\u2019ve been talking about both yesterday and today, market participants don\u2019t seem to be receiving the message that the program could be smaller than $1 trillion.  Therefore, I think it is appropriate that the minutes continue to reflect that some participants are expecting the end of the purchase program to occur before the end of the year.  Given that the primary dealers seem to be interpreting our current communications in line with a program that\u2019s the size assumed in alternative A, I believe that the signal from the minutes and the statements should be a bit firmer.April 30\u2013The subtle change in the language that we made at the March meeting did not shift market participants\u2019 views very much at all.  So I support the option of adding the sentence that was suggested by Governor Duke, for all of the reasons Governor Duke articulated.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR", "   April 30\u2013MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Alternative B continues to apply substantial monetary stimulus to a growing economy.  While I do support accommodative policy, continuing this policy well beyond our response to the crisis and recession, I think, poses risk to long-term sustainable economic growth.  And the risk associated with zero interest rates for many years, combined with the ongoing expansion of our balance sheet, has become more significant. Evidence of financial imbalances has emerged, although, as many have noted, near-term risks to broad financial stability seem unlikely right now.  But such risks should not be dismissed.  We know from history that early identification is problematic.  Innovation tends to outpace regulation, and supervision cannot prevent changes in the structure of portfolios from occurring.  As risks surface in multiple areas, they individually may not threaten the broad economy, but they are symptomatic of conditions that give rise to excessive risk-taking, reaching for yield, and asset mispricing.  Zero interest rates for an extended period of time create such conditions and, as such, pose real risk of painful future adjustments.  For example, nonfinancial firms continue to increase debt issuance. And while leverage is not yet alarming, it is accompanied by signs of weakening underwriting standards.  For example, the nearly $90 billion of covenant-lite loan issuance in 2012 was just below the previous record set in 2007 and has continued at a rapid pace.  In terms of asset purchases, I do remain concerned about future costs.  The exit strategy memos and analysis are reminders of the complications and complexities, as well as uncertainty, associated with the conduct of monetary policy going forward, including risks to future long-term inflation expectations. Because of these concerns, I would prefer to take steps now that signal an intention to begin tapering these purchases at midyear and allow markets to adjust their expectations, reduce April 30\u2013reliance on asset purchases, and return to more-normal risk pricing and market functioning.  Language from alternative C that speaks to expectations of improving economic growth later in the year and continued improvement in labor markets could provide some signal to market participants that tapering is likely to start sooner than their current expectations. Thank you", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B as written.  With respect to our asset purchases, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve moved meaningfully closer to achieving a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, even though yesterday I noted silver linings among the dark clouds of the March labor market report.  Several people have noted that,   April 30\u2013cumulatively, the Tealbook projection for the unemployment rate at the end of this year has been revised down 0.6 percentage point since September.  But it\u2019s important to bear in mind that the projected labor force participation rate has also been revised down.  This means a higher estimate of the cyclical shortfall, and, when you work out the math, that substantially reduces the implied employment gain from the lower estimated unemployment rate. With respect to efficacy, I see no evidence that our asset purchases have become less efficacious. In fact, I was heartened by the robust performance of private domestic final purchases in the latest GDP release.  Strong consumer durable purchases and continued progress in housing help offset intensifying drag from a substantial tightening in fiscal policy. Our purchase program entails some costs, but I continue to regard them as manageable at this point.  Moreover, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve learned much that\u2019s new about costs since the program began.  I\u2019d also add that I consider market expectations concerning the likely size of this program reasonable.  They coincided very closely with my own at the outset of the program.  And I do think\u2014this is something President Bullard emphasized, and I agree\u2014that markets have been reacting sensibly to economic news in adjusting their expectations about the program, and that is serving an important automatic stabilizer effect. Going forward, I\u2019m certainly open\u2014and I think it\u2019s quite appropriate\u2014to adjust the pace of our asset purchases, depending on the progress we make in meeting our economic objectives.  I hope that the softness we\u2019ve seen in the recent data does not portend a more pronounced slowdown in the months ahead, and that private demand will prove robust enough to offset increasing fiscal drag.  And I hope that the labor market will continue to improve in a context of strengthening economic growth. Before scaling back our purchase program, we need to have greater confidence that the improvements we\u2019ve seen in the labor market since the start of our   April 30\u2013program will continue.  If these hopes are in fact realized, I see the potential for us to reduce the pace of our purchases even before we\u2019ve fully achieved what we deem a substantial improvement in the outlook. I appreciated very much the helpful memo on communications issues related to changing the pace of our purchases.  Of course, I\u2019m hoping that we will be able to begin tapering our purchases because we see sufficient progress toward our objectives.  If the employment reports for April and May are reasonably strong and are supported by solid spending indicators, I\u2019m open to considering tapering our asset purchases at the June meeting using language similar to the one shown for the \u201cStrong growth in economic activity and employment in coming months\u201d scenario on page 9 of that memo.  If the pace of improvement in labor market conditions turn out to be more modest, but nonetheless sustained, I could envision beginning to taper, say, at the September meeting using statement language along the lines suggested in the staff\u2019s \u201cModerate growth in economic activity and employment growth in coming months\u201d scenario. If, in contrast, we decide to taper asset purchases because of a changed assessment of their efficacy and costs, we will owe the public a coherent account of what we\u2019ve learned since the start of the program that has now convinced us that the cost\u2013benefit tradeoff has turned negative.  The illustrative statement language that the staff prepared for the \u201cModest growth\u201d scenario demonstrates, in my view, just how difficult it will be to explain why we decided to begin winding down our asset purchases despite lack of progress on labor market improvements and for reasons we did not already know at the time we started the program.  Nonetheless, without some explanation, we risk damaging our credibility and, with it, the credibility of our forward guidance. I believe that the market reaction could be swift and severe, and I think we should not contemplate taking this route anytime soon and not without dire need.  April 30\u2013I would also caution against overestimating our ability to substitute accommodation through other means if we reduce the pace of our purchases on efficacy-and-cost grounds.  Our asset purchases send a powerful message that we\u2019re committed to promoting a self-sustaining recovery. A decision to end them would call that commitment into question and, in the minds of the market, likely take asset purchases off the table as a remaining tool in our arsenal. In this context, and with financial markets already expecting that we will provide accommodation through the federal funds rate for years to come, I really would question how much scope we\u2019d really have to offset the impact of such a shift through further alterations in forward guidance. Finally, on Governor Duke\u2019s proposal, I\u2019d prefer not to include the new language, although I have absolutely no objection to the substance.  We did include new language last time.  We\u2019ve emphasized this point in speeches.  I think it\u2019s well understood in the markets, and I think markets might take it as a signal that I\u2019d consider premature that we anticipate action in June", " MR. TARULLO.  Boy, there is a lot of disagreement around the table.  What I\u2019ve noticed this time\u2014and it just struck me\u2014is that there seems to be disagreement among people whose instincts generally go in the same direction\u2014that is, those who have more accommodationist instincts and those who have less accommodationist instincts.  I guess, then, that my remarks are probably directed to those of us who think of ourselves as somewhere in the middle.  There are, roughly speaking, three groups, although, as I say, there\u2019s more disagreement within those groups than I had anticipated.  One group was always skeptical of any real benefits coming from the LSAPs and feared that inflation or other problems were just around the corner.  The second group is pretty comfortable and doesn\u2019t see much risk associated with LSAPs.  So, for them, it\u2019s basically a question of, when do you see improvement.  For whatever group that is\u2014and I won\u2019tApril 30\u2013assign a number of how many people are in the middle\u2014I think Jay and Jeremy have, for some time now, identified the issue, which is, what happens if we get into a circumstance in which there is a tepid performance of the economy, in which things are not demonstrably showing improvement\u2014or, in the terms I used last time, a reasonably high plateau\u2014but they\u2019re also not deteriorating.  And this is the concern, I think, that both of them expressed again yesterday. I believe that one could share that concern to a lesser or greater degree and still think that this would be an odd time to indicate any movement toward tapering or ending the program.  If anything, the economic situation since the March meeting has looked less bright.  The moderate benefits we\u2019re getting from the program\u2014and I do think it\u2019s a little hard to deny that there are moderate benefits; whether you think they\u2019re as great as or greater than the Tealbook says may be debatable\u2014seem particularly worth maintaining, as we\u2019re going into the period in which the sequestration is going to have the maximum contractionary effect on the economy.  So any implication that we\u2019re starting to think more seriously or look forward to June as a tapering moment would seem dissonant at this moment, both on substantive and on presentational grounds.  As I also said last time, whatever the costs, whether they\u2019re reasonably foreseeable, or the concerns, which I share, about the unknown unknowns that may attend continuation or eventual termination of the LSAP program, it seems hard for me to believe that these costs are materially greater whether we started ending or tapering in June or sometime later in the year. The potential roiling of fixed-income markets may happen whenever we slow down, but it seems to me at least more likely to happen if general economic conditions haven\u2019t been good enough to start pushing longer-term rates higher.  And the unknown unknowns, which might become greater as the balance sheet itself gets larger, seem unlikely to be substantially greater with several hundred billion dollars more of purchases. So, as I sit here today\u2014this is a very limited  April 30\u2013observation\u2014it seems to me a reasonably low probability that, by June, we\u2019re going to be able to look through the sequestration and make a judgment as to whether that underlying momentum in the economy promises substantial improvement.  But I don\u2019t foreclose the possibility that it will be the case. And certainly, if there are strong numbers in the next couple of months, notwithstanding the sequestration, that would be pretty good evidence that there was substantial improvement. Finally, on Betsy\u2019s language, it might have been preferable if we had included that language at the outset, because it would have given a bit of the flexibility that people, I think, would like to have.  Several have already suggested possibilities for its misinterpretation in either direction right now.  I think I share that, but this is one, Mr. Chairman, where, if going one way or another makes life easier for you, I\u2019d be happy to go in that direction as well", " MR. EVANS.  Well, all of a sudden, changing it to \u201ceconomic outlook\u201d is going to take the labor market improvement out, and I don\u2019t know how people are going to speculate on that.  I can understand taking the inflation out", " MR. MEYER.5  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The minutes of the June 2011 FOMC meeting include the exit strategy principles shown on the first page of the handout titled \u201cMaterial for Briefing on Exit Strategy Principles.\u201d  Publishing these principles, and thereby clarifying how the Committee intends to normalize the stance and conduct of monetary policy, served two closely related purposes: (1) giving the public confidence that the Federal Reserve will be able to normalize policy smoothly and has a plan for doing so and (2) reducing the risk that the Committee\u2019s eventual steps to reduce policy accommodation would come as a big surprise to the public and so cause an outsized market reaction.  In light of those two purposes, the 2011 exit principles include both broad strategic elements and specific tactical guidelines. The seventh principle indicates that you might adjust the exit strategy in light of economic and financial developments.  Since June 2011, the economy has been hit by shocks emanating from the euro area and from fiscal policy, among others.  Also since June 2011, you decided to reinvest principal received from agency securities into agency MBS rather than into Treasury securities, you conducted the maturity extension program, and you began the flow-based asset purchase program. Consequently, the SOMA portfolio is larger, holds more MBS, and has a longer average maturity than we projected in June 2011.  In addition, you adopted threshold-based forward guidance about your intentions for the federal funds rate, a step that was not anticipated when you released the exit principles. In light of these developments, some of you have suggested that it may be necessary to revise the June 2011 principles.  As background for today\u2019s discussion, 5 The materials used by Mr. Meyer are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).  April 30\u2013the staff prepared memorandums on exit principles, strategy, and tools.  If your dialogue today indicates that you see a need for revisions, the staff will prepare drafts for your consideration.  The first and last of the seven principles seem timeless.  Our sense, based on your remarks during recent Committee meetings, is that many of you see a need to revise one or more of the other principles.  For example, a number of you have suggested that the Committee might forgo selling MBS, either to avoid the risk of an adverse market reaction or to provide some additional monetary stimulus.  Some of you have noted that ceasing to reinvest principal payments from MBS would, by itself, reduce the Committee\u2019s MBS holdings substantially.  Several of you have suggested reducing the level of reserve balances by selling Treasury securities that will have a relatively short remaining time to maturity rather than by selling MBS.  As you\u2019ve noted, Treasury securities that will mature within a few years likely could be sold without realizing significant losses.  A couple of you have suggested retaining some MBS in a \u201cnew normal\u201d SOMA portfolio.  And even if you still intend to sell MBS and to reduce your MBS holdings to zero, you might nonetheless judge, in light of the increased quantity of MBS held in the SOMA, that it is no longer advisable to sell all of them over a three- to five-year period.  If you want to open the door to any of these approaches, you might see a need to modify the exit principles. In light of the small volume and somewhat idiosyncratic nature of transactions in the federal funds market under current conditions, several of you have expressed concern that raising the remuneration rate on excess reserves might not result in an equal increase in the federal funds rate.  Others have worried that the federal funds rate might not remain closely connected to other short-term market rates. If you\u2019re not confident that the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates will move up in line with the interest rate on excess reserves, you might want to eliminate references to the federal funds rate and instead indicate that adjustments to the interest rate paid on excess reserves, along with open market operations, will be used to influence the level of market interest rates in order to promote maximum employment and price stability. The second and third of the June 2011 principles, in combination with the first part of the fourth principle, lay out a sequence of steps that you indicated you would follow when you decide to begin moving to a less accommodative policy.  With threshold-based forward guidance in place, you may no longer think it necessary to change your forward guidance before raising the federal funds rate; you might judge that the public will infer that an increase in the federal funds rate is drawing near as the unemployment rate approaches its threshold.  You could, of course, decide to change your forward guidance before acting to raise interest rates, particularly if you eventually were to conclude that economic and financial conditions at the time a threshold is crossed do not warrant a prompt increase in short-term rates, but you may no longer want to promise that you will raise your target for the federal funds rate only after you have ceased reinvesting, changed the forward guidance, and initiated temporary reserve-draining operations.  More generally, you might now see it as desirable to modify the exit principles in light of your threshold-based forward April 30\u2013guidance, and perhaps to allow greater flexibility about the details of removing policy accommodation.  Or you might still judge that maintaining confidence requires communicating a sequence of specific steps, but not the sequence of steps in the June 2011 exit principles. Finally, you might think that revisions will be necessary, but not yet.  So, with that as background, I\u2019d point you to the discussion questions that were distributed last week.  For your convenience, I\u2019ve reproduced them on the second page of the handout.  My colleagues and I would be happy not only to learn your views, but also to answer any questions you may have for us.  Thank you", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you. I think it makes sense to revise the exit principles and make that known sooner rather than later, because, clearly, what we have in place today is no longer operative.  This can be seen in the primary dealer survey, which shows that a majority of respondents no longer expect agency MBS sales, even though that\u2019s what\u2019s in ourApril 30\u2013exit principles.  And that view, of course, was reinforced by the discussion in the March FOMC minutes about how not selling agency MBS could mitigate the risk of an upward spike in yields.  The exit principles also don\u2019t seem sensible to me, given the introduction of the thresholds.  How can we commit to the timing sequence of normalization\u2014ending reinvestment, for example\u2014 when we don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll reach the thresholds or, in the case of the unemployment rate threshold, whether we\u2019ll want to raise short-term rates as soon as that threshold is reached. It also makes sense to me to revise the exit principles sooner rather than later because people will soon assume that this is in train.  If they haven\u2019t figured that out already, the minutes to this meeting will make that clear. I would hope we could get it done at the June meeting.  That would be ideal because that would be relatively soon, and the Chairman would have the opportunity to discuss it in the press conference.  So that\u2019s a goal\u2014aspirational. In terms of what approach, I think the exit principles should be recast in two broad ways.  First, they should be less about tactics and more about principles.  The focus should be on the outcome we seek\u2014smooth exit; minimizing disruption of market function and risks to financial stability\u2014rather than on the precise ordering in the way each tool will be used.  We should maintain some flexibility on how we can best use our tools to achieve our objectives. In June 2011, when we put forward this first set of exit principles, it was a different environment.  Our balance sheet was smaller.  Exit was anticipated to be relatively near at hand compared with today, and we had a different objective.  We were trying to reassure people that we weren\u2019t going to dump a lot of assets into the market, and that\u2019s really what the exit principles at that time were trying to address. In terms of the exit principles, I think we should emphasize how we plan to exit in a way that not only maintains effective monetary control, but also minimizes market-functioning andApril 30\u2013financial stability risks.  I would put the focus on that rather than on how the balance sheet will evolve over the longer term.  I think that these issues are separable as long as we have the tools in place to conduct monetary policy effectively, even with an enlarged balance sheet, which I think we do.  And I want to separate these two issues because I don\u2019t want commitments about the longer-term balance sheet to constrain our ability to exit in a way consistent with our near-term objectives. I don\u2019t want to have these artificial constraints that we\u2019ve created for ourselves. Also, I\u2019m not sure what the longer-term balance sheet should look like, and so I don\u2019t understand what I gain today by constraining myself to a particular balance sheet or structure in the future.  The only potential benefit of doing so, of putting these balance sheet constraints in place, would be if that made exit easier, but I don\u2019t see the connection between the longer-term balance sheet and exit. We\u2019re going to learn a lot about our monetary policy regime as we normalize interest rates.  So, to me, it makes sense to learn from doing before determining what the longer-term balance sheet should look like. In terms of sales of MBS or short-term Treasuries, I would favor announcing that we have no plans to sell agency MBS in the foreseeable future, at least until interest rates are fully normalized.  That gives you the option of selling them later, at some future date, if you want.  Retaining agency MBS, as our discussion around the table has shown, has four clear benefits: It eliminates the risk that such sales might pose to market functioning, it reduces the risk to financial stability from a sharp rise in long-term rates, it adds a bit of additional accommodation by keeping the agency MBS on our balance sheet for longer, and it eliminates the risk of capital losses from sales that could depress our Treasury remittances.  So I think this straightforward. In terms of short-dated Treasury sales, I wouldn\u2019t pre-commit to this or rule it out. I think we can defer this decision.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something that market participants are worried   April 30\u2013about or focusing on now.  Most important, we don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to want to start raising short-term rates.  We don\u2019t know, therefore, how much short-dated Treasuries we\u2019ll hold at that point in time.  We don\u2019t know how well the other tools will work in controlling short-term rates\u2014in other words, how important it actually will be to drain reserves through asset sales. We also don\u2019t know what interest rates will be doing then and what the impact of those interest rates will be on the path of our remittances.  So, from my perspective at least, it seems too soon to commit to such sales when it\u2019s unclear whether we\u2019ll actually want to undertake such sales in the particular circumstances in which we find ourselves a few years out in the future. To sum up, I favor a much scaled-back version of the exit principles.  These would focus on our goals of using our tools in a way to foster our dual mandate objectives and that would give some attention to minimizing market-functioning and financial stability risks. And, finally, I\u2019d note that we anticipate that the short-term interest rates, such as the federal funds rate, are anticipated to be the primary tool of monetary policy.  But the point here is, I want to de-emphasize the primacy of the federal funds rate because we might want to shift to a different short-term rate instrument\u2014say, the floor RRP rate that I was talking about a little bit earlier, if that turns out to be a very effective tool to control short-term rates. Another advantage of the floor RRP is, if that works, it solves some of the potential governance issues because that would clearly be in the province of the FOMC, unlike the interest on excess reserves.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "   April 30\u2013VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, the issue on thresholds is, we have a threshold that states this unemployment rate and expected forward inflation.  We don\u2019t know when we\u2019re going to hit that threshold, and then we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re actually going to act once we hit that threshold or someplace in the future.  So, talking about how you\u2019re going to stop reinvestment early\u2014I don\u2019t know how to link that up with the timing of when I\u2019m actually going to do liftoff.  I feel as though thresholds create a lot of confusion.  When should we stop reinvesting when we don\u2019t know when short-term interest rates are actually going to increase.  I don\u2019t understand how the sequencing works.  I think the thresholds make the timing issue a little bit confusing to me.  And maybe other people aren\u2019t concerned about that", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In some respects, I guess I\u2019ll continue the themes that Bill and Betsy introduced, but I\u2019m dialing up the skepticism a bit on the utility of this enterprise. Back in 2011, I recall having some concerns about an extended discussion of exit principles for just the reason that Betsy alluded to a moment ago, which was we were communicating that we were actually thinking about exiting\u2014something that turns out to have been premature at best.  In retrospect, there was another problem that we created for ourselves precisely by putting these things out, which is, now they seem outmoded and thus, I think, call into question the wisdom of trying to reformulate exit principles at anything but the high level that Bill was alluding to earlier.  The question I\u2019d ask, then, is:  What are we going to get out of this enterprise. Now, it seems to me that there\u2019s one thing that we really do\u2014or at least I really do\u2014 want to accomplish, and Bill mentioned this as well, which is making clear that the previously stated intention to sell MBS is no longer operative.  And I do think it\u2019s not only useful, but also important, to get that idea out. Ironically, what that reflects is the need to reverse a principle that we stated a couple of years ago, which reinforces the caution about stating too many things in advance. I wonder whether there\u2019s much usefulness to be gotten out of this beyond a restatement of things in a way that\u2019s close to a set of platitudes.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with platitudes, but saying, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to do things so as to avoid financial instability\u201d\u2014I\u2019m not sure it contributes an enormous amount, except maybe just restating to ourselves what we think we\u2019re going to do.  But I don\u2019t know that it provides much reassurance to people in the world that we\u2019re going to be able to exit smoothly.   April 30\u2013I don\u2019t think that we really need anything else right now.  Even the issue of how the thresholds change things could probably be left for later, although my instinct is to agree with Bill that it does require some further statement. It might be desirable to have a more contemporary statement of operative principles, but I\u2019m, frankly, not even sure of that, because it may just invite the world to compare the last statement with the new one and, as seems often to be the case in such instances, not only to draw attention to the fact that we\u2019ve changed our minds, but also to elicit a bunch of people reading into some of the changes way more than what we may have intended. If we are going to do it, though, I think there are two things to avoid.  The first\u2014it must be obvious by now\u2014is having very much detail in the exit strategy that will later encounter the same kinds of problems that we\u2019re now seeing with the 2011 exit principles.  And the second is getting into a prolonged discussion in an effort to develop statements around longer-term issues, such as whether we should continue to hold MBS until after policy normalization or whether we\u2019re going to move from primary reliance on the federal funds rate to some other mechanism. As Betsy said, there are a lot of things to be talked about over the next couple of years, but I don\u2019t think we need to even begin to engage in that discussion in order to achieve what needs to be achieved now. So if we are going to restate principles, I think something like what Narayana has suggested is the sensible approach.  If there\u2019s enough sentiment for going down that route, I certainly wouldn\u2019t be opposed to it.  But if we start getting bogged down in issues of principle, such as what the balance sheet is going to look like after normalization, or if we start getting tempted to put in too much detail, then my suggestion would be that we just step back, identifyApril 30\u2013quite parsimoniously\u2014the word of the day\u2014what it is that we need to say, and then have the Chairman say that in a speech or in congressional testimony. Thank you", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I\u2019d like to start with a proposal:  With all of the cultural references that have been made today\u2014movies, The Lord of the Rings, \u201cMemorable Movie Death #3,\u201d community college job fair\u2014it might be nice if the transcripts could reflect a link to the relevant website [laughter] so that future historians can make the proper associations.  All right. Levity aside, I agree with comments like those of Presidents Williams, Lockhart, and Lacker.  I think that the June 2011 exit principles statement has really served us quite well.  For anybody who goes out and talks and takes questions, there have been many times when somebody stands up and acts as if no one has ever thought of this before: \u201cHave you thought about exiting.\u201d And it\u2019s very useful to say, \u201cYes, the June 2011 minutes have that, and we expect to do that.\u201d  So they have served us very well.  Now, having said that, I still think that exit is a few years away, and we should be careful not to impede the effectiveness of our current policy, which I take to be, provide a sufficient amount of accommodation to reduce the April 30\u2013unemployment rate below 6\u00bd percent as soon as possible.  There is a tension, as many have noted already, in our communications discussing our current short-term accommodation and, ultimately, longer-term restraint. We need to deal with that.  So I personally am in no real hurry to announce a full revision to our exit principles.  But that said, I do take the point that it\u2019s a good idea to make some minimalist adjustments to the principles that we have in place, and most of those simply reflect the reality of a substantially larger balance sheet than what we did contemplate in June 2011. Regarding the things that the staff is looking for to tabulate, I definitely think that somehow mentioning that normalization is likely to take longer than three to five years\u2014 whether we\u2019re specific about that or we just take it out\u2014is important as is conveying the idea that we\u2019ll be in no hurry to unload our MBS holdings to get back too quickly to a Treasuries-only SOMA account.  Ultimately, Treasuries-only is the right place to head, but we should reserve as much flexibility on the tactics of that as seems reasonable. In some sense, I think that one way to handle this might possibly be just in a statement from the Chairman or in a paragraph in the minutes.  I don\u2019t know.  I suppose we could label something \u201cExit Principles, version 2.0,\u201d but I\u2019m a little concerned about drawing too much attention to it.  And because many people have made some very good recommendations already about how to handle that, I\u2019m not going to get into that detail too much. The second set of questions I took to be, how do policy developments since June 2011 factor in.  As I was mentioning during the Vice Chairman\u2019s comments, it is very complicated how the thresholds interact with the size of our balance sheet and what we\u2019re going to do with it.  I think that it\u2019s very important for us to continually reinforce the threshold concept of what our policy is.  Our forward guidance\u2014it\u2019s not a trigger; it\u2019s a threshold.  And that will come intoApril 30\u2013play as we contemplate any reserve draining.  As the unemployment rate gets close to the threshold level of 6\u00bd percent, reserve draining might begin about contemporaneously with the expected liftoff of the funds rate\u2014but that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d\u2014if the inflation projection is around 2\u00bc percent or whatever your number is.  If inflation is at the upper tolerance, conditional on what our guidance is, then we\u2019re more likely to view 6\u00bd percent as closer to a trigger in that conditionality. But if the inflation projections are 1\u00bd percent, then I\u2019m in the camp with President Kocherlakota\u2014there\u2019s no reason why we should very quickly withdraw accommodation when inflation is not a problem and unemployment is too high.  Then you would not want reserve draining to start too soon.  I think we\u2019re going to need to judge some type of response function of the funds rate with the unemployment rate and our inflation projection.  It strongly suggests to me that draining will need to be contemporaneous with the decision to actually increase the funds rate at a future meeting.  So that\u2019s how I would think about trying to describe this.  However, having gone through as much detail as I have, I\u2019m not optimistic that we\u2019re going to be able to put that nicely into a principles statement.  But if we could, that would be fine. I think that\u2019s more tactical, and it\u2019s not high principle. The remaining questions I\u2019ve already pretty much answered. I think we can reduce MBS assets slowly.  Terminal SOMA should be Treasuries only.  The path could be simply redemptions, and selling short-term Treasuries, and securities in general; that would be fine by me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with those who have stressed that it served us well to have a set of exit principles.  But circumstances have changed in important ways since we adopted them, and adjusting them soon would have a number of benefits.  First, our adoption of threshold-based forward guidance for the funds rate rendered portions of the existing principles obsolete.  More important, however, the positive market reaction to that shift suggests that we\u2019d be better off recasting the exit principles in a manner that de-emphasizes calendar dates and intervals, instead clarifying the economic conditionality of our future actions.  In particular, I agree that a revised statement of exit principles should de-emphasize details and, instead, emphasize that we\u2019ll use our various tools in support of our chosen stance of monetary policy, and that that stance will be expressed in terms of a target level for short-term interest rates.  Another reason to revise the exit principles is that we\u2019ve already alerted markets that we may alter our MBS strategy. I believe we owe the public greater clarity on this issue as soon as possible.  But I agree with Governor Tarullo and President Lockhart that it\u2019s important to change  April 30\u2013our exit principles in a way that it will be perceived as technical adjustments reflecting changes in our circumstances and not be confused as a shift in our views concerning the appropriate stance of policy.  And I\u2019d say that the availability of a press conference in June could make that an opportune time to adopt a revised policy. Before continuing with the questions for discussion prepared by the staff, I\u2019d like to emphasize how much I agree with Governor Duke and Vice Chairman Dudley.  I think we face a difficult quandary due to our reliance on the fed funds rate as our target.  Our exit strategy really needs to support our new threshold-based forward guidance, but that guidance links moves in the federal funds rate target to evolving economic conditions.  Now, if we stick with the funds rate as our target after exit\u2014and our current forward guidance implicitly takes that as a decision that we\u2019ve made\u2014I don\u2019t see how we avoid draining reserves to establish better control of that rate after we lift the target. But then we face the problem of, how do we, in effect, avoid saying to markets, just as soon as we\u2019ve undertaken draining action, that policy has now been placed on a predetermined course at which a liftoff of our target for the funds rate will happen at some predetermined future date.  So I agree with Governor Duke and Vice Chairman Dudley that it could be extremely advantageous to deal with this quandary and, more generally, to switch to a framework that would focus on a different short-term rate as a target and one that we could control without having to drain enough reserves that the funds rate becomes less idiosyncratic and thin.  And the suggestion that we could focus on the GC repo rate and use standing repo and reverse repo facilities to establish a narrow corridor is something that I really think is deserving of staff study.  It could make sense to be operating in this way not only at the time of liftoff and over the longer run, but also, as Vice Chairman Dudley suggested, possibly even sooner as a way to establish control over a short-term rate. April 30\u2013If we revise the exit principles now, we face the question about what to do in terms of references to the funds rate.  I thought that the proposal circulated by President Kocherlakota very nicely finessed this issue by referring to our acting primarily, in his words, \u201cby influencing the federal funds rate and other market interest rates.\u201d  For now, I think this would be a satisfactory solution, given that the funds rate currently does take center stage in our forward guidance. Over time, it may make sense for us to inform the public that we are considering a number of longer-run options, and that we\u2019re debating their various merits and drawbacks based on our own recent experience and that of other central banks operating with different kinds of procedures. President Kocherlakota\u2019s proposal for a revised exit strategy strips almost all detail of implementation out of the exit principles. I think this has some attraction. At the same time, I think it is important to keep in mind that our exit principles are a communications tool, and that they have worked to reassure the public that we\u2019ve carefully thought about the issues, that we\u2019re confident we have a plan that will work, and that we intend to make sure that any asset sales that we undertake will not disrupt financial markets.  But I agree with the general point that, as far as the normalization process is concerned, it would be helpful simply to convey that we have a range of tools available to drain reserves, including sales of Treasury securities close to maturity, but that we\u2019ll decide on and communicate the specifics of such operations only as the time approaches. Returning to the questions, on question 3, my preference would be to return in the long run to a SOMA portfolio consisting predominantly, but not necessarily entirely, of Treasury securities. In normal times, I agree that the Fed should not be seen as engaging in credit allocation, although, in the circumstances we\u2019ve been in, I think our MBS holdings have been   April 30\u2013doing a lot of good.  Even after exit, a severe downturn could again confront us with a need to resort to balance sheet policies.  And I thought the staff made a convincing case that, to maintain analytical and operational expertise, it would be prudent to hold, in normal times, at least a modest share of MBS securities in the SOMA portfolio. On question 4, I\u2019d favor eliminating the commitment we\u2019ve made to sell MBS.  First of all, I consider our MBS purchases the most efficacious part of our asset purchase program, and eliminating our commitment to sell them would, on the margin, provide a bit of additional accommodation now.  Second, we\u2019d diminish the risk that we\u2019ll be locked into a program that, when the time comes to execute it, could fuel a sharp backup in MBS yields and mortgage rates.  And of course, from the perspective of reducing capital losses, focusing any sales on securities that are close to maturity is beneficial. So, for these reasons, I would recommend that we eliminate from the revised exit principles our promise to sell MBS, and that we add the possibility that, sometime during exit, we may sell shorter-dated Treasuries.  Given the various uncertainties we face during exit, preserving optionality is valuable"], "2013FOMC20130619meeting.txt": ["MR. LACKER.  I would just suggest consideration of another aspect of timing.  I think our intermeeting experience showed a couple of instances in which communicating about two or more separate aspects of our policy over the next several years sometimes confused markets.  If an effort is made following this meeting, either through our statement or your press conference, to try to clarify markets\u2019 understanding of our strategy, my sense would be that that would be focused on clarifying their understanding of our strategy regarding the reduction in the pace of our asset purchases, and these normalization points could be a substantial distraction from our ability to convey a clear message in that case", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to second both comments.  One is, it\u2019s pretty clear that what people are looking for most is some clarity about dialing back or dialing up, and you\u2019re going to be focusing on that, I think, during the press conference or we may put it in the statement, depending on the discussion.  So this, to me, would be additional noise.  I\u2019m not sure about the timing of it.  And I completely agree with President Plosser.  It\u2019s not clear to me why we would remove one of the tools in our toolkit, depending on circumstances. Bill has been very kind in responding to the specifics.  There is, according to the tabulation, a substantial majority, but if you use the words \u201csubstantial majority,\u201d that sounds like it\u2019s a decided deal, and I do worry about the wording in point 3.  I just wanted to register my agreement with both President Lacker and President Plosser.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  This underscores the certainty that we would not\u2014 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It\u2019s not certain\u2014a substantial majority favors it.  I think that\u2019s accurate", " MR. FISHER.  Did you say they would not be surprised", " MR. FISHER.  And then, regarding your discussion of the JGB implementation challenges, I would be grateful to be briefed on that\u2014not now, but at some point.  I wouldn\u2019t want to take up the rest of the table. I do have a comment about the dynamics of high-yield debt, Mr. Chairman.  Again, Simon is in better contact than I am, but my sense is that the sophisticated guys have gotten out of that market.  I mean, we\u2019re seeing in the past two weeks record sales from the ETFs and mutual funds.  If my memory is correct from my old practice, the standard spread for high yield was LIBOR plus 900.  Right now we are at LIBOR plus 450 or so.  And then if you look atwho\u2019s selling the stuff, most of them have only been in the business of late\u2014they\u2019re kids.  So I worry that we have to think about the consequences of our policy, and then how we express ourselves and what the Chairman says during his press conference:  How is this corps of kids going to manage to guide a $2 trillion bond market through a 450 basis point adjustment.  It\u2019s a comment, but also in a way a question, because this is a very tight spread, and this is a significant market.  Again, my perception, talking to my contacts on the street, is that the big boys are out.  And then when you talk to the people that are on the receiving end of the sales pitches, there\u2019s almost a desperation of those trying to sell these deals right now, and you\u2019re seeing that reflected in some of the outflows now from the ETFs and the mutual funds.  But it\u2019s important to understand the dynamics.  It\u2019s a different experience base, and we can\u2019t quantify that, but I\u2019m a little worried about how it\u2019s going to be managed as rates rise.  Is that a legitimate concern", "MR. KAMIN.  Then going to the welfare implications, it could be that bottling the natural gas in the United States is helpful to U.S. manufacturing, but that might not be beneficial to overall welfare.  The dynamic spin-offs from the improvements in manufacturing competitiveness might not end up being that great, and we might be better off just acting as a primary commodity exporter and reaping the income gains from that", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If you indulge me for one more question, in exhibit 3 you have the fiscal impetus shrinking very substantially in 2014 and 2015.  President Williams, I think there were some reports of research at the San Francisco Fed, the thrust of which was thatfiscal restraint was going to be much greater going forward.  If you\u2019re not aware of this, I don\u2019t want to put you on the spot, but is there an easy resolution between that research and this from the Board staff", " MR. LACKER.  Yes, I\u2019d like to follow up on this.  I was puzzled by the numbers in the panel of exhibit 3 referred to as \u201cFiscal Impetus,\u201d which shows the percentage point contribution to real GDP growth.  You may have just answered my question because it shows a number well below negative 1, and the Tealbook reports minus 0.7 for 2013.  I ask this because the change is pretty substantial between 2013 and 2014, which is, of course, the measure of the lift we would get from the waning of fiscal drag.  Yet in the Tealbook, it goes from negative 0.7 to negative 0.4, which is about 0.3 less than what was shown here.  Is this the reconciliation that this panelthat shows contributions to real GDP growth is relative to some trend, is that right.  Do I have the right Tealbook", " MR. LACKER.  Okay", "  [Laughter] MR. ROSENGREN.  The SEC has announced their new proposal, which I had hoped would reduce financial stability concerns for money market funds.  Unfortunately, as structured, it\u2019s not at all clear that the SEC proposal will produce greater financial stability, and I just wanted to highlight three problems. First, for institutional prime money market funds, which account for approximately 40 percent of the industry, the proposal would require a floating NAV under one potential reform option.  Unfortunately, it\u2019s not clear how many assets will, in reality, be priced.  For assets with a maturity of 60 days or less, funds will continue to be able to use amortized costs rather than market values.  Since two-thirds of prime money market fund securities have remaining final maturities of 60 days or less and weighted average maturities of approximately 43 days, a fund\u2019s net asset value still will not reflect market values for a significant percentage of assets.  As a result, funds will have an incentive to purchase volatile and risky assets with less than 60 days to maturity because funds can avoid reporting market values for that subset of assets in their holdings.  By smoothing fluctuations in the reported NAV, investors may be misled about the underlying risk in a fund\u2019s portfolio. Second, retail prime money market funds will not be required to have a floating NAV.  Presumably this is predicated on the fact that such funds have historically experienced lower run-   risk vis-\u00e0-vis institutional prime funds.  However, a significant number of both retail and institutional prime funds have taken significant credit risk and required sponsor support.  Thus, prime retail funds also should be required to have a floating NAV, with all assets priced at market values. And third, the second option allows the money market fund board at their discretion to impose gates or redemption fees.  Since it is at the discretion of the money market fund board, I would view this second option as the do-nothing option.  This alternative likely increases flight risk because when fees or gates are triggered by explicit events, investors will be able to reasonably perceive the imposition of a gate or fee and thus will be incented to run in advance.  In addition, the imposition of gates and/or redemption fees by one prime fund will provide a strong incentive for investors of other funds to redeem as well, in anticipation of those funds also possibly imposing gates and/or fees. It\u2019s regrettable that important alternative enhancements already have been discarded in narrowing the reform options to two.  However, if from this point forward one focuses only on the SEC options that have been included, it would be important that the SEC ensures that valuations do reflect market values on all of the assets under the floating NAV option so that the NAV truly floats.  I would hope that the FSOC will not be passive, given that the SEC proposal falls far short of what we would like to see to reduce financial stability concerns", "  And that is being done on an ongoing basis, actually, in New York to calculate the\u2014 MR. POTTER.  I think it\u2019s the reverse, right.  The prepayment risk is higher right now.  The duration is going to extend massively as rates go up", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast is similar to that of the Tealbook and to my submission for the previous SEP.  However, I have a somewhat easier monetary policy assumption than in the Tealbook, with purchases being reduced somewhat this year but extended into next year, for a cumulative total over $1 trillion.  With that assumption, I expected the unemployment rate to reach 7.3 percent at the end of the year and 6.7 percent at the end of next year.  My forecast for inflation has changed somewhat.  While I had among the lowest inflation forecasts in the previous SEP submission, I have lowered my inflation forecast a bit further to reflect that actual inflation outcomes continue to surprise on the downside. While working on the forecast, I wrestled with three issues.  The first is that inflation outcomes have been significantly less than expected.  The core PCE index is now at a low for the historical series at 1.05 percent.  Total PCE is now at 0.7 percent.  The Tealbook assumes that these are temporary aberrations, and that we will soon be back on a path that gradually approaches 2 percent.  While this is probably the best estimate, our confidence that expectations are so well anchored that we do not need to be concerned about persistently low inflation is certainly being stretched.  The TIPS five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation measure is now as low as it has been since 2011, and some measures of inflation expectations also have been drifting down. While some may be reassured that the CPI measures of inflation are not as low as the PCE measures, our target is expressed in terms of the PCE measure.  The choice of the PCE measure for our target is based on the belief that it is a better measure of inflation.  The PCE measure, by construction, better addresses substitution effects, and it employs spending weightsfrom a business rather than a household survey.  Furthermore, research by my staff has found that when there are large gaps between CPI and PCE inflation rates, the CPI series tends to correct toward the PCE.  While not conclusive, this evidence suggests some caution in how to interpret the very low PCE inflation rates.  The risks of persistent PCE inflation misses becoming more embedded in expectations is one of the reasons why my forecast has been predicated on somewhat more accommodation than assumed in the Tealbook. The second issue I wrestled with is the underlying strength in the economy, particularly given the recent increase in interest rates, with most long rates 40 to 50 basis points higher now than at our previous meeting.  It is noteworthy that the restrictive fiscal policy has not resulted in a larger adverse impact on the economy, given the significant tax increases at the beginning of the year and the sequestration starting to bite.  In part, I attribute this to accommodative monetary policy that has helped to offset the fiscal restraint.  Comparing final sales to domestic purchasers with final sales to private domestic purchasers shows roughly a 1 percent difference, with government spending accounting for the slower growth in final sales to domestic purchasers.  The risk is that higher interest rates may cause a slowdown in residential investment and consumer durables so that they provide less of an offset for the restrictive fiscal policy.  While my forecast assumes enough underlying strength so that this does not happen, as well as a reduction in the fiscal headwinds, the recent interest rate movements mean that I will be watching quite carefully the interest-sensitive sectors over the next several months. The third issue is the strength of the labor markets.  The unemployment rate is at 7.6 percent.  It is certainly lower than last September.  Furthermore, decreases in unemployment rates have been widespread across states.  Particularly encouraging is that some of the hardest hit states, such as California, Nevada, and Florida, have shown some of the most significantimprovements.  I would attribute part of this improvement to our actions, since these are all states that had been disproportionately affected by falling residential real estate prices and have been among the states that have most benefited from lower mortgage rates and rising residential housing prices.  Despite these positive signs, the employment\u2013population index is little changed from last fall, and the three-month moving average of payroll employment is only 155,000 jobs per month, hardly the significant improvement I was hoping to see.  While my forecast assumes that we continue to experience a gradual improvement in labor markets, and that the unemployment rate ends the year at 7.3 percent, I worry that further increases in long rates could cause the economy to grow less than I have forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In our conversations with directors and contacts across the Sixth District, there was little change of sentiment from earlier in the year regarding economic and business prospects for the remainder of the year.  Sentiment was not uniform, but, to generalize, our contacts perceived the downside risks to have lessened somewhat as the year has progressed.  But, at the same time, we detected little conviction that there would be a marked improvement in business conditions and a meaningful pickup of activity in the second half.  We also heard from our contacts a repeat of themes that we had heard in earlier months:  holding fire on expansion-oriented investment, investment instead for productivity gain, reticence to hire additional workers, and uncertainty regarding the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Our anecdotal inputs this cycle presented a mixed picture that has not materially changed from recent months and suggests some caution in assuming a breakout to higher, broad-based growth in coming months.  My forecast submission, based on my Bank\u2019s reading of the data andanecdotal soundings, reflects this ambivalence.  My submission did not change greatly from my March forecast.  The basic narrative of the economy, as I see it, is a continuing modest pace of growth, with the second half a little better than the first half.  I am projecting acceleration in 2014 from 2.3 percent this year to just short of 3 percent next year.  But I confess that my conviction weakens as I try to predict 2014 and 2015.  My forecast anticipates steady progress in employment conditions, with an assumption of continuity at around 175,000 jobs per month for payrolls.  And my forecast treats the current low inflation readings as transitory, with gradual convergence to the Committee\u2019s target.  All that said, the most disquieting element in the current picture is inflation.  The price numbers could indicate the economy is weaker than I think.  We have spent considerable effort in Atlanta parsing the incoming price data.  Various cuts of the data do not, in my opinion, suggest the breadth or degree of downward price pressure we saw in 2010.  Still, it is hard to dismiss the softer incoming numbers, although this morning\u2019s CPI data are encouraging. Prior to this morning\u2019s reading, the sticky-price CPI\u2014a snapshot of the CPI market basket focused on prices that tend not to adjust very often, and may, therefore, be more forward looking\u2014has been slowing recently.  Also, Atlanta\u2019s most recent Business Inflation Expectations Survey showed a small drop in expectations of unit cost increases for inputs over the next 12 months.  These are small changes, and I don\u2019t want to overstate their meaning.  I think the case for a gradual strengthening of prices in the near term and a relatively quick return to our inflation target is a little stronger based on this morning\u2019s data, but still rather weak. I am viewing the risks to my outlook on GDP growth, unemployment, and inflation as broadly balanced, at least over the near term.  However, the current circumstances of weak quarterly growth and soft inflation indicators make me feel a little apprehensive about thisforecast and whether the risks are truly balanced.  But for the moment, that\u2019s my story, and I\u2019m sticking to it\u2014a well-worn Washington expression.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The recent private-sector data have been positive on balance.  Consumers seem to be holding their own despite tax increases and very modest wage growth, and the labor market is doing considerably better than it was last September.  Still, in a truly vibrant labor market, we would have seen a breakout in hiring, and some soft spots remain.  For example, our temporary employment contacts have seen flat-to-negative orders over the past several months, and recent months\u2019 employment reports show that 200,000 each month is not yet sustainable. The business sector also has lagged more than I expected.  Investment has been sluggish, and we\u2019re not seeing any signs that cap-ex will turn around anytime soon.  In a typical recovery, some lag in investment would be expected and the delay would not be especially noteworthy.  But in the current episode with its extended period of high unemployment and continued consumer deleveraging, I think we need businesses to lead the recovery by more than what is typical.  And so, especially in light of their relatively healthy financial condition\u2014as President Fisher pointed out, any CEO worth their salt must have made improvements\u2014I find this business sluggishness a particular downside concern. Regarding my anecdotal contact reports, the news this time was better than the dour commentary I heard last round, but it\u2019s still far from uplifting.  As you, Mr. Chairman, heard firsthand two weeks ago, my directors are stingy with their upbeat reports.  Many of the director and business messages are pretty mixed, and that\u2019s an improvement.  For example, both Caterpillar and Deere were relieved that their sales had not dropped off further.  Still, their businesses are much softer than they had initially planned for this year.  Even if sales improve in the second half of the year, these heavy-equipment manufacturers are unlikely to shift into anexpansionary mode with regard to cap-ex or hiring.  Indeed, in the United States, they currently are contracting slightly by making small layoffs in mining and construction equipment manufacturing. Among my international business reports, the general consensus is that Europe is doing horribly, but that the downturn may have bottomed out.  At the same time, China\u2019s long-awaited rebalancing seems to be in train and appears to be heading for the lower range of expected growth, say, in the neighborhood of 6 to 7 percent. On a positive note, when talking with the business community, it remains clear that our accommodative monetary policies are helping to support growth.  My auto contacts continue to report strong light motor vehicle sales, and they cite attractive financing rates as an important contributing factor. Although mortgage rates have risen recently, they remain low and help support the improved environment for home sales and residential construction.  Increasingly, competitive lending rates for small businesses are also a positive factor.  One of my banking directors who runs a medium-sized community development bank noted that small business customers are confident enough to seek concessions on rates and terms on bank loans.  He said if a customer is hearing about deals getting done in the 4\u00bd to 5\u00bd percent interest rate range, they are coming in and asking for 3 to 3\u00be percent.  My last CDIAC meeting also had an extended discussion about greater competition for borrowers and broken interest rate floors.  This isn\u2019t great news for bankers, but it is good news for small businesses.  It\u2019s another sign that our policies are having broader competitive effects on the economy, and that\u2019s an excellent development. My national outlook has not changed much since our previous meeting.  We\u2019ve revised our forecast for growth in 2013 down a bit.  The main reason is that we finally threw in the towelon the hope that a compromise agreement might scale back the sequestration.  We\u2019ve also brought down our inflation forecast some.  Here, recent developments point to a substantial risk that inflation will undershoot our 2 percent long-run objective for much too long of a period, unless, of course, we have a sufficiently robust recovery. Accordingly, in constructing my SEP projections under appropriate monetary policy, I assume a substantially more accommodative stance than the Tealbook.  Specifically, we assume that our LSAPs continue through the first half of 2014 and that the funds rate remains unchanged until late 2015.  I also assume importantly that our communications to the public convey a strong confidence that the Fed will employ our tools as long and as fully as necessary.  With these policy assumptions, my SEP projections have growth accelerating to above potential in 2014 and 2015.  This forecast is also premised on many normal recovery factors, including pent-up demand and the waning of deleveraging effects.  Under our assumed appropriate policy path, the inflation trajectory reaches our 2 percent objective a bit more quickly than in the Tealbook\u2019s extended projection.  It gets there in 2016, just beyond the SEP forecast horizon.  In addition, our longer-run inflation projection displays a modest overshooting of 2 percent.  I see this as being consistent with my reading of optimal policy in the monetary economics literature, and also with our view that appropriate policy takes a balanced approach and that inflation misses are symmetric about our 2 percent target.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My views haven\u2019t changed significantly since the previous meeting.  I\u2019m still uncertain about how the tug of war between the large amount of fiscal drag and improving underlying fundamentals will play out. Relative to the Tealbook, I\u2019m a bit more pessimistic about the near-term outlook\u2014that is, that the growth rate during the second half will pick up appreciably.  As I noted at the previous meeting, I don\u2019t see the factors in place for an early reacceleration in economic activity.  Fiscal drag and slowing growth abroad are significant constraints.  They are likely to offset to a large degree the positive effects of the housing recovery and higher household wealth.  My assessment is that since the previous meeting, the data have been mixed at best.  While it\u2019s true that consumer spending has held up quite well and housing is recovering, against this you have lack of momentum in terms of investment, weakness in manufacturing activity, signs that growth abroad is still slowing, and a tightening of financial market conditions.  With respect to financial market conditions, it\u2019s true that stock prices have held up relatively well, but in terms of fixed-income markets, we\u2019ve had a roughly 50 basis point rise in long-term Treasury yields and comparable rises in other corporate bond and mortgage rates. With respect to labor market conditions, I would characterize the recent payroll employment gains as high relative to the growth rate of economic activity.  In other words, I think they overstate the improvement in the labor market.  Also, when I\u2019m looking at the labor market, I\u2019m struck by the fact that the hiring rate remains depressed and has not improved much over the past few years.  The improvement in net hiring has come almost exclusively through a slowdown in the pace of layoffs.  So my conclusion from that is the labor market is still far from being healthy.On the inflation side of the ledger, I\u2019m getting a bit more concerned that inflation will stay too low relative to our objective, compared with the previous meeting where I was relatively unworried.  That\u2019s because inflation expectations, as measured by the five-year, five-year-forward TIPS breakeven yields, have come down about 30 basis points since the previous meeting.  You could argue that we\u2019re still broadly within the range of recent years, but if the downward trend were to continue, then you\u2019d have to say we were in some more troublesome territory.  We\u2019d be getting back to where we were in the fall of 2010 and, in that case, the idea was that inflation was going to go up because inflation expectations were anchored; that would be a less-compelling argument now, in my opinion. The biggest issue I have currently is that there seems to be a bias toward rushing to judgment in terms of dialing down the pace of asset purchases.  It\u2019s important to resist the impulse to parse the data in a way to justify an early reduction.  If we try to do that, we\u2019re risking our credibility.  We should be balanced in our assessment of the data.  The fact is that the payroll gains we\u2019ve seen overstate the growth momentum of the economy.  If in subsequent months the data are consistent with a dialing down of the rate of asset purchases, I\u2019ll be very supportive of such an action.  I won\u2019t be happy, however, if what we do is rationalize why it\u2019s okay to dial down when such an action is not really supported by the data and the outlook.  If we do that, it could be viewed as broadly inconsistent with our prior commitment, and that would risk our credibility.  Thank you", "  At this point, that is the question for all of us:  whether Jeff\u2019s capitulation comes just at the point where his previous view would have been vindicated\u2014 MR. LACKER.  Just in time", "  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  \u2014or whether, on the contrary, Janet\u2019s downside concern and the position reflected in Jeff\u2019s capitulation turn out to be the better analysis.  And, like Janet, I think it is going to be hard to tell whether that is the case, at least for a little while yet.   But that does seem a pretty consequential question, because it is going to implicate the question not only of the continuation of the purchases but also what kind of impact we think the more accommodative monetary policy will have over time.  I think many of us would draw fromthat assessment that more accommodation was needed, but presumably at least some of us would draw the conclusion that monetary policy is going to remain relatively ineffective in counteracting those tendencies until there are some more structural changes in the economy.  At some level, that has always been the issue before us, but I felt it was presented in starker relief today than it has been for some time now. I have a bunch of stuff here, most of which has already been said by other people, so I won\u2019t repeat it.  I will just say a couple of things on labor markets.  And this, in a sense, builds on what Esther said, although I think it leans in a slightly different direction.  The point I was going to make around labor markets is essentially that, regardless of what you think about how much improvement there has been, there is quite likely a substantial amount of room for further improvement.  Thus, there is a substantial amount of need for further accommodation.  To begin with, though, it is probably worth reminding ourselves how many currently important questions about labor markets don\u2019t have particularly good answers right now.  For one, we don\u2019t have a good explanation for the decline in the labor force participation rate, one that is noticeably greater than the trend which was assumed prior to the recession.  We don\u2019t know, as several people have already alluded to, whether the quits, layoffs, job openings, and other indicators of labor market dynamism will return to pre-recession levels or, as in the past two much milder recessions, they will never get there.  And we don\u2019t know whether, given the severity of this recession, the change to a new normal will be even greater.  All of that implicates the broader question of why there has been an apparent secular decline in labor market dynamism over the past 20 years or so.  We have all of those questions, which are potentially quite important and about which there are already debates.  As I say, I don\u2019t have particularly good answers at this juncture.  My second point is that the analytics behind efforts to answer those questions are necessarily complicated by at least a couple of factors.  One, the significant changes in labor markets that have taken place since previous severe U.S. recessions limit the utility of the data and the learning from those recessions in trying to project what is going to happen now.  And, second, the duration of the most recent recession and the slow pace of recovery raise the plausible prospect of hysteresis effects of a sort that we have not really observed previously in U.S. labor markets.  That is, even if one believes, as I do, that the story during the recession and for some time thereafter was one of aggregate demand shortfalls and cyclical unemployment, the persistence of long-term unemployment and the permanent disappearance of so many jobs may now be having some structural effects.  So there may come a time when we will need either to get some good answers to the questions about labor markets I noted a moment ago, or to make some assumptions about what those answers may be, in order to have a working sense of how much can be done to increase employment before we hit up against structural limits. But the third point is that that time hasn\u2019t come.  I would say, on the contrary, that current observations of what is going on in labor markets, and debates around what is going on, suggest that we may be actually further away from that point than we might have thought not so long ago.  Consider, first, that there really is still no evidence of wage inflation.  There is a little bit of a pickup in compensation, but nothing resembling wage inflation across the labor market more generally.  I note that apparently the past few quarters of ECI data may not be very accurate, so we may have to revise that.  But at least, based on what we know, I think that is the case.  Mismatch indexes continue to suggest that at least this particular form of structural limit on employment growth has not become particularly binding.  As Esther pointed out, the dispersionof employment gains is actually, in some sense, a pretty good sign that we are not hitting up against structural limits. The second point I would make in this regard relates to the current state of debate over what is going on in labor markets.  And it is notable that virtually no one is suggesting, for example, that the natural rate of unemployment is at 7 percent.  The debate now is whether it is at 6 percent or whether it is lower.  And, similarly, the question about the unemployment rate that is most discussed is whether it understates labor market slack, not whether it reflects or overstates labor market slack. And third, while the questions I noted earlier would argue against too strong an expectation that any particular labor market indicator will return to its pre-recession level, the fact that so many such indicators are still so far from those levels seems to me to reinforce at least a presumptive inference that while we may not be able to specify with much assurance just how much labor market slack remains, it is very likely to be quite a bit.  So the implication for economic policy, of course, is that quite apart from the issues surrounding the pace and duration of our asset purchase program, which we will discuss tomorrow, there is still a very strong case for substantial accommodation in monetary policy as a whole.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since the time of the April Tealbook, the economy has done a bit better despite the ongoing drag from higher taxes and the sequestration.  But I emphasize the words \u201ca bit\u201d because, compared with how far we have to go, the improvement is really very modest.  In my view, it is far-fetched to think that the economy will run out of available capacity anytime soon, at least as far as the labor market is concerned.  Yes, the unemployment rate has declined more quickly than we had anticipated last summer.  But Ithink part of this is likely due to a further decline in labor force participation, not to a true improvement in labor market conditions.  There could be a number of reasons that people are dropping out of the labor force, and none of them really suggest vastly improved labor market outcomes.  If workers are continuing to become discouraged about job prospects, even this late in the cycle, that surely isn\u2019t good news.  And it indicates to me that there is still substantial labor slack.  But even if some of those workers\u2014the elderly and the disabled\u2014will never rejoin because they consider themselves, and are considered by firms, to be unemployable, that can\u2019t be entirely reflective of an improvement in economic fundamentals in the labor market either. For me, like many of you, the more genuine surprises have occurred on the inflation side.  The core PCE index now stands at 1.05 percent year-on-year.  This is the lowest number in the 50-year history of the series.  And inflation has been running well below the Committee\u2019s September 2012 projection.  We can continue to take comfort in the stability of inflation expectations.  But even here the case has weakened a bit lately.  The five-year-forward TIPS breakeven inflation rate has fallen from close to 2.8 percent at the start of the year to about 2.4 percent late last week, with most of the drop occurring over the past few weeks.  This decline might imply that the recent weak inflation readings have caused long-term inflation expectations to move lower.  I am hoping that this drop is temporary.  Still, between the possibility that inflation expectations may become dislodged to the downside, and the likelihood that many workers continue to withdraw from the labor force not only because of unfavorable demographics trends but also because of discouragement, my view is that the economy is not necessarily poised for a pickup in growth that I would see as reflective of a strengthening in economic fundamentals.Moreover, I continue to view the risks to the outlook as mainly to the downside.  In particular, I remain concerned that despite the rejoicing over last year\u2019s big drop in unemployment, real disposable personal income was essentially flat last year, posting its lowest increase since the recession.  As I have repeatedly noted, such lackluster growth in incomes doesn\u2019t bode well for strong economic growth. Despite what I consider to be only modestly positive economic news, bond yields have been climbing.  At the same time, mortgage and credit spreads have widened, defensive stocks with bond-like characteristics have been selling off sharply, and outflows from the emerging markets have been much more dramatic.  While it is possible that market participants\u2019 views have improved more than mine, I think some of the responsibility for the unsettled financial market conditions and rising rates lies with us and our recent communications.  Some of this may be good, or at least inevitable, because financial conditions are aligning themselves more closely with the intent of the Committee.  But some of this probably isn\u2019t good because market participants may just be confused.  Markets, including global markets, seem to be anticipating not only the end of purchases, but perhaps also an earlier normalization of the funds rate.  Indeed, since the last round, forward rates two to three years ahead shifted up 30 to 50 basis points despite so-so activity data, further declines in core inflation, and no explicit indication from any one of us that we have changed our view on the path of short-term rates.  That sounds like confusion to me. So if short-term rate expectations are changing, I think we are in potentially dangerous territory.  Markets are conflating their expectation for the pace of LSAPs with the path of the funds rate, which raises the risk that even a modest reduction in LSAPs will have much-larger-than-desired economic effects.  If our communications aren\u2019t streamlined with sharper messagesthat help markets disentangle the two effects\u2014expectations for the pace of LSAPs and expectations regarding the path of the funds rate\u2014we may run the risk of tightening much earlier or faster than any of us intends.  I will provide some more focus on this communication aspect during the next round", "  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard, are you attracted to the unemployment contingency rule that was suggested", " MR. BULLARD.  Just to follow up on some of President Plosser\u2019s comments, what would our intent be, say, if unemployment ticks down to 7.4 percent and the staff still forecasts, or the Committee forecasts, that it is going to be a shallow pace of decline in the unemployment rate.  Would we taper at that point or not.  I think that\u2019s a key question about how we\u2019re going to do this.  And then you would say, okay, we\u2019re not going to taper at that point\u2014but then the next month, it goes down to 7.3 percent.  Now you\u2019re that much closer.  How do you envision handling it", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Over the past few meetings, I have expressed my concerns about ongoing aggressive monetary stimulus in the face of a growing economy, and I continue to have those concerns.  That said, my view of the appropriate path for the balance sheet is generally consistent with that of the Tealbook.  With the assumption of $750 billion in total purchases under the current program and a slowing in the pace of purchases over the second half of the year, the Tealbook is forecasting real GDP growth of 3.3 percent in Q4 of this year, with consumption growth projected to be at 3.6 percent.  This would make it the second-strongest quarter for consumer demand since the end of the recession.  From that point, growth is projected to only get stronger, as it is in the central tendency of the SEP.  Given this backdrop, I see applying any accommodation beyond this baseline assumption as raising the risk that we will adjust the pace of purchases too late rather than too soon. I thought Governor Yellen\u2019s analogy yesterday of the driving trip from San Francisco to New York was an interesting one.  It seems to me our challenge today, though, is less about easing off the gas pedal in Denver than about understanding our destination.  Last September, the Committee set its sights on speed and a northeasterly direction, so arriving in Denver understandably lacks clarity as to whether New York was, in fact, our destination [laughter] and how far we will continue in a northeasterly direction and at what speed. Alternative B attempts to introduce a signal that the Committee is preparing to reduce the pace of purchases assuming sufficient further improvement in labor market conditions.  Given the Chairman\u2019s recent comments about this possibility over the next few meetings and the market\u2019s heightened sensitivity to this prospect, I\u2019m concerned that the signal in the statement as written may not be forceful enough.  Simply acknowledging that downside risks have diminishedmay not lead the public to believe that the Committee is prepared to act in the near term, especially with no change in purchases at this meeting.  Accordingly, I could have supported alternative B if it were more deliberate in its attempt to signal an intention to begin reducing the pace of purchases as early as September.  A clearer signal that the pace of purchases could be curtailed would help pull in market expectations in line with the Tealbook assumptions and lay the groundwork for such a reduction in the very near future.  I do not find that the language in paragraph 4\u2032 of alternative B provides this kind of clarity, although I certainly support its intention to do so.  I think this would be consistent with the Committee\u2019s previous statements, which have made clear that substantial improvement in the labor market outlook is needed to end the purchases, but not necessarily to reduce the pace of such purchases.  Given the ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and the outlook, I view today as the appropriate time to deliberately signal that the pace of purchases will decrease in the very near future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B as written.  I see much evidence to suggest that substantial accommodation is still necessary.  I think we need to wait for more improvement before we begin reducing the pace of purchases.  And at this meeting, I\u2019m not prepared to take any steps that would be perceived as reducing accommodation in a way not supported by changes in the real economy. The proposed changes in paragraph 2 regarding the reduction in downside risks are at the edge of my comfort zone, and I think that this paragraph already communicates that we are beginning to lay the stage for a pullback.  I think the statement in paragraph 1 should recognize the further decline in inflation, but understand the consensus view to be that the dip is transitory.  I concur with both Presidents Williams and Evans in their reactions to the inflation language and would support their views. I agree with the overall message in paragraph 4\u2032 of alternative B, but I\u2019m concerned that we haven\u2019t done the groundwork yet for making such a huge change in the statement itself rather than laying the stage in the press conference.  Just from a cosmetic perspective, I count 20 new lines of text in paragraph 4\u2032 and the removal of 6 lines of text.  We should not do this without greater confidence\u2014and I\u2019m not saying perfect confidence\u2014but some greater confidence that we will know, if not the magnitudes, then at least the direction that markets will take from this messaging.  A little more certainty from our perspective might tell us, for example, whether amessage in the statement is going to lead financial markets to further tighten, precipitate earlier contraction, or possibly be mildly expansionary.  I\u2019ve just heard too much around this table this morning to know for sure.  I also wonder how markets will take it that we\u2019re removing the sentence added to last meeting\u2019s statement so early.  Do we really want to be appearing so uncommitted to such recently inserted language. Also, communication only begs for more communication.  In this regard, what would markets say about our silence on the next communication vacuum, which, to me, is the composition of purchases between Treasuries and agency MBS.  And does this silence itself create additional uncertainty.  But I appreciate the need to provide clarity.  I think the press conference provides the opportunity to remind markets of some of the statement\u2019s existing messages, and there are plenty of existing messages we could hammer in on that haven\u2019t been fully appreciated by markets yet.  Not just markets, but we also don\u2019t know definitively whether banks, while making substantial steps toward responding to interest rate risk through their risk management practices, have themselves fully appreciated the potential timing of a possible surge in interest rates. So hearing the messages again will itself underscore their importance and maintain the Committee\u2019s steady course while signaling how we intend to move forward with reductions in the pace of purchases in the context of financial stability.  So first, and I think you intend to do this, Mr. Chairman, we need to emphasize that there are a number of exits we have to manage.  There are actually two exits, not just one.  Markets and the public don\u2019t seem, though, to fully understand that there are purchases and then there\u2019s the federal funds rate.  And each exit, as we\u2019ve been discussing, has different criteria.  If we permit markets to conflate the two exits, we will cause more confusion, and we will run the risk of a premature contraction.  Beginning toclarify the stopping rule for purchases is a good idea, and we should explore how it interacts with the perception of the second exit, which, again, is the liftoff of the federal funds rate.  I think there\u2019s confusion about what happens when we hit the 6.5 percent unemployment threshold.  I think the trigger\u2013threshold distinction isn\u2019t fully grounded in the thinking of market participants.  Some market participants continue to think that the 6.5 percent figure is our view of full employment.  Others are ignoring the lower-for-longer language, and the decision by the Committee to look at other labor market indicators is not one that the markets have fully considered.  So I think our projections, in fact, might raise the confusion factor because they show that we\u2019ll come to the threshold earlier than we had anticipated and perhaps earlier than markets had anticipated.  So at the same time that we\u2019re contemplating an early reduction in purchases, we\u2019re also, by virtue of our forecasts, contemplating an early crossing of the threshold, which to many market-participant minds will entail an earlier liftoff of the federal funds rate. Third, markets seem to think that the reduction in purchases will be on a predetermined path, but we want to slow our purchases according to how the economy progresses.  This means that markets must learn that there\u2019s the potential for us to pause in engaging in reductions or to increase purchases.  We need to communicate such possibilities so that it\u2019s the state of the economy that\u2019s the real driver. Fourth, markets are confused about whether financial stability concerns would put an end to all monetary accommodation.  Given our close eye on the reaction of term premiums and their potential to suddenly mushroom, we could begin to think about clarifying that financial stability concerns could halt purchases but may not halt the need for additional forms of stimulus, if necessary.So it seems to me there are many aspects that we need to clarify:  that there are two distinct exits, not one; that 6.5 percent unemployment is not full employment, and it\u2019s not a trigger; that other labor market indicators will be relevant to raising the fed funds rate; that a reduction in purchases will not happen on a predetermined path; and that if we begin to see dangerous threats to financial stability prior to the economy being self-sustaining, we would look for substantial forms of accommodation, if necessary.  I\u2019d like the press conference remarks to be used to lay the foundation of these messages to markets, so that our later tightening this year will occur if economic conditions warrant and will occur without triggering dangerous levels of instability.  Thank you", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I have a ladder, please.  [Laughter]  I favor alternative B.  At the margin, though, I think the statement is a bit too optimistic sounding in mentioning the improvement in household spending, business fixed investment, and the housing sector, and omitting references to areas where the data have deteriorated, such as the weakness evident in manufacturing.  I know I\u2019m not going to get this, but I would actually prefer to have some of the language from paragraph 1 of alternative A referencing the slowdown in the manufacturing sector moved from alternative A to alternative B.  I understand I\u2019m not going to get it, but I really worry that alternative B by itself is going to be perceived as a bit hawkish relative to expectations.  And then on top of that, we\u2019re going to impose this path for reducing purchases, so we\u2019re actually setting the stage for maybe a bigger market reaction and a greater tightening of financial market conditions than is, in fact, actually necessary.  So I worry a little bit about that.  In the same vein, and this may actually be more live, I would agree with others who want to strike the word \u201csomewhat\u201d from paragraph 1 in terms of the reference to inflation.  I\u2019m perfectly happy with the introductory phrase \u201cpartly reflecting transitory influences.\u201d  I think that\u2019s, in fact, accurate. In terms of giving guidance about how we might dial down purchases at some future date, I think that\u2019s very much best left to the press conference rather than the statement, particularly at this meeting, but I think even beyond that, potentially.  First, our actions are supposed to be data-dependent.  So overemphasizing a particular path in the statement is in opposition to that.  Also, highlighting a detailed path in the statement creates a hurdle orthreshold to not following that path, which I think is inconsistent with the notion that our actions are supposed to be data-dependent.  Second, if we were to put this in the statement, I worry about how we would alter the statement subsequently if the data weren\u2019t to conform with our expectations.  What\u2019s the threshold for such changes.  So we sort of get locked into a particular path, which, I think, then reduces the data dependency of our policy, which is what I think has made it so effective. I certainly agree that giving the market more guidance about our reaction function is important, but I think we want to do it in a way that retains our flexibility to respond to the data, and do so in a way that\u2019s consistent with our earlier commitment, which is to follow an outcome-based policy, not a time-based policy.  For this reason, I very much favor the Chairman explicitly referencing that our central tendency forecast anticipates an unemployment rate of about 7 percent around the middle of next year.  To tie the stopping rule for purchases to an outcome rather than just to a date without highlighting the 7 percent unemployment rate\u2014the market would just be focusing exclusively on two dates:  the start of dialing down, this fall; and the end date, the middle of 2014. I think we need to pull them away from that, back to data, because really the policy works on the fact that it is outcome based.  The more you step away from an outcome-based, data-dependent program back to a time-based program, you\u2019re really moving away from the original conception of this program.  That conception was whatever it takes, and the whatever-it-takes aspect of this program was really important because it really removed the downside risks to the economic outlook because the market participants understood that the Fed was going to be prepared to take away that risk.  We want to do as much as possible to preserve that idea of taking away the downside risk.I also agree with Governor Yellen that characterizing the forecast more broadly is important\u2014not just referencing the 7 percent unemployment rate, but also referencing the growth path that we anticipate at the time.  Remember, when we said this, this was about the labor market outlook.  It wasn\u2019t about reaching a given destination in terms of the unemployment rate.  It was about the fact that we thought that growth was picking up and the unemployment rate would continue to decline going forward.  So I think that some notion of the growth momentum is also important to reference. Finally, I promised yesterday that I would say something about communications.  So I will say something about communications.  There\u2019s no question that some of the backup in yields is just due to the fact that things are changing and the market is starting to anticipate a change in our policy, and that\u2019s unavoidable.  But I think we did, as a Committee, contribute to the backup in yields by not being clear in terms of our communications, and I think we\u2019re relying too much on the Great Communicator to do all the work.  I think the Committee has a responsibility in terms of how we communicate.  I think there are three things that we need to do on communication.  Number one, I think we need to continue to communicate that our actions are dependent on the data, not on time.  I think we need to just be very consistent with that.  Second, I think we need to be clear that the outlook is uncertain.  Even though we\u2019re laying out this baseline path, if things deviate from that baseline path, policy will be adjusted accordingly.  We don\u2019t want to get the market locked into this particular path.  Third, and most important, it\u2019s imperative, in terms of how we communicate, that we don\u2019t undercut the efficacy of our own policy.  This goes to Governor Powell\u2019s comment about not talking about, well, we\u2019re dialing this back because the costs of purchases are so horrible\u2014that\u2019s basically undercutting the efficacy of the policy.  I think thatonce a decision has been made by the Committee, we all should want the policy to be as effective as possible.  And I think what that means is that you should argue vociferously within this venue for the policy that you want, but, once the policy is decided, you should speak in a way that actually makes that policy more likely to be effective and succeed rather than undercut it by telling people why this is the wrong policy, why the policy will result in disastrous outcomes.  I just don\u2019t think that makes sense in terms of what the Committee is trying to accomplish.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me finish.  I think that it is certainly worth considering saying that we will continue purchases, adjusting as we make progress, but ending when labor market conditions have improved substantially, which will be consistent with about a 7 percent unemployment rate.  Something like that.  I think that would be a good place to go; I think it\u2019s at least worth looking at. That being said, and I am happy to do any votes or whatever anybody wants to do.  What I heard was a lot of concern that we not do that immediately.  So the intermediate strategy, which I would propose\u2014and I invite reactions\u2014is what I called the \u201csoft option,\u201d in which I will saythat we expect to end by midyear.  At midyear, unemployment would be around 7 percent, growth would be solid enough to provide additional job gains, and inflation would be returning to its target\u2014so, a very soft indicator of what we are aiming for.  And then, that could be hardened in July, if that\u2019s where we want to go.  Now, again, I am very open to doing the harder version, but I believe that there is too much opposition at this point.

So, President Bullard, how are you going to explain your dissent in the statement that goes out"], "2013FOMC20130731meeting.txt": [" MS. REMACHE.  Thank you, Simon.  The Committee received a memo ahead of this meeting, prepared jointly by Board and New York staff, outlining details for a potential overnight reverse repurchase agreement (RRP) facility.  The memo described how such a facility might work, drawing parallels to interest on excess reserves (IOER).   In concept, paying interest on excess balances held at the central bank could create a hard floor for relevant market rates.  In practice, the firmness of that floor depends on a number of factors, including whether the central bank rate is offered to a sufficiently wide set of market participants.  In the case of IOER, a number of key money market lenders are unable to access the IOER rate, and we observe that market rates are below, often well below, the IOER rate.  That spread can be attributed both to costs related to arbitrage, such as the FDIC assessment on all bank liabilities, and imperfect competition arising from credit or other counterparty constraints, which limit the extent to which institutions are willing and able to compete away rate differentials.   An overnight RRP facility would expand the range of market participants with access to an overnight risk-free instrument from the Federal Reserve, beyond depository institutions with direct access to IOER.  As with IOER, under the fixed-rate, full-allotment framework, counterparties with direct access to the facility should generally be unwilling to lend to private institutions at a rate below the facility rate.  They may also be willing to engage in arbitrage to pull other market rates toward this rate.  The facility could have a stabilizing effect on money market rates because the facility rate is pre-announced and because counterparties can adjust their participation daily.  This may reduce volatility and tighten the linkage of rates across money markets.  It could also strengthen the bargaining position of market participants with access to the facility in their own negotiations for overnight lending.   While these possible dynamics suggests an overnight RRP facility could be a useful tool in managing overnight interest rates, the memo highlights four important open issues.  First, the appropriate level for the facility rate relative to the IOER rate, the fed funds target, and other market rates is a key determinant of the effect of the facility on money market rates and intermediation flows.  Further staff work is neededto evaluate options in terms of their effectiveness in meeting the Committee\u2019s policy objectives.   Second, the average degree of take-up from the facility and its variation is difficult to anticipate ex ante.  The staff can foresee reasonable scenarios in which the facility has a meaningful impact on market rates but usage would be small\u2014for example, if the facility establishes a strong reservation rate from a key set of money market lenders\u2014and others scenarios where usage would be large\u2014for example, if money market mutual funds are able to pass along more of an increase in their returns to shareholders than banks do to depositors, in which case one might see a notable shift of depositors from banks toward money market mutual funds.   Third, if the facility, or any reserve draining facility for that matter, leads to further declines in brokered fed funds volumes, it could increase the risk that the fed funds effective rate would be dominated by idiosyncratic trading activity and so would become an ineffective proxy for the broader level of overnight market rates.  Such an outcome could raise the need for the Committee to consider an alternative policy target.   Finally, a key issue is whether the current set of RRP counterparties is sufficiently wide to have the desired effect on market rates.  Counterparties have been expanded significantly over the past several years and now include 18 DIs, 4 of the 12 FHLBs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and 94 of the largest money market funds, in addition to the 21 primary dealers.  Nevertheless, further expansion could be helpful.   In order to exercise operational readiness, the staff has included aspects of a facility like that considered in the memo in the small-scale, real-value RRP exercise planned for August.  For example, the staff plans to exercise the ability of various systems to accommodate a fixed-rate, full-allotment style operation with same day settlement.  These procedural adjustments are unlikely to garner much attention by market participants or counterparties, as the adjustments either affect aspects of the operation, which are not visible to the public, or are within the scope of normal activities of this kind.  This exercise falls with the current authority to conduct small-scale, real-value exercises and, in addition to confirming the ability to implement an overnight RRP facility like that considered in the memo, would be valuable as part of general RRP readiness because it provides more options within our current RRP planning efforts. Looking ahead, if Committee interest in an overnight RRP facility is high, the staff could pursue a number of additional initiatives to prepare and gain further insight into such a facility.  First, the staff could begin work to identify additional types of counterparties for further expansion.  Second, the Committee may wish to consider other variations of planned RRP exercises, possibly also including ones that may result in larger usage of the facility.  And, third, the Committee may wish to develop a broader communication plan about the facility.  If the Committee would find it helpful, the staff could prepare a memo that would discuss options foradditional exercise and communication strategies for the Committee\u2019s consideration at a future meeting.   At this time, Simon and I would be happy to take any comments or questions regarding the overnight RRP facility or recent market developments.  Thank you", "MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was left feeling somewhat puzzled by this memo, certainly not for the lack of energy and thought given to it by the excellent New York staff, but I think the body of the memo leaves one struck with the uncertainty about a number of things.  First of all, I think the authors enumerate conceptually some of the determinants of the spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates but with no quantitative sense of their importance.  I think there is ample evidence of uncertainty about the quantitative effects, particularly the possibility of fairly dramatic shifts between money market funds and bank deposits\u2014shifts that can be quite large for very small errors in our setting of the spread between IOER and the overnight RRP rate.  And then the question is where to set RRP rates.  Now, the puzzling aspect of the memo is that you get to the conclusion, and what it offered as next steps are all operational.  I was eager to hear a proposal to do more research, to actually do some field work to figure out what determines the overnight RRP spread to the IOER.  I would have thought the staff would want to seek a deeper understanding of what\u2019s going on in that market and what determines that spread before undertaking operational experiments.   The broader question here is that it\u2019s not clear to me from this memo what this tries to solve and what you want to control; you want to control something for a purpose.  There\u2019s a reason for that.  We lived for decades with a volatile and variable spread between the target fed funds rates and the overnight RP rate, and it didn\u2019t seem to bother any of us.  Obviously, if that spread widens, we raise the fed funds target rate by more to compensate for it.  And if we think all of the interest rates in the world are keyed off the overnight RRP rate and there\u2019s a spread between that and the thing we control, we can just offset whatever that spread is with the instrument we control.  More broadly, the traditional approach in central banking is to pick a rate and peg it and let the market figure out the appropriate spreads to various other instruments inmarkets where some vagaries of the participants, capital treatment, and the like make the rate slightly different than the rate we\u2019re pegging.  So you\u2019re asking us to go down the road of pegging two rates.  Why stop at two.  And is there some inefficiency about this spread that we\u2019re trying to fix.  I just wasn\u2019t left with a clear picture of the welfare economics of what this is about and what we\u2019re trying to achieve.  I could strongly support further research in this area, but I would discourage going ahead with operational preparations, given what we know about our intervention at this point.  I do see the advantages of an overnight RRP rate as a target to supplant using the IOER as our main instrument for reasons that President Kocherlakota and Vice Chairman Dudley enunciated, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re ready to move ahead with operations at this point", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I share some of the comments that have already been made, so I\u2019ll just be very brief.  I too see the appeal of having an overnight RRP rate as our target.  I think that there are some philosophical as well as other reasons why that might be attractive, and so I, like Jeff, would very much encourage some more research and more exploration. I\u2019m a little bit concerned about moving too operationally in the following sense.  One of the things I thought the memo did was suggest that if we do this, particularly if we start doing this on a large scale, it\u2019s not just the signaling about our policy intentions, but we may do further damage to the federal funds market in terms of undermining its effectiveness and its ability to revive that at some future date.  After all, this Committee has still iterated that its ultimate objective is to use the federal funds rate as our primary target, and if we do something that risks undermining the effectiveness and mechanism of that market, we could find ourselves backedinto a corner if we\u2019re not careful.  So I\u2019m a little bit worried about not doing it in a way that undermines the ability to have a choice later on about which instrument we want to use.  That\u2019s one part where I think we need to be very careful. And the other is the governance issue, which I remain a little bit concerned about.  Right now, we have what amounts to a gentleman\u2019s agreement, if you will, that we will discuss the funds rate target, and that would be translated into IOER.  We need to be a little clearer, though.  It\u2019s not obvious to me that the governance that we have implies that the FOMC would set this rate.  I would think that if that\u2019s not the case that we ought to assure ourselves that that\u2019s the way it would operate before we lock ourselves into a different strategy.  Those would be my two concerns that I think we need to be careful about", " MS. DUKE.  Just to jump in one more time", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess I was asking a slightly different question.  If the monetary policy assumptions hadn\u2019t changed, how much bigger would have been the downward revision in the GDP forecast.  Because right now you have a lot of stuff mushed together.  You have all of the economic developments, plus you have the monetary policy assumption change.  It\u2019s very hard, for me at least, to parse out what the forecast would look like if you hadn\u2019t changed the monetary policy assumptions.  I can\u2019t tell how much of the downgrade is being offset by the monetary policy assumption.  Now, maybe you\u2019re saying that the market moves sort of trumped the monetary policy assumptions, so we didn\u2019t really factor the monetary policy assumption changes into the forecast", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Right.  But presumably if we really were only doing $750 billion, financial market conditions would have been a lot tighter than they are today, right.  And the economy would presumably be weaker.  I just felt that was a little unclear in the Tealbook.  I was a little confused by that.  How about the oil price question", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  But my question is more, how is the staff thinking about the effects of that on the consumption path  Because they got this benefit in\u2014what was it, April, May\u2014from gasoline prices falling a lot.  Now gasoline prices are rising quite a bit.  Is that important, or you just viewed it as transitory", " MR. PLOSSER.  My question was the same as President Dudley\u2019s about the monetary policy assumptions.  I would like to just push a little harder.  If I remember correctly, in August of last year, the presumptions of the staff memo said that, for $500 billion of additional purchases, you get somewhere between 0.1 and 0.2 percentage point reduction in unemployment after two years and about the same or a little less rise in inflation after two years.  So by adding roughly $500 billion of purchases to your assumption, going out only until the middle of next year, I am presuming that the effects of the additional LSAPs were pretty trivial.  Is that a simple way to think about the fact that other stuff really didn\u2019t make much difference in your forecast", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The incoming data have caused me to reduce my growth estimate for the year directionally in line with the Tealbook.  Tomorrow morning\u2019s number will tell us if the tracking estimates of various parties, including that of my own Bank, correctly foretold a weak second quarter.  My outlook has real GDP for the year 2013 coming in at or below, but near, 2 percent, similar to the growth record over much of the recovery period.  The downward adjustment for the year is of course just arithmetic.  For now, my forecast continues to anticipate a step-up in economic activity in the second half with increasing momentum in 2014.  The underpinnings of that outlook are an attenuating fiscal drag, recovering Europe, helping net exports, and positive benefits from generally growing business and consumer confidence bolstered by a continued housing rebound and increased household wealth. As I read the data, they present a bit of a puzzle.  By that I mean certain data elements seem difficult to reconcile with others.  President Lacker\u2019s comments drew attention to thisconcern.  Over the past couple of years, job gains at about 1.7 percent a year had been running close to the economy\u2019s trend rate of growth of around 2 percent a year, implying a suppressed trend rate of productivity growth.  The Tealbook captures this notion in the supply-side damage alternative scenario.  But that scenario implies more inflation pressure than is apparent, so I am not yet ready to make that my working assumption.  I think it is more likely that the pace of economic activity will improve than that the rate of employment expansion will slow.  In my baseline outlook, the necessary resolution comes from stronger economic growth consistent with the rate of net new jobs growth sustained around the trend of 190,000 to 200,000 per month. The inflation numbers also strike me as curious.  My staff and I agree with the Tealbook that a variety of special factors have pushed the core PCE measure lower this year.  The most recent CPI report seemed to support the transitory factors hypothesis, but the inflation trend remains well under the Committee\u2019s objective, and I, for one, keep pushing out further my expectation for the timing of getting to target.  It is comforting that inflation expectations appear stable, but, again, I see tension between inflation data elements that seem to call for resolution.  Either inflation numbers have to firm or inflation expectations should adjust downward.  I continue to have inflation firming in my forecast. In conversations with directors and contacts over the recent cycle, we heard mildly positive predictions about the second half.  The outlook of business people was pretty uniformly that the second half would be either a little better or about the same.  It is hard to discern from these conversations whether the 2\u00bd to 3 percent growth rate currently in my projections is supported by business sentiment in my District.  Those contacts able to gauge consumer spending see it advancing only at a modest pace, somewhat at odds with the second-half strength assumed in the Tealbook forecast.  In this cycle, we continued our practice of surveying businessinflation expectations and asking contacts about their pricing power.  These soundings provide little support for the expectation that the downward pressure on prices is likely to ease in the foreseeable future. Regarding the balance of risks, I am going to express some anxiety about the balance of risks.  Even with an optimistic outlook, I have shifted my economic growth balance from neutral to the downside.  I have to admit that this view is partially influenced by my Bank\u2019s growth forecasting track record.  The year 2013 will be the third straight year in which we forecast an acceleration of economic growth over the prior year, only to have to revise downward in response to incoming data.  As I evaluate the record of the SEP central tendencies and the Tealbook, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that I am not the Lone Ranger in that pattern.  Given this experience of growth underperforming my earlier medium-term projection, my state of mind is to be less dismissive of downside contingencies.  The contingencies that concern me include a renewed fiscal uncertainty shock in September, the possibility of sequestration effects still in the pipeline, and a reversal of sentiment in business and consumer circles that has an effect on demand in the second half.  In spite of officially holding to my outlook of improved economic growth, I have to say my confidence that growth is on the verge of accelerating isn\u2019t high.  If someone here, perhaps David Wilcox, wants an over\u2013under bet on a 3 percent growth rate for the next six quarters, I will take the under.  I am also inclined to weigh the risk to my outlook for rising inflation as tilted to the downside.  That means that the bias allows for persistent subpar inflation as a trend without necessarily suggesting accelerating disinflation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The incoming data have been mixed.  The news from the labor market has been relatively encouraging.  But outside of autos, consumer spending is looking pretty sluggish, and the sequestration is adding to an already large fiscal drag.  So, like the Tealbook, we expect tomorrow\u2019s second-quarter GDP number will be distressingly weak.  Also, like the Tealbook, we are predicting a pickup in economic growth in the second half of the year to about a 2\u00be percent pace.  However, there is considerable room for doubt; this pickup is just a forecast.  There is nothing really tangible in the data at the moment that points to an acceleration in economic activity.  This seems to me to be a forecast of hope again.  The same goes for inflation.  Though it is not yet clearly in the data, we think core PCE inflation will increase a bit from its current disturbingly low level as we move through the year.  However, we do not think it will rise quite as fast as the Tealbook. Nevertheless, our hopeful projection for an improvement in economic activity seems consistent with the reports from my business contacts, which were somewhat more positive this round, and I\u2019d like to dedicate the next comment to Governor Duke.  Directors of my small and medium-sized banks offered some of the most upbeat assessments I have heard in a while.  They noted a lot of new activity and demand from small businesses and multifamily real estate within the last month.  So I was glad we got that in before you left.  The reports from automakers were also good.  They continue to remark that low financing rates have supported sales.  However, myother big business contacts were more tempered.  Their tone was best summed up by a story from my Chicago chairman, who runs Manpower Employment Services.  He said that the CEOs of his big Blue Chip clients were sounding more upbeat, and many indicated a greater likelihood of near-term expansion.   But there is a disconnect.  Usually when he hears such talk, it is accompanied by an increase in orders for temporary workers.  Temporary employment services is, after all, a leading indicator.  When he pointed out to the CEOs that their current orders didn\u2019t reflect the same optimism that they just expressed, they backtracked, right-sized their views, and said they weren\u2019t yet confident enough, even at these earliest stages, to pull the trigger on hiring for temps.  So that is a bit of a downside risk, I would say.  Apparently, they will wait until more customers actually walk through their doors before increasing capacity. Now, of course, this has all occurred at the same time that financial conditions have become more restrictive than they have been for quite a while.  At the margin, this could cause businesses to sit on the sidelines even more than they already are.  More important, our forecasts put a great burden on the household sector to kickstart the virtuous cycle of spending and hiring that is needed to achieve a higher path for economic growth.  And that may be a tall order.  Revised data now give a picture of softer consumer expenditures outside of autos, which is consistent with this year\u2019s tax increases weighing on household budgets.  And many households still face underwater mortgages or other difficulties accessing credit, although that has improved of course.  So I am concerned about the risks to the forecast for consumption and housing, especially now that we have piled on less-attractive borrowing costs and smaller increases in asset prices from here on out. Despite the risks, I still expect that the cyclical repair process will eventually show through to higher economic growth, although continuing strong support from highlyaccommodative monetary policy remains essential to my outlook.  We are forecasting growth will recover to a 2\u00be percent rate in the second half of this year and rise to the 3\u00bd percent range over 2014 and 2015.  I guess I could pause at this point and offer the same type of commentary that President Lockhart did because we were similarly hurt in our outlook for being overly optimistic, and I\u2019m trying to temper that.  We still think that economic growth is going to recover.  I think this is a good point forecast, but it is an uncertain one.  Importantly, the data for the third quarter will be crucial for assessing the impact of the long list of factors that are clouding the forecast at the moment.  Somewhat like the comments from President Bullard and President Rosengren, I simply don\u2019t see how we will be able to have much confidence that we have broken out to a higher growth path with a sustainable improvement in the labor market outlook before we see how the economy performs in the third quarter. Accordingly, I think we have to be careful about doing anything further that prematurely reduces monetary accommodation.  The outsized increase in rates that occurred since our June meeting wasn\u2019t helpful for economic growth, even if it had a modest influence on financial stability risks.  Our communications and actions from here need to be extremely careful to not make financial conditions even more restrictive than we inadvertently engineered in June.  And in our monetary policy discussions tomorrow, I will argue for greater explicitness in our strategic direction that should help us in this task.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Recent economic data have been a jumble of good and bad news.  Real GDP growth looks to have slowed markedly in the second quarter.  At the same time, job gains have been solid, and production indicators are pointing upward.  Financial market developments have similarly presented a mixed bag.  The backup in interest rates is a negative for economic growth, but equity and house prices have continued to climb, and lending standards have eased further.  So after weighing this information, I have not changed my forecast that economic growth should show renewed vigor in the second half of this year as the effects of fiscal austerity, credit restraint, and uncertainty wane.  Consistent with this assessment, I\u2019m hearing greater optimism from a broader set of my contacts, including from sectors outside of housing and high tech.  With the strengthening economy, I anticipate that we will reach our 6\u00bd percent unemployment threshold in the first half of 2015, and I see the risk to the outlook as broadly balanced. But given that our forward guidance focuses on the unemployment rate, an important issue is whether the unemployment rate is giving an accurate read on where things stand relative to our maximum employment mandate.  Now, President Fisher already referred to the WallStreet Journal article on our forecast accuracy.  For those people who looked at that, you could see that I am particularly challenged about forecasting the unemployment rate.  I could blame the data, but instead I actually will blame the forecast because, in fact, the unemployment rate has a number of advantages as a summary statistic for slack.  First, it closely tracks other indicators of labor market slack, such as the share of households reporting that jobs are plentiful, and the share of small businesses reporting difficulties filling job vacancies.  Second, in the United States at least, the natural rate of unemployment appears to have been reasonably stable and predictable over history.  However, the significant drop in labor force participation and the relatively flat employment-to-population ratio since 2008 that President Kocherlakota already made reference to suggests that the unemployment rate could now be understating the degree of slack in the economy. The current discrepancy between the unemployment and employment-to-population rates is, in fact, highly unusual.  In the past, the correlation between cyclical movements and unemployment in the U.S. unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio was very high, and the reason is that the big movements in the participation rate, like the one we\u2019ve seen recently, at least in the past were primarily structural rather than cyclical, driven by factors such as the entry of women into the labor market.  This same pattern is found in international data, in which the signals coming from unemployment and employment-to-population are typically aligned, except when notable disruptions to secular trends in labor force participation have occurred.  So whether one views the unemployment or the employment-to-population ratio to be the better measure of slack depends on to the extent that one believes that this time is different.  For example, based on the historical behavior of labor force participation, the FRB/US model finds that the trend component of labor force participation has declined considerably over thepast few years, and the current participation gap\u2014the difference between the trend and the actual labor force participation rate\u2014is only about \u00bd percentage point.  In that case, the unemployment rate is actually providing an accurate gauge of labor market slack.  However, labor market disruption during the deep recession and slow recovery has been unusually large.  So this time could be different.  A greater proportion of the recent decline in labor force participation could, in fact, be cyclical.  At one extreme, Chris Erceg and Andy Levin, in their paper, argue that the decline in participation is mostly cyclical, and the current participation gap is 2\u00bc percentage points, suggesting much more slack than implied by the unemployment rate. There\u2019s been a great deal of research aimed at understanding why participation has declined so much in recent years.  This work finds that, in addition to demographic factors, ongoing structural trends\u2014such as the movement onto permanent disability benefits among prime-age workers, the decline in two-earner households among the working-age population, and the focus on school instead of work among young adults\u2014have played a role in driving down participation.  Although various estimates of trend participation differ somewhat, they generally find that structural factors explain the majority of the decline in participation since 2008.  That said, they also suggest that the cyclical influence on participation has been larger than one would have expected based on history, with estimates of the current participation gap between \u00be and 1\u00bc percentage points.  My interpretation of all this evidence is that, to some extent, the current period is indeed different, although not to the extent that Erceg and Levin claim.  Extensive layoffs and persistently dismal job prospects appear to have caused unprecedented withdrawals from the labor force, and my current estimate of the participation gap is about 1 percent\u2014in the middle of the range I just mentioned.  So I expect a participation rate that will remain roughlyflat over the next few years as the return of discouraged workers offsets the longer-term demographic trends that are pushing down participation. One lesson from this research in labor force participation is how difficult it is to discern in real time what is causing shifts in participation and whether these movements are structural or cyclical in nature.  A compounding factor is that the trend participation rate can rise or fall for many years, for reasons that are hard to predict beforehand.  For this reason, forecasts of trend participation rates tend to be subject to large forecast errors.  For example, following each of the past three recessions\u2014that includes the most recent recession\u2014the Bureau of Labor Statistics has significantly reduced its estimates of trend labor force participation.  This difficulty in measuring the trend in participation provides a reason to be cautious in putting too much weight on the employment-to-population ratio as a measure of labor market slack. Regarding inflation, while we remain well below our 2 percent longer-run goal, I\u2019m encouraged by the recent data that suggested that declines in inflation that we\u2019ve observed earlier in the year were, indeed, temporary.  And still, I have heard little discussion to date of wage or price pressure from any of my contacts, which leads me to believe that while we are now again on our way back toward our 2 percent target, it will be several years before we get there.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The interventions by the rest of you so far have confirmed what I\u2019d come to believe over the past several weeks, which is that the fragile consensus toward which we were moving six or seven weeks ago has now been drawn into question again.  By that, I mean the notion that after the fits and starts to which Janet and others have alluded, there was, I think, an emerging view\u2014not shared by everyone here but by a lot of people\u2014that the headwinds or the mud or whatever metaphor you want to use had sufficiently abated or sufficiently dried that the conditions were present for some real self-sustaining economic growth, and the question was would the fiscal drag keep that self-sustaining momentum from really getting going.  And most of us thought that what we\u2019re going to belooking at this year was just that question of the impact of the payroll tax snapback and sequestration.  I think with Jeff\u2019s intervention last time, which he\u2019s recounted again today as his capitulation to the persistence of a growth trend around 2.1 percent, we actually had a preview of the old set of questions that we had debated for three or four years coming back to us.  And I hope that we\u2019re not back in that realm by the end of the year, but it seems to me, at least, that it\u2019s going to be considerably harder than I had anticipated just a couple of months ago to figure out within the next couple of months whether, in fact, we\u2019ve got that kind of self-sustaining momentum. The Tealbook continues to project a fair-sized uptick in economic growth over the next few quarters, and if forced to take a position, that\u2019s still probably the one I\u2019d choose, although with a slightly smaller increase in economic growth.  But it\u2019s really difficult, as many of you have already said, to survey the information and revisions to the information that we\u2019ve received since the June FOMC meeting without having at least some greater doubt about this proposition and, indeed, the assumption of greater underlying strength in the economy.  In particular, as Janet just said, the weaker PCE is a little hard to explain away solely by hypothesizing that the impact of the payroll tax snapback may have affected consumer behavior a little more quickly than expected.  In fact, the Tealbook doesn\u2019t try to do that; they\u2019ve also marked down the underlying pace of consumer spending.  It\u2019s not clear to me how one would allocate the various proportions of revision between those two explanations.  And with the savings rate having fallen pretty sharply already in the second quarter and with no strong prospect of significant wage increases, the trend in consumption is certainly a lot less clear than it appeared to be just a couple of months ago.  It would have to get a pretty big boost from the wealth effects of equity andhousing market increases, a boost which is presumably less likely to be realized than in the go-go days when people just pulled equity out of their homes at their friendly neighborhood bank. Now back to Jeff\u2019s self-described capitulation.  It\u2019s still possible, maybe likely, that surrender was premature, that reinforcements will be coming around the bend, that the negative fiscal forces will be in a gradual retreat, and together that will produce the turnaround expected by the Tealbook.  But as I said, I suspect it\u2019s going to be hard to figure that out in the next several months, particularly because I think figuring out exactly what impact sequestration is having has proven to be more difficult than we expected.  That is, the notion that you could just plug the numbers into the model and that was going to give you the effect always seemed to me a little bit troublesome, given the nature of the spending and the cutbacks and the furloughs and all the rest.  But I think that has been proven even more so.  It\u2019s really hard to figure out exactly when the effects are going to be felt, even when nominally the cuts by the agencies are taking place in a staged fashion.  Add to that the fact that, all other things being equal, I\u2019d expect some slowing in job growth, lagging the slowdown in GDP growth that we\u2019ve just experienced, and it\u2019s my overwhelming expectation that things are not going to clarify over the next few months. If it turns out that the assumption of more underlying strength in the economy looks increasingly to be ill-founded\u2014again, that wouldn\u2019t be my modal expectation, but it seems to me a higher likelihood than many of us thought not long ago\u2014then more of us are going to have to join Jeff in capitulating to the persistence of disappointing economic growth.  But here I think the terms of surrender become very important.  Jeff explained his own decision by reference to some combination of Bayesian updating, increased skepticism that remaining headwinds will abate, and greater emphasis on possible structural constraints on growth for a number of years ahead\u2014mostly, but I think not exclusively, productivity constraints.  The alternative basis forsurrendering, of course, is the conclusion that there\u2019s not as much self-sustaining underlying strength in the economy anyway because we\u2019re in what roughly, and somewhat imprecisely, one could term a multiple-equilibrium situation.  That is, right now economic growth is stuck at a lower level because demand won\u2019t rise without greater income.  Income won\u2019t rise without some greater combination of business investment and faster job and wage growth.  And these won\u2019t happen without more demand.  So the hope has been that some element in this relationship could be changed through monetary policy stimulus\u2014fiscal stimulus days are long gone.  Income could be boosted, and then the more virtuous cycle might get started, leading us to a different, preferable cycle than the one we may be stuck in right now. I hope that the underlying strength story wins out through the course of this year and we don\u2019t have to figure out how much we attribute to structural damage to the economy, how much we attribute to a continuing aggregate demand shortfall.  But I think we\u2019re just going to have to wait and see, and as I said, to me the most important takeaway from the past couple of months is that clarity seems less likely in the next few months than I would have thought it would have been.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  On the wording for paragraph 5, what do you think the cost would be of not changing the wording from the last meeting at all.  If the goal of this meeting is to convey that we\u2019re not changing policy, do you think the changes in the words in both 5 and 5\u2032 are worth the possible misinterpretation of those changes in the words", "   MR. EVANS.  My question was on that point, if I could", " MR. POTTER.  And I think that\u2019s what President Rosengren\u2019s question was about.  How much do you have to reaffirm, during the intermeeting period, what was said in the statement if you\u2019re pretty happy where we are right now.  Bill and I can try to help you with this, but wedon\u2019t have that much confidence.  So you should probably ask yourself, which error would you like to make right now", " MR. POTTER.  I think that, given what we got in the dealer survey, people weren\u2019t expecting changes in this part of the statement.  We saw four dealers expecting something about the contingent plan and four expecting something about the forward guidance.  Not all, but many of them expect something in the first paragraph", "   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I\u2019m going to comment on the very narrow question of how the market would interpret 5 versus 5\u2032.  My own view is that 5 is probably viewed slightly more powerfully, because the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d is going to be read as, \u201cWhy did they put those words in there.  They put those words in for emphasis.\u201d  Paragraph 5\u2032 does essentially the same thing but in more words\u2014a little bit more complicated, a little bit less visible.  I certainly agree with Bill that one of the problems with \u201cforeseeable future\u201d is, when is it no longer the foreseeable future.  So I think 5 is probably a little bit stronger than 5\u2032, but it has a few more problems in terms of, where do you take it from there over time", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One concern that we had in Minneapolis about the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d language is that some might interpret it as the Committee saying that it has  a poor outlook for at least many months to come, if not many years to come.  \u201cForeseeable future\u201d has a very long time line in front of it", "   MR. POTTER.  Talking to participants who don\u2019t put contributions into the survey, we learned they\u2019d be closer to Governor Raskin\u2019s viewpoint of why we did what we did in June.  They\u2019d be saying, \u201cI\u2019m looking at the data.  It doesn\u2019t look as though my forecast got stronger. They\u2019ll have these data as well.\u201d  \u201cSo why would you make that change.  There must be some other reason that you were making that change", " MR. WASCHER.  Okay", "  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  I think it\u2019s already dead", " MR. BULLARD.  President Williams, could I get you to expand a little bit on this last sentence in paragraph 2:  \u201cThe Committee . . . anticipates that, with appropriate policy accommodation, . . .\u201d.  You said you didn\u2019t like parts of that sentence", " WILLIAMS.  I would have said simply, \u201cThe Committee also anticipates that inflation will move back toward its 2 percent objective over the medium term.\u201d  I think that\u2019s stronger than what we currently have that says \u201cat or below,\u201d which does suggest to me that we\u2019re a little\u2014I don\u2019t know about \u201ccomplacent\u201d\u2014but that we\u2019re okay with inflation being below 2 percent.  In my view, if we say that we anticipate that inflation will be moving back toward 2 percent, that\u2019s a strengthening.  I just found that saying \u201cwith appropriate policyaccommodation\u201d twice in the same paragraph seemed a little funny, but that\u2019s the only concern I had with that", " MR. EVANS.  You\u2019re not really explaining why you\u2019re expecting it to go up, though, in the statement", " MR. EVANS.  Could I ask what \u201cappropriate monetary policy accommodation\u201d is meant to convey in this.  I meant to ask that yesterday.  Does it mean more accommodation than we currently envision.  Well, I tried that in my SEP projections, and I had a pretty optimistic path, but the additional policy wasn\u2019t exactly conveyed in that to my satisfaction.  But anyway, those are the rules of the game", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think the concern here is that that could also be read also as a complacent statement\u2014that we think it\u2019s going to be fine, given our current policy path.  So one attempt to try to convey at least some doubt was this language at the end about monitoring inflation, which you suggest cutting.  Just because we\u2019re not sufficiently confused here at this point, another possibility would be to say something about the risks to inflation; that would be another way to deal with this.  But I think this is a question we need to address seriously, because there was some concern about whether we were taking the low inflation sufficiently seriously", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I\u2019m with John on this a little bit.  I do worry that \u201cwith appropriate policy\u201d is likely to be interpreted as saying that we\u2019re going to act in some additional way that we haven\u2019t specified, and it\u2019s going to feed into the notion that somehow we are going to take action in the very near future.  I think I\u2019d prefer a different way of trying to say that.  It\u2019s important that we acknowledge inflation is low, and that we commit to our inflation objective.  I actually agree with that.  But I want to be careful that the language doesn\u2019t get interpreted as stating that it\u2019s going to either prevent us from moving along with asset purchases or suggesting that we\u2019re actually about to do more asset purchases in response to that, because I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what we want to signal at this point.  That\u2019s my concern", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  To make my suggestion concrete, we have this current statement:  \u201cThe Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall.\u201d  We have that now.  We could add, comma, \u201cbut the risks of persistent low inflation have increased somewhat\u201d\u2014something like that.  I\u2019m just putting that out there.  I think the best thing to do is to have our go-round, and we can address each of these points in a systematic way and then take straw votes, and so on", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was tempted to follow the lead of Don Kohn and simply state that, for the 41st time, I support alternative B.  [Laughter]  But you gave me an opening to talk about communications strategy and what I think this Committee should do after I\u2019m no longer here to vote, so I\u2019m going to take that.  Starting with the language that is in B, I had all of the same comments about paragraph 2 that President Williams already made, but I like A(2), and I think that may be a better alternative.  I also had the same thoughts about \u201cforeseeable future,\u201d but I\u2019m not going to deliver any postmortem blows to that phrase.  I think the clarification in 5\u2032\u2014that the term \u201chighly accommodative stance of monetary policy\u201d refers to continued low rates and maintaining the size of the balance sheet\u2014is important   In some of the coverage of the Chairman\u2019s comments in his various intermeeting statements, every time he said \u201can ongoing need for highly accommodative policies,\u201d they would assume that that was walkingback the expectation to reduce asset purchases rather than referring to what was going to happen with short-term rates. In terms of the questions, I want to start by saying clearly, for the minutes, that I fully support the strategy you outlined in the press conference.  And I think markets heard pretty clearly the message about asset purchases, but some seemed to miss the distinction between asset purchases and the threshold for short-term rates.  So it\u2019s appropriate that we do change paragraph 5, rather than paragraphs 3 and 4, to reemphasize the message that, even when we start reducing asset purchases, that doesn\u2019t pull forward the liftoff of the fed funds rate. In response to the questions about paragraphs 3 and 4 and forward guidance, I want to caution against the temptation to oversteer communication, especially with the first reduction in purchases.  I was really worried when I read the language of 4\u2032 in the first policy drafts that were circulated for this meeting, and I see that the language is still in alternative C, which presumably functions as a staging ground for the time when it is appropriate to reduce the pace of purchases.  I think it tries to set out too many conditions for the ultimate stopping of purchases, which, at that point, may be at very low levels.  Even if you don\u2019t share my concerns about the cost of a very large balance sheet, I think you can agree that stopping or substantially slowing purchases before we can declare victory could be very damaging to our credibility, and that credibility is key to the effectiveness of forward guidance.  So I wouldn\u2019t set out so many hurdles to clear all at the same time.  Save the triple toe loop for the conditions necessary to start tightening policy.   Along the same lines, even if you do hit 7 percent as expected, I think it would be very difficult to communicate that a 7 percent unemployment rate in paragraph 4 is a stopping rule, while the 6\u00bd percent unemployment rate in the next paragraph is a threshold.  If you stop purchases when you get to 7 percent, why wouldn\u2019t markets then expect that you\u2019d begin raisingrates when you get to 6\u00bd percent.  So I would urge that you consider leaving 7 percent as a soft target in the Chairman\u2019s remarks and something to talk about, but that you not convert it to a hard target that\u2019s contractualized in the statement.  I think there\u2019s a real opportunity, as I\u2019ve said before, to rehearse your approach to ultimately raising short-term rates in your approach to adjusting the pace of purchases, and I would urge you to leave yourselves the option to make adjustments in small enough increments that their value is largely through their signaling and to demonstrate that you can move quite slowly and deliberately and in a data-contingent way. I also hope that you\u2019ll save the option to reduce the 6\u00bd percent threshold for one of two conditions where it might be needed\u2014either (1) as a way to compensate if you\u2019re stopping purchases in response to cost concerns rather than because they\u2019re no longer necessary or (2) as a way to push back on expectations for higher rates if, as you get closer to the threshold, market expectations for higher rates start to build before you\u2019re actually ready to pull the trigger.  I firmly believe that this time, stronger economic growth is just over the horizon, but we haven\u2019t actually seen it yet.  And as badly as I want to see this Committee take the first step, I hope you won\u2019t take too many steps until you\u2019re certain that there won\u2019t be any required backtracking. Someone said yesterday that it appears that the surveys show that we\u2019re very good at communicating with former Fed staff [laughter].  Soon I\u2019m going to find out how good you are at communicating with former Fed Governors.  In any case, know that I will be watching and pulling for you and our economy every step of the way.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  I\u2019m very much in the minimalist camp.  So I want to really talk about paragraph 2 and paragraph 5 because those are the things that we\u2019re debating.  On the one hand, I do think that there is a little bit more risk from inflation being too low, but what I don\u2019t understand is, what\u2019s changed since the last meeting.  We didn\u2019t recognize that risk at the last meeting.  And have the risks increased from the last meeting.  I would say probably not.  David, do you have a view.  Risks are about the same as they were at the last meeting.  Or maybe they\u2019re less because the nonmarket factors have reverted back.  We\u2019ve had higher energy prices in the interim   So people are going to be a little bit surprised by highlighting that at this meeting when we didn\u2019t highlight it at the last meeting.  I\u2019m wondering what inference they\u2019re going to draw from that.  What I guess I would want to throw out as a question or something for consideration is whether they might draw the inference from that that the dialing down of asset purchases in September is now less likely because we\u2019re concerned about inflation risks, whereas we weren\u2019t concerned about those risks at the last meeting.  I\u2019m pretty willing to go along with what the Committee decides on this, but I do think we want to be careful not to inadvertently alter the market expectations about tapering by how we change the language in paragraph 2.  There\u2019s a real risk there that I just want to throw out, and I think we need to think about it.  If we do this, do we make market expectations of tapering in September less likely.  Then, if we taper in September\u2014let\u2019s say the data support doing that\u2014are we doing a zig and then a zag to monetary policy and creating unnecessary volatility that could be avoided by just sticking with what we had.  Now, one thing you could do if you wanted to note that inflation has gotten your attention, without doing anything in paragraph 2, would be to say that \u201cinflation continues to run below the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective\u201d in paragraph 1\u2014to underscore that you\u2019ve noted it, it continues, and it\u2019s on your radar screen.  Markets will notethat change, but it won\u2019t be such a big deal that you\u2019ll be altering expectations.  That\u2019s the first thing I\u2019d like to raise in terms of this alternative B. The second thing is on paragraph 5\u2032, where there seems to be a debate between 5\u2032 and the old paragraph 5.  I worry a little bit about 5\u2032, in the sense that it says that the \u201cCommittee today reaffirmed its view\u201d that it\u2019s going to do all of these things.  Is the market going to take that as a statement that you\u2019re saying that because you decided you\u2019re going to taper in September.  So it\u2019s actually being taken as a stronger statement about September action because you\u2019re making all of these changes, which you really wouldn\u2019t need to make if you were actually going to keep market expectations about policy where they are.  There\u2019s a risk that 5\u2032 as written will actually be interpreted as making September tapering more likely, because I think they\u2019ll say, \u201cGee, why are they reaffirming all of this stuff today, unless they might want to signal something.\u201d  So I guess that pushes me a little bit in the direction of, do no harm and go back to the original paragraph 5. In response to the questions, shockingly, I\u2019m very comfortable with what the Chairman did at the press conference.  After all, we gave him our proxy, and so it would be a little weird for us to take that proxy away after the fact.  In terms of conveying more in the statement\u2014not now.  I think that maybe when we actually dial down purchases for the first time, I can imagine changing the language to something similar to that in C(4) to explain what this means going forward.  But there\u2019s no upside to changing the statement right now.  With respect to changing the forward guidance on rates, I think that would be a very strange thing to do right now.  On the one hand, we\u2019re potentially dialing back asset purchases, not because of efficacy and costs but because we\u2019re actually making progress toward our objectives.  But then we\u2019re turning around and actually lowering our threshold.  So, what is it.  Are we trying to add accommodation.  Are we trying to take accommodation away.  I think doing it now would be really confusing topeople.  It would basically undercut the asset purchase program by reinforcing the idea that we were reducing it because of efficacy and costs, not because we were actually being more optimistic about the outlook.  In terms of changing the threshold in the future, I wouldn\u2019t completely rule it out, but I think you have to have a good reason for doing so.  It\u2019s better just to keep reinforcing that it\u2019s a threshold, not a trigger, and it seems to me we\u2019ve actually made some progress on that.  I also think that we have a lot of moving parts in this program already.  And so every time you make a change, boy, you\u2019d better be really clear on what the benefit of making that change is relative to the cost of forcing the market to learn what that change means.  I just don\u2019t see adding a lot more complexity in terms of changing thresholds or adding inflation floors; I don\u2019t see the benefits there as being worth the costs.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  But this is in conjunction with the statement that we have a modest pace in the first half of the year\u2014so, picking up from its recent pace.  I think most people would agree that 1.4 percent is not the second-half mode. Okay.  We have this modified language on housing.  We take note of mortgage rates having risen somewhat.  We responded to President Fisher\u2019s concerns about financial conditions having tightened somewhat and narrowed the concern.  So this will signal a bit of concern about the intermeeting changes.  I think that\u2019s what I heard yesterday. Now, this takes us to the inflation language.  As I said, most people are happy, more or less, with market expectations and don\u2019t want to risk changing those too much.  But I do think there was a bit of concern that we were too complacent about inflation.  I believe that it is in fact the case that, if, for example, inflation were to actually move downward over the next two months, that would affect our thinking about September and about accommodation.  So my own preference would be to do something there if we can.  In part, I\u2019m also trying to respond to President Bullard, who was very concerned about that at the last meeting.  Vice Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  One thing we could do that would be very mild is to say \u201canticipates that inflation will move back toward 2", "\u201d CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Because we\u2019re thinking that the asset purchase program started in the fall", " MR. EVANS.  On the inflation risk, this is the way that I think about it.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to take the June statement as the status quo.  In April, we added that sentence that indicated we might move in either direction on asset purchases, and the markets were attracted to the idea that low inflation might lead us to increase asset purchases.  So what we did was a little bit more of a surprise.  After the June statement, one of the things that you did very well at the NBER Summer Institute was that you gave a lot more voice to the risks of low inflation.  My friend Jim Bullard was sitting in the front row.  You talked about that effusively enough that I think the status quo should be thought of as your commentary there.  And if that could be added to the statement, however so slightly, there\u2019d be a benefit.  I\u2019m not saying we should make a lot of changes, because you\u2019re right\u2014we don\u2019t want them to all of a sudden think that\u2019s going to be a reason to move", "  MS. YELLEN.  No\u2014without", " MR. EVANS.  It\u2019s consistent with your comments at the NBER", " MR. LACKER.  This will reaffirm the Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  That follows \u201csince the fall"], "2013FOMC20130918meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I share the sense of intrigue with an overnight RRP as sort of an operating instrument for monetary policy operations, and I\u2019ve actually proposed that idea before. At the July meeting we had some discussion of this, and I suggested some research would be warranted before we go further down this path.  The Manager was kind enough to be in communication with me about that research.  The staff has done a good job of asking counterparties about their thoughts about the likely effects of this, but the research I had in mind was really something else.  What I think we\u2019re lacking here is a sense of where we\u2019re going down this path and why.  Let me give you an example. The staff has suggested that we\u2019re aiming to provide a hard floor under the RP rate.  Well, before 2008 we targeted the fed funds rate, and we operated with a substantial spread to the RP rate\u201410, 15, 20 basis points, at times larger, and fairly volatile.  There wasn\u2019t a hard floor under the overnight RP rate, and we didn\u2019t seem to think it was a problem then.  The staff hasn\u2019t provided any reason why it\u2019s a problem now or likely to be more of a problem going forward. I\u2019ll raise a couple of other concerns about this path that I think deserve some really careful consideration.  One is this expands us into doing a fair amount of business with money market mutual funds.  So the traditional thinking is that this is an industry whose business model is based on the bypass of bank regulations, and if we\u2019re to get them to voluntarily hold overnight   RRP investments with us, kind of by definition, that makes them better off in the sense that they can offer a higher and safer rate of return than they otherwise would if we weren\u2019t in that market. It\u2019s not obvious to me that this is a good thing for the structure of money markets, for us to enhance the competitiveness of money market mutual funds.  At a bare minimum, we need some thought before we go down that road.  It\u2019s not obvious that there\u2019s some inefficiency that this would cure regarding the margin between bank and nonbank intermediation, or\u2014I guess you could think of it as shadow and nonshadow banking.  I thought we didn\u2019t think that was an industry that was very well structured in the broader sense. I\u2019d also point out that, because of their status as primary dealers, the dealers are thought to enjoy sort of an imprimatur of the New York Fed, that they\u2019re accepted into a club.  Presumably, the same thing will hold for money market mutual funds who have been \u201cblessed\u201d by being anointed as counterparties to the Desk. Another broad concern has to do with the triparty RP market.  This market is, in my view, deeply flawed.  I think it\u2019s a consensus in the System.  The New York Fed has been doing yeoman\u2019s work going down the path toward triparty RP market reform.  That work is not complete.  It\u2019s not clear how successful it\u2019s going to be without some more-fundamental changes.  You know, I point out the flaw there.  Two banks have a lock on clearing and settlement in the triparty RP market.  The participants who clear and settle with them are highly dependent on intraday overdrafts from those banks, which gives either bank the power to refuse an unwind and force us into an untenable situation like we saw in March 2008.  Although we are involved in the triparty RP market\u2014to the tune of $5, $10, $15 billion a day\u2014and it\u2019s the way we\u2019ve always done our open market operations, this is a fundamental-enough flaw that it deserves some thought before we go extending and broadening our involvement in that market.  Governor Stein made an excellent point last time, which is that we\u2019re not going to know what the implications of doing this at scale are until we do this at scale.  And the corollary is, I don\u2019t think we want to do this at scale until we\u2019re ready to do it at scale.  So I don\u2019t see a real huge value in pursuing more of this.  Now, this has to do with monetary policy operations, the configuration of precisely what money market we intervene in, and how and under what conditions.  Our system has evolved over the years.  We took a run at this before the crisis.  We did a fairly substantial amount of study.  Some people around this table were involved in looking at different operational regimes. For me, we need that again if we\u2019re going to go down the road of some completely different operating scheme.  I\u2019d rather see us do that analysis so we know where we\u2019re headed and why, and we have a little more confidence about what effect it\u2019s going to have.  Until then, these operations may be harmful.  In a time of austerity, it\u2019s not clear to me that further operational exercises of this type are really a good use of our resources before we\u2019ve done the kind of analysis we\u2019ve done several times in our past to study the operational regime we\u2019re under and figure out whether this is what we want, or if there is some way we can improve on it. So, Mr. Chairman, I do not support this resolution. I think we should table it, and I think you should commission some study from the experts we have here to further explore where we\u2019re headed in terms of our operational regime", " MR. EVANS.  Okay.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I was a little more nervous about your last comment where you pointed out that this is going to help us out with the exit from our large balance sheet.  And we are going to need some help, so I favor that.  But I wonder if this is the right time to engage in this type of testing. There were a lot of comments about how, of course, no one should make any inferences about what this testing means for our next policy course, and I have some other questions about that related to forward guidance and whatnot.  I\u2019m not sure how much confidence I can have in that.  Everyone in the marketplace knows about these tests, right.  This is not a secret.  So I guess my questions are:  How much time do we really think we need to prove this system. Is it measured in four months or six months. Is it critical that we do it now.  If we were to delay this for perhaps a year, would that leave enough time.  And perhaps that, by itself, would also send a signal, since it is ultimately a tool for exit", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  From my perspective, the testing actually will reveal something on two dimensions.  One, how sensitive is demand for changes from 1 basis point to basis points.  And we just don\u2019t know the answer to that.  And, two, how sensitive is demand to the external factors that affect money market conditions, like quarter-end, year-end, financial market stresses, worries about Europe.  All of those things are going to also affect the demand curve for safe assets, and we just don\u2019t know how sensitive that is.  And the testing, I think, will reveal it. I also think this facility, earlier rather than later, gives us potentially down the road an additional degree of freedom in monetary policy.  You can imagine if the testing goes well and we learn something, we could get more comfortable using this.  Let\u2019s say the economic news were to disappoint, but we didn\u2019t feel like we wanted to increase asset purchases or we felt that that channel was exhausted.  Well, we could then potentially reduce the interest rate on excess reserves from 25 basis points to some lower rate.  That\u2019s not really feasible, I don\u2019t think, in the current environment because we don\u2019t really know what that would do to the whole constellation of rates.  If you put a solid floor in place, then you have a little bit more flexibility in terms of what you do with the ceiling.  So I think it also has that potential benefit", " MR. LACKER.  I was just going to say about tighter control of rates, that it\u2019s not obvious that argument stops at RPs. I mean, if we are interested in controlling rates, where does that argument stop. We\u2019d intervene in anything if we wanted to control it more closely.  It is not clear why you want to control RP rates more closely.  That\u2019s the thing. And the other thing I would point out is that this experiment will give us some data in an envelope of the current environment, which could be very different after we raise rates. It could be very different if we are setting a rate closer to the IOER or if we are targeting the fed funds  rate. It\u2019s not clear how that is going to affect this.  So it\u2019s part of the package, and I\u2019m not sure how well we are going to be able to extrapolate from what we learn here", "  MS. YELLEN.  I would like to offer an observation on our current SEP submissions and specifically on the projections for 2016.  Most participants project that by late 2016 the economy will be very close to maximum employment.  The median projected unemployment gap, calculated as the unemployment rate less that participant\u2019s estimate of the longer-run normal rate, is one-tenth of a percentage point.  Also, most participants expect that inflation will be very close to 2 percent.  But the median funds rate projection stands at 2 percent; that\u2019s 2 percentage points below the median estimate of its longer-run normal value. The SEP funds rate projections for 2016 will receive a good deal of attention when they are released tomorrow, and the public may find this feature of our projections surprising and even puzzling.  For example, suppose the public uses the Taylor (1999) rule without inertia as a benchmark.  If they plug in the unemployment and core inflation gaps implied by the midpoint of the central tendencies for these variables, and if they further use our median long-run normal value for the funds rate of 4 percent, they will discover that this rule prescribes a funds rate at the end of 2016 of 3\u00be percent, compared with the median SEP projection of only 2 percent. Now, of course, each one of us presumably knows exactly how and why he or she arrived at their individual funds rate projection, but the public could infer different rationales, so I think it\u2019s worth discussing and trying to be clear among ourselves about why our funds rate projections are so low. One possible rationale is that these funds rate settings reflect a commitment policy in the spirit of Woodford and the optimal control policies reported in the Tealbook.  Such a policy post-2016 would lead to sustained overshooting of inflation and undershooting of the unemployment rate. But looking at the individual projections, it appears that, with very few exceptions, they are more in line with monotonic convergence of the unemployment rate back to its longer-run normal value and inflation to 2 percent as in the Tealbook baseline.  Speaking for myself, I didn\u2019t actually incorporate sustained overshooting in my own SEP projection.  Rather, my policy projection reflects the view that the headwinds afflicting the economy will continue to restrain economic growth even in 2016, so that a return to full employment and 2 percentinflation at that time is only attainable with the real funds rate remaining below its long-run equilibrium value. I think that for the effectiveness of our forward guidance, it likely matters which of these two interpretations is the one that the public infers. If we are writing down projections that incorporate an important element of commitment to time-inconsistent policies, the public might question whether it is plausible that future committees will deliver on these promises, especially with the period of changeover in the Committee\u2019s composition ahead of us. In contrast, if most of us are writing down low funds rate projections for 2016 primarily because we anticipate that the headwinds will abate only gradually, it makes sense for us to communicate that our policy projections are driven by this feature of the economic outlook and, therefore, are approximately time consistent.  Provided the public broadly shares our economic outlook, it should conclude that future Committees will be likely to follow this path, and this anticipation should strengthen our forward guidance", "  So there is a long-run trend that is being offset by\u2014 MR. WASCHER.  Yes.  And so the participation rate moves back toward its declining long-run trend over the forecast period", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My questions are also about this same page here, \u201cEvolution of Various Key Activity, Inflation, and Financial Projections,\u201d which I found fascinating.  I love this summary.  Let me see if I can get this right. The way we have it is, real GDP growth, not changed very much in actual or forecast from last September; 10-year and mortgage rates are not changed much from last September.  But if you look at the stock market, it\u2019s up 10 percent, and projected to go higher.  And housing prices, not shown, are up 15 percent.  So there is a big wealth effect here. But as I understand it, that doesn\u2019t really affect GDP according to this analysis.  Wealth is up a lot.  Rates haven\u2019t changed.  GDP doesn\u2019t change", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a few comments on financial stability.  I enjoyed Mike\u2019s presentation.  It was very useful. I especially liked some of the discussion at the very end of what staff were doing in terms of following up on initiatives related to pockets of concern.  It\u2019s useful to see the mapping between what\u2019s being generated in the report and actions being taken.  I thought President Evans\u2019s questions were useful along those lines as well. And I also think that the discussion of financial stability that appears before the alternative simulations in the Tealbook is a great starting point for trying to build in financial stability considerations into our thinking about monetary policy.  I\u2019ve mentioned this before. I continue to think that it would be useful to translate the discussion into at least crude quantitative measures of risk to prices and employment.  And by crude, I mean something like, is there a 1-in-1,000 chance of a financial crisis with significant macroeconomic consequences in the next two years, 1-in-100 chance, 1-in-10 chance\u2014orders-of-magnitude kinds of ideas. My next comment is about this issue of using monetary policy to mitigate possible financial instability. We often hear the suggestion that we can mitigate incipient financial instability by tightening monetary policy, but there\u2019s quite a tricky term issue here, right.  If it\u2019s right on us, we are not supposed to tighten.  We\u2019re supposed to ease.  So right away, you see subtleties there.  But I think we\u2019ve seen tightening of monetary policy since early May.  Ten-year Treasury yields have risen by more than 100 basis points.  This increase has been accompanied by at most a slight improvement in the macroeconomic outlook.  So it seems reasonable to interpret the increase in rates as largely attributable to a noticeable tightening of monetary policy. We see this, too, in the inflation breakevens.  The Fed is now expected to keep interest rates  higher for a wider range of macroeconomic outlooks.  So when I think about tightening, I don\u2019t just think about our benchmark outlook.  I think about what we are going to do for a wide range of possible outlooks, and I think we\u2019re expected to follow a tighter policy for a wide range of outlooks, and that\u2019s reflected, as I indicated earlier, in the higher term premium as well. But anyway, how has this tightening of policy affected financial stability.  Now, we have a lot of different tools, so it\u2019s not a suggestion about only one of them, but the effects seem quite mixed.  I would say that measures of risk and risk appetite have actually risen in the past three or four months.  If you look at the equity premium, it\u2019s fallen even though the VIX has risen.  Spreads of risky bonds really haven\u2019t changed very much, so it may be hard to read much into that.  We heard reports that the increase in long rates was actually increasing incentives to reach for yield among financial institutions.  The basic problem here was that income from mortgage duration had fallen sharply because of the increase in mortgage rates, but, at the same time, the financial institutions could not earn that much interest income from medium-term loans because interest rates were still very low for medium-term loans.  So tightening policy at the long end of the curve had really put more pressure on profits, and in that sense exacerbated the reaching-for-yield problem. I\u2019ve highlighted some senses in which we haven\u2019t seen a diminution in financial system vulnerabilities because of the tightening of monetary policy.  There are also ways in which the increase in long rates has reduced financial system risk.  I won\u2019t talk about that.  I\u2019m not taking a stand on whether they, on balance, increase or decrease risks.  My point is a more limited one. We don\u2019t have a clear understanding of how monetary policy is going to affect financial system vulnerability.  This idea that\u2019s out there in the blogosphere\u2014and actually even if you go to the movies there\u2019s this idea out there\u2014that if you tighten monetary policy, you can control financial system risks.  We need a lot more understanding and a lot more study of this before we can reach that simple conclusion.   My own view is, with all of these uncertainties, I wouldn\u2019t want to rely on monetary policy tightening at this point as a way to deal with these risks. The best way the FOMC can ameliorate financial system risks is by eliminating monetary policy uncertainty.  Unfortunately, I feel we\u2019ve moved in the opposite direction on that in the past few months.  We\u2019ve increased uncertainty about monetary policy as opposed to decreased it.  In my view, we can best reduce that policy uncertainty by following a clear strategy that\u2019s focused on achieving our dual mandate objectives over the medium term, but I\u2019ll talk about that more tomorrow", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had mentioned before that I was concerned about monitoring the credibility of our forward-guidance tools for monetary policy.  Based on some of the comments Simon made in his Desk presentation, it looks like the announcement of potential reductions in our flow purchase rate have altered markets\u2019 assessment of how long we\u2019re going to subscribe to our forward-guidance threshold.  I don\u2019t know the size of it, but that\u2019s a little bit of a concern. I think that\u2019s an unintended reaction to the communications that we\u2019ve made in the past three or four months.  But then I\u2019ll note Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s comment, also during that discussion.  He mentioned anecdotal comments that maybe, because of financial stability issues, we might have to back down on the credibility of our forward-guidance threshold of 6\u00bd percent.  So that\u2019s one reason why I thought it was important to ask about what the status of our regulatory and supervisory behavior has been toward potential financial instability developments in these markets because it has credibility implications for our monetary policy tools.   I think this has been an important discussion.  We\u2019ve benefited greatly from these past several financial stability briefings.  We are monitoring so many things.  Just going back to the March briefing, we had a list of concerns.  What if interest rates go up by 100 basis points.  And we\u2019ve gone through that experience.  It was a little rugged, but there\u2019s no more risk because of that.  Maybe the risk is a little less.  Maybe we\u2019re in a better position because of that. There are supervisory actions that have been taken.  Perhaps they were long intended with the SNC leveraged loan guidance, but there is also interest rate risk guidance.  So I think that\u2019s helped.  We have seen difficulties with agency REITs from the increase in interest rates and, whether that was self-correcting or it just wasn\u2019t as big of an effect as we feared, that was a good thing.  There are market liquidity issues that we\u2019ve been concerned about due to Dodd\u2013Frank, and now the evidence is that it\u2019s actually just that dealers are unwilling to engage in those transactions. If they\u2019re going to be that way, they\u2019re going to be that way. It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s an outsized concern now for financial stability.  That\u2019s important.  We\u2019ll have to continue to monitor it but, like President Kocherlakota, I think it ought to be something much larger in terms of financial instability concerns that kicks in before we allow it to degrade our monetary policy tools.  I would also welcome greatly any of the staff\u2019s assessments about what the relative tradeoffs are in order to reduce financial instability by a certain likelihood.  How much would we have to degrade our monetary policy tools. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. WASCHER.  We have a similar model where we do that, and we include some other variables as well.  I think our current participation rate gap is about \u00bd percentage point in the Tealbook.  So different models can get you some different answers, depending on what you include", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the July meeting\u2019s policy round, I said I feared an incoming stream of data through this meeting and possibly beyond that could be characterized as producing persistent ambiguity. We have seen two more labor reports and lots of other data since our previous meeting, and I would say that the economic signals do not yield a clear picture.  A number of incoming prints have been disappointing relative to expectations, and the data taken on their own, without reference to expectations, strike me as quite mixed, with some points of strength balancing some signs of weakness around what have mostly been middling indicators. My team engaged our directors and contacts in the Sixth District this cycle with questions designed to get at their sense of the outlook on which they are making their own business decisions.  Specifically, we asked if they buy the widespread assumption of forecasters, and that includes ourselves, that the second half will see a pickup in activity versus the first half.  We asked if our assumptions of higher consumer and business spending, somewhat greater export  activity, and a diminishing drag from the government sector, felt right to them.  To summarize quickly what we heard, our contacts can be described as apprehensively optimistic.  This represents a slight pullback from sentiment before the July meeting.  They are seeing business trajectories that are in essence very similar to the first half. As I said as I began, my reading of the key data leaves me ambivalent. I can make the case for believing in a pickup in growth.  Growth seems to have strengthened in Europe and stabilized in China, adding to an encouraging context for export growth.  Business demand for fixed capital appears to be improving.  The drag on GDP growth from combined federal, state, and local government spending has shrunk measurably. Industrial activity is improving along several dimensions.  At the same time, our current tracking estimates, and those of others, for GDP growth in the third quarter suggest a slowing from the revised second-quarter estimate and cast significant doubt on the assumption of a pickup in the second half.  Also, the recent employment report may signal a slowing of hiring.  The glass can be seen as half empty or half full, and I think that is an agonizing circumstance in which to make the policy decision we face at this meeting. In my SEP submission, I modestly downgraded my 2013 growth forecast but held to a basic outlook of a pickup in the pace of growth over the forecast horizon.  My projection of accelerating growth, however, is not as early or as strong as the Tealbook.  My forecast for the unemployment rate is similar to the Tealbook in the near term, crossing 7 percent in the middle of next year.  So in my overall growth and employment outlook, I am sticking to an optimistic narrative but, like many of my District contacts, with some apprehension. For the SEP submission, my inflation forecast has price trends heading back toward target, like the Tealbook, but at a much less attenuated pace.  I have underlying inflation  returning to target by 2015 rather than remaining below 2 percent for longer as in the Tealbook.  I will point out that if the Tealbook forecast proves correct, core PCE inflation will have been below 2 percent for nine consecutive years.  On a headline basis, the Tealbook projection through 2016 implies missing the year-over-year headline objective in eight of the previous nine years. I find this troubling, and I find it as fodder for the half-empty interpretation. To repeat, my outlook shows modest growth relative to the Tealbook, and it is also at the low end of the central tendency of the most recent SEP.  My sense of risk at this juncture is that I see more downside risks than upside.  Given our record of overoptimistic forecasts, I am giving some probability points to the risk that accelerating growth may not just be around the corner.  As to cause, I will point to possible intensification of drags stemming from the sequestration, a more general drawdown of defense spending, and I also see uncertainty around the fiscal situation possibly affecting consumer and business confidence. Our soundings in my District on business input cost and wage pressures suggest that the recent subdued inflation trend may persist for a few more quarters, but do not suggest further disinflation.  That said, I submitted a risk assessment regarding my baseline inflation outlook, which I mentioned a second ago, to the downside.  The Tealbook may be right, and my assumption of earlier convergence to the objective of 2 percent may be optimistic. To summarize, if I could be assured that the growth that I have in my forecast is reasonably on track, and the price trend is stable and not softening, that would make me less apprehensive.  But in my judgment, there are simply a lot of question marks\u2014too many\u2014in the mix of data at this juncture.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  However, given the Committee\u2019s recent direction on trimming LSAP purchases, the sort of aggressive policy that I would prefer is simply too far outside the consensus, and accurately communicating my policy assumptions within these public projections is beyond what we have figured out how to do effectively.  I did, however, assume that we would hold the funds rate near zero even after we crossed the 6\u00bd percent threshold.  Given the softness in inflation and the headwinds weighing on growth, I think a more appropriate policy dictates zero rates until nearly the end of 2015 and only a gradual tightening in 2016, as mentioned in paragraph 5 of alternative B.  With these policy assumptions, I had just over 2 percent GDP growth this year.  And I will ignore Albert Einstein\u2019s definition of insanity\u2014I persist in writing down growth figures of 3 percent and higher in the out years.  With this growth trajectory, unemployment should fall below 6\u00bd percent in mid-2015, but as I said, I think appropriate policy implies waiting longer to start raising rates. On inflation, I think we will be too low over the entire forecast horizon.  Even in 2016, in my opinion we will be lucky to be near 2 percent.  I have displayed charts on the history of inflation in a lot of different presentations, but the way that I do it sort of ignores the observation from President Lockhart.  It is quite remarkable that we\u2019ve had so many years out of nine with inflation below our 2 percent objective.  That\u2019s quite a record, not something we should try to repeat. The risks to our growth and inflation forecasts are decidedly to the downside.  I\u2019d feel a lot better if we found a way to minimize the increased restrictiveness of financial conditions.  I\u2019m hoping that the movements in long rates we have seen so far are a one-off adjustment as financial markets finally come to grips with the fact that policy will not remain on hold forever. My forecast assumes this realization of our policy intentions.  I think this is plausible especially if recent asset reallocations have primarily been due to a change in heart by the most optimistic investors, the ones who had previously thought our open-ended asset purchases were more like a Draghi\u2013Woodford \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d policy.  That\u2019s not what we could bring ourselves to do apparently. But I see the risk of further unintended financial restrictiveness if we do not reemphasize our continuing commitment to providing the economy the monetary accommodation that it needs to achieve escape velocity.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I view the economic news as somewhat disappointing relative to my expectations.  Unfortunately, there is not much evidence that the U.S. economy is breaking out above the 2 percent growth path that has prevailed since the beginning of the economic recovery.  In other words, an increase in the pace of economic growth consistent with sustainable improvement in the labor market outlook still appears to be lacking.  In terms of the outlook, I continue to believe that the economy will pick up speed next year as the degree of fiscal restraint subsides and the post-crisis healing of the U.S. economy continues.  But this is a forecast, and it\u2019s not a reality yet. Also, it seems to me that there are some notable uncertainties and risks with respect to the growth outlook.  In particular, we don\u2019t have a good idea how much the rise in mortgage rates since May will damp housing activity.  What we have in hand indicates an impact.  We have seen a decline in mortgage originations for purchase and pending home sales, for example, but how large and long-lasting the impact will be isn\u2019t very clear to me.  Also, it strikes me that the   risk from the fiscal side will be unusually high over the near term.  I don\u2019t have any clarity about how the Congress will deal with funding the ongoing operations of the U.S. government at the end of the month, or how the debt limit situation will play out during the late October\u2013early November time frame. But there certainly are risks in that direction. With respect to the inflation outlook, I\u2019m not particularly troubled by the fact that core PCE inflation is somewhat below our objective currently for several reasons.  First, the earlier downtrend appears to have bottomed out because the most recent trend the past few months is above the year-over-year growth rate.  As time passes and the earlier, lower observations drop out, the year-over-year rate is likely to drift upwards.  Second, if we look at a decomposition of the inflation data, it shows that the most recent slowing in inflation has been less widespread across core goods and core services than was the case in 2010.  And, third, inflation expectations remain pretty well anchored above the current core PCE rate, which should exert some upward pull on inflation, although I must admit the five-year, five-year forward has drifted down a little bit recently, and so that deserves watching.  So the fact that inflation is a bit below our 2 percent objective doesn\u2019t really get that much weight from me in my monetary policy views.  When I put it all together, it strikes me that it\u2019s a time to be cautious in jumping to conclusions.  While it\u2019s true that every day the economy shows evidence that it will successfully resist the downward pull from this year\u2019s large dose of fiscal restraint, I have not become more confident about the outlook for the next year.  I am also not yet sufficiently confident to support a reduction in the pace of asset purchases, but more on that tomorrow. Finally, with respect to the issue that Governor Yellen raised about the federal funds rate forecast in 2016, my forecast is 2 percent.  It is very much a headwinds story. It is not really an accommodative monetary policy story.  I think the equilibrium short-term real rate is going to  stay low for a very long time.  Credit availability is going to take a long time to heal. Securitization markets in the mortgage area haven\u2019t really restarted at all to date in any meaningful way outside of the agency market.  This is one reason, of course, that for many meetings I have talked about my hesitancy to embrace the Taylor rule", " MR. BULLARD.  You\u2019re telling a complicated headwinds story in which these variables move all the way back to normal values, but somehow there are still headwinds at work that are keeping the real funds rate at this low level.  And so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following your story because of that", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like many others, I found the data that have become available between June and today not clearly establishing the steady improvement contemplated by the baseline projections of the majority of the Committee at the June meeting. But the preliminary SEP suggests that as a group we are sticking with that basic narrative, albeit with the improvement delayed a bit, and less optimism about the upper range of that improvement.  And I\u2019m part of the group, sticking to a projection of modest to moderate increases in GDP and declines in unemployment over the next couple of years. But I suspect  many of us\u2014and I think the staff also, as reflected in the Tealbook\u2014have less certainty around that projection than we had back in June.  So, once again, we find ourselves revisiting the possible explanations for why that may be the case.  And I, at least, tried to ask myself what new evidence there may be for any of these possibilities. One explanation is that the numbers we have been receiving are somewhat misleading, so maybe things aren\u2019t as mixed toward the disappointing end as we think.  There is always the possibility of noisiness in the data, of course, something that is apparently more than usually likely with August employment numbers, as David mentioned in his initial presentation. Quite a different take on the possibility of the numbers being misleading was, as John Williams mentioned a moment ago, put forth in an interesting staff presentation at yesterday\u2019s Board meeting.  It suggested that actual output may have been understated by the GDP numbers of late, and that the higher GDI numbers are, based on past observation, likely better predictors of what future GDP will look like than our current GDP numbers themselves.  There is a little bit of support for that hypothesis in the ISM numbers, which have been a bit of a bright spot in the otherwise very gray data of late. The second explanation is what the Tealbook calls the \u201cSupply-side damage\u201d hypothesis, and we\u2019ve talked about this one a lot over the past few years. My view has been that the longer unemployment stayed elevated, the labor market impaired, and business fixed investment relatively low, the more likely it was that there would be some lasting structural damage to the economy following on from the major dislocations of 2008 and 2009.  But I have also been of the view that, given the amount of slack that still likely remains in the economy, we\u2019re not really able to judge how much damage there has been and won\u2019t be until the recovery has proceeded a fair ways further.  And, thus, there\u2019s been no near-term implication for monetary policy.My bottom line on the structural damage hypothesis hasn\u2019t changed in any basic way, but there is one piece of data that provides some evidence of current, as opposed to inferred or anticipated, structural damage effects.  That is the pattern of exit from long-term unemployment. For quite a while, that was actually something of a rebuttal to structural damage arguments.  Recently, though, the transition rate of the long-term unemployed to employment has dipped down a bit, more so when considered relative to the exit rate of the short-term unemployed, and the transition rate of the long-term unemployed out of the labor force has continued to tick up.  The latter was for a while probably largely attributable to the expiration of extended UI but now may reflect something else.  Neither of these changes in the transition destinations of the long-term unemployed is dramatic, but they probably bear watching over the next couple of quarters. A third explanation has been loosely stated\u2014the headwinds explanation of factors unleashed by or following the crisis, which impede recovery.  Presumably, the difference between headwinds and structural damage is that the latter cannot be counteracted with more fiscal or monetary stimulus, whereas the former can\u2014hence, the implicit metaphor of an airplane throttling up to maintain speed.  I guess you could make the case that, after a while, headwinds cause damage, but I\u2019m not going to go down that road.  The kind of headwind most obviously characteristic of a financial crisis aftermath is that there are high amounts of debt at households, financial firms, and nonfinancial firms, all of which becomes harder to manage in the face of declining asset values and income.  But once balance sheet repair progresses far enough, that headwind should abate.  With nonfinancial firms, at least large ones, sitting on a lot of cash, and financial firms having been strengthened substantially, and household income-to-debt ratios back to about 2003 levels, there is a pretty good case for the proposition that the repair process should be far enough along in enough households and firms to permit renewed purchases, borrowing, and lending. This is probably the main reason why a sustained steeper path of recovery began to seem more plausible to me earlier this year.  I knew Janet\u2019s intervention was coming, so I haven\u2019t had to try to develop all of this myself, but as Janet just reminded us, we are facing a different set of headwinds that continue to provide a different explanation.  Some, such as the extent of fiscal tightening, have blown up since the recession ended.  And others, such as the very slow recovery of the housing industry, continue to blow even after the rain has stopped, like the tail-end of a hurricane.  These headwinds, presumably, can be offset with continued monetary stimulus.  The headwinds hypothesis, of course, presumes a good bit of slack in the economy.  And, as has been the case for some time, this presumption continues to be supported by what I might term a negative piece of evidence\u2014that is, the absence of any indication of wage pressures.  This is true not only in the aggregate, but also in a somewhat more decomposed form, as revealed in a plotting of the distribution of average wage growth, which shows that none of the skewing that one might expect to see toward the upper end, where sectoral pockets of labor shortages lead to significant wage increases, has actually occurred. I suspect there is something to each of these three explanations, and the relative importance of each over time will, thus, obviously be critical to our decisions.  For now, though, I don\u2019t think that the recent run of fairly disappointing data has changed the basic story of an economy still in need of greater aggregate demand.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. I have a second quick question, which is on paragraph 4 of alternative B.  This is just a minor wording thing.  We say \u201cuntil the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.\u201d I think we should say something about since what period of time.  If we just read it like this, it looks like \u201cuntil the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially\u201d from this point in time, as opposed to what we mean, I think, which is since last September when the program was initiated", " MR. POTTER. I don\u2019t think this part of the statement has been touched since September. And it had the logical problem that President Lacker pointed out in September last year, which no one else has taken on", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I admit, though, that I did not find today\u2019s policy decision an easy call.  There has undeniably been a lot of improvement in the labor market since we started the asset purchase program a year ago, and, on that score, I think a first reduction in the pace of our purchases could certainly be justified.  But as I explained yesterday, against that assessment of the extent of progress we\u2019ve achieved stand my lingering doubts about the potential for further improvements going forward.  I still do anticipate that we\u2019ll see steady improvement in the labor market, and that inflation will move up toward our 2 percent objective, a scenario along the general lines of that laid out by the Chairman in his June press conference. But, taking both considerations into account, I judge it wiser not to move today and to await additional evidence that raises our confidence that progress in the labor market will be sustained. The new sentences in paragraph 3 of alternative B, to me, strike the right balance.  They acknowledge the improvement in labor market conditions since we began our program, but they also point out that, in the current circumstances, it\u2019s prudent to await further confirmation that those improvements will be sustained.  The new language in paragraph 4 of alternative B clearly keeps a reduction in the pace of purchases on the table without raising the bar for what we\u2019d need to see in the data. Alternative B signals that we\u2019re willing to be patient in adjusting the pace of our purchases and emphasizes that we remain focused on implementing policies that will achieve our dual mandate objectives.  It gently pushes back against the view that many market participants have that we\u2019re hell-bent on winding down the asset purchase program for reasons we\u2019ve not clearly articulated, perhaps relating to efficacy or costs, including financial stability risks. I agree with President Kocherlakota that the same perception is undermining the credibility of our  forward guidance. It also highlights our concern that the deterioration in financial conditions we\u2019ve seen in recent months could undermine the attainment of our objectives. Of course, a decision not to reduce the pace of our purchases today does entail some risks.  The increases we\u2019ve seen in longer-term yields appear to be due importantly to higher term premiums, in part reflecting heightened uncertainty about monetary policy.  A decision to maintain our current pace of purchases may not alleviate, and could exacerbate, this uncertainty.  Moreover, by the time of our October and even our December meetings, we may conceivably remain just as uncertain about the sustainability of labor market progress as we are now.  For that reason, I think it\u2019s important, as paragraph 3 of alternative B does, not only to stress our uncertainty about future progress but also to point to the cumulative progress we\u2019ve seen since the start of our program. Actual progress matters, and we may well make further progress. Indeed, all else being equal, the greater our cumulative progress, the more confident we can be that we will ultimately reach our mandated maximum employment goal\u2014the main purpose of the asset purchase program since the outset\u2014and the safer it should become to reduce the pace of purchases.  Put differently, it\u2019s a lot more reasonable to worry that we won\u2019t arrive in Manhattan when we\u2019re in Denver or Kansas City than after we\u2019ve passed through Columbus, Ohio, or find ourselves at the Weehawken entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with the many people who have suggested that our discussion and decision today are predominantly about what we are signaling about our policies not just today, but also over the course of the next several quarters, in all likelihood.  Just to preface my assessment and positions, I want to return us for a moment to two sets of institutional difficulties that we have with market expectations. The first, as I\u2019ve said before, goes back to the origins of the current LSAP program in September 2012.  The program, as stated in the FOMC statement and, certainly, as perceived by markets, probably did not reflect the broad consensus of the FOMC that was suggested by the strong vote that it had at the time.  That\u2019s created a certain awkwardness since then, whereby we introduce concepts somewhat tentatively about efficacy or costs; we didn\u2019t really want to push those publicly for good reasons, even though they may have animated concerns of a number of Committee members; and so we find ourselves having to talk publicly in terms of the articulated standard of substantial improvement in labor markets, even though people\u2019s own individual calculi are affected by a number of things other than that. The second problem, which I think has become more apparent today, is that, once again, with the June so-called framework, as we all recall just from that meeting a few months ago, there wasn\u2019t really a convergent view on how we were going to proceed with LSAPs.  There were several colleagues who seemed to have much more of a chronology in mind:  We\u2019re headed toward September, and then we\u2019re going to proceed after that.  There are others who were leery of making very many signals in any direction.  And then there were those in the middle, who, ultimately, I think, dictated the standards that the Chairman articulated in the press conference, which were data driven but, obviously, communicated some lean toward taper. So in my mind, what we have here is a matter of not only managing market expectations, but also managing ourselves.  That makes this a very messy decision, as I think is apparent in the comments of people today, which are really quite thoughtful, a cut or two above our normal interventions, on the one hand, and yet reflecting genuine and good faith differences of perspective, on the other. Now let me turn to, in a policy sense, what the standards for tapering would be.  And of course, we have two sitting side by side here:  the one from the September 2012 FOMC statement; and the second, the framework for tapering that the Chairman articulated in June, invoking and building on the September 2012 statement but trying to develop that a little further.  Well, with respect to the September 2012 statement of overall substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets, I think it\u2019s been pretty clear for a while that, for most people, one\u2019s  going-in position on the wisdom and efficacy of LSAPs is pretty closely correlated to one\u2019s position on how much labor market improvement has occurred.  Labor market conditions are potentially quite broad and encompass a general assessment of the health of the labor market, and so some want to focus on unemployment, and others want to point to net job creation, the labor force participation rate, or the fact that some traditional indicators of dynamism, even though they\u2019re showing signs of life, are still pretty depressed by historical standards. As I think people know, my own view is that there are still a fair number of questions, as I suggested yesterday, about the relative contributions of different explanations for what\u2019s going on. Those questions are probably going to stay with us for a while as to how much is achievable in labor markets through policies intended to increase aggregate demand. It\u2019s also been my position, which I continue to hold, that, pretty clearly, a good bit more can be done now, and that we will not need to make a decision for a while as to whether we\u2019re approaching the limit of what can be achieved in a prudent fashion. Now, what\u2019s \u201csubstantial\u201d.  This is a classic legal word that gets inserted into a standard and then is susceptible to a variety of interpretations that can be consistent with a variety of going-in positions.  So I always thought we were going to have disagreements on that, and so we do. I think we can pin down a little bit more, though, the standards that the Chairman articulated in his June press conference.  I do want to read those because there\u2019s been a little bit of selective text use today, and I think it\u2019s important to recall all of what he said. Sorry, Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m repeating history, your own history, back to you even as you sit two seats down from me", " MR. STEIN.  We\u2019ll talk.  So here\u2019s the key\u2014the no discretion.  There are two motivations.  On the one hand, say you wanted to send a more dovish message.  Well, you could, as I did in this thing, move the unemployment rate from 7 to 6.8 percent. That\u2019s a big deal.  The difference between 7 and 6.8 percent is maybe four more months, roughly speaking, of asset purchases.  That\u2019s substantial and it\u2019s pretty credible, I think, if you do it this way.  So if you\u2019re just interested in saying something a little bit more dovish, that does it.  But I think\u2014and this is totally central, in my view\u2014the removal of discretion is really key.  It\u2019s the discretion that is the heart of our problem; as Narayana said, we\u2019re going to face an existential crisis at every meeting as we go forward. I think some of us have been thinking, \u201cOh, once we get past the first taper, life will be good.\u201d It\u2019s not going to be good, because we\u2019ve got this vocabulary, this thing means something at every meeting, and we\u2019re going to face the same problem over and over again.  I want to kill the problem, and I think the way you kill the problem is by removing discretion. Now, the counterargument would be, if you do this mechanical hard rule, the unemployment rate, of course, is not a perfect summary statistic for the state of the labor market or for things we care about.  Look, I\u2019m not trying to go all John Taylor on you guys.  This is not about rules versus discretion.  The very important thing in this case is, we have discretion over our other and more important tool, which is the path of the funds rate.  The way I would try to explain this is, we\u2019re putting this thing on autopilot.  But\u2014and I think this gets very close to what President Williams was talking about in terms of the way you shape the forward guidance, and a little bit of this is in paragraph 5 of alternative A\u2014you make it very clear that after liftoff, we\u2019re going to be conditioning on exactly those things that we can\u2019t condition on if we subject the LSAP program to a mechanical stopping rule based on unemployment.  After liftoff, if labor force participation comes in a little weak or if inflation is lower, all of that, which we\u2019re going to explain now as clearly as possible, will shape how we behave after crossing the 6\u00bd percent threshold. So that\u2019s basically the point.  Again, I wanted to make clear the concerns I have over alternative B\u2014there\u2019s a fair point that a number of people have raised:  You don\u2019t want to just get locked into saying, \u201cI hate asset purchases, and I\u2019ve hated them for a long time, and I want them to die.\u201d But I think the concern is no longer really over that, and this proposal, in fact, might lead us to do, in expectation, more in the way of asset purchases than whatever policy we may be following if we go down the alternative B route. I think it\u2019s really that we\u2019ve got a communication problem.  We\u2019ve felt it now at a number of meetings, and we\u2019re likely to feel it at a number of meetings going forward.  We\u2019ll be doing ourselves, the incoming Chair, and the new Committee a huge favor if we can put this to one side and focus.  We\u2019re going to have our hands full with focusing on the short-rate set of issues, and I think we\u2019ll communicate more clearly about those if we\u2019re focused on that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER. I would have that section just say \u201cBut some tightening of financial conditions has occurred in recent months and, if sustained, could slow the pace of improvement in the economy and labor market.\u201d I don\u2019t think you take anything away.  I think, again, market operators would wonder what we\u2019re talking about, because they\u2019re seeing tightening in certain sectors.  But I think if we just say \u201cSome tightening of financial conditions has occurred in recent months and, if sustained . . .\u201d\u2014that\u2019s literally true"], "2013FOMC20131016confcall.txt": [" MS. ROBERTSON.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019ll start with the current government shutdown and debt ceiling debacle, which are nearly at an end.  There are many ways to account for the tremendous losses from this episode.  Jobs in the private and public sector, consumer confidence, our international standing, a possible and perhaps permanent erosion in the full faith and credit standing, critical government data, and a calling into question of our systems of governance are just a few of the many losses from this self-inflicted wound.  But the even more remarkable thing about this episode is that the proposed deal does not do anything whatsoever to resolve our longer-term budget or fiscal-related questions.  I\u2019m afraid that when we look back on this episode perhaps the biggest loss is that there were absolutely no lessons learned from this crisis. So with that introduction, let me quickly cover three questions.  Where are we.  What are the terms of the deal.  And what happens next. In terms of the deal, it appears, if all goes to plan, that the government will be reopened in the next day or two.  A budget conference of some sort will be asked to convene and to report back by December 13 to set in place the fiscal appropriation and budget parameters for 2014.  It\u2019s probably worth noting that since 2010 we have had eight such budget commissions, all of which have failed to produce much of anything.  In addition to that, the continuing resolution would be extended for fiscal year 2014 appropriations until January 15.  This will be done at basically the current sequestration levels of $986 billion.  Why January 15.  It\u2019s an important date for the formulation of congressional strategy because that is when the next round of sequestration for 2014 kicks in, at about a $967 billion level.  Now, that is roughly a $20 billion difference, most of which falls on defense spending.  So one would ask, why all of this for $20 billion.  The answer to that is this number greatly diminishes the real divide between the two chambers.  And that was evidenced by the collapse of the appropriation process earlier this summer. The Senate had been moving on a pathway that pretty much ignored sequestration for the coming year and, consequently, targeted an overall level of government spending about $90 billion above the House level.  The House, while meeting the targets, had its own problems, and they, too, sort of collapsed around themselves earlier this summer because they were trying to make up for what it perceived to be inadequate levels of spending in the defense arena by taking from all of the nondefense discretionary spending paths.  For example, the IRS would have had about a 25 percent cut.  Consequently, both the House and Senate paths were troubled.  They got nothing done.  And, consequently, it rolled up into this morass that we have had over the last several weeks.  So they are now going to have another commission\u2014\u201cconference,\u201d if you will\u2014that is going to look at this and report back by December 13 in order to deal with the January 15 deadlines.  So that\u2019s on the government spending side. The debt ceiling has been wrapped up into this\u2014and we\u2019ve got conflicting information at this point, so I may want to update you as the meeting goes along\u2014but it appears that they are going to have a debt ceiling date of February 7.  And because of the extraordinary measures, the way those work, and the time of year at which the Secretary of the Treasury will be exercising them, the extraordinary measures don\u2019t provide much benefit to the Treasury, extending the debt ceiling date from February 7 to probably mid-March.  If this had been taking place after June 1 or September 1, those extraordinary measures would have given a lot more leeway to the Treasury Department because of the way the tools interact. Now, the unknown, and what we are checking our BlackBerrys about, is that apparently they are still negotiating, and perhaps some of the McConnell language on the debt ceiling has made its way into this agreement.  Maybe that\u2019s just for this vote or it could be a more permanent part of the debt ceiling deliberation, and that would be a big deal.  Basically, what the so-called McConnell rule does is provide that the President has the authority to raise the debt ceiling, and it takes a two-thirds majority of both chambers to reject the President\u2019s action.  I find it hard to believe they are going to do this on a permanent basis because that\u2019s a pretty fundamental change.  But it seems that something akin to that has at least made its way at this hour into the agreement", " MR. LACKER.  I\u2019m not sure what \u201closing market access\u201d means.  Do you mean they wouldn\u2019t like the price they\u2019d get", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The refunds go out early, and the receipts tend to come in late.  So I would imagine that February\u2013March is probably pretty problematic", "   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  [No response]  Susan, what is your sense of the understanding of banks and the public about how this is going to work.  What are the main weak points at this juncture in terms of their understanding of how payments would operate", " MS. FOLEY.  I think that there are assumptions being made by market participants.  I do know that there are some who are making scenarios that say, \u201cOkay, if it happens in terms of prioritizing principal and interest, this is what we would do.  If there is not going to be prioritization of principal and interest, here are some other assumptions that are made.\u201d  I think if you are in a situation where principal and interest are not prioritized, there is a big question of how a lot of institutions would handle that situation in terms of their contingency planning.  That\u2019s a big open question.  So I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty in the market", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We had the Treasury bill auction\u2014what, last week.\u2014where some of the dealers did not bid an amount equal to their market share of primary dealership.  They did not show up to their pro rata share.  If two dealers wouldn\u2019t show up to their pro rata share, there\u2019s always a risk that more wouldn\u2019t.  And they could actually potentially have a failed auction", " MR. POTTER.  Yes.  I would like to briefly highlight some of the operational issues the Desk would encounter with the possible policy actions and delayed-payment scenarios.  Some of these issues are also faced by market participants in their own transactions. First, in order for the Desk to accept Treasury securities with delayed principal payments in operations, the Treasury would need to authorize the New York Fed to extend on Fedwire the maturity date of any security maturing the next day\u2014by  10:00 p.m. at the very latest. Second, the Desk\u2019s current Treasury LSAP purchases are not likely to substantially mitigate market disruptions in delayed-payment scenarios.  As a simple example, we have about $22 billion left to purchase in October, and even if we only purchased securities that will pay a coupon on October 31 during eligible operations for those securities, it would amount to about $9 billion of the $700 billion in affected securities. Third, while the Desk\u2019s securities lending operation would be one way for market participants to borrow unaffected securities, the legal agreements and some of the processing infrastructure around these transactions make them less effective in delayed-payment scenarios.  In particular, the timing of operations will not allow dealers to finance their borrowed securities in the triparty repo market.  Fourth, repo operations could provide cash against affected securities, providing a direct response to funding pressures.  However, the current structure of triparty settlement practices for any cash lender, including the Desk, may result in large intraday credit exposures for securities that mature during the course of the repo term.  That finishes the operational issues I wanted to highlight", "  The thrust of your question is if we can\u2019t lend to the discount window because of stigma, we need\u2014 MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  I\u2019ve gotten very mixed views from bankers as to whether they thought stigma would attach.  But the fact that at least some think it would makes me wonder what would happen if, the day after we made this announcement and there was a liquidity squeeze in the market, guys don\u2019t want to come to the window", "  MR. ENGLISH.  Not really, no.  I think in the discussion in 2011 the Committee expressed no particular interest in such a program.  There are issues that our money fund experts have raised about whether it even helps to lend to money funds if they have losses, or if you are buying things out of them.  That may just be concentrating the losses on the remaining money fund investors who haven\u2019t yet fled, and thereby giving them an even greater incentive to then flee the money fund.  So there are real questions about whether it helps, and there was a lot of discomfort, I think, on the Committee with providing assistance to money funds, where we think they are, in some sense, just a bad idea.  If there were problems with money funds, the way that the Committee could address that is by potentially buying bills or doing RPs to provide some liquidity and to provide a way for the money funds to sell their holdings rapidly in a market that might not be very liquid.  That would work as well as, or better, perhaps, than a lending program specifically for money funds", " MR. POWELL.  As a policy matter, yes.  I wonder, on a number of grounds, whether it is wise for us to be disclosing the things we will and won\u2019t do right now, a month and a half before the next debt ceiling crisis.  It seems to me you could argue\u2014and I\u2019d like to hear, obviously, what others think\u2014that the very thought that we actually countenance a debt default would be destabilizing.  You can also argue that\u2014here is your game plan\u2014if it actually looks like a good game plan, then it will make it less likely that the Congress will feel enough pressure to actually raise the ceiling.  I do think that the right time to be making disclosures is before a default; you don\u2019t wait until after a default.  I think you want to have a plan before there\u2019s a failed auction, and to be saying we\u2019re here to provide liquidity and assure the orderly function of the short-term money markets.  And that, ideally, is enough to avoid a default.  The real risk is of a failed auction, is the loss of market access at any price.  It\u2019s not that I want to wait until there is a default.  I think that\u2019s the wrong thing.  But I wonder whether just dropping this in the minutes on November 20 is wise", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, if we agreed on the first five, I would include that.  But, obviously, you\u2019d leave the door open that we will take other initiatives.  What I worry about is, with each passing incident like this, markets discount things well ahead of time.  We don\u2019t know when they\u2019re beginning to discount, or sniff out\u2014and I would defer to the Desk here, but my sense is that they sniff things out a little bit more quickly.  And if we wait until just before default or default, already markets and market operators are beginning to position themselves.  So I think we should show that we have discussed the matter, have agreement on certain tools we can use, but that we haven\u2019t shut the door to taking other initiatives to maintain market stability.  The market is moving faster with every passing day, and I don\u2019t think we have the luxury to wait.  I would like, in a market-operation sense, to at least take advantage of a period here where there seems to be a little bit of an opening to make it clear:  \u201cWe\u2019ve thought this stuff through.  We have some tools.  There are other tools we can apply,\u201d without stating the specifics of those tools.  But I would defer to Simon on that", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019d like to follow up on the point that I think President Lockhart was driving toward, and this was sparked in my mind reading the memo and coming across the phrase \u201cprevailing market prices\u201d so many times.  There are a number of things in 1 to 5 where we\u2019re doing things at prevailing market prices, and at issue are particular CUSIPs where the payment has been delayed or defaulted in some way or another.  The first question that arises in my mind is whether our actions\u2014our willingness to take them in RPs, or whatever\u2014would affect prevailing market prices.  Now, if it wouldn\u2019t, because the market for those things is so large and ours is tiny, I\u2019m wondering why we would do it.  And if it would, then I think there is this issue. There are a lot of different cases to piece out here, and I started thinking about this in terms of what principles I\u2019d start with, with this whole endeavor, to guide our choices.  And one of them is that we really ought to be ensuring monetary stability, in the sense that we\u2019re accommodating significant shifts in the demand for money, like we did on 9/11, where there was a $100 billion shift in the demand for money in one day, and we accommodated it. But then I think\u2014and Bill English mentioned this in his presentation and remarks\u2014preserving the measure of independence we won in 1951, and I mean specifically avoiding the subservience of our monetary policy objectives to the Treasury\u2019s financing needs, is important, too.  And I\u2019m wondering whether intervening in a way that affects the relative price of the defaulted CUSIPs would risk raising the appearance of our essentially buffering private-sector market participants from the effects of the Treasury\u2019s default.  And while that\u2019s not forbearance that benefits the Treasury directly, it does, to some extent, insulate markets from the effect of its action in a way that implicates the kind of issues that came up in \u201951 and that Bill alluded to.  So I\u2019m wondering, is there something in between our intervening in the way that 1 to 5 describe in the CUSIPs that are defaulted and our staying away from those CUSIPs altogether.  If our actions won\u2019t affect prevailing market prices, and if we stay away that won\u2019t affect prevailing market prices, then I\u2019m not sure what the value of our intervening in those CUSIPs is", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I will just follow up briefly on what President Lacker said, because I think he raises some very good points that I have certainly been troubled by.  I think it is important that when we are thinking through 1 through 5, one of the backdrops for that \u2014at least for me\u2014is that we are thinking about this as being a relatively short-term event where the Treasury will eventually make us whole.  If we buy a defaulted-upon security, we expect that within a relatively short period of time, the Treasury will actually act to make us whole on that.  If we didn\u2019t have that expectation, I think that 1 through 5 wouldn\u2019t look as attractive to me.  But I think our interventions that are being described in 1 through 5 are expressing that confidence that we will be made whole, and in that way moving market prices.  That\u2019s very similar to\u2014as you, Mr. Chairman, referred to\u2014how we operated in a crisis.  We expressed a level of confidence that maybe the private-sector agents, because they were operating on their own, couldn\u2019t have", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  To weigh in on the communications issue a little bit, I think markets are making assumptions about what we will do anyway, whether we announce something or not.  And so I think that\u2019s where it becomes a little bit odd to say, \u201cWell, we are not going to communicate about something where markets have clear assumptions about what we do anyway,\u201d because all that\u2019s doing is putting a cloud of uncertainty around what might actually happen in the case of a default.  I would say also that the Treasury has long had the policy of not wanting to talk about this issue publicly.  But there again, markets are making assumptions about what the Treasury will do, and in particular that they will prioritize principal and interest payments, which has really been something Treasury secretaries for a long time have said.  So I think that this idea about not communicating ahead of the crisis because you might bring the crisis on maybe isn\u2019t the best way to think about this, if you start thinking about the fact that private-sector guys are making assumptions anyway.  All the Treasury is doing is putting a cloud of uncertainty about what it might do in the case of a crisis, so if we actually got into the crisis, it would make things much worse than they would otherwise have to be.  I think there is room for some change in thinking on this if we get past this particular round so that you could at least have some contingency planning and some statements on the table, frankly, both by the Treasury and by the Fed here\u2014if we could get the Treasury to come around to that view, which it probably won\u2019t.  Then when we actually got into the crisis we would be able to mitigate it further, or better than we otherwise would be able to.  And this would be an important component of meeting our price stability goals.  This probably dovetails a little bit with President Kocherlakota\u2019s leading comments earlier in this meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I wanted to follow up on Governor Stein, and on this whole 6/7/8/9 question.  For me, 7 is consistent with our broad monetary stability objectives.  A broad rise in RP rates, across the spectrum of red-zone and non-red-zone securities, would suggest an increasing demand for liquidity that we\u2019re ideally situated to supply.  We did this on 9/11.  We just fixed the RP rate and offered to intervene at whatever quantity people wanted.  Moreover, we did this strange thing.  We usually keep a spread between Treasury-only, agency, and MBS RP rates, and we flattened that out and just took them all at the same rate.  We were making a judgment there that we were willing to squash those spreads.  And the same question would arise with regard to these \u201cred-zone CUSIPs,\u201d I guess we could call them.  So, subject to the proviso that there\u2019s some delicacy about that, I\u2019d support 7. The same for 6 too, I think, but \u201cundesirable from a policy point of view\u201d was a phrase that had me scratching my head.  I thought we wanted to get rates low, but the broader question here has to do with transitory versus permanent, more persistent changes, because a rate that spikes for a day or two is not going to really affect our monetary policy objectives in any meaningful way.  You know, we are thinking about things flowing through longer-term rates and monetary policy being transmitted that way.  Yes, some people would lose some money if rates go up or down by a lot in one particular day or not.  But I think it\u2019s for something that\u2019s expected to persist for a couple of days that we would want to intervene.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019d want to intervene just for something that we were sure was only going to last a day.  I think President Kocherlakota\u2019s comments are germane here, and I think going down this path is consequential enough that I would like to see some check-in with the Committee on this.  But I would be willing to delegate if that\u2019s the broad group\u2019s view. About 8 and 9, I was going to use the phrase \u201cbeyond the pale.\u201d  Governor Stein invites us to put ourselves in the position of a state of the world, ex post, in which things are really bad.  And back to President Kocherlakota\u2019s observation that our willingness to intervene in these red-zone CUSIPs reflects an underlying assessment on our part that the government is not going to default.  Well, if this is a bad state of the world, like Governor Stein describes, there would be a difference of views between us and members of the financial public on that.  Otherwise, the price declines would be arrested, and yields wouldn\u2019t go up so much.  So if it\u2019s really a disaster for those red-zone CUSIPs, it must be that a lot of the market participants don\u2019t have the confidence that President Kocherlakota suggests we should act on in buying these.  I think that raises delicate questions, and I don\u2019t think that ex post is the sole perspective you want to consider that from.  I think you want to ask the question of, what do you want markets to think we are going to do in that situation.  And you want to look at things from an ex ante perspective.  This is sort of a general proposition.  From that point of view, it strikes me that Governor Powell\u2019s \u201cloathsomeness\u201d is really germane here.  So I\u2019m opposed to 8 or 9", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On option 7, I do think we should consider this as part of our toolkit.  However, if we made a decision like that, it could be a momentous decision for the Committee\u2014arguing that we would possibly be targeting repo in the future instead of fed funds.  That\u2019s a decision that should be made by the Committee and not by a crisis or by the Chairman alone.  So I would say that the Committee should authorize that if we get to that.  I doubt that there would be a situation that would be so dramatic that we would have to go ahead with a decision of that magnitude without consulting the Committee. The other options I think we should put in our pocket for now, and just table them for the time being"], "2013FOMC20131030meeting.txt": [" MR. POTTER.  Exhibit 14 shows you that the outstanding stock that we could still purchase is large.  It wouldn\u2019t be a large percentage of that.

In the past, my predecessor and I have voted against these on the grounds that they were an adjunct to foreign exchange operations that were essentially fiscal policy and should be the responsibility of the U.S. Treasury subject to the authorization of the U.S. Congress.  Today we\u2019re being asked to make these things that were adopted on a renewable basis in the midst of the crisis into a relatively permanent arrangement.  Their purpose is not for exchange market intervention this time, but the provision of dollar funding by foreign central banks to overseas financial institutions.  I recognize that the SOMA would not bear exchange risk or credit risk in these transactions, but nonetheless, we\u2019d be facilitating yet another expansion of central bank backstop lending commitments, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the best path to financial stability.  So I would oppose authorizing the manager\u2019s request", " WILLIAMS.  Just a question about how to read the market\u2019s expectations for the fed funds rate:  It was striking that the primary dealer survey shows a huge number of people expecting the funds rate liftoff to be in the third or fourth quarter of 2015.  But when you look at the expected fed funds rate, while it is consistent with liftoff around then, it is also consistent with the fed funds rate at about 1\u00bd percent at the end of 2016.  The primary dealers are saying around 2 percent at the end of 2016.  When we look at the mode, it looks like liftoff won\u2019t be until 2017.  This is a question for Simon, or for anybody:  How am I supposed to understand what the market expectations for monetary policy are when there is such a big differencebetween the mode and the implied fed funds rate\u2014which is, I think, the reasonable view given the zero bound\u2014as well as between the mean and the primary dealer survey", " MR. ENGLISH.  Well, yes, absolutely.  And there is probably considerable uncertainty, so there may not be that much weight around the mode.  There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about the outlook for the funds rate, for sure", "MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston\u2019s forecast is quite similar to the staff\u2019s Tealbook forecast, including some of the interesting contours of that forecast.  Like the Tealbook, we expect that the second half of this year will look much like the first and that we will finally live up to our New Year\u2019s resolutions over the past few years and GDP growth will rise from 2 percent to 3 percent beginning in the new year.  But just how confident can we be that this time we will achieve our resolution. Looking at some of the initial conditions, one can certainly argue that an uptick to growth is a realistic expectation.  An important component of this forecast is the increase in consumer spending due to a variety of factors that, by historical standards, appear to be quite favorable.  Consumers are wealthier, as both the stock market and housing prices have surprised on the upside over the past year.  While the recent payroll employment numbers have been disappointing, total payroll employment has risen by more than 2 million jobs over the past year.  Oil prices have come down, leaving more disposable income to purchase other items.  Finally, consumer balance sheets are healthier, and interest rates on auto loans and home loans remain quite low by historical standards. I would have expected these same positive events to have carried over to improved consumer sentiment.  However, that has not been the case.  Work by the Boston staff finds that sentiment remains surprisingly low, not only by historical standards but also relative to factors that normally drive consumer sentiment.  If one forecasts sentiment using economic variables that capture income, employment, inflation, commodity prices, and stock prices, there is a fairly tight in-sample fit.  However, currently sentiment is roughly 10 points lower than what would be expected from the out-of-sample forecast equation.  The source of the depressed consumer is hard to pinpoint, but it does raise a concern that after New Year\u2019s Eve, the morning-afterhangover may not lead consumers to spend as currently projected by models using historical data.  Certainly, one might conjecture that another prolonged discussion about the debt ceiling and government shutdown will do little to boost consumer confidence in the future. This highlights a second potential risk to the forecast:  the outlook for fiscal policy.  Even during less fiscally entertaining times, forecasts of government spending have economically meaningful standard errors.  Work by the Boston staff looked at how well forecasts of government spending captured subsequent government spending.  One might have expected that with an improved budget process, government spending would be fairly predictable.  However, the standard errors for both semiannual and annual forecasts of spending since 1979 are relatively large and indicate a fairly high degree of uncertainty about the accuracy of government spending forecasts.  In many cases over the past 25 years, the forecast errors have indicated that when the economy is weaker than expected, government spending tends to be larger than forecast.  I am concerned that this time the correlation may switch sign.  Government spending remains difficult to predict.  But while the precise timing and nature of the next fiscal agreement remain quite uncertain, the risk that we will experience disruptive fiscal discussions followed by more short-term fiscal austerity than is needed in the current economy remains quite elevated. In fact, my own recent forecast errors suggest that that pattern is something to worry about for the coming year.  Over the past few years, my baseline forecasts up to the actual fiscal decisions were that the 2011 debt ceiling discussion would not be disruptive, that the sequestration would not be implemented, and that this year we would avoid a government shutdown and another disruptive debt ceiling discussion.  That I have consistently assumed that irrational fiscal policy that damages the economy would be avoided, and that those errors have all gone in one direction with downside consequences for the economy, makes me pause as Ithink about a 2014 forecast that once again assumes that fiscal shocks will not drag down growth next year. Despite these concerns, I still expect the 2014 economic data to be better than the series of disappointments we experienced in the 2013 economic data, with real GDP growth accelerating from the 2 percent rate we expect in the second half of this year to 3 percent next year.  However, my forecast, based on an optimistic expectation of improved consumer spending and fewer headwinds from fiscal policy, does not have balanced risks.  The downside risks should make us unwilling to reduce stimulus until the economic growth we are expecting is clearly in the data, not just in the forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  [Laughter] MR. LOCKHART.  By the way, just to prove the point, that\u2019s what Santa Claus used to look like.  Next year\u2014 [Laughter] The tone of anecdotal reports from a pretty large sample of contacts in the Sixth District over the past three weeks was downbeat compared with the period before the September meeting and earlier in the year.  Many had expected a pickup in activity in the second half.  That acceleration has not materialized.  While most anticipate continued slow growth in the near term, many of our contact reports sounded the themes of increased uncertainty and greater caution.   The fiscal drama seems to have adversely affected household and business sentiment at least for a while.  The Affordable Care Act, the sequestration, and the regulatory environment were also cited as factors weighing negatively on confidence.A trucking firm expressed concern over a soft holiday season as some of its large customers, notably big-box and dollar stores, recently began cutting shipments.  A national distributor of maintenance and replacement industrial parts described flat demand from its 150,000 industrial customers and offered that manufacturers are building for orders, not for inventory.  Retail industry reports were mixed, but most contacts reported a decline in sales and demand following a slower-than-expected summer and back-to-school season.  Some retailers also indicated that they planned to hire fewer seasonal staff, reflecting less optimistic expectations about the upcoming holiday season.  We did hear reports of strength in consumer spending at the high end, reinforcing the perception of a two-tier consumer spending picture.  We heard concern expressed that households with tighter budgets may incur a hit to disposable income because of higher health care insurance expense. Business investment appetite and intentions remain soft, with outlays aimed at equipment replacement rather than expansion.  We heard a number of reports of deferred investment decisions.  Our anecdotal feedback on employment trends and intentions was mixed.  Sectors such as energy, IT, auto, and construction continue to report incremental hiring.  In the auto sector, however, a provider of temporary labor reported a slowdown in manufacturers\u2019 converting temporaries to permanent employees.  A director in the hospital industry reported layoffs due to reduced Medicare reimbursement.  Otherwise we mostly heard reports of delaying additions to employment levels and resorting to increased hours to meet business demand. As regards price pressures, our contacts reported little concern about inflation.  Cost pressures seemed to be well contained.  Isolated industries, including fast food, grocery, and commodity construction materials, reported being able to get the market to accept small price increases.  Wages remained stable across most industries.To sum up, many of our business contacts this cycle reported revising down their expectations for the fourth quarter and 2014.  I think it is prudent not to overreact to mood swings among our public contacts, particularly directly after the spectacle of fiscal impasse here in Washington.  That said, my sense of the data points to continued slow growth in the vicinity of 2 percent rather than the hoped-for acceleration to something closer to 3 percent.  So I am once more marking down my near-term outlook and struggling with the question of whether to scale back economic growth projections for the medium term.  At the very least I feel I have to put more weight on downside risk for economic growth and inflation at this juncture than I did in September. The Tealbook\u2019s economic growth projection was revised downward a touch in 2013, but revised up marginally in 2014 and 2015.  My forecast continues to be less optimistic over the medium term than the Tealbook, and I admit to growing embarrassment with my persistently overly optimistic growth forecasts.  I\u2019m increasingly skeptical that the explanation is an unusual sequence of one-off events and temporary headwinds, and even if the reality is not something more persistent, I\u2019m finding it hard to convince myself that the economy will not limp along, if not indefinitely, then for quite a while longer.  This makes a tapering decision look more like a policy choice requiring extremely deft explanation, and I\u2019ll elaborate more in the next round on that. In the very near term, we may not get much help in clarifying the economic picture from incoming data, some of which are likely to be less reliable.  Also, the potential for some kind of replay of the fiscal drama clouds the near term through February at least.  These are frustrating circumstances in which to wrestle with the question of appropriate monetary policy, and I lookforward to the next two rounds for enlightenment from my colleagues.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As best I can tell from the data in hand and my business contacts, the economic situation hasn\u2019t changed a great deal since our September meeting, so in some respects, like President Pianalto, I could stop at this point.  I\u2019ll go on briefly. It\u2019s still difficult to assess the strength of the economy, especially the effect on activity of the financial market tightening overall since last spring.  Not only was the data flow interrupted by the government shutdown, but it is also hard to interpret the data and anecdotal information we do have, because they are colored by households\u2019 and businesses\u2019 reactions to the drama in Washington.  With that caveat, and as in the Tealbook, it looks to us like economic growth is continuing to muddle along at about a 2 percent rate.  Two thousand thirteen will likely turn out to be yet another example of events intervening to dash our beginning-of-year hopes for a meaningful step-up in activity.  The recent labor market data are consistent with this assessment.  My conversations with directors and business contacts also reinforce this view of muddling along. On the positive side, auto sales continue to be relatively strong.  Demand and pricing for steel has remained solid.  Businesses have breathed a sigh of relief with Europe finally beginning to grow again, and there are fewer worries now about slowing in China.  But the downside risks remain substantial.  In addition to the usual suspects\u2014perhaps it is a national pastime\u2014there is the new risk that Washington will schedule quarterly tournaments in brinkmanship.  It\u2019s sort of exasperating.  In such circumstances, businesses and households are exceedingly unlikely to accelerate their spending plans.  Indeed, none of my business contacts expressed plans to increase hiring or capital expansion through the first half of 2014 and certainly not before customer demand increases substantially, as President Fisher also alluded to.  And inflation continues to be low.In this environment, accommodative policies remain essential to supporting the economic growth prospects that we do have.  In sum, the limited information we have received since our September meeting did not strengthen the case for making an initial reduction in the pace of asset purchases.  We are still very much in a wait-and-see mode for our long-awaited virtuous cycle.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It\u2019s challenging to make monetary policy in the fog, and at the moment that fog is especially dense.  The latest employment report did show an upward revision to the rather tepid payroll gains originally reported for August.  Even so, the pace of monthly payroll gains shows a worrisome downward trend:  185,000 over the past 12 months, 163,000 over the past six, and 143,000 over the past three.  The unemployment rate in September rounded down one-tenth from August, but the participation rate failed to reverse any of its earlier declines.  Given the noise that the government shutdown will introduce into the next employment report, it may be some time before we get a clearer read on whether the slowing we are seeing in the pace of labor market improvement is just a temporary step down along a path that will eventually exhibit greater momentum, as in the Tealbook baseline, or whether the data instead portend a more lasting shift to a scenario of slower progress. In June, the central tendency of our GDP growth projections for the second half of 2013 was about 2\u00be percent.  Now the Tealbook projects just 2\u00bc percent, and only a small portion of this downward revision is due to the effects of the government shutdown.  Once again, the hope for acceleration appears to have receded into the future.  I recall President Rosengren drawing an analogy to Waiting for Godot in the previous meeting.  This observation is sobering not only because the current state of the labor market is unacceptably weak, but also because of what it says about our ability to forecast the economy\u2019s future course.  It thus raises questions not onlyabout the appropriate stance of policy today, but also about the appropriate conduct of policy in a world characterized by such great uncertainty. At the risk of oversimplifying, perhaps it is useful to consider four scenarios for the economy going forward, all of which, to me, have some plausibility.  In scenario 1, the run of bad luck we have experienced over the past several years is about to end, and we are poised to see a notable pickup in growth along the lines of the Tealbook\u2019s faster-recovery scenario.  In scenario 2, growth picks up as the various headwinds restraining demand abate, but more gradually, as in the Tealbook baseline.  In scenario 3, we are already at the new normal as far as economic growth is concerned because structural damage to the economy from the recession and the financial crisis exceeds that in the baseline.  In this supply-side-damage scenario, the job market, along the lines that President Lacker described, will continue to tighten even absent any meaningful pickup in demand because structural productivity growth has declined.  Finally, in scenario 4, structural productivity growth has not declined, but private spending picks up over time by less than the staff project, a scenario that seems entirely possible given the huge uncertainties surrounding our forecasts of private consumption and investment spending.  In this scenario we remain stuck in the mud, with economic growth continuing at a trendlike pace and little further progress in the labor market. Thoughtful arguments have been made around the table in support of each one of these scenarios.  Of course, like the Tealbook, many of us have been making overly optimistic predictions over the past several years.  Although there are some tangible factors we can point to, such as the European economic and financial situation and the course of federal fiscal policy in the U. S., I believe it\u2019s fair to say that we do not fully understand why growth has remained so persistently slow.  My own modal outlook follows scenario 2, something similar to the Tealbook baseline.  I see the economy developing momentum, but only gradually and only in a context in which monetary policy continues to provide accommodation for a long time.  To be sure, I\u2019m quite uncertain about this outlook, as it reflects more a tendency to draw inferences from past forecast errors than any clearly articulated view of exactly why aggregate demand is picking up so slowly. The other scenarios that I outlined also seem possible.  For example, as the staff have noted, the fact that growth of gross domestic income has outpaced GDP growth suggests that demand may already have picked up more than we recognize.  The structural-damage scenario also strikes me as a realistic possibility.  It is entirely plausible that the weak productivity growth we have seen since 2010 reflected at least in part the reversal of productivity toward its structural level following outsized gains in 2009.  But if payroll gains continue at the pace we saw last year in the face of only 2 percent GDP growth, could that still reflect catch-up.  The longer productivity keeps growing in the 1 percent range, the greater the likelihood that we may find ourselves in a world similar to that characterized in the supply-side-damage scenario of the Tealbook.  Scenario 4 is, to me, the most worrisome possibility.  There, productivity growth does pick up, but GDP growth does not, and the pattern of improvement we have seen in the labor market over the past year continues to stall out. Given the plausibility of all these scenarios, we need to ensure that policy will be appropriately positioned no matter which one unfolds.  In this respect, our current plans with respect to asset purchases and our threshold-based forward guidance work reasonably well, as I see it, in the first three scenarios.  If the headwinds lift more rapidly\u2014scenario 1\u2014we will be able to wind down the asset purchase plan as envisioned in June, and if unemployment reaches6\u00bd percent sooner than we anticipate, we could begin to remove accommodation sooner than in the baseline, as would be appropriate.  In scenario 2\u2014the Tealbook baseline\u2014our current plan to taper asset purchases as more evidence accumulates that we are on track and to maintain an accommodative policy for some time thereafter will get us back to our full employment and inflation goals, although the projected pace of progress is quite slow.  If slow productivity growth continues because of structural damage\u2014scenario 3\u2014our plan should also work.  The labor market would continue to improve even though growth may not pick up, but we can taper asset purchases as we see that progress, and if unemployment declines quickly, it would likely also be appropriate to remove accommodation sooner than in the baseline. What worries me most is scenario 4, in which we\u2019re stuck in the mud and progress stalls, because here the risks of stagnation and disinflation are significant, and policy does not seem appropriately positioned right now to respond.  In particular, we may not then be able to end our asset purchase program with a declaration of victory, and the outlook, absent further policy measures, would be unacceptably weak.  Tomorrow I will reflect a bit more on how we might respond to such a scenario", " MR. TETLOW.3  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019ll be referring to the handout titled \u201cMaterial for Policy Planning.\u201d  Turning first to forward guidance, as noted in the box at the top of the first exhibit, the Committee may wish to consider adding an inflation floor to its forward guidance for the federal funds rate to signal its commitment to price stability when inflation is unusually low.  Importantly, because an inflation floor would be an addition to existing forward guidance, which already includes an inflation threshold, an inflation floor would not amend prior commitments and could clarify that the Committee is committed to defending its inflation objective both from above and from below. The model-based analysis in the memo suggests that an inflation floor of 1\u00bd percent would produce economic benefits more often than not, but those benefits are likely to be small.  In the stochastic simulations, the floor is binding in only about one-fourth of the draws, and in only about one-half of the cases where it is binding does it shift out the liftoff date for the federal funds rate by more than one quarter.  That said, those simulations in which the inflation floor is particularly helpful\u2014ones in which inflation is low, of course, but also when the unemployment rate stalls near its threshold value\u2014are simulations in which losses without the floor are high.  Accordingly, an inflation floor might be best thought of as a hedge against certain bad states of the economy. With regard to communications, adding an inflation floor would help clarify the symmetry of the FOMC\u2019s inflation objective, but it might also present communications challenges.  To the extent that forward guidance is already complex, the addition of an inflation floor could further tax the public\u2019s understanding.  Moreover, the rollout of an inflation floor could be taken as signaling that the Committee is more worried about inflation remaining persistently low.   The lower panel discusses the provision of more information about the post-liftoff behavior of the federal funds rate.  As you know, monetary conditions today depend on the entire path of the future funds rate, not just the date of liftoff.  Hence, a policy that defers liftoff of the funds rate for longer than otherwise can nevertheless result in a tightening of the stance of monetary policy if the subsequent increase in rates is steeper.  In the staff memo, we examined the implications of committing to a policy for the federal funds rate, for the period after liftoff up to the point when the unemployment rate falls to 5\u00bd percent, that is more inertial than the inertial Taylor rule that we normally use.  We found that this more gradual post-liftoff rule would not likely affect the liftoff date but would result in a more gradual climb in the federal funds rate for some time after liftoff.  This results in small improvements, on average, in economic performance.3 The materials used by Messrs. Tetlow and Clouse are appended to this transcript (appendix 4). Implementation and public communication of such a change in post-liftoff policy would present challenges for the Committee, not the least because that event is likely to be well off in the future.  The meaning of a state-contingent gradual increase in the federal funds rate may be difficult for the public to understand.  At the same time, this addition to forward guidance, if timed appropriately, could be used to draw a distinction between federal funds rate and asset purchase policies. The second page of the handout covers the material on simple policy rules to guide decisions on reducing the pace of asset purchases.  The memo you received on this subject introduced three rules for purchases: one based on the unemployment rate and two others based on changes in payroll employment.  As you know, different measures of labor market conditions can send different signals, which can present pitfalls for simple rules that are written in terms of one variable, to the exclusion of others.  Revisions to the data aside, the choice among these rules matters when the unemployment rate and payroll gains co-move unusually.  If recent declines in the labor force participation rate (LFPR) continue, while payroll gains stay near current levels, the unemployment-based rule would call for faster reductions in LSAPs than would the payroll-based rules.  But if recent declines in the LFPR are largely cyclical and are reversed, the unemployment-based rule might call for slower reductions, even if payroll gains are strong. Communicating an LSAP policy rule would present some challenges for the Committee, some of which are summarized in the bullets at the bottom of the exhibit.  The most obvious concern would be handling conflicts in the signals coming from different labor market indicators.  A second issue is the coordination of an LSAP rule with existing thresholds for the funds rate, at least for employment-based rules.  Under some conditions, those LSAP rules could prescribe purchases to continue after the 6\u00bd percent unemployment rate threshold governing funds rate guidance has been crossed.  Based on our stochastic simulations, we computed the likelihood of this occurring to be roughly 7 percent.  A third issue pertains to communication of whether the new rule only allows the pace of purchases to ratchet down.  In the memo, we suggested that these and other obstacles might argue for a measure of vagueness in the initial communication of a rule, vagueness that could be shaped and clarified in longer-form discussions\u2014potentially including press conferences, speeches, and testimony\u2014and through repetition.  Thank you", " MR. BULLARD.  I have one question for President Evans, because this idea of tapering but then strengthening forward guidance at the same time has been kicked around the Committee before.  Are you worried at all that this would send a conflicting signal.  You want to pull back, but you don\u2019t want to pull back.  Are you worried about that at all, or not really", " WILLIAMS.  Do I have a whole hour", "  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  Yet another reason for a deeper discussion. A third alternative was to commit to overnight RPs at a predetermined rate until the threshold was crossed.  But my interpretation of the motivation of this discussion is to help people understand how long we think it will be until the thresholds are crossed, not our degree ofcommitment about what we\u2019ve said we would do until the thresholds are crossed.  Committing to doing something different until the thresholds are crossed\u2014it\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s going to change people\u2019s minds about how long it\u2019s going to be until the thresholds are crossed.  So I\u2019m a little puzzled about that.  I think the idea behind forward operations seems to be that we\u2019d take positions that commit us to losing money if short rates go up at some specified time in the future.  We haven\u2019t actually committed not to let rates go up.  Plus, because we\u2019re already pretty well positioned to lose a lot of money if rates go up, I\u2019m not sure how much additional credibility this would buy us. The third question concerns lowering the funds rate when we taper or lower IOER.  I\u2019m skeptical about whether it would help for the reasons someone said.  We would be using one instrument while we\u2019re tapering, which would be perceived as moving another way with another instrument, and that would be confusing.  In addition, the current level of the funds rate doesn\u2019t really say anything to anybody about how long the rate\u2019s going to be low, and I think the disconnect problem is about how long it\u2019s going to be until liftoff.  That\u2019s the major issue of the funds rate curve.  And, if we\u2019re going to lower IOER now, I think it raises a really awkward question as to why we haven\u2019t done this in the last five years.  It\u2019s just a little bit awkward that we haven\u2019t lowered it until now.  If there\u2019s some reason we can point to, then that might be good, but I think that\u2019s awkward. And, finally, regarding the mix of assets, I favor reducing MBS purchases only", "MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A lot of great things have been said already.  President Fisher asked me to speak until 6:00, but, given how many great things have already been said, it\u2019s going to be hard for me to meet that challenge. I do want to associate myself with the remarks that President Evans made about the main risk that we face, which is that the public and the markets don\u2019t see us as sufficiently committed to sticking with the long program of accommodation that is going to be required to meet our dual mandate objectives.  We continue to be falling short of our dual mandate objectives over the medium term, and I would say that that is one way for us to simplify our communication on an ongoing basis.  In January 2012, we set forth a strategic plan of what we are trying to achieve.  We came back and reaffirmed that strategic plan.  One way to simplify communication is to be making reference to that plan on an ongoing basis as a benchmark for what we\u2019re about.  For example, why would we think about lowering IOER now.  Well, actually, we\u2019re falling short on both of our mandated objectives.  We\u2019re falling short of what we\u2019re trying to achieve as an organization in terms of our strategic direction.  That provides an explanation for why we would take this step of lowering IOER at this time.  I think one way to achieve the simplicity\u2014and I won\u2019t be the one holdout, saying, \u201cYes, we should get more complicated if we can\u201d; I also favor simplicity\u2014is to be speaking more in terms of our goals and less in terms of the tactical moves that we are forced to confront on a meeting-by-meeting basis.  Now, with that said\u2014that I think we should be trying to be persuasive that we\u2019re in it to win it, and that we\u2019re there to try to get the recovery accomplished and get inflation back to 2 percent\u2014I sense that we are going to want to back away from the asset purchase tool before we have accomplished full employment and before we have gotten back to 2 percent inflation.President Rosengren laid out some arguments for not thinking about costs and efficacy.  I\u2019m actually quite sympathetic to the line of reasoning that Eric put forth, but I do not think it\u2019s commonly shared.  So we have to have a way to talk about this publicly\u2014why is it that we\u2019re going to back away from this tool when we\u2019re still short of our goals.  And this is the problem we faced with our recent communications about near-term tapering.  We\u2019ve been sending the following message:  We\u2019re willing to curtail or reduce monetary accommodation.  Mr. Chairman, despite your third principle, I think reducing the flow of purchases is going to be seen as taking away a tool when the unemployment rate is expected to fall only gradually and the inflation rate is expected to rise only slowly back toward desired levels.  That kind of communication is telling the public that we\u2019re quite comfortable with relatively long-term deviations from our employment and price goals.  It really tells that our strategic plan isn\u2019t that relevant for our thinking about monetary policy.  With that message, it\u2019s not surprising that the markets see it as a very real possibility that we might be willing to raise short-term interest rates relatively soon.  We can fix this communication problem\u2014I think President Lockhart hit on this, and I mentioned this in my last go-round\u2014by being more transparent about how we\u2019re thinking about purchases.  Why are we talking about reducing purchases in the face of a disturbingly weak macroeconomic outlook.  It\u2019s because many around the table have expressed growing discomfort with this unconventional tool in light of their concerns about its costs, its efficacy, and its just general \u201cunknownness.\u201d  That\u2019s not a word, I don\u2019t think", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with a comment that Governor Yellen made during her earlier statement that we appear to be in a pretty good place today.  So I prefer no action, and I guess that\u2019s alt-B. At our September meeting, we clearly indicated that we needed more and better confirmation that the SEP outlook was concrete and achievable.  Since then, the data flow was interrupted and the fiscal developments in Washington piled greater uncertainty onto our current setting.  I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m in the minority on that one, according to some of the comments so far.  At the margin, the economic setting is most likely worse than we thought in September. Now, with regard to particular elements in the statement, I don\u2019t agree with the suggestions about deleting the first sentence regarding the role of the government shutdown.  I think it\u2019s a reality check and that most commentators would say that it\u2019s more difficult to assess.  I probably didn\u2019t hear all of the details of President Williams\u2019s careful assessment of why thingsaren\u2019t that much more difficult to assess.  I would guess that in Chicago we had computer programs that had missing values and, when we went to run them normally, they just blew up, and so we had to do something in order to correct them.  I think it\u2019s objectively correct that it\u2019s more difficult to assess, and that\u2019s all it says, \u201csomewhat more difficult to assess.\u201d  However, then we say information received seems like things are actually pretty good.  I think that if you read the statement from the outset without that, it seems a bit too bright.  \u201cInformation received since the FOMC\u2026\u201d, I can imagine somebody\u2014Jon Stewart\u2014saying, \u201cWhat information did they receive during that time period.\u201d  Anyway, for me, it really adds more questions than answers.  Maybe there\u2019s a rewording that can make this better, but that bothers me.  I think the higher mortgage rates also are a pretty good explanation for at least a partial reason why we\u2019ve seen housing.  The other factors that President Fisher mentioned have been longer lasting, at least in my conversations with people in the housing industry.  Some of those effects have been around for a while.  It\u2019s the increase in mortgage rates that\u2019s been more timely and associated with that. Now, on the alt-A suggestion, I will admit a great deal of sympathy with the alt-A post-threshold guidance in paragraph 5, and President Williams rightly put emphasis on that yesterday.  I did not hear enough of a consensus for the 6 percent threshold change in forward guidance, certainly not today, maybe never, and I think that some additional post-threshold guidance helps.  I do think that the production function for making it do what we want it to do will involve an awful lot of additional commentary from the center of the Committee\u2014namely, you, Mr. Chairman, or Madam Chair, depending on when we do it.  I think it\u2019s going to require a couple, three-times-a-month type of commentary on that to drive it home because it\u2019s qualitative, and I think people are going to start asking questions about what it really means.  The 6 percentmaybe could have been dealt with, pounded in, and then it would be there.  But I think that based on the kinds of questions that the rest of us field when we go out and speak and those the wire reporters ask us, they\u2019re constantly asking for more information about that.  And I think it would be incumbent on us to make that effective, to do it more often; that\u2019s a feature of that. Regarding the last paragraph\u2019s forward guidance on the pace of increasing the funds rate, I do favor some type of guidance.  I\u2019m probably a little more sympathetic toward it than the commentary so far, but my staff has more concerns about it than I do.  I\u2019ll simply mention that when my expert staff is bringing up these same objections, it may be an indicator of how the public may struggle with that.  I definitely agree that headwinds present an enormous obstacle and are going to continue to be that way for a while, but, to some, it might sound too downbeat for too long regarding our assessment of future growth prospects.  So it may lead the public to believe we\u2019re more negative about the future than I personally intend by that guidance.  Now, to address this, I think it could be helpful to add a bit more specificity if this approach is seriously considered at some point.  So I would favor adding something to qualify headwinds, like fiscal and household headwinds that have been restraining the economic recovery, and then the language there.  I think you made an excellent observation, Mr. Chairman, about the effect of the fiscal policy to date.  It has been really big, and it would justify that type of language.  And the household sector is going to continue to assess and work to right-size its debt obligations for a considerably period to come.  I expect a long adjustment period like the analysis that we heard yesterday, unless we see much stronger wage and income growth across all industrial and occupational levels.  I think that that could work, but I assume that it\u2019s probably not live for today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before I comment on my preferred policy option, I wanted to provide some background on my thinking.  My estimate for the natural rate of unemployment is 6 percent, and I know that this is on the high end of the range of estimates in the SEP, but I take solace that I\u2019m not the only person with this estimate.  So with my natural rate of unemployment at 6 percent, I believe that we are going to need to begin to raise the federal funds rate when unemployment is somewhere in the range of, say, 6\u00bc to 6\u00bd percent.  That is less than 1 percentage point from where the unemployment rate stands today.Since the asset purchase program began last summer, the unemployment rate has fallen by nearly 1 percentage point, and we have had solid, if not spectacular, growth in payrolls.  So if we wait much longer to adjust the pace of asset purchases, we run the risk of making it even more difficult to separate our asset purchase program from our fed funds rate guidance, because when it comes to our hopes for the unemployment rate, their boundaries start to blur together.  And separating these tools seemed like it was a key theme from our policy planning discussion go-round.  Suppose the unemployment rate continues to decline at its recent pace and the first reduction in the asset purchase program is put off until next March at the earliest, which seems to be what markets are thinking.  In that scenario I think separation of the two programs is going to become even more difficult.  I favored slowing the pace of asset purchases at our last meeting, and I realize that slowing purchases at this meeting is essentially impossible because it would generate a second surprise in as many meetings. In light of the current market expectations, I would suggest that the Committee\u2019s statement in the form of alternative A is going to be read as indicating that asset purchases are unlikely to slow until some time in 2014.  So I would like to see some language inserted into alternative B that would give the Committee greater flexibility to slow asset purchases in December or in January if the incoming data support such an action.  And I think this could easily be done by inserting the following sentence after the first sentence of paragraph 3 in alt-B.  I would suggest inserting, \u201cIn the coming months, if the Committee continues to see further progress toward its objectives for the labor market and inflation, the Committee will likely begin to gradually reduce the pace of asset purchases.\u201d  Then the paragraph would just continue with, \u201cHowever, at this meeting the Committee decided to wait for more evidence,\u201d et cetera.  I think giving us a little more flexibility to move in December and January would be important.In addition, like many others have already suggested, I would not add the last sentence in alternative B.  In my mind, the effectiveness of our communications would be best served by only making further alterations to the forward funds rate guidance when we actually adjust the rate of asset purchases.  I think making these changes together would help to decouple our asset purchase program from our fed funds rate guidance.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Alternative B is certainly consistent with the decision in September to await more evidence that progress will be sustained, and in a world of noisy data and government shutdowns, awaiting more evidence of progress increasingly seems to be a very high bar.  That said, I do not support alternative B for several reasons.  As I have noted before, it continues aggressive easing despite actual and forecasted improvement in the economy.  There has been cumulative and sustained improvement despite fiscal headwinds and slow healing in labor markets.  And despite the critique that forecasts have been too optimistic, they have accurately projected forward momentum.  The Tealbook, the SEP, as well as private forecasters continue to do so. I do worry about the cost of this level of accommodation, perhaps because the costs among this Committee have remained ill-defined.  Our policy planning go-round highlights the challenges we face in several dimensions, such as how to communicate our goals, how to understand the effects of our tools, and explaining how they will be retired.  We should continue to focus on these issues not only for consistent messaging, but, importantly, to affirm our understanding of the efficacy of these tools relative to our goals and the realities of the economy. The emphasis on data dependence is important, but I\u2019ve been more focused on cumulative progress rather than the most recent data point.  Considering our progress just sinceJune, the unemployment rate has fallen; employment has increased by 600,000; and the September ISM manufacturing survey had the highest reading in over two years, driven in part by a rise in employment component.  The August ISM non-manufacturing index had its highest reading in eight years.  With this backdrop, I continue to view taking steps toward slowing the pace of asset purchases as appropriate and reasonable.  It is difficult for me to see that adding accommodation at some reduced pace represents any meaningful tightening. I also am concerned that market expectations of the cumulative size of LSAPs could continue to move higher despite continued job gains and declines in the unemployment rate.  Recall that primary dealers expected the unemployment rate at the end of asset purchases to be 7 percent according to the dealer survey prior to the June meeting.  This estimate was unchanged in the flash survey after the June press conference.  Given the latest survey that now shows expectations for tapering in March, the continued job growth and decline in the unemployment rate make it likely that we will not even start tapering before the unemployment rate reaches 7 percent.  Adjustments in these expectations regarding LSAPs might be appropriate if less progress had been made than previously anticipated or the medium-term outlook substantially deteriorated.  However, the unemployment rate has fallen more than expected and private-sector expectations for job growth are likely to exceed what had been forecast in September of 2012.  That said, it seems increasingly problematic to reinforce a direct connection between LSAPs and labor markets as we have discussed.  Moreover, postponing the start of LSAP reductions reinforces a message in my view that we think the outlook is weak when, in fact, the growth trajectory we continue to project shows acceleration. Finally, I would prefer to omit the proposed new language in paragraph 1 related to the government shutdown for reasons others have raised, as well as in paragraph 6, which I thinkdoes little to clarify our expected policy path and might introduce yet another unobserved variable into the policy-setting landscape.  And I would also be supportive of looking at some modification to the mortgage rate increase as the sole reason for the housing slowing.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just in terms of our medium-term planning, continuing the discussion from the earlier go-round, I will now say somewhat moreaffirmatively that I think it would be worth our individually and collectively thinking more about the alternative approach that Charlie Plosser suggested, which is to say instead of a tapering when we are ready to make a change in the LSAP policy, we instead think about announcing a total amount of the LSAP purchase and then just continue however many months it would take to get us to that point. Turning to today\u2019s action, I, like most others, support alternative B.  I have more to say about the language than I normally do, but that is prompted in part by the comments that others have made.  I am in favor not only of retaining the first sentence of paragraph 1 but of actually strengthening, or at least expanding, it.  I mean, it is a positive and not a normative statement.  It is supposed to be, as Charlie Plosser did say, describing a situation as opposed to suggesting a particular policy action.  First, it doesn\u2019t actually suggest that there has been significant fiscal contraction, other than that which is already ongoing.  It simply says it has made it harder to assess economic conditions during the intermeeting period, which I find actually quite true.  Something that is omitted from that statement, though, is actually the principal reason why I find the conclusion true, and that is the uncertainty around the lifting of the federal debt ceiling.  I think the effect of the shutdown itself was probably concentrated in Washington and a few other areas where there were delays in contractor payments being made, and the like, and I think the staff expects that most of that effect will be reversed in the coming weeks and months.  But in talking to market actors generally, what I found was that the run-up to the uncertainty and the residue of questions around the federal debt ceiling had more people hitting the pause button on things that they were thinking about doing.  And it is that which, I think, makes things a little bit more difficult to assess.  Will the pre-talk about shutdown and fiscal cliff trend continue through and be visible by December, or will the effects of the shutdown and the fiscal cliff debate lingerand be another blow to the general certainty about where the economy is headed.  So I would actually expand the statement to say that \u201cthe effects of recent fiscal developments, including the temporary shutdown of the federal government, uncertainty around the lifting of the federal debt ceiling, and delays in releases of some key data, have made the evolution of economic conditions during the intermeeting period somewhat more difficult to assess.\u201d On the question of the higher mortgage rates, I was under the impression\u2014but this may be wrong\u2014that existing home sales are more sensitive to mortgage rate changes than new construction, for some of the reasons I think Richard explained.  The only thing I\u2019d say, though, is if people don\u2019t want to leave the sentence as it is, I guess I would prefer to just delete the last phrase \u201cin response to higher mortgage rates\u201d rather than to insert \u201cpartially.\u201d I am just going to note in passing, but not suggest a language change, that I am not sure that I, at this point, fully subscribe to the first sentence of paragraph 3, which I see is now \u201cconsistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.\u201d  I think that\u2019s actually an open question at this point, which kind of gets back to the points I was making about paragraph 1.  But I definitely do not suggest a change in the language, certainly not at this time. And, finally, on paragraph 6, I join with many others in thinking that at least at this time it\u2019s probably better not to include it.  Hearing some of you, it sounds as though many of you would like to maybe see some massaging of the language itself.  But in terms of timing, I agree with what I think Jay said yesterday, and others have echoed, which is that if we are going to do something like this it is probably better to do it at a time when we have a new SEP, which confirms the expectation that is in there, and gives the Chairman an opportunity to explain it.  On the downbeat point, I get what people are saying.  But if the SEP is downbeat, then it is a little odd to be too worried about being downbeat in the statement.  Maybe there is a reason for that,but, as I understand it, the motivation for this language is the SEP.  And we have stated our collective expectations in the SEP, and they are not overly optimistic.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I see the Committee as still operating under the broad framework for reducing asset purchases that the Chairman articulated after the June and September meetings.  And going forward I see two broad cases.  In the first case, the data are strong enough to credibly warrant tapering and the fiscal negotiations conclude for now without disruptive consequences.  In that case the market will expect taper and the Committee should taper in keeping with existing guidance.  But what to do if the economy continues on more or less its current path of 2 percent growth, payroll gains that oscillate between decent and meager, and declining unemployment helped along partly by unwanted declines in the labor forceparticipation rate, or, alternatively, perhaps the declines in unemployment will slow or stop as labor force participation stabilizes.  I think, in that broad case, there is a choice to be made.  The Committee can just keep buying $85 billion of securities a month through 2014 and 2015, indefinitely, what President Lacker referred to as the \u201chamster wheel scenario.\u201d  If we pass the March meeting with no hint of another potential approach, then I think that is kind of the track that we\u2019re on.  The alternative is to adopt a shift in the mix of tool strategy:  gradually bring asset purchases to a halt by the end of next year, and strengthen forward guidance only if necessary.  And I think the time may be coming to make that change.  I hope not.  And I\u2019m inclined to favor this strategy. In terms of the timing, I think it\u2019s important to look at the calendar, as President Pianalto was suggesting.  We\u2019re about two years away from, in the base case, hitting the natural rate.  The range of natural rate from 6 to, say, low 5s would be hit sometime in 2016\u2014about two years out.  If you think about the red zone of tapering as being March and June, as I think of it now today\u2014I would like to be wrong, I would like it to be earlier, but probably March or June are the red zone\u2014we effectively have almost a year of runway for the actual taper, call it nine months.  At about that time, at the end of 2014, you are hitting the unemployment threshold.  Then, you have promised to wait for a considerable period, so you have used up most of 2015 waiting to think about actually raising rates.  At the end of 2015, you are right at the beginning of the zone of the natural rate, and now you haven\u2019t raised rates at all, so you\u2019ve got to get up to at least 2 percent, even in our headwinds scenario.  I guess I lay all of that out just to say that I don\u2019t see it as in any way premature to be having this conversation.  There has been a tremendous amount of progress made, and I think it is time to go ahead.  And I think doing this in March or June of next year would in no sense be premature in the base case.I think there will be major communications challenges in either of these two cases, but in the latter case where we are tapering and it\u2019s not a great outcome, I would still emphasize the extent of progress.  I would emphasize that the program has broadly achieved the goal that the Committee set forward of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market, and I would use the Chairman\u2019s three talking points of data-dependence, stock of progress, and independence of tools as well. It seems to me that it will still never be a great idea to talk about the inefficacy of asset purchases, and I\u2019m with President Bullard on this.  I would just point out that, in my opinion, there have been several occasions on which it would have been appropriate to taper, ignoring, for the moment, the question of the market\u2019s preparation.  For example, June was a time of significant optimism about the economy, with big payroll numbers.  Of course, the market was not ready for it.  My point is that the Committee doesn\u2019t have to choose a time that minimizes its credibility.  If it comes to this, it is appropriate to wait and taper at a time when credibility is higher in terms of payroll numbers and the other tests we have laid out for ourselves. In terms of the statement, I have heard all of the arguments.  I guess I would come down: take the first sentence out, take the last sentence out, take out \u201cin response to higher mortgage rates,\u201d take it all out.  [Laughter]  Leave it blank.  And I do kind of think we are all over fiscal policy here.  We\u2019ve got two other mentions of it.  It starts to sound like a little too much.  It is nice to mention fiscal policy, but we are doing it twice already.  Those are the things I would do.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  I\u2019d just like to restate.  I don\u2019t prefer the path that you\u2019re taking with regard to the first sentence.  I think that the first paragraph is going to appear odd because there\u2019s nothing in the statement that even acknowledges the events since our September meeting.  If you try to make the type of commentary that some have made like, \u201cOh, don\u2019t we feel better about the decision that we took in September because of what happened after September with regard to the government,\u201d there\u2019s nothing in this statement that gives rise to that justification.  It\u2019s close to clueless on that score", " MR. FISHER.  May I, Mr. Chairman.  I disagree because there are two references about fiscal policy; there\u2019s one in that very paragraph"], "2013FOMC20131218meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER. What about quantitative information about portfolio shifts.  Do you have a sense of what effect this has had on the banking system and banking deposits.  Are you going to learn more about that with the $3 billion cap", " MR. LACKER.  I would like to understand more, too.  I would feel more comfortable supporting this if there was a long-range plan and I had a more definite sense of what you were learning or what you were about to learn with the next incremental expansion of the experiment", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let\u2019s ask you to look into that unless there\u2019s some important technical barrier.  Do it Friday morning then", " MS. YELLEN.  I very much agree with that suggestion and think we ought to look at what role a facility like this could play, at least in our medium-term operating environment.  After all, we\u2019re going to have a very large balance sheet for a very long time regardless of what the end state of our operating regime looks like, and I think there are a whole bunch of questions we need to consider around this. First of all, I think we absolutely need to assure ourselves that this would work to set a floor if we go to full allotment.  And, when you think about it, if we end up beginning to reduce our asset purchases, people are going to begin to ask questions about our exit strategy again and about all of the things we have left unspecified.  Are we going to keep our balance sheet at its current size until after we have raised our funds rate target.  Well, we can\u2019t really comfortably do that unless we know that this facility is going to work. There are also very important questions about the fed funds rate when we go to full allotment, especially if we narrow the gap between the IOER and this rate.  The funds market could begin to dry up or become dysfunctional, which could mean that we\u2019re going to need to or want to move to a different rate that\u2019s our target rate which is, at a minimum in terms of communications, a big step, I think.  And given that market participants use the fed funds rate as a reference rate in a lot of contracts, we need to consider what happens if it starts to become idiosyncratic. I just want to say, I really endorse the notion that we have to look very seriously at these medium- or longer-term issues", " MR. LACKER. I\u2019ll just register, for the reasons that President Plosser and Governor Yellen outlined and that I outlined when we first discussed this facility, it strikes me that this would be more appropriate after having done some work to study the effects.  That would be my preference", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a quick question on the SEP projections.  I think it was back in June when our policy statement relied on the outlook coming out of the SEP, and I think the market reaction was that our SEP was stronger than they were expecting.  Is there any risk from these SEP projections that the market is going to be unexpectedly higher or lower or generate any potential increase. I\u2019m trying to guess what type of effect it might have on long-term interest rates by itself", " MS. DeBOER.  Sure.  I can give you two pieces of information that might help answer that question.  The fed funds rate implied by overnight index swaps right now is about 40 basis points lower than the SEP implied rate at the end of 2015 and about 40 basis points below in 2016 as well.  These quotes have not been adjusted for any term premium effect, which the staff believes is negative, so the difference from the SEP could be higher than is indicated by the unadjusted market quotes.  Another piece of information I could bring to bear is: the median primary dealer thought that the fed funds rate at the end of 2015 and 2016 is 25 basis points below where the SEP puts it.  So there is a chance that the market could interpret the SEP as more hawkish than it feels itself to be", "  Wasn\u2019t there also a view that the policies could lead to asset overvaluation and those\u2014 MS. WEINBACH. That\u2019s right.  That\u2019s what I mean by some particular markets may get overvalued\u2014yes. There was a wide range of views", "   MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a question on the SEP, too, that is related to Governor Tarullo\u2019s question.  We lay out the liftoff tied to calendar date, but we are providing guidance to the public tied to the unemployment rate.  Do you think it\u2019s confusing to have an SEP based on calendar time.  And do you think there would be any value to actually having it more tied to the thresholds that we are using in the forward guidance.  When I look at, for example, 2014, I don\u2019t know if those two individuals thought liftoff would occur because they thought we would be at 6\u00bd percent or lower, or whether they thought the threshold was inappropriate.  And similar to what Governor Tarullo was suggesting, I don\u2019t know exactly why people are picking that liftoff date\u2014is it tied to how strong the economy is, or is it tied to other factors. It just seems like it is a little bit at variance with our forward guidance to be so focused on calendar dates", " MS. LIANG.

Now, is the lower path of inflation in part due to more persistence of those transitory influences, or is there something else going on", "  The new Minneapolis Fed research by Fitzgerald, Holtemeyer, and Nicolini uses cross-SMSA evidence to eliminate this contaminant because monetary policy does not respond to a particular SMSA\u2019sinflationary pressures and demand pressures", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The narrative supporting a reasonable pickup in growth has strengthened since the last meeting.  Consumer spending and sentiment are stronger; industrial output and the ISMs are stronger.  As for the ongoing fiscal negotiations, given the political realities, there was no possibility of reaching a grand bargain.  So the upside case was that the Congress would do nothing.  It was a low bar.  And they got over it.  The deal is close to neutral in its effects on near-term GDP as an accounting matter, but if you think that uncertainty about fiscal policy may have been a significant restraint on animal spirits and, thus, on activity, as I think, then it is potentially much better than neutral.  And the big vote margin in the House suggests that there won\u2019t be a shutdown or a debt-ceiling crisis early next year, although, as Dan pointed out, there are more recent reports that do suggest that that unhappy possibility remains alive.  So we may be looking at a period of fiscal calm.  And combined with a reduction in fiscal drag for next year, that\u2019s potentially a big improvement. On the other hand, I get no sense of a meaningful pickup in activity from the bankers and industry people that I talk to, and I am inclined to give some weight to that.  Therefore, I am  forecasting 2.8 percent growth in GDP for next year, which is the low end of the central tendency and less than the Tealbook baseline scenario. On unemployment, I want to add a couple of things.  The first is that while monthly and quarterly payroll measures move up and down, the trailing 12-month payroll average has been remarkably stable around 190,000 per month, plus or minus 10,000 or so.  And I can\u2019t really think of a good reason not to expect something like that to continue.  Another implication of that is probably that policy ought to be much less affected by the first estimate of monthly payrolls, particularly when there are so many broader indicators of labor market conditions that are much more stable and show continued improvement. I was also struck by the discussion in the Tealbook of recent forecasting history.  What has been consistent since 2009 has been a faster decline in unemployment for a given amount of GDP growth, which has led the staff to substantially downgrade its assessment of the supply side of the economy.  We discussed this puzzle at the September meeting at some length, and numerous factors may be at play.  But the longer it goes on, the stronger the case is for still more supply-side adjustments.  In that connection, I was struck both by the recent Board analysis and by a paper by Shigeru Fujita of the Philadelphia Fed that shows that the surprising and unwelcome declines in the labor force participation rate since 2011 are entirely due to retirements and not to an increase in discouraged workers.  Empirically, retirees have been very unlikely to return to the labor force.  Let me add that Dan\u2019s caveats around those data are both welcome and appropriate to consider.  I have learned that you can never look at any one paper, any one argument, or any one set of data, until you hear all of the sides.  But it is, to me, very interesting and troubling information.   All of that leads me to expect payrolls to gradually increase above a couple hundred thousand per month as the economy improves, but with good months and bad months around that trend, accompanied by fairly rapid declines in the unemployment rate.  I project that it will go down to 6.3 percent at the end of this year and to 5.7 percent at the end of 2015. I do see a substantial improvement in the labor market since September 2012, and so it does seem to me that labor market conditions are supportive of a decision to gradually reduce purchases beginning tomorrow.  It also seems to me that the incoming data and, particularly, the supply-side damage story do weaken the argument that the U3 unemployment rate is sending a misleading signal about labor market slack. Turning to inflation, the fourth-quarter deceleration in core inflation is troubling, particularly at a time when growth is picking up and slack is decreasing.  The baseline view is that the reasons for this decline are things that don\u2019t give us much of a signal about the future direction of inflation\u2014medical prices, import prices, and the like.  So the baseline forecast for PCE and core inflation continues to be a gradual return to 2 percent.  I am inclined to agree, and I draw support from the fact that hourly earnings are growing at 2 percent and also that inflation expectations remain grounded.  But this will clearly bear close watching. Finally, based in part on an expectation of inflation moving only very slowly back to our longer-run objective, on rate policy I find myself predicting a somewhat slower return to normal levels of the federal funds rate.  So I\u2019ve got the federal funds rate at 75 basis points at the end of 2015 and 1.75 percent at the end of 2016.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Which direction, Bill", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But one has conditionality, and the other doesn\u2019t, so they\u2019re not really the same. You\u2019re comparing apples to oranges", " MR. POTTER.  One other point on the SEP, which is a controversial point, is that some people trend.  They will take the four highest dots and not include those in the calculation.  And I think if you take those out, there might be a slight drop in the SEP number", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But what you said before about a particular difference in trading volumes doesn\u2019t even seem to be factual", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My goal for this meeting would be to leave financial conditions unchanged until we see data that clearly indicate real GDP growth above potential and clear movement of PCE inflation back toward our target of 2 percent. My forecast is that such evidence will be more apparent in the data by our March meeting. I have three reasons for waiting. First, we have been consistently overestimating how quickly we will get above-potential real GDP growth with inflation moving toward our 2 percent target.  We should wait until these outcomes are in the data, not just in the forecast.  Second, the cost of patience is quite low. In my estimation, we have little evidence that the costs associated with increasing our balance sheet will be much higher if we wait until March to begin tapering. Third, with inflation so low, we should be doing whatever we can to more quickly return both elements of our mandate to their goals.  My forecast is that even waiting until March to reduce purchases would still leave us below our 2 percent inflation target and the unemployment rate just above my estimate of the natural rate three years from now. I am concerned that, by reducing purchases at this meeting, we risk tightening financial conditions, possibly significantly.  I certainly hope I\u2019m wrong.  Such a tightening would put atserious risk the 3 percent growth in most of our outlooks and thus push the attainment of our dual mandate goals even further into the future. My strong preference is to do nothing at this meeting. But quantitative forward guidance, such as lowering the unemployment threshold in our statement to 6 percent, would mitigate my concerns.  There does not seem to be sufficient support for that now.  However, I cannot support the current alternative B, which risks a further and, in my view, premature tightening of financial conditions. In summary, with the unemployment rate still elevated and the inflation rate well below the FOMC target, changes in the purchase program are premature until incoming data more clearly indicate that the economy has sufficient momentum to sustain GDP growth faster than its potential rate.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  As I listen to this conversation, I\u2019m going to be thinking about how I\u2019m going to talk about these things in the press conference.  Let me just make a comment here on the use of the unemployment rate. An early version of the statement said something to the effect that gains in the unemployment rate had overstated progress, which we eliminated, and I think the discussion yesterday suggested that that really wasn\u2019t the right way to think about it.  In a speech about a month ago, I actually said something like, \u201cThe unemployment rate is the best single indicator   that we have, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re using it to essentially trigger the broader conversation about what\u2019s happening in the labor market.\u201d  So, assuming we do not lower the threshold, if I\u2019m asked why we didn\u2019t lower the threshold, my plan is to say something like, \u201cWell, again, the unemployment rate is the best single indicator.  It tells us when to begin looking.  But we don\u2019t want to tie our entire analysis of the labor market to a single variable.  The sense of the Committee was that, once we get to 6.5 percent, we want to look at a broader set of variables at that point\u201d\u2014so, without downplaying the accuracy of the unemployment rate, I would just suggest that it\u2019s a good signal to think about looking at the whole range of variables, without saying there\u2019s any kind of bias in the unemployment rate", " MR. PLOSSER.  That\u2019s fine, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with all of that, and that\u2019s okay.  My reading, though, of the statement is that the language in paragraph 5 seems stronger than that.  It seems to be making a much stronger statement\u2014that we will not do anything when we get to 6\u00bd percent.  It\u2019s not definitive, but, to me, it sounds stronger than what you just said", " MR. PLOSSER. First, just to clarify, President Bullard, there is no optimal policy design for asset purchases that I\u2019m aware of. I know of no theory according to which we can write down an optimal control problem with asset purchases and derive optimal control policies for asset purchases.  So I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re able to determine what is the right rule, if you will, or conditioning statements, that purchases ought to go by. The second point I would make is that our asset purchase programs are conditional and have been conditional.  We\u2019ve tended to announce programs and have always been able to add another program or restart a program when we chose to do so.  We did QE1, and then we did QE2 because the economy was not responding.  Subsequently, we did Operation Twist, and then we started QE3. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t even taper.  I would just keep the $85 billion and then stop it at some point, with the clear knowledge that if the economy was not cooperating, we could restart the program and do it again.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear that the path here is not optimal, but it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s very confusing by not specifying what our reaction function really is, and that\u2019s part of the problem\u2014 we haven\u2019t been able to do that.  So I would say that we don\u2019t have a Taylor rule for asset purchases, much as we might like to have one.  We don\u2019t know how to specify that optimal control problem, either", "  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  I see.  I look forward to some analysis.  Let me talk about the end of paragraph 2.  I would prefer not to do this blue language.  I like the original language better.  It is not quite as anxious.  But if we are going to do this language of President Evans, I would strongly suggest that we replace \u201cis moving\u201d with \u201cmoves.\u201d  The \u201cis moving\u201d suggests that we detect some increase in inflation that is in train.  And I\u2019m not sure we do. I think where we are around the Committee is that we expect, we hope, that inflation will increase.  But I don\u2019t think we believe it is in train, and the \u201cis moving\u201d suggests that we think something is in train.  And I think it would be a little more felicitous to make it clearly future tense there. On the change at the end of paragraph 4, in blue, changing \u201ceconomic outlook\u201d to \u201coutlook for the labor market and inflation\u201d\u2014I like that. That leaves out output growth, which is something that I have wanted for some time.  Once you have talked about labor markets, you  have said it all except for productivity growth.  And we don\u2019t really view that as something monetary policy can do a lot about, which is why I have been arguing for that for a while. And then the other thing in paragraph 4 that Presidents Lockhart and Williams commented about, this \u201cfurther measured steps\u201d phrase.  The concern I have about that language would be that whatever our step is now, that language might convey that we are not going to do anything bigger in the future.  And \u201cfurther measured steps\u201d kind of has that flavor, and I\u2019m not sure if President Lockhart\u2019s or Williams\u2019s suggestions get around it.  I think President Williams\u2019s suggestion of deleting \u201cfurther\u201d helps because it doesn\u2019t make it sound like we think this is a measured step.  It sort of leaves it open whether the step we just took is measured or not.  So I would support President Williams\u2019s suggestion there.  And I think I would support President Lockhart\u2019s suggestion as well to change \u201cmeasured\u201d to \u201csimilar.\u201d I believe that\u2019s the end of my list of options to comment on.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, you confused me on that last comment.  I view \u201cfurther measured steps\u201d as the intermediate option.  If we take out \u201cfurther,\u201d that would seem to give more flexibility.  But then you just said replace it with \u201csimilar,\u201d which I think makes it less flexible.  So I\u2019m not quite sure which way you want to go", " MR. EVANS. If I could just offer a comment, on the first sentence in paragraph 5, I cannot improve upon your statement that this continues to maintain highly accommodative policy.  But, we know from what we\u2019ve done over a long period of time and research on monetary policy that you can easily say with a straight face, \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to have highly accommodative policy even when the funds rate starts to go up to 1 percent,\u201d right.  You can measure it against what Wicksell\u2019s natural rate is or whatever. That statement is operative for a very wide range of different policies. I think that the way that you will express it will be understood as genuine, but you can imagine that some people would react to it and say, \u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s not the strongest statement", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am prepared to go ahead with alternative B today.  In my view, the decision to reduce purchases is well justified, as can be seen in the comparison of labor market conditions to those that prevailed in September 2012 and to those that the Committee expected to prevail today. Payroll levels are 1.5 million higher than expected.  Unemployment is almost a full percentage point lower than expected and, as I mentioned yesterday, and others mentioned as well, the trailing payroll numbers are in good shape for 3-, 6-, and 12-month levels.  So it is, in fact, a pretty good hand of cards on that front.  The decision is also justified under the framework that the Chairman articulated at the June meeting.  We have continued progress in the labor market, growth picking up, and inflation that is forecast to return over time to our 2 percent objective. In addition, our reasons for not tapering in September\u2014weaker data and the fiscal negotiations\u2014have been addressed. All of that said, I struggle with two concerns, the first of which is timing, and for me the question then is taper now or wait until the March meeting, and the second is inflation and how to think about the inflation forecast in connection with this decision.  So on the first, on timing, at the last meeting I argued that we needed three things to taper before March: strong incoming data, a successful conclusion of the fiscal negotiations, and communications from the core members of the FOMC that signaled that the December meeting was very much on the table.  So we absolutely got the first two done, and I thought that the third element would be virtually impossible to satisfy, and that was the basis for my confident prediction that we would not be able to taper until March. But I have to admit we\u2019ve gotten there.  Through a sequence of events,   we\u2019ve gotten to a place where it\u2019s expected at one of the next three meetings. But it\u2019s not fully anticipated, although I do believe that the market would see a taper as fully justified based on the Chairman\u2019s framework, based on the improvement in labor market conditions.  So the content is not a surprise.  It\u2019s really that the decision to move at this meeting rather than one of the later meetings is ahead of expectations only in a time sense. It\u2019s a surprise.  It\u2019s probably a tiny hawkish surprise, and I expect there will be a reaction in the market.  Like others, I don\u2019t see that it ought to be a major reaction, and it ought to settle down in a few days.  And the Chairman will communicate strongly at the meeting there is no intended hawkish surprise here.  So I\u2019m comfortable with going ahead from a timing standpoint. As far as inflation is concerned, we are obviously in a very difficult place.  The forecast is for a slow return to 2 percent, and there really is no expectation in the forecast of notably higher inflation in the short term.  So if inflation goes sideways for a while and is mainly held down by factors that send no important signal about slack, I don\u2019t think I see that as a basis for pausing the taper. Going to the language in the statement, I think that the new blue language in paragraph 4 of alternative B gets it exactly right.  It\u2019s about the outlook for inflation.  The inclusion of inflation there will be seen as a signal, and it\u2019s about the outlook.  I think that kind of has it exactly right.  And I actually think that the language at the end of paragraph 2, \u201cinflation is moving back toward its objective,\u201d leaves me a little bit uneasy because there really isn\u2019t much of an expectation that we will see inflation moving back in the next couple of meetings.  So I wonder whether that doesn\u2019t create some uncertainty around the path of purchases in the near term.  As John indicated, one or two or three data points become a trend, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s intended that way, but some may see it and it may create uncertainty.  So I see that as a concern.In terms of the other language, I do really like all of page 6.  As written, that page is quite good.  I like the original language, \u201cin further measured steps,\u201d because I think it\u2019s a good balance. It creates a fair amount of certainty.  One or two more tapers, it\u2019s going to create a lot of confidence in our path.  I could live with strengthening it, and I think maybe we look at that over time to see if we could become more deterministic in terms of both the time and the amount.  I mentioned I like the blue language.  In terms of the language for after hitting 6\u00bd percent, I\u2019m very comfortable with this.  In my own forecast, liftoff actually happens just after we hit 6 percent, and so I think this gives a strong indication of where we are without giving away discretion for free. That\u2019s it on the statement. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Thanks, everyone.  A lot of interesting discussion, but I don\u2019t think there are too many decision points on the alternative B statement. I think in alternative B, paragraph 2 there was a pretty clear preference for the balanced risks option\u2014\u201crisks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having become more nearly balanced.\u201d  This is very consistent with the SEP, which had only one or two to the downside\u2014what is it, Matt", " Chairman\u2014 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes"]}
