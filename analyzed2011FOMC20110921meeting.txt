 MS. YELLEN.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "So moved" suggests agreement or support for a previous statement or proposition.


Passage number 3.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Let me start by welcoming Esther George to the table.  Tom Hoenig is still president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for another 10 days, and so officially you’re representing the Bank as first vice president, but at the next meeting, you will, of course, be succeeding Tom.  You’re well known to everyone around the table.  You’ve been in the System a long time, and you have a great deal of high regard.  So again, welcome and congratulations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions for Brian.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply expresses gratitude and a request for questions for Brian. President Plosser's involvement is not indicated to be related to any disagreement.


Passage number 7.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I’d like to get more clarification on your discussion of the breakevens and probabilities of deflation.  A number of things are going on here, clearly.  There are the effects of declining projections of real growth, perhaps, and a lot of evidence of flight to quality from Europe into safe Treasury securities, all of which potentially confuse the signals on the breakevens here and how we think about them.  So can you talk more about that—what you really believe these changes in the breakevens might be signaling and how we can decompose that, if at all.  And I would ask another question about the probabilities of deflation that have arisen from the TIPS.  If I go to, for example, our SPF surveys, those probabilities really haven’t changed that much.  They’re still much closer to 10 percent than to the 20 percent in the TIPS, which suggests to me there’s some differential here.  I’d like to hear you talk more about those effects and the interpretations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a request for clarification and further discussion.


Passage number 8.
 MR. SACK.  Certainly.  I think those are very good points.  As always, we want to look at these market indicators of inflation expectations and inflation risks as having some noise, and we want to look at the collective evidence on inflation expectations, clearly.  And in the current circumstances, there are some factors that could be contributing to the downward movement in the breakeven inflation rates.  You mentioned the flight to quality as one possibility, which I think is important, and another one that’s been discussed is the expectations of the maturity extension program.  If it would be concentrated in nominal securities, the perception is that it could also be contributing to the downward movement.  Having said that, it’s moving down pretty aggressively.  It’s moving down at a time when markets in general are becoming more concerned about growth.  I think to some extent, this likely does reflect some shift in the fundamental perspectives about inflation risks.  And lastly, I’ll just comment that you’re correct that the survey evidence generally suggests a more stable outlook for inflation expectations and inflation risks, but we’ve generally found that the surveys often demonstrate more stability than we think perhaps represents the true views on risks.  So maybe we want to look at the evidence as somewhere in between the surveys and the market-based measures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging and agreeing with the points made by the other person, while providing additional information and perspective.


Passage number 9.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I ask a follow-up question, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply asking for permission to ask a follow-up question. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 10.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement "Okay. Vice Chairman" does not indicate any opposing or conflicting views. It is simply an acknowledgement or response to a previous statement or action.


Passage number 11.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  How about if we look at the TIPS market itself.  You have TIPS yields in terms of the probability of deflation within a TIP that’s already booked a bunch of inflation versus a newer one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is presenting a question about looking at the TIPS market and comparing yields in terms of deflation and inflation. There is no contention or disagreement evident in the text.


Passage number 12.
 MR. SACK.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: In the given passage, there is no indication of disagreement or contention. The statement "Mr. Sack" is a simple acknowledgement or affirmation, without any contradictory or conflicting information.


Passage number 13.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What does that show.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is asking for an explanation or interpretation of something.


Passage number 14.
 MR. SACK.  Well, that’s what the measure in the bottom right is.  That’s a very good point.  It wouldn’t be distorted by these differences.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sack acknowledges and agrees with the point made by the other party.


Passage number 15.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That shouldn’t be distorted by liquidity and things of that sort.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is suggesting that a certain aspect shouldn't be influenced or distorted by liquidity or similar factors.


Passage number 16.
 MR. SACK.  That’s right.  I think for the measure in the bottom right, distortion to the implied deflation is less of a concern.  Probably for the five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate, some of the considerations you raised are relevant, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the previous statement and acknowledges that some of the considerations raised by the other person are relevant.


Passage number 17.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The passage simply expresses gratitude without any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 18.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage doesn't provide any context or information about President Lacker, so it is impossible to determine if there is any contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 19.
 MR. LACKER.  Excuse me.  Could you explain how this is taken out of the TIPS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It's a simple request for clarification.


Passage number 20.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, you have some TIPS securities that have been outstanding for a while, and there’s a bunch of inflation that’s accrued, and so if you get deflation from here, that still gets embedded in the price—you give back that inflation that you’ve achieved because it’s been outstanding for a while.  But if a new TIP has just been issued, you have deflation from here; you don’t have to give that back.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is discussing the difference between older TIPS securities and newly issued ones in terms of inflation and deflation.


Passage number 21.
 MR. LACKER.  I’ve got you.  It’s a different basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "I've got you" suggests understanding or agreement between the speakers.


Passage number 22.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without access to the passage, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 23.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without further context. The passage is incomplete, containing only the name "President Fisher."


Passage number 24.
 MR. FISHER.  This is just a comment, Mr. Chairman, but you gave a speech in October 2003, which was titled “Monetary Policy and the Stock Market:  Some Empirical Results,” and you spoke of how—and I loved the particular word that you used because it had such emotion to it—the market “quivers” as they await the FOMC’s decision.  And you concluded, obviously, that FOMC decisions can move markets.  I’m interested, in listening to Brian today and the past many, many reports we’ve had—really, beginning with your third slide, you talked about the market’s anticipation of our lengthening of duration.  So we’ve moved from the meeting itself to expectations of what we’d accomplish at the meeting, which are oddly correlated with what we’re actually contemplating.  And we might be tempted to conclude that these quivers, or whatever you might call them, would then lead to tremors if we don’t act according to what the market’s expecting. I guess the question I have is, is there a way we can better understand this.  There’s an uncanny resemblance, as I said earlier, to what we’re actually discussing and what markets are thinking about, and then we are tempted, perhaps, to live in fear that if we don’t deliver according to market expectations, we’ll have a very harsh reaction.  In other words, markets are anticipating quivering before we act rather than upon our action, as you articulated so well in 2003.  I don’t think things have changed that much since 2003.  There’s more information, the net is much more thorough, we have more market operators, et cetera, but something is amiss here.  And I wonder if we could at least think about that.  Maybe the Board staff or a group of us could form a committee to get a better feeling for how this is happening, what it means, and whether it is affecting the way we make decisions.  Because I’m concerned about that—and this isn’t a criticism of you, you’re just reporting what you’re finding in the marketplace—from slide 3 onward to the very last one.  That’s one point.  The second point—and it’s most un-central-bank-like, it’s un-Bagehot-like—is that they’re expecting us to move into assets that everybody else is demanding right now—until you got to your mortgage-backed security slide.  Those are just observations, but I’m very concerned that we might be influenced by market expectations.  I’m not sure how those market expectations are built, but things have progressed a little bit, Mr. Chairman, since that speech in October 2003, which I thought, for the record, was a very good speech.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 25.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks.  First of all, I think we all agree that the FOMC makes policy based on our economic outlook, and the markets have to adapt to that.  There’s a bit of an observational equivalence, though, between markets in some sense forcing policy actions and markets simply receiving good communication.  We have become more transparent in the past eight years or so.  Our minutes, for example, have been a big source of information.  I recall very well the debates we had about moving the minutes, which used to be after the subsequent meeting, into the intermeeting period.  Of course, the minutes describe the options and the discussion, and so I think that would be one mechanism.  I take your point, and would emphasize that as conditions warrant, we need to act appropriately, but I do think part of it, at least, is coming from us guiding the markets in various ways in terms of what to anticipate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the idea that the FOMC makes policy based on the economic outlook and that the markets have to adapt to that. They also mention becoming more transparent and providing information through minutes. They agree with the idea that the FOMC guides the markets in terms of what to anticipate.


Passage number 26.
 MR. FISHER.  Or transparency.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage mentions Mr. Fisher and the topic of transparency, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement in the given text.


Passage number 27.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And to the extent that that’s true, it’s a sign of success that we are transparent and communicating effectively.  Other questions.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states that being transparent and communicating effectively is a sign of success. It does not present any disagreement or controversy.


Passage number 28.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If I could amplify on your remarks—because I used to do this—I would comment that basically the people in the market are trying to think along with the Fed.  They’re trying to think, “Well, if I were in their shoes, what would I do.”  And I believe this has been the case for many years.  It’s just a little bit more vivid now because we’re engaged in using policy instruments that we haven’t used historically, but believe me, for the past 20 years, people have been thinking very hard about, “Is the Fed going to move at this meeting.  If they’re going to move, how much are they going to move.”  And that’s all been priced in.  I completely accept your point that at the end of the day, we have to do what is appropriate, not just because the market has priced it in.  But regarding the convergence of the marketplace and our actions, I don’t think it’s surprising in the sense that the market is observing us and learning from us and solving for what our reaction function is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is elaborating on someone else's remarks and expressing agreement with them. They are explaining that people in the market try to anticipate and understand the actions of the Federal Reserve, and that this has been the case for many years. The speaker also acknowledges that while market expectations are considered, the Federal Reserve still needs to make decisions based on what is appropriate.


Passage number 29.
 MR. FISHER.  Again, because both of us used to do this for a living, I think you’re right.  I think what the Chairman said is most important.  We let what is in the best interest of the real economy guide us, not what the markets expect us to do at any one meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is agreeing with the Chairman's statement and expressing their support for prioritizing the best interest of the real economy over market expectations.


Passage number 30.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 31.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I just have a quick factual question, which is, how much usage of the ECB swap lines has there been so far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question being asked.


Passage number 32.
 MR. SACK.  Very little.  There was just over $500 million in last week’s operation from two institutions.  It’s possible that with the 84-day operation, there will be more usage.  The pricing of obtaining dollar funding for three months is actually very close to the price of the swap line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states the amount of money involved in the operation and the pricing of obtaining dollar funding for three months. There is no mention of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 33.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Oh, I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 34.
 MR. SACK.  Whereas the current operations are 7-day operations, most firms, even under strained market conditions, can get funding in the markets much cheaper than the pricing of the swap lines.  So we will see in mid-October if usage picks up with these new operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any clear contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact and speculates about potential outcomes.


Passage number 35.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  That was very helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses gratitude for the assistance they received.


Passage number 36.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in it.


Passage number 37.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The difference between the maturity extension program and an equivalent-sized quantitative easing is that with the quantitative easing, we issue more reserves, and with the maturity extension program, we force the private sector to absorb, instead of reserves, more two-year securities.  With our policy guidance, two-year securities are trading roughly under 20 basis points, and so they seem like virtually perfect substitutes for reserves.  I’d be interested in the Desk’s insight into the differences between those two.  How much different would it be for us to force them to hold more two-year securities than it would for us to force the market to hold more reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply looking for more information and insight into the differences between two policy options.


Passage number 38.
 MR. SACK.  In general, I think those are substitutes, and the staff would say that there won’t be much of a difference in the effect on markets in terms of whether reserves are issued or two-year and other short-term Treasuries are sold.  There are some differences, of course, though.  The reserves have to reside in the banking system, and the Treasuries, instead, can be more broadly held.  So to the extent that leverage ratios matter or other bank-specific behavior matters, you do have a difference there.  But I think we would agree with the broad sense of your question.  We see the mechanisms of maturity extension or asset purchase programs as being similar, with the effect coming more from the assets that are purchased than from the way they’re sterilized or whether they create reserves or two-year Treasuries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the broad sense of the question and only points out some minor differences between reserves and short-term Treasuries.


Passage number 39.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s a nice test of the two different theories of balance sheet expansion.  Is it reserves or is it the asset side.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply presenting two different theories of balance sheet expansion without taking a position on which theory is correct.


Passage number 40.
 MS. RASKIN.  Yes.  Just a question, Brian, regarding the New York policy survey.  In terms of the probabilities of additional policy actions, we are seeing a relatively high probability on providing SOMA guidance, and I was wondering if you could talk about your sense of what the participants in this survey are looking for.  I think you said that they seem to be looking for explicit guidance on the path of the balance sheet, but of course, we’ve put out principles regarding how we would conduct an exit strategy.  So my question is whether you can shed any light on what else they seem to be looking for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 41.
 MR. SACK.  Some respondents just think it’s a simple and logical step to put more of that guidance into the FOMC statement.  The FOMC statement right now obviously has very strong guidance on one policy instrument and virtually none on the other, if you consider the other to be the balance sheet.  Having said that, I completely agree that with the exit strategy that the minutes have laid out, the guidance on the short rate is, in effect, providing them with guidance on the balance sheet.  So that may limit the effectiveness of this step, but I think respondents to the survey just see it as a logical step and maybe one that could have at least some beneficial effect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is a logical step to put more guidance into the FOMC statement and agrees with the idea, although they also acknowledge that it may have limited effectiveness.


Passage number 42.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Brian.  [No response]  All right.  We need to vote to ratify domestic open market operations since the last meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information and instruction, rather than presenting any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 43.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the phrase "So moved."


Passage number 44.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Okay.  The next item is a discussion of alternative policy tools.  We’ll start with a staff presentation.  Our presenters are Julie Remache, Seth Carpenter, and Dave Reifschneider.  Who’s going to go first.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information that suggests contention or disagreement. It is simply providing a list of speakers for a discussion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 45.
 MS. REMACHE.2  I am.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In a memo provided to the Committee ahead of this meeting, the staff presented three options for managing the SOMA portfolio in order to provide additional monetary policy accommodation:  a reinvestment maturity extension program, a SOMA portfolio maturity extension program included in alternative B in Book B of the Tealbook, and a long-maturity large-scale asset purchase program included in alternative A. The intention of each of these options is to remove duration risk from the holdings of private investors, thereby putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and making broader financial conditions more supportive of economic growth.  However, the amount of duration risk removed and the manner through which that occurs differ across the three options.  The two maturity extension options maintain the current size of the portfolio while shifting its composition toward longer-term Treasury holdings, while the long-maturity LSAP option expands the size of the portfolio while shifting its composition.  2 The materials used by Ms. Remache, Mr. Carpenter, and Mr. Reifschneider are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). Under the reinvestment maturity extension program, the reinvestment of principal payments from agency securities is shifted into Treasury securities with greater than six years to maturity.  This policy is assumed to remain in effect until redemptions begin.  As can be seen in your first exhibit, in the top-left chart by the dark blue line, this policy maintains the portfolio at its current level and leads to only a modest shift in the path of the SOMA once exit commences.  The average duration of the portfolio, shown by the dark blue line in the chart to the right, moves up to five years by late 2012, about a half-year longer than in the baseline scenario. The maturity extension program (MEP) of alternative B would involve $400 billion of long-term Treasury security purchases and a similar amount of short-term Treasury security sales, in addition to lengthening the maturity of reinvestments of agency securities.  Under this alternative, the size of the SOMA would again stay steady.  However, as can be seen in the top-left chart by the light blue line, it implies a more distinct departure from the baseline over time.  The average duration of the portfolio would increase markedly, reaching nearly 6½ years, as shown in the top-right panel.  Because of the longer average maturity, the portfolio would not run off as quickly during the exit period.  Indeed, it would be as much as $450 billion higher than in the baseline and would take 15 months longer to return to steady state. The long-maturity LSAP of alternative A would add $1 trillion in Treasury securities to the balance sheet, in addition to lengthening the maturity of reinvestments of agency securities.  The red line in the top-left chart shows the increase in the SOMA.  The average duration of the portfolio moves up, but by much less than under the MEP.  Once exit commences, the SOMA runs off more quickly; however, given the higher starting level of the portfolio, it reaches its steady-state size at about the same time. The middle-left chart shows the path of the SOMA in 10-year equivalents—a measure of the dollar value of duration risk.  The chart shows that both the MEP and the LSAP add a considerable amount of additional duration risk to the SOMA portfolio, with the MEP operating more by shifting the average duration of the SOMA and the LSAP operating more by increasing the size of the SOMA.  By contrast, the reinvestment option by itself adds only modestly to SOMA duration risk. As shown to the right, the MEP and LSAP have similar effects, reducing the 10-year term premium by roughly 20 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively.  These figures are somewhat larger than the estimated 15 basis point effect of the LSAP that ended in June.  FRB/US simulations suggest that either of these programs would lower the unemployment rate about ¼ to ½ percentage point and boost core PCE inflation about ¼ percentage point.  Of course, as Brian noted, market participants place relatively high odds on a maturity extension program, and hence a sizable portion of the interest rate effect may already have been realized.  The reinvestment option has considerably more modest effects on rates and therefore on the economy. The broad contour of Federal Reserve income over the projection period is similar under the MEP and LSAP alternatives, although there are some important differences in its trajectory and sensitivity to interest rate movements.  The bottom-left panel shows our projections for remittances to the Treasury under each scenario.  Relative to the baseline, both the MEP and LSAP would result in an increase in remittances to the Treasury through 2014, driven by higher interest income on Treasury holdings.  Thereafter, income would be lower as a result of higher interest expense.  In the longer run, income under these alternatives remains depressed because of the higher proportion of securities acquired during the current low yield environment.  Under all scenarios, remittances remain positive and trough at levels close to those prevailing before the crisis. The bottom-right panel examines the results under an adverse rate scenario in which the FOMC tightens earlier and long-term interest rates run as much as 175 basis points higher than the baseline.  In the LSAP scenario, which is the most adverse, remittances to the Treasury would cease for a period of four years, resulting in a deferred credit asset on the balance sheet peaking at about $50 billion in 2016. Before closing, I should highlight two additional points about the balance sheet options presented.  First, under the MEP or LSAP, the SOMA would own approximately 40 percent of all Treasury securities with greater than six years to maturity, with many securities at our 70 percent limit.  The Federal Reserve has never held such a high proportion of long-term securities, and we think that holdings of this proportion have some risk to cause a deterioration in market functioning. Finally, it is worth repeating that all of the estimates presented here are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, particularly those around the market and economic effects.  In particular, we presented results based on a portfolio balance model, which implies that it is only the overall quantity of interest rate risk that matters in determining the market effect.  If instead there is more market segmentation across maturity points, then there would be more difference between the LSAP and MEP programs, as we also purchase short-term securities in the LSAP program.  I’ll now turn it over to Seth to discuss IOER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage presents three different options for managing the SOMA portfolio, each with different implications for duration risk and impact on interest rates and the economy. The passage explains that the reinvestment maturity extension program has a more modest effect on duration risk and interest rates, while the SOMA portfolio maturity extension program and the long-maturity LSAP option have more significant effects on duration risk and interest rates. This suggests that there is disagreement or contention among the options presented.


Passage number 46.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Thank you.  The Committee also received a memo about the implications of lowering the interest rate paid on excess reserves (what we refer to as the IOER rate) to zero or to some positive value, such as 10 basis points.  I should note that I’m referring to what’s labeled “Exhibit 2.”  It’s a set of bullet points to help you follow along.  Lowering the IOER rate would likely push down money market rates and, by lowering the expected future short-term rate, should also put some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.  The overall effect would likely be quite modest, however, because money market rates are already near zero, and there are some impediments to some of these interest rates falling below zero.  For example, it is unlikely that the federal funds rate would ever trade at negative rates; however, other instruments, such as Eurodollars, GC repo, and Treasury bills, have traded at negative rates in the past and could do so in the future. Lowering the IOER rate should, all else being equal, provide banks with an additional incentive to lend, because any individual bank could fund additional lending by running down its reserves and leaving the overall size of its balance sheet unchanged.  However, surveys over the past couple of years suggest that banks see a paucity of qualified borrowers, so a modest reduction in their opportunity cost of lending may have only modest effects on their overall quantity of lending. Lowering the IOER rate might also mitigate the reputational risk to the Federal Reserve from the appearance of paying a subsidy to banks.  That risk may be heightened because the rise in reserve balances that came from the LSAP program initiated in November 2010 has been concentrated at branches and agencies of foreign banks and because, since the spring, with the adjustment in the FDIC’s insurance assessment, market rates have fallen further below the IOER rate.  Reducing the IOER rate to zero would clearly eliminate any possible subsidy.  Reducing the IOER rate to 10 basis points would at least result in the Federal Reserve paying interest to banks at a rate that is somewhat more in line with other safe, short-term assets. Of course, reducing the IOER rate, particularly to zero, has potential costs, including disruptions to money markets and the intermediation of credit.  If short-term interest rates decline further, money market funds could come under additional pressure, and the industry would likely contract further.  The large volumes of funds intermediated though money market funds might have to be redirected, with the ultimate investors potentially switching to other assets and the ultimate borrowers finding alternative sources of funding.  If such shifts were abrupt, and borrowers could not find ready alternative sources of funding, disruptions to market functioning could ensue. There could be, in particular, implications for the federal funds market as well.  The federal funds market consists of banks borrowing from institutions that cannot earn interest on reserves, primarily the Federal Home Loan Banks, in order to arbitrage the IOER rate.  If the IOER rate were cut, especially to zero, banks would lose the incentive for this trade.  The federal funds market would likely contract significantly, and the effective rate could become erratic, perhaps becoming less well correlated with other market rates and even possibly rising outside of the target range. Investors might react to lower money market rates by leaving large deposits with their banks.  Given balance sheet pressures, other banks might follow the lead of Bank of New York Mellon and begin imposing explicit negative interest rates on deposits.  If such a pattern became widespread, policymakers might be concerned about creating hardships for households and other savers and, as a result, run a different reputational risk. Finally, the U.S. Treasury debt auctions cannot accept negative bids.  If Treasury bills were persistently trading at negative rates, bidding at auctions could be distorted, with a likely stop-out rate at 0 percent, and the primary dealers would instantly realize a risk-free profit from the Treasury.  That concludes my remarks.  I turn it over to Dave.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is providing information and discussing potential implications of lowering the interest rate paid on excess reserves.


Passage number 47.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Thanks.  Turning to your third exhibit, one of the memos we distributed to you last week explored a variety of issues related to forward guidance.  The top panel considers one of those issues:  the market’s reaction to the additional guidance you provided in the August statement—specifically, the indication that “the Committee currently anticipates that economic conditions . . . are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.”  As noted in the first bullet, this guidance reduced the perceived odds that policy would begin tightening before mid-2013, as evidenced by a downward revision to the expected path of the funds rate implied by futures; uncertainty about the future path of the funds rate also fell.  Together, these developments led to a moderate decline in longer-term Treasury yields.  In addition, as Brian noted earlier, market commentary since the August meeting suggests that investors understand that the Committee’s forward guidance is conditional, and that the timing of the onset of tightening is not tied to a specific date but will depend on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  That said, investors are unclear about the specific conditions that would warrant tightening.  In this regard, the latest Desk survey suggests market participants anticipate that the unemployment rate will be close to 8 percent and the inflation rate around 2 percent when you first begin to tighten—conditions that may or may not be consistent with your policy intentions. This market uncertainty about future policy suggests that you may wish to consider ways to clarify your forward guidance further, such as providing quantitative information about the conditions that would influence the decision as to when to begin tightening.  As noted in the middle panel, such clarification could better align market expectations for monetary policy with the FOMC’s intentions and reduce uncertainty about future policy actions.  If so, that guidance could be stimulative to the degree that the public currently underestimates your willingness to pursue accommodative monetary policy over the medium term.  Beyond that, such guidance could make investors’ responses to incoming data on the economy, and thus the accompanying movements in longer-term interest rates and other asset prices, more consistent with the Committee’s actual reaction function.   One way of providing more specificity about the factors influencing the Committee’s actions might be to announce specific unemployment and inflation “threshold” conditions for keeping monetary policy exceptionally accommodative.  Under this approach, the Committee could indicate its intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero at least as long as unemployment was above, say, a 7 percent threshold and the medium-term outlook for headline inflation remained below a 2½ percent threshold.  As the memo discusses, the use of threshold conditions raises a number of issues, one of them being the potential for confusion about the Committee’s long-run objectives.  To avoid such confusion, as well as to help more firmly anchor long-run inflation expectations, the Committee might also wish to release quantitative information about both its long-run inflation goal and its projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will converge over time. In addition to considering these communication issues, the memo also explored the potential benefits and costs of additional forward guidance using simulations of the FRB/US model; the bottom panel summarizes the results from this exercise.  Our analysis suggests that the Committee could potentially provide modest near-term stimulus if it committed to keeping the funds rate near zero as long as specified thresholds for unemployment and inflation were not breached.  In the simulations, the effectiveness of such guidance rests on two conditions.  First, the announced policy must be credible, in that the public must be confident that future FOMCs will follow through on that guidance.  Second, the guidance must indicate an appreciably later liftoff than currently expected by the public.  The simulation results suggest the Committee probably should not expect much additional stimulus from this strategy unless it acts fairly aggressively by, for example, announcing its intention to keep the federal funds rate very low as long as unemployment is above, say, 6½ percent and the medium-term outlook for inflation is below 2½ percent. In the simulations, forward guidance of this sort provides only modest stimulus because it alters expectations only for the likely date that policy firming will begin and not for the average stance of policy thereafter.  But the announcement of thresholds might in fact change longer-run expectations more dramatically, particularly if supplemented with guidance about the pace at which the federal funds rate will be normalized after liftoff.  If credible, such longer-term guidance could potentially yield more pronounced expectationally driven changes in financial conditions and other factors, and thus appreciably more stimulus.  Additional model simulations reported in the memo suggest that if the Committee could convince the public of its intention to pursue policies later in the decade that are only somewhat more gradualist than the public would otherwise expect, it could bring about a noticeably faster decline in unemployment than in the baseline forecast, accompanied by inflation running modestly above 2 percent for a time.  Such an outcome would be similar to the optimal policy simulation results reported in the Tealbook. The memo also considered the robustness of this sort of forward guidance to unexpected economic developments.  This analysis suggested that, while unconditional commitments to keep the federal funds rate near zero until some specified date are highly problematic, conditional forward guidance in the form of announced thresholds for unemployment and inflation appears to do reasonably well in a wide range of circumstances, including ones where policymakers significantly overestimate the amount of slack in the economy. The final page of your handout reproduces the questions that were distributed to the Committee last week.  During the go-round this morning, you may want to address these questions in the context of your remarks.  Thank you; this concludes our presentation.  We would be happy to take your questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 48.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much for a concise presentation of a much more detailed set of memos, which were very helpful, and I thank you for that as well.  Before we go into a go-round, let’s have a question period.  Are there any questions for the staff.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply expressing gratitude and asking for questions.


Passage number 49.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes, thank you very much for a very complete set of memos.  I do have a question on the interest on excess reserves memo—probably not surprising.  After rereading your memo again this morning, I looked at the H.8 for foreign-related institutions in the United States, and the cash assets, which include reserves, were $943 billion; Treasury securities, were roughly $100 billion.  I can’t from that look at how much excess reserves are actually being held.  Do you have the percent of excess reserves actually being held at branches and agencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 50.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I don’t have that on me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they do not have something on them without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 51.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Ballpark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply mentioning the subject of discussion, which is "ballpark" or the topic of conversation.


Passage number 52.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes, it’s getting up close to just under half of the total quantity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of fact about the quantity.


Passage number 53.
 MR. ROSENGREN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The above passage does not contain any statement or information that would indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 54.
  Half of the excess reserves of the foreign branches— MR. CARPENTER.  Most of the roughly $600 billion increase from the second LSAPs, in dollar terms, went to the foreign branches and agencies, in an adding-up sense.  So it’s a good portion of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Carpenter, is expressing disagreement with the idea that only half of the excess reserves of the foreign branches went to them. He argues that most of the increase from the second LSAPs went to foreign branches and agencies.


Passage number 55.
 MR. ENGLISH.  On September 7, the numbers that I have show about $800 billion at the foreign DIs and about $700 billion at domestic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating the numbers for foreign and domestic DIs without any conflicting information or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 56.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a second part to that question.  There’s been a big change in how foreign branches have been used in the United States.  A year ago in August, they were supplying $323 billion over to Europe or over to their parents, which is more typical.  They tend to raise funds in the United States, and send it over to their parent.  More recently, though, that’s reversed, and it was a $500 billion switch between last year and this year.  So they’re now receiving on that September 7 date $238 billion from the parent.  That’s a very big swing.  As I was trying to understand why that swing would occur—and President Lacker’s observation is relevant—I noted that three-month T-bills are paying 1 basis point; six-month T-bills, 2 basis points; and a two-year Treasury is paying 16 basis points, very close to the 20 basis points that he mentioned.  If, for example, a French bank is holding two-year Treasury securities at 20 basis points in order to be able to meet potential liquidity needs but has an option with a branch to hold reserves at 25 basis points in the United States, then it seems as though the strategy would be to sell the two-year Treasury security and put the funds in a branch getting 25 basis points.  By doing so, they get a higher return and reduce the duration risk of their portfolio, and that seems to be reducing the demand for medium-term Treasury securities because they’re choosing to hold overnight reserves paying a higher return with lower duration risk rather than holding medium-term Treasury securities.  To what extent is our holding the reserve rate so high having an impact that is counter to what we’re trying to do with medium-term Treasury securities.  Is it discouraging demand for medium-term Treasury securities, particularly by foreign banking organizations.  Do you have any observations on whether you’re seeing that kind of trend actually occurring.  And to what degree do you think that’s important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information and asking for observations and opinions.


Passage number 57.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I guess I would offer the following.  The transmission channel that you described about the switch in the funding position of the branches relative to their headquarters overseas is consistent with the anecdotal reports that we are hearing.  And you can think about the reasons for this working independently and then reinforcing each other, with reserves being an attractive asset, paying more than other perfectly safe things, and the foreign supervisors wanting there to be more dollar-denominated liquidity on their books for liquidity reasons.  We’re definitely hearing that story.  I think there are a couple of different ways it could matter in terms of the effect on other market rates and intermediate-term market rates.  The story that you told where there is reduced demand for two-year Treasuries and increased demand for reserves would tend to push up the two-year rate closer to the IOER rate.  But that’s in some sense just the more general point that the rate paid on reserves affects short-term rates and things that are close substitutes.  To the extent that it’s higher than it might otherwise be, if 25 basis points is higher than zero, then presumably if the IOER rate fell to zero, the two-year rate would also come down at least to some degree with it.  Does that answer the question you were asking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering his thoughts and observations on the topic being discussed.


Passage number 58.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  That sounds consistent with the kind of story I was telling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker affirms that the mentioned statement aligns with their own story or narrative.


Passage number 59.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I think your story is consistent with what we’ve been hearing and the data we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Carpenter is simply expressing agreement with the story and data presented.


Passage number 60.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think that’s right.  Just one other thought.  I’m not sure that the story you were telling depends on it being a foreign banking organization.  The same story would be true for a domestic organization in terms of its decision between holding Treasuries and holding reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. Mr. English is simply offering a different perspective or alternative viewpoint.


Passage number 61.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  You might argue, though, that the optics of paying a very high return on an overnight fund to a foreign banking organization are a little bit different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a viewpoint or hypothetical argument.


Passage number 62.
 MR. ENGLISH.  On the optics, I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 63.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  The optics would show, I think, paying a very substantial premium that’s higher than what they could get on a two-year.  I don’t know if people are going to be as worried about it for a domestic entity, but if it was widely understood that it was for a foreign banking organization, particularly because this is an important tool for us when we are exiting, you do wonder whether it undermines our willingness to be able to use this tool in the future if people start being concerned about what its effect is on potentially subsidizing foreign organizations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 64.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Just one other thought.  If you literally look at holdings of Treasury securities and straight agency debt at the foreign banks, they’ve actually been growing over the past year or so, right through August.  I think that’s consistent with what Seth said.  Some of these institutions are being urged by their supervisors to beef up their U.S. dollar liquidity, and so they may be holding both more reserves and more Treasury securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement and supports it with evidence.


Passage number 65.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, you had a two-handed intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage mentions President Fisher having a two-handed intervention, but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 66.
 MR. FISHER.  Eric’s point is very good, and I think the point about domestic banks is very good.  But I thought that under Regulation D, we couldn’t pay interest rates on bank balances that exceeded market rates.  Is that true or false.  What is the law, and what do the regulations require.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.
In the passage, there is contention or disagreement because Mr. Fisher is questioning whether the statement made by Eric about paying interest rates on bank balances exceeding market rates is true or false. He is seeking clarification about the law and regulations.


Passage number 67.
 MR. CARPENTER.  The statutory requirement is that the rate paid on reserves can’t exceed the general level of short-term interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents the statutory requirement without any conflicting viewpoints or opinions.


Passage number 68.
   MR. FISHER.  Short-term interest rates are defined as.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the definition of short-term interest rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 69.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Not defined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 70.
 MR. FISHER.  But Eric just laid out all the way to two years.  It must be defined somewhere.  Did we not codify this in Regulation D—was it section 204.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is simply seeking clarification and asking whether something was codified in Regulation D.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 71.
 MR. CARPENTER.  The statutory requirement is pretty vague.  In terms of putting things into practice, it ends up being a little bit more judgment.  You could look at several other market rates, and so you’d have to define the universe of short-term interest rates.  You’d have to define what “general level” means.  So if you were to look at just federal funds, the effective federal funds rate is 6, 7 basis points, but every day there’s a distribution of trades, and some of those trades are outside of the 0 to 25 basis points target range.  As a result, there are, every day, trades in short-term money markets that are above 25 basis points.  In that sense, it’s not obvious, at least to me, that paying 25 basis points is at odds with the vague definition of the law.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. 

Explanation: The speaker is expressing uncertainty and disagreement with the idea that paying 25 basis points is in line with the vague definition of the law. They argue that the vagueness of the statutory requirement makes it difficult to determine what the "general level" of short-term interest rates should be and what range should be considered. They point out that trades in short-term money markets often exceed the 25 basis points target range, suggesting that the 25 basis points payment may not align with the intent of the law.


Passage number 72.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "Thank you" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a polite response expressing gratitude.


Passage number 73.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given phrase, "President Kocherlakota," does not provide any information that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply states the position and name of an individual.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 74.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a question and a comment.  The question was about the observation that if we executed either the MEP or the LSAP, we’d be holding 40 percent of the Treasuries with maturity over six years.  To me, that suggests that these operations might not be all that scalable.  So in the sense that if we faced further deterioration in the economy and we wanted to provide more accommodation at that stage, it would be difficult for us to think about working through augmenting these programs.  Is that a fair conclusion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is expressing his skepticism about the scalability of the MEP or LSAP operations and suggests that it would be difficult to provide more accommodation in the future if needed.


Passage number 75.
 MS. REMACHE.  I think that would be fair to say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 76.
 MR. SACK.  They’re not scalable in terms of purchasing in this region.  They’re also not scalable in the ability to sell securities because obviously we just have a fixed quantity at the short end of the yield curve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Sack about the scalability issues related to purchasing and selling securities in a specific region.


Passage number 77.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  And then the comment is about how, if we were to lower the IOER, banks could begin imposing explicit negative deposit rates.  This is reminiscent of conversations I’ve had with people—they typically tend to be older people—who are complaining about the low interest rates they’re earning on their savings.  The comment that I’m tempted to make, but which I have not made yet in public, is that this is actually a feature, not a bug.  [Laughter]  We’re trying to get them to consume, as opposed to saving, to spend money on their grandkids and lend to that promising young entrepreneur down the street, as opposed to holding money, and so this actually would be a sign of the program working.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging a comment and sharing their own perspective on the matter.


Passage number 78.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Right.  What we tried to characterize in the memo, and I alluded to it in the briefing, was that this would be in some sense a reputational risk.  From an economic perspective, banks have, since time immemorial, imposed fees on checking accounts, giving at least effective or implicit negative rates.  But writing down a negative interest rate as their deposit rate is psychologically different for people.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 79.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No, that’s fair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply acknowledges the fairness of a proposition without expressing any opposing views or contrasting opinions.


Passage number 80.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for the staff.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply lists the topic of "other questions for the staff" and mentions President Bullard without indicating any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 81.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two comments on exhibit 3, “Forward Guidance.”  I think one aspect of these simulations is that the announcement inside the model to keep rates low for longer is assumed to be a credible announcement, as you note here, and I’m not sure that that’s really the right way to think about this.  You’re talking about a central bank that has never done this in the past and an unprecedented situation.  You make an announcement far out into the future—say, for 2015—and my baseline would be that the market’s not initially going to believe that you’re going to be able to carry through on that commitment far out into the future.  That is, when you actually get to 2015, you’ll be tempted to revert to normal Committee behavior as it has evolved over many years.  And so my sense is that because of this assumption, these effects are probably overstated in the simulations, and that you should allow the guys in the model to gradually learn that the Committee is actually going to come around and actually carry through on this, even if the data may come in somewhat differently than anticipated at the time of the announcement. The other area—obviously I’ve been an advocate of this—was that I was disappointed to see that simulations like this don’t take into account the possibility that you would just get stuck at a zero nominal interest rate equilibrium and you’d end up at zero nominal interest rates for a very long period of time.  Japan has been at zero for about 15 years.  I think you have to have that also in the simulation so that you can say with some confidence, “You take on this action, and you’ll be able to move off zero at some point in the future,” instead of eliciting expectations that are going to actually keep you at zero for a very long period of time.  Those are two aspects of the simulations I was disappointed with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard disagrees with the assumption made in the simulations regarding the credibility of the central bank's announcement to keep rates low for longer. He believes that the market would not initially believe the commitment and that the effects of the announcement are overstated. He also disagrees with the simulations not taking into account the possibility of being stuck at a zero nominal interest rate equilibrium for a long period of time.


Passage number 82.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 83.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  One more observation on interest on excess reserves.  I did spend some time talking to asset managers over the past month, and on the retail side, a company like Fidelity already gives you an option to sweep into an FDIC-insured account.  So for the retail, you already have an option outside of the government or the prime money market fund.  At the wholesale level, the way they described it to me is it’s like selling turkeys at Thanksgiving—you sell turkeys under cost, but you care about the fact that the entire shopping cart is full—and so they think of an account as a suite of assets that people are actually doing.  The government securities money market fund pays 1 basis point at Fidelity and roughly that at almost all the others, but they’re interested in the suite of assets that the people put in.  They need a place to park the funds.  Their indication to me was that it wouldn’t change their behavior very much.  They aren’t going to lower the rate below zero, but they do view it as a loss leader for the other services.  So I’m not sure it’s going to be quite as disruptive as the memo indicated—at least the perspective from the asset managers I talked to. And just an observation on the negative interest rate.  BONY did announce its negative interest rate.  Shortly after that, the stock price dropped, the CEO left the company, customers complained, and no other custody bank chose to follow suit.  I would say that I’ve talked to two custody banks, and they’re gleeful at the negative interest rate.  So I’m not sure that is actually a trendsetter for other organizations.  Just an observation that I’m not as worried about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not have any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply sharing their observations and perspectives on interest rates and the behavior of asset managers and custody banks.


Passage number 84.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes.  On the first point about the money fund, I think we agree with you entirely, and I should point out that there is a distribution across the staff as to how big the costs are.  I think the ability of a sponsor to subsidize a fund that’s operating at a loss then means either that some of the disruptions won’t happen or that the disruptions might happen more slowly through time, allowing this greater intermediation that may ultimately have to take place going from one steady state to another.  It could happen more gradually—again, mitigating the potential disruptions.  So the scenario you paint seems entirely plausible.  We just can’t be certain that that’s going to be the case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Carpenter states that he agrees with the speaker's point about the money fund and acknowledges that there is a distribution of costs among the staff. He then goes on to explain how a sponsor subsidizing a fund operating at a loss could potentially mitigate disruptions and allow for a more gradual transition to a different steady state. Overall, Mr. Carpenter's response indicates agreement and understanding of the speaker's perspective.


Passage number 85.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no mention of any disagreement or contention in the passage. It simply states the name "President Pianalto" without providing any additional context or information.


Passage number 86.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Actually, I think President Rosengren just answered my question.  Because this idea that we might lower the interest rate on excess reserves has been in the public for some time now, I was going to ask whether the Desk or the Board staff had conversations with money market fund managers about how they viewed the effect.  And President Rosengren’s response about the managers he has talked to answers it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that President Rosengren's response has answered a question that Ms. Pianalto had.


Passage number 87.
 MR. CARPENTER.  I think from the money fund management perspective, the view that President Rosengren brings up is one that we’ve heard a lot here at the Board.  Brian, I don’t know whether you want to characterize the Desk’s discussions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that the view expressed by President Rosengren is one that they have heard a lot at the Board.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 88.
 MR. SACK.  We did not do an extensive reach-out recently on this issue, but we always have conversations with money funds.  This has been in play for some time.  I’d just say that you do hear some anecdotes on the other side as well:  They’ve been subsidizing; if we take another 5 or 10 basis points out of returns, there’s a limit to their ability to subsidize; and at least one or two have suggested that they would close funds.  Now, it’s hard to know whether that’s a forecast or a way of trying to lean against this possibility.  I think some anecdotes say it would not be disruptive or important, but they don’t all go in that direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that some funds have been subsidizing and may not be able to continue doing so if returns decrease. Additionally, one or two funds have suggested that they may close. The speaker acknowledges that there are differing opinions and anecdotes on this matter.


Passage number 89.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 90.
 MR. FISHER.  I think that’s an important question.  I think an even more important question is whether it would induce banks to lend more.  Have we had a chance to survey banks.  Seth, you may have an answer to this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 91.
 MR. CARPENTER.  We have not recently done a survey of banks on that specific question, but the way we look at it is to ask how big of an effect could it be and what are the current impediments to lending right now.  That’s why we tried to allude to some of the surveys that we have on a regular basis about business lending from banks, and banks tend to point to a shortage of qualified borrowers—their terms—and low demand for loans.  The economy is weak.  The need for bank credit is low, and as a result, there’s less demand.  While it seems clear that this should, at the margin, provide banks with a greater incentive to lend, at most we’re talking about a 25 basis point change.  In that sense, it’s not clear that it could be that large to begin with.  Moreover, banks have some balance sheet constraints.  An individual bank may try to get rid of reserves and get more loans, but the banking sector as a whole can’t get rid of reserves.  And if, in fact, the real constraint on bank lending now is on the demand side and not so much on the supply side, again, at the margin it should go in the right direction, but it doesn’t seem like it could be “the answer.”  That said, we’ve seen a small increase recently in bank lending, and so to the extent that this could help with that momentum, maybe there’s something at the margin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any direct disagreement or contention. It provides an analysis of the current state of bank lending and the potential impact of certain factors. There is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 92.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a simple expression of thanks to President Bullard. There is no evidence of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 93.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude from someone named President Plosser.


Passage number 94.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thanks.  I just want to ask one question.  Obviously, a policy tied only to unemployment would risk destabilizing inflation if you misestimated the u*.  But, as I said at the beginning, we have the escape clauses of both projected inflation in the medium term and inflation expectations.  You mentioned that projected inflation is a weaker condition, but, of course, that’s what all inflation-targeting central banks do.  And then you also mentioned the unemployment rate as being interpreted as a target.  I just wanted to note that the language describing the unemployment rate in A(2) comes directly from the FAQs that your group put together for a public presentation explaining what unemployment is.  I think the SEP suggestion is an interesting one, for example, but I don’t quite understand why it was inconsistent with the broad inflation-targeting framework.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and expressing their understanding of the inflation-targeting framework.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 95.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I would suggest—and I have suggested this before—that I think this is about communications as much as anything else.  And I don’t think the statement is the place to do that.  You’ve given several speeches about why the unemployment SEP number is different.  I think that concept needs to be socialized more widely.  I think you and the Vice Chair and others need to talk about it in speeches, help explain it to the public, so they understand this means something different before we try to get our policy statement, in which we are confined to very few words, to convey that notion.  I think that over a period of time, I would certainly become more comfortable that we could do this and not have it be misinterpreted.  In the context of a policy statement, I think it’s very difficult to do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, disagrees with the idea of using the policy statement to explain the concept of the unemployment SEP number and suggests that it should be communicated through speeches and public discussions instead.


Passage number 96.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The word "Okay" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple affirmation or acknowledgement.


Passage number 97.
 MR. LACKER.  Just an observation, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions an observation without expressing any opposing viewpoint or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 98.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without the passage being provided, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 99.
 MR. LACKER.  CNBC this morning aired a discussion of our possible policy tools, including this “trigger strategy” idea.  They referred to the unemployment rate trigger as a target.  So I think the discussion has begun, and I think we’re behind the curve on that if we’re going to try to convince the public that it’s not a target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and observation about the discussion of a possible policy tool.


Passage number 100.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. Additional context is needed.


Passage number 101.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What do we mean by “target”.  Do we mean “target” as in when we think about starting to normalize policy or “target” as in a long-term objective for unemployment.  “Target” can mean different things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply poses a question and acknowledges that the term "target" can have varying interpretations or meanings.


Passage number 102.
 MR. LACKER.  I understand what we mean about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement expressed in the passage as it is a statement of understanding.


Passage number 103.
  I’m just reporting that— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We understand the distinction between an inflation target and an unemployment “target” in quotation marks.  We understand that’s an important distinction to make.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they understand the distinction between an inflation target and an unemployment "target" and acknowledging its importance.


Passage number 104.
 MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is just the introduction of someone speaking at a meeting.


Passage number 105.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, Jim.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 106.
 MR. BULLARD.  Maybe we should just try to clarify this here.  I thought if you put your stuff in your Taylor rule, then usually you said you’re targeting those things.  Now, here we don’t have a Taylor rule, but you have this threshold for action that seems very close to me.  So I don’t know.  I think that there maybe is some confusion over the targets versus—I’m not sure what it is if it’s not a target.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing confusion and seeking clarification on the topic of targets and thresholds.


Passage number 107.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That was the sense, I think, that the Vice Chairman was reacting to—that there is a u* and a π* in the Taylor rule, and in that sense, it’s an anchor for or a determinant of policy.  The difference is that we can set π*; we can’t set u*.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining a point of view or understanding.


Passage number 108.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 109.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is not presenting any arguments or conflicting viewpoints. It is simply stating a fact or opinion about President Evans.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 110.
 MR. EVANS.  Well, I remember hearing John Taylor, or maybe he wrote it down in his blog somewhere, say that he disagrees with that characterization.  Now, I don’t agree with how he described it, but at some point he said that output is only in there to capture inflationary pressures and things like that.  So there is tremendous disagreement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentioned that John Taylor disagrees with a certain characterization, indicating a difference in viewpoints or opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 111.
 MR. BULLARD.  Right.  I’m recalling long papers by Lars Svensson that are defining all these things, and I don’t think it was very clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is disagreement or lack of clarity regarding the papers written by Lars Svensson.


Passage number 112.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states "President Kocherlakota" without providing any further information or context that would indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 113.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I’ll refrain from making comments about how much CNBC has read Lars Svensson’s work.  [Laughter]  As you referred to in your framing remarks, Mr. Chairman,  I think it is important to keep in mind that the thresholds that are being used in paragraph 4 of alternative A are not u*.  They are a way to describe when the Committee will raise interest rates as consistent with some notion of u* being maybe 5 to 6 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is making a comment about the reading habits of CNBC, then explaining a point about the thresholds used in alternative A.


Passage number 114.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage "That's correct." This statement simply confirms the correctness of something without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 115.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  So that’s the way I took it.  With all that said, I think we can get to a point where we all understand that in this room.  I think the challenges in communicating that to the broader public might be pretty high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and acknowledging the potential difficulties in communicating that opinion to the public.


Passage number 116.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Thank you. President Rosengren" does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 117.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll follow in the order that the questions were sent to us. For question 1(a), I do think the maturity extension program is a useful tool.  The estimates of the effect of the maturity extension provided by staff seem quite reasonable.  In talking with financial market participants, they have suggested that the expectation of policy action of this type is one of the reasons that long-term Treasuries and mortgage rates declined so much recently.  I agree with the comments of several of my predecessors, though, that it’s a one-time action, and so we’re going to need to deploy additional tools if we see a financial crisis or the probability of deflation rising substantially.  I think it’s a sensible one-time thing to do, but it is a one-time thing to do. In terms of question 1(b), on the interest on excess reserves, I think that through my questioning it was probably pretty clear what my view was.  I do worry about the optics—that so much of it’s being held at foreign branches.  I do think it helps signaling that we’re serious about keeping rates low for quite a while.  And I do believe it’ll have a fairly modest effect, but given the signaling and optics, we should think about it.  It’s a one-time thing, and if we’re doing one-time things, this would seem to be the appropriate time to think about it. In terms of question 2(a), I think it is useful to make clear that we are intending to restore the economy over time to 2 percent inflation and an unemployment rate in a range of 5 to 6 percent, consistent with our forecast submissions.  We’ve already stated in the SEP that that is what we’re expecting to do in the longer run.  And I don’t think there will be a big impact from that, but it’s probably useful to do it. To the extent that we could be more transparent about our reaction function, a question in 2(b), I think that would also be useful, not only to the public but also to our own deliberations, where it’s sometimes not as clear as it should be whether our policy positions reflect differences in our forecast, differences in our long-run objective, or differences in our reaction function.  Getting more clarity around this table about which of those three things that we disagree on actually would help edify everybody and maybe help us have a more focused discussion. In terms of 2(c), I’m actually not bothered by paragraphs 2 and 4.  I think they’re reasonable—other than that they’re in alternative A rather than alternative B.  But if I were to make a suggestion, I would combine 2 and 4 and maybe focus on three elements, particularly given that, as several people have noted, we haven’t had time to communicate a long-run inflation target of 2 percent and to have some of the communications.  But we do have the SEP projections, and if we were to do something like this conditional language at this meeting, or a meeting soon thereafter, I think it is reasonable, until we have had time to communicate, to focus on the SEP projections and on highlighting that 2 percent or a little bit below and unemployment of 5 to 6 percent—that has not changed.  Also, how consistent is it with the objectives and our forecast. And finally, to the extent that we can make our reaction function clear, I think that’s useful.  Several people seem to be talking about an inflation target as if it’s an inflation ceiling; my understanding of an inflation target is it’s just that—it’s a target that is the midpoint, it’s not a ceiling.  If it is a midpoint, that means at times we would tolerate inflation that’s a little bit higher, and at times we would tolerate inflation that’s a little bit lower.  Particularly at times when we’re very far away from where we think the unemployment rate should be, it would be reasonable to take more risk on getting the inflation rate a little bit higher.  And we could argue whether the appropriate range was 1½ to 2½ or 1 to 3 percent, but I think it’s actually quite consistent with what already is embedded in how we have described the inflation target. I do think that if we’re moving to be very explicit about inflation being 2 percent, we would need to have a conversation with the Congress.  Over time, I would hope that we’d gravitate away from the SEP projections to being more explicit about what our longer-run goals are.  But that would take more time.  That’s all I have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 118.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The given passage is a polite statement expressing gratitude to President Fisher. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 119.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Again, we’re in a process of contingency planning, and that’s exactly what motivates that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: The passage simply states that the speaker is in the process of contingency planning, without providing any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 120.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.  And let me also just add, if I may, that I’m delighted with the framework exercise because I think that’s really what we should be discussing, and I look forward to it.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher expresses his agreement and enthusiasm towards the framework exercise and indicates that he looks forward to discussing it.


Passage number 121.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "President Lockhart" does not indicate any contention or disagreement as it simply mentions the title of a person without any opposing views or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 122.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I realize you have emphasized that this is contingency planning.  I’d like to focus my attention really on my reactions to the policies suggested in terms of their immediate potential.  There’s a caricature of the French that they tend to think along the lines of, “It works in practice.  Will it work in theory.”  And I think our situation is, “Will it work in practice, or are we just dealing with psychological operations, and will they work.”  So let me start with an overview of how I reacted to the whole set of memos and questions.  I doubt that the balance sheet tools will have much real effect through the credit channel.  Looked at on a benefits versus potential costs basis, I think the MEPs are safer considering the projected modest effects.  However, for “psych ops”—to use an Army term—effects, the LSAP is much more powerful if we conclude that shock therapy is needed.  Dropping interest on reserves will have little or no effect and carries significant uncertainties.  And I’m unconvinced about, but not closed to, employing explicit unemployment and inflation policy triggers in a statement versus using the SEPs to communicate participants’ projections.  But, as I said, I’m open to further discussion and could be convinced.  And finally, I thought Governor Tarullo sent out a quite useful memo, and I am substantially in agreement with Governor Tarullo’s position. Rather than go through each of these points, let me just highlight some thoughts on two or three of these elements.  As I said, I doubt that there will be much in the way of real effect from the use of our balance sheet tools.  I concede that we can drive down long-term rates a bit, but rates are already low.  We’d be doing this in a context of continuing deleveraging.  Credit standards are necessarily higher.  There’s plenty of liquidity, and from a business point of view, even a better revenue outlook from some anticipation of growth may not generate much hiring.  I’d like to see further analysis—and my staff and I discussed this at some length— along the lines of the question, with lower longer-term rates, who—meaning, which borrower class—will actually borrow and for what purpose, and how much incremental demand will that produce. My own sense is that longer-term rates will affect mortgage costs for consumers, both new buyers and those refinancing, and for commercial real estate owners, both new projects and refinancing.  That’s where the long rates will have the most effect, but only if short-term rates also fall, and that’s uncertain, according to the study that was presented.  Are other financed consumer purchases—namely, autos and other durables—cheaper.  And furthermore, consumer revolving credit—credit cards and equivalent store charge cards—is very sticky at high rates in order to absorb credit costs and fraud costs.  Most ordinary business credit is at short tenors—that is, revolving credit that is typically priced around one year and term loans in the five- to eight-year range.  So the best chance for lower longer-term rates to stimulate sustained activity is consumer spending from lower mortgage costs due to refinancing, with some cash flow that is freed up going into increased savings.  And I ask, what’s the recent response from the point of view of refinancing to lower rates, which have been declining since the first of the year or since about April, per Brian Sack’s exhibit 3.  I don’t know what the credit aggregates have done, but I think if we look at that, we could get a sense of what the response is to lower rates; some of that is certainly contained by the fact that many mortgage holders are underwater and therefore not pursuing refinance. Regarding interest on reserves, I’m skeptical that reducing interest on reserves alone will do much to stimulate more economic activity.  Bankers don’t perceive a business tradeoff between 25 basis points on reserves and 300 to 400 basis points average yield on a loan, and for what it’s worth, bankers tell us that dropping interest on reserves will not incentivize them to make loans they wouldn’t otherwise make.  One banker did suggest that eliminating interest on reserves would cause some layoffs.  Also, I think there’s a question related to the FDIC assessment.  Because of the FDIC assessment, interest on reserves at 10 basis points would imply a net tax on large domestic banks, and if we were to go so far as LSAP 3, that would increase the tax if implemented.  So the question I have is, have we engaged the FDIC at all on their continued policy of applying this assessment, because it does affect, at least in some scenarios, monetary policy.  I’m also concerned, although I heard President Rosengren argue the opposite, that there would be disruption of short-term funding markets.  I think this is something of an unknown.  So I ask, why should we take the risk of doing that. One final comment on the targeting of unemployment within a framework as portrayed in paragraphs 2 and 4.  As I said, I’m unconvinced but not closed minded on the subject, but I’m concerned that labor markets today are very confusing.  There is much we do not understand, and an explicit number will be taken as a harder commitment than perhaps we can back up with our understanding of how labor markets are in fact working.  Those are my comments.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any evident contention or disagreement. Mr. Lockhart is expressing his opinions and thoughts on various policies and their potential effects, but there is no clear contention or disagreement with any other person or viewpoint.


Passage number 123.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Let me just mention one point.  A number of people have mentioned the role of the projections, the SEP.  I’m just raising this for consideration.  Would it make sense to make reference to the SEP in a statement.   For example, you could say, “As indicated in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the Committee judges that inflation between 1.7 and 2,” et cetera.  Does that help at all, Charlie.  You don’t have to answer now if you’re not prepared, but that would be one way to refer to information that’s already been out there, that I’ve already talked about—just something to put on the table.  We’ll put the pressure on President Williams to take us to lunch.  [Laughter]  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply suggesting a way to reference information that has already been discussed.


Passage number 124.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 125.
 WILLIAMS.  Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would just start off with a comment about interest rates and lowering interest rates and the effect on spending.  Nine months from now I’m going to have my 50th birthday, and I’ve been promised a midlife-crisis sports car.  So I assure you that if interest rates are lower, I will spend more on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's personal plans and their intention to spend more if interest rates are lower.


Passage number 126.
  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.  You have a conflict of interest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  In this passage, there is no apparent contention or disagreement. The statement is simply pointing out the presence of a conflict of interest.


Passage number 127.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: Without any context provided, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 128.
 WILLIAMS.  If there is a silver lining to our current predicament, it’s been that these events provide a laboratory for research that has increased our understanding of the effectiveness of monetary policy at the zero bound.  Based on this research—and we’ve actually reviewed probably about a dozen papers—I think it’s pretty clear that these types of programs, both LSAPs and maturity extension, are effective policy tools that could help lower longer-term interest rates at the margin.  And I’ll just comment that the staff memo that we saw today shows that either of these policy options would lower 10-year Treasuries between 10 and 25 basis points initially, and that’s roughly equivalent to a 75 to 100 basis point cut in the fed funds rate.  I actually view that as a very sizable policy action to the extent that these are equivalent, and I’m going to come back to that in a second.  I’d also just say that obviously these policies aren’t cure-alls, but I still think we should use them as appropriate given the constraints we face at the short end of the yield curve.  I’d add that in the future, we’ll likely need to broaden the set of securities that we purchase for the very reasons that President Kocherlakota and President Fisher mentioned.  I think we’ll need to consider going back to mortgage-backed securities—I know that’s not a popular idea—so that we can make larger ongoing purchases without cornering the market for longer-term Treasuries.  Moreover, research has shown that our past MBS purchases have had broad effects on private borrowing rates, making MBS purchases a potentially more potent tool than Treasury purchases.  And, as Brian mentioned earlier today, the MBS–OAS spread relative to Treasuries has spiked upward again.  That’s, again, I think, an argument for at least contemplating broadening to that class of securities. In terms of reducing the interest rate paid on excess reserves, I think that would be another way for us to provide a bit more monetary policy accommodation.  It would also lessen somewhat—I’m just repeating the comments that I think have already been made—the confusing appearance that we are paying banks not to lend money while we’re trying to ease policy in every other possible way.  Cutting the excess reserves rate would push down short-term rates a bit.  I realize that’s a small change.  I do think it would send markets a signal to lower their expected path of policy going forward, which would help reduce interest rates all along the yield curve—again, though, only modestly.  And regarding President Rosengren’s comment about how markets would respond or how much disruption you’d get, I also heard the same kind of thing—that money funds are really a part of a suite of services that are provided.  So I would be surprised if lowering the interest on reserves to 10 basis points would cause a highly disruptive reduction in the money fund market. Turning to monetary policy communication, I think that more transparency is desirable.  Paragraph 2 of alternative A is a noble effort to communicate our long-run policy goals succinctly, and it’s one that I support.  I’m also sympathetic to the goal of providing conditional forward guidance, as in paragraph 4.  I think this is very difficult to do, though, based on the wide variety of views in this room.  And my main concern is that this approach will prove to be very challenging in terms of reaching consensus on these thresholds.  It’s very difficult to satisfactorily distill our policy strategy down to just two numbers, especially during a time of extraordinary volatility and uncertainty.  Moreover, this approach focuses exclusively on the date of liftoff from low rates and provides no further information on the intended slope of rate increases after liftoff, which is equally or even more important for thinking about longer-term borrowing costs.  I do want to add that I think it’s essential that, if paragraph 2 makes reference to an inflation rate of 2½, there is a reference, such as in paragraph 2, to our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  I think having just the 2½ percent number obviously would be potentially confusing. So I am sympathetic to this approach.  It’s very difficult to do in practice.  Luckily, I think there is a better way forward.  I’m now not going to be the first person to mention this, but I will tilt at this windmill myself.  I think that it would be a better approach if we were to include our individual projections about the appropriate path of monetary policy in the SEP.  Like Governor Tarullo, I see many advantages to this approach, but unlike Governor Tarullo, I will strongly advocate for it.  Releasing our funds rate projections would accomplish everything that paragraph 4 in alternative A tries to do and, I think, much more.  So let me emphasize a few advantages of this policy.  First and foremost, releasing our funds rate projections in the SEP would clearly communicate to the public the most likely point at which we see the policy rate lifting off from the zero bound.  That could be mid-2013 or later or earlier, as the evolving data warrant.  Second, the range of our funds rate forecast would appropriately convey the disagreement and uncertainty we face about the exact liftoff point.  Third, as our output, unemployment, and inflation forecasts evolve, so too would our forecast for monetary policy.  This would give the public a genuine picture of the state-contingent nature of policy without any of the oversimplifications inherent in the simple thresholds of paragraph 4.  Fourth, the steepness of our funds rate path after liftoff would provide very useful information to the markets that is not currently conveyed by paragraph 2 or 4, and again, as emphasized in the memo, the pace of tightening after liftoff can be just as important for influencing longer-term interest rates as the timing.  Fifth and perhaps most important—and I really think this is the most important idea—is that having funds rate projections in the SEP, or at least having them internally, would help our policy discussions at this table.  It would give us a better understanding of the range of views on the Committee and could help us better frame the debate about policy and the outlook.  It might even help us find greater points of agreement regarding the future course of policy.  To summarize, I support the use of forward guidance in principle, but I think we can do much better by publicly releasing our policy projections in the SEP or at least having them internally as part of our discussion.  This would importantly communicate the most likely path of policy and the uncertainty and state contingency of that path, and again, it would shape the public’s expectations about policy after the liftoff point, which could be just as important.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses support for certain policy options, such as LSAPs and maturity extension, but also acknowledges that these policies are not cure-alls. Additionally, the speaker suggests that the interest rate paid on excess reserves should be reduced, while also acknowledging that this would only have a modest effect on interest rates. The speaker also expresses disagreement with the approach of providing conditional forward guidance, stating that it would be challenging to reach consensus on these thresholds and that it does not provide enough information on the intended slope of rate increases. Instead, the speaker argues for including individual projections about the appropriate path of monetary policy in the SEP, which is a different approach from what is currently being suggested.


Passage number 129.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think I need to mention a very ticklish governance issue that you raised, though.  The interest rate is set, of course, by the FOMC, not by everyone around the table equally.  Would you somehow identify the FOMC projections vis-à-vis those nonvoting, for example, in a given year.  That’s just a question for discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges the need to address a governance issue related to interest rate setting and asks a question for discussion.


Passage number 130.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 131.
 WILLIAMS.  My view was that, just as the SEP has done, it would represent all the participants and be consistent with the forecasts of the participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage merely presents the speaker's viewpoint and does not mention any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 132.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Lunchtime.  Why don’t we go bring our lunch back to the table, let’s say at 1:35—that will give us half an hour, and then we’ll commence again even if people are still eating at that time.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker suggests a plan for lunchtime and expresses gratitude at the end.

Passage number 134.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to start by thanking the staff for the helpful background memos.  I found them very beneficial.  I am going to focus my comments around the questions that were circulated, starting with the potential efficacy of policy tools.  In my view, the efficacy of balance sheet tools depends in part on the problem that we are trying to solve.  Our experience with the second LSAP program leads me to believe that when the problem is an elevated risk of deflation, these tools, particularly balance sheet expansion, can be helpful.  Balance sheet expansion seems to be effective in boosting inflation expectations.  When the problem is a deteriorating outlook for the economy, the efficacy of balance sheet tools is more uncertain and likely to be more limited.  As the staff memo indicates, either asset exchanges or purchases would have modest effects on bond yields.  The associated effects on borrowing rates faced by consumers and businesses are likely to provide little further stimulus to the economy, in part because rates are already so low and in part because the effects of low rates are being hindered by other factors, including deleveraging by consumers and the uncertainty on the part of businesses. Regarding reducing the rate of interest on excess reserves, in current circumstances, with short-term interest rates so low, the additional accommodation we could achieve by reducing the interest on excess reserves is likely to be pretty small.  That said, it is generally a good idea to keep the interest rate on excess reserves close to the federal funds rate to limit the perceived subsidy to banks.  So I can see some merit in the desire to reduce that subsidy, which seems to be a little large now.  However, for the reasons laid out in the staff memo, I do worry about the potential for the reduction in the interest rate on excess reserves to disrupt markets for short-term funding. Turning to the second set of questions, I support expanding our communication efforts more or less as laid out in the memo, but I would prefer to expand our communication efforts within the broader context of our existing economic projection process.  I will comment on the specific questions.  As I have indicated in previous meetings, I firmly believe that providing an explicit numerical objective for inflation would significantly improve our communications and, in turn, would improve the effectiveness of our policy.  This is especially the case now as we face an uncertain inflation trend and with the unemployment rate still above 9 percent.  In light of our dual mandate, it would also make sense to clarify our view of the longer-run equilibrium rate of unemployment, and I think the offered language does a good job of expressing the limitation of policy effects on unemployment. I also believe that providing quantitative information on our reaction function could improve our communications.  In particular, I think that coupling our Summary of Economic Projections with forward guidance based on economic conditions would allow the public to draw its own inferences on the likely timing that we would start to remove our policy accommodation.  It would also lay out the conditions to which the Committee is likely to respond.  For the reasons discussed in the background memo, using economic conditions would offer a number of advantages over using just a date, and in fact, it would eliminate the need for a date.  When we are able to find a way to eliminate the date from the current forward guidance, including our federal funds rate forecast in our SEP could provide a viable alternative to the use of economic conditions in the forward guidance. Finally, I think that some version of the draft language in alternative A could significantly improve our communications when coupled with information conveyed in the SEP.  So, Mr. Chairman, I support the suggestion that you made earlier that we might want to make a reference to the SEP in our statement.  The draft wording on the long-run objectives in alternative A, paragraph 2, seems effective as written.  I think that the language elaborating on our forward guidance in alternative A, paragraph 4, could be effective with some modifications.  First, as I just indicated, I would prefer to modify the language by dropping the date condition.  Second, I would prefer a slightly different wording for the inflation condition.  Specifically, I would prefer not to state that we are willing to allow inflation to rise to 2½ percent in the medium term, because I am concerned that that statement would take away some of our hard-won credibility on price stability.  To me, it would be much better to use a condition of, for instance, “as long as inflation is projected to remain near 2 percent in the medium term.”  This keeps the focus on our long-term target, but it recognizes that inflation could at times run above or below our target.  Mr. Chairman, you would undoubtedly be asked what “near 2 percent” means, which could easily be described as “plus or minus ½ percent on a four-quarter basis.”  You could also acknowledge that the Committee would feel obligated to comment on circumstances where the inflation rate might go beyond these bounds.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing her own views and opinions on various topics, but there is no indication of a disagreement or argument with anyone else.


Passage number 135.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of only one sentence expressing thanks.


Passage number 136.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given that I’ve stepped into a conversation that’s been going on for some time, I will keep my comments brief.  On the balance sheet tools that are described by the staff, I think, as others have noted, that the benefits would be small at this stage in the deleveraging process and uncertain, but depending on the conditions under which we think those might be most useful, exploring those further would be warranted.  That said, the asset purchases bear the largest longer-term cost and the conditions under which we might undertake those would be those we would need to think most carefully about. I do not believe that reducing the interest on excess reserves would be especially effective at this point.  I doubt it would stimulate bank lending, and I would be interested in knowing more about its impact on money markets, notwithstanding President Rosengren’s reaction to that. I would prefer to consider the communication alternatives, as have been outlined in these memos.  I think maintaining a clear commitment to price stability is important, although it is not clear that markets or the public at this point doubt our commitment or even that they doubt our inflation objectives.  The comments that have been made at this point about the use of an unemployment rate do require that we have good communications with the public and that they understand the context in which we would be talking about unemployment.  I also have questions about providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s reaction function, and in that regard, I would like to discuss further Governor Tarullo’s memo and his comments about the importance of other variables in that reaction function, including financial stability concerns, asset bubbles, and financial imbalances.  Finally, as I’ve discussed with our staff, I think exploring more the use of the SEP projections could have potential use for us in the broader context of our communications going forward.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their opinion and ideas on various topics, but there is no mention of disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 137.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a simple thank-you message from President Evans, so there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 138.
 MR. EVANS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say at the outset that I generally agree with all of your opening comments on flexible inflation targeting.  I think if we were very clear on exactly what that conveys, that would go a long way toward helping with the current situation. The premise of this discussion today is, what should the Fed do if more monetary accommodation is called for but the fed funds rate is stuck at the zero lower bound.  There are two key channels for transmitting more accommodation, and they’ve been discussed already at great length.  The first is to use our balance sheet and work the portfolio-balance effects.  The LSAPs, the MEP, and the RMEP all work that way.  The second is to provide greater forward guidance on an accommodative monetary policy stance.  We can do this by signaling a larger amount of monetary accommodation over a longer period of time.  Strong accommodation would be to keep short-term policy rates at zero for an admittedly uncomfortably long period of time.  This lowers real interest rates owing to higher inflationary expectations.  I would say that given nominal rigidities in labor markets, higher inflation for a time likely would facilitate better matching and hiring as well. But one of the big problems—and it’s been alluded to by Presidents Bullard, Kocherlakota, and Plosser—is the time-consistency problem of promising to have more inflation than what our perceived inflation objective is.  Central bankers will withdraw accommodation prematurely because they don’t like higher inflation, even modestly above a longer-run target.  And of course, external criticism feeds this response, and it’s very difficult to counterbalance those influences.  Now, logically, these perceptions among the public make our current policy stance more restrictive because there’s more of a probability attached to the possibility that we might raise rates prematurely.  So an additional tool to provide added accommodation would be greater clarity of our forward intentions.  Stating economic triggers for a state-contingent policy response can help us.  Doing this in conjunction with a maturity extension program or asset purchases would strengthen the commitment to persistent accommodation.  I have a different view than President Bullard on this.  I think that that would actually be successful in helping display credibility. The Board staff’s analyses provide compelling evidence that further accommodation can be delivered with reasonable safeguards and acceptable risks, in my opinion.  FRB/US and other Board models are the only reasonable macro models that are available to help us to sort through this at the moment.  These models incorporate both sensible, modern macroeconomic analyses and empirically reasonable matches between the model and the data.  Simplistic real business cycle or New Keynesian structures that can’t explain basic features of quarterly or annual macro data can’t be called upon for guidance here.  Our Fed DSGE project is making good progress, but it’s not far enough along to provide alternative answers in those frameworks, and we need to make decisions sooner than we’re going to be making progress on those DSGE models. President Bullard mentioned a New Keynesian model with search by Ravenna and Walsh.  I confess not to have been familiar with this paper, and it’s got a labor market and so that’s good, but as macroeconomists, we tend not to be troubled by the fact that we don’t have labor markets in these models.  Charlie and other early contributors to real business cycle theory didn’t worry a lot about particular details; that’s part of the art of it.  When I asked the staff to look at this model, they summarized it this way:  The Ravenna and Walsh model is not an empirically credible basis on which to base the actual conduct of monetary policy.  I say this because the article’s policy prescriptions are driven almost entirely by an empirically implausible factor.  In particular, the model says essentially that the high levels of unemployment we currently see are due to workers having magically become much more powerful in their wage negotiations with employers.  They’re able to bid the wage up to a high level; they’re thrown out of work; the unemployment rate is high—that’s a key feature in the model’s supply structure.  It’s not necessary to point out how ridiculous that sounds in the current period.  We understand these factors about supply effects in these models, and I don’t believe these influences are relevant for today’s 9.1 percent unemployment rate.  We talked about it in January, and I don’t think we made a lot of progress here.  The way to artfully interpret FRB/US and other models that may or may not have a complicated labor market is to think through those types of factors and whether or not they sound reasonable today.  To me, they don’t. The analyses from FRB/US and company provide a wide variety of comforting risk assessments associated with a forward guidance that’s based upon unemployment and inflation triggers.  I won’t repeat those presentations.  I found them to provide strong support for these positions.  The caveats are well known and can be taken into account, and Mr. Chairman, I thought that you were exactly on target when you opened up by saying that this is sort of like having in our statement something like, “Well, it’s going to be this way until the Red Sox win the pennant.”  We could go further.  We could do it and say “until the Chicago Cubs win the World Series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. The speaker generally agrees with the chairman's opening comments on flexible inflation targeting and expresses agreement with the need for more monetary accommodation. The speaker also agrees with the board's analyses and models that support the use of forward guidance and balance sheet policies. The only mention of a differing view is in regards to President Bullard's opinion on the effectiveness of stating economic triggers for a state-contingent policy response.


Passage number 139.
”  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Incredible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The word "incredible" is used to express amazement or astonishment, but it does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 140.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  Well, we have the inflation trigger, which is the safeguard against that.  So if structural unemployment is higher than most of us think and I’m wrong about the labor market assessment earlier, then strong monetary accommodation will lead to medium-term inflation pressures sooner than I expect.  The role of the inflation trigger is to provide a good safeguard against this adverse outcome.  If longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored, we will see evidence of this from financial market data and surveys.  In addition, medium-term inflation will move up more quickly than I expect.  Again, the role of the inflation trigger is to provide a good safeguard against this adverse outcome. After reviewing the analyses, I continue to feel that a reasonable and aggressive set of triggers, if it was a decision today, would be 7 percent for unemployment and 3 percent for medium-term inflation.  With an inflation objective of 2 percent, I think that 3 percent inflation is a reasonable statement of symmetric preferences around our objective.  Having said this, I agree with President Kocherlakota that it’s very important for the leadership of the Committee, if we were to go this route, to clearly communicate what our intentions are about inflation and inflation above our objective, what it means for flexible inflation targeting.  Just using that phrase might not be enough.  And in fact, I think that the concerns that President Bullard has about the worrisome zero inflation equilibrium would also be mitigated by the leadership speaking about intentions toward higher inflation because that would be a move away from that equilibrium. Turning to the specific questions and just to finish up, let me reorder them according to my preferences.  First, I think it would be most effective to continue providing some form of aggressive forward guidance.  The use of “mid-2013” was helpful in the context of wanting to provide more accommodation, which last meeting I did.  Providing economic triggers like the unemployment rate and medium-term inflation is the better way—by adding a more credible commitment.  Level targeting might be best, although I think the benefits of aggressive triggers with inflation safeguards may be close to the benefits of level targeting.  Second, announcing complementary purchases that aim to reduce long-maturity term premiums can provide powerful support to the forward guidance.  I find the MEP approach to add acceptable accommodation at the outset; the reinvestment is a good addition, too, but these may not be enough.  In the event that no meaningful progress is made in moving closer to hitting the triggers, adding further asset purchases would increase the level of accommodation.  And with enough forward guidance, perhaps President Bullard’s pace of purchases program would be appropriate at that later time.  Third, I think that reducing IOER as much as is feasible would help a bit, too.  It would be useful at the margin to provide disincentives for financial institutions that currently prefer cash over lending. On the particular questions related to monetary policy communications, I support providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s longer-run objective for inflation and its projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will converge.  And I can think of no reason to preclude discussions of the unemployment rate—or the output gap, if that was preferred—as they are critical objects for making monetary policy, and we need to be transparent.  I approve of the general idea of providing information about the Committee’s reaction function, like the economic and inflation triggers I discussed earlier and in August, and I find the language in alternative A, paragraphs 2 and 4, to be quite appealing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a reflection on monetary policy with the speaker expressing their views and preferences on various aspects of the policy.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is a polite expression of gratitude directed towards Governor Yellen.


Passage number 144.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I greatly appreciate the detailed staff analysis of policy options relating to our securities holdings and communications.  I’ll comment just briefly on the maturity extension program and IOER and devote most of my remarks to questions about clarifying our policy goals and reaction function. Regarding the maturity extension program, I think the likely benefits outweigh the costs.  Estimates of the program’s effects on financial markets and the macroeconomy are subject to considerable uncertainty, but it seems plausible that the overall impact might be broadly similar to that of QE2, perhaps generating an additional 500,000 jobs or so over the next couple of years.  Indeed, viewed as a form of jobs package, this program seems cost effective.  Under the modal outlook, the program would have only negligible effects on the present value of our transfers to the U.S. Treasury, and under an alternative adverse scenario like that shown in the staff memo, the implied cost per job appears to still be under around $200,000, which seems quite low compared with many other proposals for stimulating employment.  This is, as many have mentioned, a one-shot action, and certainly, if there were further deterioration in the outlook, I’m very open to considering further LSAPs to provide additional stimulus.  I also agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that it makes sense to consider broadening our purchases or, alternatively, our reinvestment of runoff from our MBS portfolio back into further MBS purchases. As for interest on reserves, I think cutting it to 10 basis points would provide a modest stimulus to bank lending and economic activity.  I recognize that a reduction in IOER might induce more banks to charge an explicit fee on deposits and that the public reaction might be negative.  That said, I agree with President Kocherlakota about this.  Such a tax on money holdings provides stimulus to the economy by inducing some shift in private portfolios away from cash and into riskier assets, whereas he mentioned into spending.  I’m concerned about the increasing volume of negative commentary that the $4 billion per year we’re paying on reserves when prevailing money market rates are lower constitutes an unwarranted subsidy to banks.  I do recognize, though, that a cut in IOER could have some adverse and unintended consequences for money market funds, the federal funds market, and other aspects of market functioning, perhaps making it an inadvisable time to make such an adjustment. Let me turn next to the clarification of our longer-term goals, which is something I strongly support.  As an old-timer, I intended to brag about participating in the FOMC’s very first discussion of this topic back in 1995.  In fact, I printed out my remarks here [laughter] from that meeting, two pages, and the seven subsequent discussions in which I’ve participated.  I contemplated the idea of simply repeating what I’d said back then.  Nevertheless, I used the FOMC Secretariat’s handy web search tool, and I was astonished to discover that the sequence of discussions of this topic actually stretches back much further into the distant past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of the speaker expressing her own opinions and beliefs.


Passage number 145.
  For example, here’s an excerpt from a list of questions that the Committee discussed on a Monday afternoon in August 1983:  “Should ultimate economic goals be given clearer expression in conveying FOMC policy intentions to the public through, say, a specific numerical statement of objectives—” MR.TARULLO.  What year was this, Janet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply provides an excerpt from a list of questions discussed by a committee.


Passage number 146.
 MS. YELLEN.  1983—August 1983.  —“or should expressions about ultimate economic goals continue to be limited to general qualitative statements.”  That question sounded eerily familiar.  [Laughter]  So, too, did the answers.  Preston Martin, who was the Federal Reserve Board’s Vice Chairman at the time, specifically recommended the adoption of a 2 percent objective for consumer price inflation.  In every Committee discussion, there’s been widespread consensus on the benefits of adopting a numerical inflation objective, which, for the sake of time, I will not repeat at this point.  As I look back on all those previous discussions, what’s most striking to me is how frequently the Committee had reached the very threshold of consensus, only to become stymied by details that seem trivial in retrospect. I think this is a good time to move forward.  Indeed, there are a number of reasons why this may be a particularly propitious time to formalize the Committee’s longer-run goals.  From the standpoint of internal decisionmaking, all of us agree that monetary policy is fundamentally responsible for the longer-run inflation outlook and for ensuring that longer-run inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, whereas the longer-run outlook for economic growth and employment is largely determined by structural factors.  We have reached a broad consensus that a PCE inflation rate of 2 percent would be fully consistent with our statutory mandate.  Our longer-run unemployment projections generally lie in the range of 5 to 6 percent, and we all agree that those projections are intrinsically uncertain and subject to revision. Moreover, I want to take a moment to dispel any notion that communicating an estimate of the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate is somehow inconsistent with flexible inflation targeting as practiced by other central banks around the world.  For example, here’s an excerpt from the Swedish central bank’s October 2010 Monetary Policy Report:  “The Riksbank conducts a policy of flexible inflation targeting . . . with the aim of attaining an appropriate balance between stabilising inflation around the inflation target and stabilising the real economy.”  The Riksbank regularly publishes its estimates of the longer-run sustainable rates of output growth and unemployment, and its Monetary Policy Reports show how actual output and unemployment are expected to converge over time to those longer-term sustainable paths.  In a paper delivered last week at Brookings, Lars Svensson noted that policymakers at the Riksbank scrutinize optimal control exercises and simple Taylor-style rules in much the same way that we do here at the Fed.  Moreover, the Riksbank is by no means unique.  The Bank of Canada, the Norges Bank, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand each use similar language to describe the practice of flexible inflation targeting, and each central bank publishes estimates of the gap between actual resource utilization and its longer-run sustainable rate while noting that such estimates are uncertain and subject to revisions. As for the Federal Reserve, information about our individual assessments of the mandate-consistent inflation rate and our longer-run projections for unemployment has been published regularly in the SEP since early 2009.  Over the past year or so, the Chairman has addressed this topic in a number of highly visible speeches and congressional testimony and in his press briefings in April and June, and many of us around the table have highlighted these goals in speeches and media interviews.  So I believe clarifying our longer-run goals in an FOMC meeting statement as proposed in paragraph 2 of alternative A would be seen as a helpful and only incremental step in the ongoing enhancement of our public communications. Let me turn next to the idea of providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s reaction function as in paragraph 4 of alternative A.  This is an approach I strongly support if it’s coupled with an explicit numerical statement of our longer-run objectives as in paragraph 2 of alternative A.  The use of such explicit, quantitative forward guidance could be tremendously helpful in clarifying for markets and the public the connection between our economic outlook and the anticipated timing of policy firming.  Absent the introduction of such conditional thresholds, I can imagine all but endless discussions in this Committee about whether to change the date for liftoff in our statement in light of ongoing changes in the economic outlook.  In contrast, if we proceed to quantify the conditionality of the forward guidance, the need to specify calendar dates would diminish and perhaps disappear completely.  Under a modal outlook like that of the staff, in which unemployment is declining only gradually and inflation remains below 2 percent, it seems reasonable that we would keep the funds rate targeted at its current setting until the unemployment rate drops below 7 percent.  Of course, the evolution of aggregate demand would determine the timing of that outcome and hence the calendar date at which policy firming is likely to commence.  For that very reason, spelling out the conditionality of our forward guidance would serve as an automatic stabilizer.  Further deterioration in the outlook would cause investors to automatically push back the likely date of policy firming and thereby lead to more-accommodative financial conditions, while an unexpected strengthening in the outlook would have the converse effect. As the staff memo indicates, such quantitative forward guidance might provide little or no stimulus if the medium-term inflation threshold were set at 2 percent.  In contrast, the memo shows that a modestly higher inflation threshold of 2½ percent, coupled with an unemployment trigger of 7 percent, could provide meaningful policy stimulus by pushing back market expectations about the likely timing of policy firming.  Moreover, such guidance could be helpful in clarifying that the anticipated path of policy would not necessarily shift in response to an uptick in core inflation or a transitory aggregate supply shock, at least as long as unemployment remains far above its long-run equilibrium rate.  In my view, a modestly higher rate of inflation over the medium term would be completely reasonable in the context of a policy strategy that fosters a somewhat more rapid reduction in the unemployment rate.  Under such circumstances, a clear expression of the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal would help ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored. Finally, I believe that the forward guidance in our meeting statement should be viewed as a complement to the SEP and not a substitute.  While the SEP summarizes the individual projections of all meeting participants based on each participant’s own assessment of the appropriate path of policy, our meeting statements are crafted through a consensus-building process that inevitably involves compromises among people with disparate views.  Moreover, the SEP provides quantitative information about each participant’s modal outlook, whereas our forward guidance is explicitly contingent on economic conditions, conveying some information about our reaction function. By the way, I would note that some foreign central banks do produce multiple sets of projections conditioned on alternative scenarios roughly similar to the materials at the end of Tealbook, Book A.  Nonetheless, including alternative scenarios in the SEP might not be appealing to everyone at this table, and in any case, such an initiative would require a substantial period of consultation and development.  However, given the significant interest that I’ve heard expressed around the table in policy projections and adding them to the SEP, I believe my subcommittee would be more than willing to continue exploring this and potentially bring back further recommendations beyond what we circulated in August to this Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Yellen, is discussing the benefits of adopting a numerical inflation objective and providing more explicit quantitative information about the Committee's reaction function. She expresses support for these initiatives and provides examples of how other central banks have implemented similar practices. She also suggests that forward guidance should be viewed as a complement to the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and explains why including alternative scenarios in the SEP may not be appealing to everyone. Overall, the passage demonstrates a consensus among committee members on these topics.


Passage number 147.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of a polite expression of gratitude and a mention of Governor Duke.


Passage number 148.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You’re getting the lingo down really well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is positive and is praising the person for their language skills.


Passage number 149.
  [Laughter] MS. DUKE.  “Credit constraint,” “liquidity constraint”—I’ve got those, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. The speakers are laughing, which implies a lighthearted tone rather than a contentious one. The mention of "credit constraint" and "liquidity constraint" suggests that the speaker is identifying with the mentioned issues, rather than expressing disagreement or argument.


Passage number 150.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions Governor Tarullo without providing any information or context that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 151.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It’s good to have oil, isn’t it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing a positive view about having oil. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 152.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  But inflation is 1.4, which is the really remarkable thing. There are obviously disadvantages here as well.  If we really did what the Norges Bank does, or something like it, we’d have to make significant changes in our institutional practices—not only the nature of the SEP, but also consider how the Norges Bank conducts itself.  As I understand it, they meet two weeks before they actually make their interest rate decisions, at which point they do the equivalent of thinking about the Tealbook projections and have a discussion of that.  They must be one cohesive group, because the seven of them seem to come up with something thereafter, on the basis of which, two weeks later, they make the actual interest rate decision.  And that might pose cultural or logistical challenges for us to do something like it.  That’s just one example of what might have to be done.  So obviously, one way or another, some delay would be entailed in doing something really meaningful with the SEP.  And this will convey a less precise reaction function, though again, this would assume that the reaction function is, in reality, quite firm. The Chairman—in a question, I think, to John—asked about the delicate situation we have in that an entire group of 17 does our projections, but we only have, for right now, 5 plus 5 actually voting on interest rate policy.  I guess, Mr. Chairman, I would say that I don’t have a specific proposal here.  But it does seem to me that both are relevant.  If one is looking for credibility, then the views and projections of the nonvoting members of the FOMC are quite relevant to providing credibility to markets at large, because even though Sandy and Jeff may not be voting now, they’re going to be voting next year, or they’re going to be voting the year after that.  So their projections are also relevant.  Thus, I might suggest a variant being two different projections if we couldn’t come up with—as I suspect we couldn’t—the consensus adoption (with modification) of the staff analysis that the Norges Bank seems to do. Oh, one final point.  I’m sorry.  This is what happens with notes.  Going back to the maturity extension point, I think John first mentioned today the idea of using MBS again, and then Bill and Janet spoke to it, and Betsy endorsed it as well.  And I would weigh in there.  I know that the earlier concern was that this looks like credit allocation, although I feel a little boxed in here:  People don’t want to do Treasury purchases because it looks like debt monetization; they don’t want to do MBS purchases because it looks like credit allocation.  If you conclude that you want to do purchases, you’ve got to purchase something.  And it does seem, right now, for the reasons that Betsy and Bill identified, that we really could have more of an effect.  As I’ll mention later today or early tomorrow, since I think housing is right at the center of what is keeping us in this slog right now, anything that can be done to affect housing markets, even indirectly, would have a higher payoff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mainly a discussion of different ideas and suggestions related to monetary policy and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).


Passage number 153.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there does not appear to be contention or disagreement in the passage provided. The statement "Thank you" simply expresses gratitude and does not indicate any conflicting opinions or arguments.

 MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage is a dialogue between Mr. Lacker and the Chairman, indicating there is communication and potentially differing perspectives or opinions.


Passage number 155.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot answer the question without the full passage.


Passage number 156.
 MR. LACKER.  If I may respond to the good Governor Tarullo.  The reason I keep mentioning our triple mandate is to note that we have read out the objective of moderate long-term interest rates precisely because the best contribution we can make to moderate long-term interest rates is to keep the inflation rate low.  That’s despite the fact that the opposite is true in the short run—that we can, in the short run, raise interest rates by raising short-term interest rates to reduce inflation.  So exactly the same logical relationship between moderate long-term interest rates and inflation exists with respect to unemployment and inflation—namely, fighting inflation may not reduce unemployment in the short run, but in the long run, we all recognize it would be our best contribution.  The Congress can put anything they want in a mandate.  It’s up to us to construe it.  They can ask us to pursue maximizing the postseason performance of the Boston Red Sox, but we’d have to construe what that meant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is simply providing his perspective and explaining the reasoning behind the triple mandate of the Federal Reserve.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 157.
 MR. TARULLO.  That’s true, Jeff, and I understand what you’re saying, but you made a point in part based on how the world would receive a statement endorsed by all or most members of the Committee that associated a number with unemployment.  I would say you can make the converse argument.  If the Committee were to come out now with an inflation target that made no reference to unemployment, that would be construed in a very meaningful fashion as well; personally, I think it would be construed as the embodiment of what some people in the world advocate anyway, which is an inflation-only mandate.  So you’re quite right to say the first statement is going to attract an enormous amount of attention, but it goes both ways.  Omitting unemployment will have just as powerful a message as including something on unemployment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo acknowledges the point made by Jeff but presents a counterargument, suggesting that omitting unemployment from a statement would also be significant and potentially seen as advocating for an inflation-only mandate.


Passage number 158.
 MR. LACKER.  I could just agree that there is that division.  I think the division about this issue reflects different visions for how monetary policy affects inflation and unemployment.  And if you think one is more accurate, you like that language; if putting inflation-only accords better with your vision of how monetary policy affects the two, you prefer that formulation; if you prefer a more symmetric approach, it’s because your vision likely reflects a different view of how monetary policy interacts with the economy.  I’m just reading it the way I see it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses different perspectives on how monetary policy affects inflation and unemployment without expressing any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 159.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, can I intercede here to ask Governor Raskin’s views.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement by Mr. Fisher asking for Governor Raskin's views.


Passage number 160.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don’t we do that first, and then we’ll take the remaining comments.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests doing something first and then addressing the remaining comments.


Passage number 161.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, here is my view regarding the efficacy of balance sheet tools.  A maturity extension program, for example, can reduce duration risk, putting downward pressure on term premiums and thereby longer-term interest rates.  I don’t doubt that this channel works.  To me, the fundamental question is not so much whether longer-term interest rates are sensitive to changes in the balance sheet, but to what degree economic activity is sensitive to changes in longer-term interest rates.  I assume that when we ascertain the efficacy of policy tools tied to the balance sheet, this latter question is of primary importance.  The ultimate value of balance sheet tools, after all, is whether they produce the desired effect, and only the desired effect, on economic growth, employment, and price stability. At this point, I’m concerned that there are frictions inhibiting the transmission between longer-term interest rates and economic growth, so that determining the appropriate sizing of balance sheet actions and effectively communicating our policy decisions publicly have enhanced urgency.  As I’ve noted before, the effectiveness of this Committee’s actions has been affected adversely by the difficulty and slow pace of household balance sheet repair and restructuring.  If times were normal, we would expect a smooth transmission to occur such that decreases in interest rates would encourage households to purchase houses, cars, and other consumer goods.  Because of household balance sheet problems, this channel is likely severely attenuated. Second, as we all know, there’s an excess supply of housing, the elimination of which is not proving very sensitive to interest rates.  In past expansions, residential construction has been a vital component of recovery.  This has not, obviously, been the case in this recovery, and I suspect that even if we could set 30-year rates at zero, we would still not see much new construction until the excess housing supply is eliminated.  Third—and this is an additional factor clogging, so to speak, the transmission of low interest rates to greater economic growth—is the role played by the general lack of confidence and uncertainty plaguing households and businesses.  Whether these are due to the threat posed by European sovereign debt and European banks or other sources, the lack of confidence and increase in perceived risk discourage households from undertaking substantial new spending and businesses from expanding payrolls, productive capacity, and inventory holdings, no matter how low interest rates are.  Because of these factors, and there are others that we are all aware of, our monetary policy strategy has to be, it seems to me, less piecemeal and more coordinated.  The challenge with balance sheet tools is that we run the risk of pushing on a string or not appropriately sizing our responses if we don’t think through how we believe these clogs, or friction points, get addressed and how they constrain our need to respond going forward.  I am fully aware that many, if not all, of these obstacles are not within the realm of monetary policy.  But to my mind, that means it’s our responsibility to clarify for others where these fixes need to happen in order to improve confidence, enhance the sensitivity of growth to interest rates, and make our policies potentially more effective. All that said, I believe that policy tools tied to the Fed’s balance sheet have been closely associated with declines in interest rates at the long end of the yield curve.  And we have seen some discernible effects on things like credit conditions, confidence, relative asset prices, liquidity, and bank lending.  Moreover, although I’m concerned that growth might not be as sensitive to interest rates as it has been historically, I don’t think that the responsiveness is so small as to make the policy useless.  Rather, I think there is still room to bring down the longer end of the yield curve in such a way as to produce some shifts in economic growth.  Just last week, shortly after mortgage rates had tumbled to the lowest levels in at least four decades, an increase in mortgage applications suggested at least some response from homebuyers. I’ll be brief on the subject of reducing IOER, except to note that while I take seriously the concerns expressed by some on the Committee regarding IOER, I wonder about the public perception of continuing to pay what is perceived as a high rate on reserves when rates on Treasury bills are close to zero.  I find the perception problem among the American public exacerbated by the fact that many foreign branches currently hold unusually large reserves.  Ultimately, we should gauge the effectiveness of this tool by the amount of growth it could produce as compared with our other tools and whether this amount of growth is worth pursuing in light of the probability of unintended consequences.  The costs of this option, it seems to me, mostly relate to money market functioning, and those costs are worse the greater the decrease in IOER.  Mitigating some of these costs is an option to not cut to zero.  So if we decide not to pursue this avenue with a modest decrease in the IOER, I remain concerned with the appearance problems regarding the Committee’s hesitation to use this tool. As to the communication tools, I think they hold potential.  I’m positively inclined to the proposal of providing more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s longer-run objective for inflation and its projection of the level to which the unemployment rate will converge over time.  This will provide more-explicit, quantitative information about the Committee’s reaction function and will serve to ground it with the communication regarding π* and u*.  My view is that we need to endeavor to improve public confidence—not, of course, by distorting our description of the true state of the economy, but by creating through our communications the credible expectation that we have a series of maneuvers that will move the economy closer to the goals set in our statutory mandate.  To the extent that businesses, the markets, households, and the public understand where we are heading, and assuming we can assure them we are credible, the greater will be our ability to nudge forward growth in the context of price stability.  I think these communication tools are a way forward in improving mean expectations, which contribute to reductions in uncertainty and gains in confidence.  As long as we can put in place words and actions that enhance their credibility, that they are in essence contracts we are establishing, to signal to economic agents that we are anticipating using other tools, as appropriate, to manage to these levels, then I would be favorably disposed.  This task strikes me as exceedingly difficult, and yet the extraordinary nature of our times demands we try.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The author is expressing their views on various topics related to monetary policy, but they are not opposing or disagreeing with any specific arguments or viewpoints.


Passage number 162.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Do you have a comment, President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply thanking President Kocherlakota and asking if they have a comment.


Passage number 163.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I was going to make a very quick comment.  Governor Tarullo pointed to the idea that we have to be careful about whether we’re thinking about thresholds or triggers or rules when we put these numbers into the statement.  In light of that, I would caution that if we do end up putting numbers in—which, as I’ve indicated, I’m not excited about—I think we want to be careful to choose numbers that we’re not likely to change.  I think there’s a tendency to say we want to stick close to 2 percent not to scare people, and so we put in something like 2¼ or 2½ or whatever.  But you want to think down the path and consider that unemployment has remained very obdurate in the space of a great deal of stimulus.  If we get to a point where our medium-term outlook for inflation is above 2½, closer to 3, and unemployment is still at 8½ or 9, what are we going to want to do.  Admittedly, the way that it is crafted is all in terms of thresholds, so it looks as though we have the flexibility, but the interpretation will matter as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, is cautioning against choosing numbers for thresholds or triggers that may need to be changed in the future. He is emphasizing the need to think ahead and consider different scenarios, such as high inflation and high unemployment. There is no opposition or contradiction in his statement.


Passage number 164.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It falls to me to summarize.  This was a very useful discussion, and I’m certainly glad we had a two-day meeting because—[laughter]—it’s already past 2:15, and I think we would be in big trouble now.  Just a couple of comments.  I’m not going to try to summarize everything that was said.  We will certainly—“we” being mostly Bill English and his staff—be looking carefully at the transcript and trying to summarize from that. On the balance sheet tools, I think most people preferred the maturity extension program to LSAPs at this juncture—with some notable exceptions, like President Bullard—on the grounds that we should perhaps reserve the big gun for later.  However, people raised questions about the quantitative impact or the efficacy of that kind of tool, and observed that it’s a one-shot tool—it can’t be repeated.  I think those are valid questions.  I’ll take the opportunity to editorialize.  Some of the very small numbers on rate changes that were being cited are roughly consistent with a 25 to 50 basis point cut in the federal funds rate, which in normal times we think is a pretty significant action.  I would also comment, again editorializing, that the channels of transmission are actually multifarious through many different ways in which interest rates affect asset prices and behavior.  In the paper on the stock prices that President Fisher cited, the piece of research I did with Kenneth Kuttner, we found empirically that the biggest effect of interest rates on stock prices was through its effect on risk aversion and risk-taking, and we’ve been seeing big swings in risk-taking in asset markets.  To the extent that we affect risk preferences and risk-taking, that would be one channel.  But to come back to the thrust of the conversation, while not many people argued that these were positively harmful—except to the extent that if they’re ineffective, they would harm our credibility—the question that was raised was, how effective would they be. One positive suggestion was made, which I think I’d like to just reiterate.  A number of people—I think starting with the Vice Chairman—made the suggestion about reinvesting redeemed MBS back into MBS.  If we did that, that would keep the MBS stock in our portfolio constant.  It would not increase it, nor would it increase the size of the portfolio.  But it might have the advantages, at least superficially, of addressing the increase in the spread between MBS and Treasuries and reducing the pressure on longer-term Treasury markets.  I think that’s an intriguing idea, and what I’d like to do is ask Brian and Bill to talk about this and, in the morning, give us your comments, if you would, about any risks or concerns you might have about that.  And then, depending on how things go in the conversation tomorrow, I may ask the Committee if they see that as an improvement over alternatives.  So let me just give you that fair warning. On IOER, we had a pretty mixed view.  On the one hand, people were concerned about the perception that we are subsidizing banks, especially foreign banks, and noted that cutting IOER would have at least a marginal impact on the cost of funds.  On the other hand, a number of concerns were expressed about market functioning, and Seth’s memo provided four or five different areas of possible concern.  I’m wondering, Seth, whether you have reached the limit of human knowledge on this subject or whether looking at this a little further over the intermeeting period, for example, or the next few weeks would be useful.  Tell me if that’s not the case.  Can we get more insight into some of these potential costs and risks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 165.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Well, we can definitely do more thinking about it.  I guess some of the issues are almost inherently unknowable until we get there.  As in the discussions that the Desk had with money funds and in those that President Rosengren had with money funds, you’ll get potentially different answers from talking to different people.  Is it primarily the cost that you are asking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that more thinking and discussion is needed to fully understand the issues at hand, and acknowledges that different people may have different answers to the question being asked.


Passage number 166.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The way a lot of people put it is that there are unknowable impacts on market functioning, including money market mutual funds, bank deposits and interest on deposits, federal funds market, and so on.  I don’t know whether more progress can be made on this question or not, but perhaps you could give it some thought.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty and suggesting that the reader considers the possibility of making progress on the given question.


Passage number 167.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes.  Let us think about it and then get back to you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Carpenter is simply suggesting a pause for reflection before providing a response.


Passage number 168.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the term "Vice Chairman" alone. It simply refers to a position or role within an organization and does not indicate any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 169.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Just one idea that people have batted around, which I’m not sure is a good idea, but people have talked about an alternative of going slowly to a lower IOER to see what happens.  Because I’m not sure it’s a good idea, I’m not really supporting it.  That’s something that I don’t think the staff has really looked at in detail.  For example, an alternative is that you move it to 20 and you see what happens.  And if nothing bad happens—[laughter]—you keep going.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing an alternative idea that has been suggested but expresses their uncertainty and lack of support for it.


Passage number 170.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply mentions the title and name of Chairman Bernanke without any further context or information.


Passage number 171.
  It’s like, you drive the truck onto the bridge, and you— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You walk onto the ice pond.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes a situation where someone drives a truck onto a bridge and then walks onto an ice pond.


Passage number 172.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 173.
  [Laughter] MR. CARPENTER.  After today’s meeting wraps up, we’ll have some discussion and get back to you tomorrow morning with our thoughts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply mentions that there will be a discussion after the meeting and they will provide their thoughts the next day.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 174.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Give us some sense of what further progress you think can be made. We had the deepest and most interesting discussion on the communications issues.  Clearly, there’s a lot of interest around the table in increasing our transparency, establishing more information about our objectives, and giving more information about our reaction function.  And in particular, we have the problem, or opportunity if you wish, to clarify the guidance that we gave at the last meeting.  I think this is something that should remain very firmly on the table in the sense of something we should continue to work at closely.  A lot of people suggested making more use of the SEP, the Summary of Economic Projections, and that’s something we should certainly talk about.  For example, the view was expressed that the subtle distinctions between an inflation target and the long-run unemployment rate could not be adequately expressed in a statement and needed other kinds of communication like the SEP, press conferences, speeches, et cetera.  And I think that’s worth discussing.  The possibility was also raised of asking additional questions or getting forecasts of interest rates in the SEP.  I do note that—and I think this was raised by at least a couple of people—the SEP is, in the end, the aggregation of our 17 or 19 opinions.  It doesn’t have the imprimatur of a Committee decision, and that’s a bit of a problem that we’ll have to take into account.  But in terms of providing information to the public, I think it is a useful direction. Governor Tarullo noted that our discussions today didn’t really address the worst-case contingencies, which a number of people have brought up.  And I would say that’s by design because today we were talking about tools in the context of flexible inflation targeting.  I think that in a flexible inflation-targeting framework, we would try to respond to prices primarily through lender-of-last-resort activities and liquidity provision.  In terms of monetary policy stimulation, there may ultimately be some limits to how much stimulus we can provide if we’re going to maintain inflation at the mandate-consistent level.  So that’s an issue to be talked about further.  In those “break glass” situations, I think we would want to at least discuss seriously some of the alternative frameworks that have been discussed and proposed.  Again, as I mentioned, we’ll put that on the table for discussion at the next meeting.  We certainly will talk about the kinds of situations in which we might want to take more dramatic action. Thank you for this very useful conversation.  Coffee is ready.  Why don’t we take 20 minutes for coffee, and we’ll come back for the economic go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. There are differing opinions on how to increase transparency and the best way to provide information to the public. Some suggest making more use of the Summary of Economic Projections while others raise concerns about its limitations. Additionally, Governor Tarullo notes that the discussions did not address worst-case contingencies, indicating a potential disagreement on how to respond to extreme situations.


Passage number 175.
 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’re finally to item 3 on the agenda.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple statement about reaching a certain item on an agenda. It does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 176.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Moving right along.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Moving right along" suggests a smooth transition or continuation of the discussion.


Passage number 177.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The “Economic and Financial Situation”—Larry Slifman, Steve Kamin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 178.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 179.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Larry, your view on the likelihood of recession was independent of events in Europe—at least that’s how I took it.  So let’s say, Steve, that you’re wrong and I’m wrong; Europe does not muddle through, and we get the worst case.  How does that, then, affect the view of the U.S..
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing a hypothetical scenario and asking about its potential impact on the view of the U.S.


Passage number 180.
 MR. SLIFMAN.  Well, we explored that in one of the alternative simulations in the Tealbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that something was explored in an alternative simulation.


Passage number 181.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It didn’t seem negative enough to me when I read it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing a personal opinion about the perceived negativity of something that was read.


Passage number 182.
  [Laughter] MR. SLIFMAN.  It could be even more negative.  The one thing I would point out is that the factor models that I showed on the lower left have sentiment indicators as one of the many variables in those models.  So to the extent that that sentiment currently is being held down, among other things, by the situation in Europe, then that would be captured by the factor models.  But I think the more general point is that we did try to think about what would happen if things got a lot worse in Europe, and as we showed in the Tealbook, that would have adverse consequences.  It would throw us into a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their perspective and analysis of the situation in Europe.


Passage number 183.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think what’s hard to capture is that if something bad happens in Europe, it’s not just a GDP feedback loop—it’s a market feedback loop.  And I think back in 2008, we underestimated how powerful that can be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 184.
 MR. SLIFMAN.  Steve can talk more to it, but the alternative simulation incorporates some of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that Steve can provide more information about the alternative simulation and suggests that it incorporates some of the discussed elements. This statement does not indicate any disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 185.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Our simulation involves, for Europe, a very substantial increase, for example, in corporate credit spreads and a decline in consumer confidence there that reduces output in Europe some 8 percent below baseline, which is obviously very substantial.  For the United States, we have also built in an increase in credit spreads, although smaller amounts, as well as some confidence effects, leading to a decline just in the level of GDP below baseline in the neighborhood of 4 or 5 percent.  Now that, I will say, is probably the biggest negative effect we have ever built into an internationally based simulation in the Tealbook.  But we can go further.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the simulation results and acknowledges that it is a significant negative effect. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 186.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other questions.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply consists of laughter, a thank you, and a statement about other questions that may be asked.


Passage number 187.
 MR. FISHER.  Real quickly, Steve.  Also on the negative potential side—Turkey, Brazil, and China—our staff work indicates that there’s substantial overheating, certainly in the first two, and at risk in the third.  Banking systems are highly fragile.  Have you factored that into your discouraging scenarios.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any contention or disagreement. Mr. Fisher is simply presenting information about potential risks in Turkey, Brazil, and China and asking whether they have been factored into the scenarios.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 188.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, we have certainly spent a lot of time thinking about that issue, particularly for China and Brazil, which are larger trading partners with us and figure more prominently in my thinking, though we do follow Turkey as well. In China, for some time, there have been a number of property-market-related risks, both in terms of prices having risen very high and in terms of there being very substantial lending, which puts at risk not only some borrowers, but also lenders.  In particular, a lot of state and local governments in China have been using off-balance sheet vehicles to try to channel funds to developers and others.  It’s sometimes like a substitute for fiscal policy for them.  So that represents a concern.  However, it is true that over the past half-year or so, property prices in China, based on our perhaps imperfect measurements, seem to have tailed off a bit and maybe even declined.  And of course, the Chinese government and the PBOC are taking a lot of steps to try to rein in the lending.  It’s certainly something that’s very much on our radar screens, and we’re very aware it.  But we don’t see the overheating problem getting worse, at least as far as the property market in China is concerned. We’ve also been following Brazil carefully for very much the same reason.  There have been very many anecdotal reports of a bubbling property market in the country.  Unfortunately, we don’t have as good data on housing prices there, but there’s no reason to disbelieve the anecdotes.  And part of the problem is that Brazil ramped up credit growth a great deal during the financial crisis and hasn’t really reversed that now.  So we’re watching that carefully.  Thus far, we haven’t seen evidence of a bust of that sort, and we have seen the GDP growth and the economy slowing.  We’re looking forward to that tailing off again without a meltdown.  But it’s something we’re following.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing concerns about the property markets in China and Brazil, but also mentions that they haven't seen evidence of a bust or overheating problem getting worse. This suggests that there may be differing opinions or uncertainty about the severity of the issue in these countries.


Passage number 189.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is expressing gratitude for something.


Passage number 190.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is because the passage only mentions President Plosser without providing any additional information or context. Therefore, it is not possible to determine any disagreement or contention based solely on the given information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 191.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  Just to follow up on this, I think the situation in Europe is quite concerning, given the pace at which they seem to be resolving their problems.  And we can talk about a meltdown or implosion of Europe, but it seems to me that one of the things that might happen is an acceleration in the massive flight to quality that we have been seeing, with the consequences being, rather than a flight out of quality of the U.S. banks, a huge inflow of cash.  How would we react to that, or what would the consequences of that be, short of rapid depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar and a huge inflow of cash from European institutions into the United States.  How would that play out, and what would the consequences be for us, if any.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser expresses concern about the situation in Europe and suggests that it could lead to an accelerated flight to quality and a huge inflow of cash into the United States. However, the passage does not provide any response or agreement with this viewpoint.


Passage number 192.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, I will say a couple of words, and then maybe my domestic colleagues can add on.  In some respects, the flight to safety could be a double-edged sword in the sense that on the one hand, most negatively for the United States, it would probably appreciate the dollar very substantially, and we’ve already seen a little bit of that happening.  And that would be adverse for our net exports and represent a contractionary force through that channel.  As well, the flight to quality would probably raise credit spreads for riskier borrowers in the States, and that would be adverse.  On the other hand, of course, Treasury yields would fall more, but it’s not clear how much more they would have to fall, so that plus would be mitigated.  And then finally, there’s an issue that we’re already running into with the movement of money market funds into banks, which is that the banks themselves are hitting their capital concerns.  So I’ll stop there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting potential consequences of the flight to safety and discussing both negative and positive aspects of it. There is no disagreement or conflict being expressed.


Passage number 193.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Right.  In the scenario of a very severe European recession that we had in the Tealbook, all those effects that Steve just laid out were there.  You were seeing Treasury yields fall appreciably, and that helped buffer things.  However, the dollar was appreciating; that made things worse.  And we assumed that risk spreads on private securities were going up, which also made things worse.  Going back to Vice Chairman Dudley’s question, the other recession scenario we had in the Tealbook featured some of the special things that might also occur in the event that Europe crashed.  The other recession scenario assumed that the economy is extremely vulnerable at the moment to any sort of kick from anywhere.  It could come from abroad; it could be domestic:  But with any sort of kick, things could play out much worse than the models might usually suggest, because of the strains that households are under, because of the strains that the banking system is under, because people would be looking at monetary policy and saying, “Well, what’s the FOMC going to do to buffer this.  Or, looking at fiscal policy—what’s the federal government going to do to buffer this.”  This isn’t to say that all of those things will happen, but it is our view that if you did have a big kick to the economy—say, from Europe—there’s a very strong risk that the negative effects, even aside from the channels that Steve outlined, would really ramp up because the economy is more vulnerable.

Passage number 197.
  [Laughter] MR. ROSENGREN.  But I must say that I am disheartened that the staff probability of a recession increasingly exceeds the probability of the Red Sox winning the pennant.  [Laughter] After the last meeting I was struck by how responsive the longer-term Treasury rates were to our announcement of maintaining very low rates through the middle of 2013.  It highlighted the important role that forward guidance can play as we navigate this very difficult period.  Unfortunately, the continuing debate in Europe on a way forward and a string of weak economic reports in the United States caused the 10-year Treasury to fall further.  For much of the past month, the 10-year Treasury has been at 2 percent or a little bit less.  Similarly, the 10-year rate in Germany has been below 2 percent, and the Japanese 10-year rate has been at 1 percent.  This does not seem like an environment in which market participants are focused on inflation in the United States or other developed countries.  My interpretation of this is that most market participants’ worry index is ordered as follows:  The highest concern is about another possible financial crisis, most likely triggered by European problems; the next-highest concern is for the very weak economic and labor market data we continue to receive; and a rather distant third is inflation.  My own ordering is identical. My biggest concern is that we will have at least a serious threat of a financial crisis this fall.  I have talked previously about money market funds.  However, it’s not only the threat of investor runs that causes money market funds to have a significant impact on our short-term credit markets; even without a rapid withdrawal of investors, the money market funds have still dramatically reallocated funds away from some European banks.  This move away from risk is a perfectly rational response for a lower-credit-risk investment.  However, the consequence of money market funds’ withdrawal from European banks has highlighted another key weakness in short-term credit markets—the reliance of European bank branches on short-term dollar funding for long-term dollar assets.  As money market funds and other investors have shrunk as a source of short-term dollar funding, the maturity of funding has shortened significantly, and in some cases, peripheral banks have been entirely shut out of short-term wholesale funding.  The wholesale funding of dollar assets with increasingly short-term funds is all too reminiscent of the SIV problem experienced in 2007. We need to make structural changes in our short-term credit markets so that U.S. dollar markets are no longer hostage to European credit risk.  Structural changes in foreign branch wholesale funding could avoid some of these problems.  My preference in the longer run would be to require full subsidiarization of all U.S. operations of foreign banks.  But in the absence of that, we should be considering more-restrictive supervisory and regulatory oversight of branches to prevent their funding model from being destabilizing to the U.S. economy.  However, we still have significant weakness among some of our largest institutions.  Bank of America and Morgan Stanley both have credit default swap rates above 300.  Should significant credit rating downgrades occur in the midst of a European crisis, I am concerned about how quickly their liquidity will disappear. We’ve been taking unprecedented actions with monetary policy.  I would strongly advocate that we consider whether the same sense of urgency is occurring around financial stability and bank supervision.  The recent announcement on providing dollar funding was quite necessary, but we need to move more quickly to make sure these types of announcements are not needed.  My worries about financial stability are ultimately grounded in my concern that financial disruptions will further weaken an already fragile real economy, moving us further from our dual-mandate goals. Between the two goals, my biggest concern is the unemployment rate.  The economy has been growing below potential, and I fear that even without a European crisis, the threat of a crisis and the underlying challenges in housing, state and local governments, and the labor market have sapped the confidence of consumers and businesses.  In discussions with businesses, this concern is palpable.  While Boston is doing better than many other parts of the country, businesses that have been hiring report being inundated by qualified applicants, from restaurants and grocery stores to biotech firms.  They report that the only labor market problem is that if they identify a key potential hire, they cannot induce him or her to move, because the worker is concerned about losing the job if the new employer’s prospects dim.  This is quite consistent with the very low quit rate we continue to observe. Turning to the inflation outlook, the Tealbook foresees an inflation rate below 2 percent in the medium term.  We should not be content with an inflation rate expected to underrun 2 percent when the unemployment rate is so far from full employment.  The pricing of corporate and Treasury securities seems quite consistent with very low inflation persisting.  Finally, if one were to use DSGE models, which I do not find as compelling as some, inflation tends to be driven by unit labor costs, which continue to surprise on the downside.  With labor market costs staying so low, inflation can become a problem only if firms are rapidly increasing their markup, an event quite unlikely given the poor growth rates we have been experiencing. We face a very volatile fall, with confidence shaken and growth anemic.  We should focus our policy attention on restoring both elements of the mandate in the medium term, a topic to be discussed tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 202.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Business conditions in the Sixth District remain in positive territory, but anxiety levels have risen.  Most firms report that they expect their businesses to post gains in the second half that are marginally better than the sluggish growth in the first half.  Forward expectations have deteriorated compared with the beginning of the year, but most firms are not yet preparing for an outright decline in business activity.  There are still pockets of relatively strong activity.  Tourism is doing well.  Auto production has rebounded nicely.  Freight traffic has moderated a little but is still strong.  Port contacts report that export activity remains strong, and they have seen no significant drop-off in recent months. During the intermeeting period, we mobilized our regional network to get a grassroots perspective on the labor market.  The key takeaway from this effort is that the labor market situation is complicated.  Firms are resistant to add to their payrolls.  As reasons, most cite a combination of soft demand, uncertainty about the course of the economy, and uncertainty over regulatory and fiscal policy.  Where jobs are available, structural or structural-like impediments seem to be at work.  A number of contacts describe the hard and soft skill sets of applicants as substandard.  Consequently, hires are made only if and when the right candidate presents himself or herself.  Some workers are finding it difficult to reset expectations about wages and personal lifestyle.  Some potential hires have to be wooed away from unemployment, which is preferred to some offers of work because of extended unemployment assistance.  Despite earlier evidence casting doubt, firms of various stripes continue to say that “house lock” is inhibiting relocation, which has complicated business expansion plans and contributed to persistent unemployment to some extent.  Taken together, labor markets appear to be restrained by a host of both supply-side and demand-side negatives. During the intermeeting period, my staff also conducted a formal survey of business inflationary conditions and sentiment.  We noted a very modest rise in expected inflation over the coming year compared with readings a few months ago.  While firms say their pricing power remains limited, they now do not see much room to offset cost pressures by productivity-improvement measures.  The firms in our survey see rising materials costs as having the greatest potential for upward cost pressure in spite of some recent stabilization.  At the same time, the survey data indicate that potential for labor cost pressure has intensified a little in recent months.  Overall, shifts in business inflationary sentiment since midyear have been modest and do not yet suggest an unanchoring of business cost expectations. Turning to the national outlook, I have not adjusted my economic growth outlook from the August meeting.  My baseline for growth is essentially the same as the Tealbook baseline, which is similar to the consensus of private forecasters.  However, I have been surprised by and disappointed with recent inflation data and judge the inflation trend to be near the upper end of the desired long-term range.  Given the unexpected persistence of elevated headline and core inflation readings, I’m incorporating into my outlook less assurance that inflationary pressures will subside as predicted in the Tealbook base case. As regards the assessment of risks, I see the risk to my economic growth projection as elevated and weighted to the downside—no change in that assessment from the August meeting.  I would add that the risk of financial system instability did intensify in recent weeks because of the European situation.  In addition, the fact that I and others have repeatedly underforecasted actual inflation, combined with what I’m hearing about the declining ability of firms to offset further cost pressures, leads me to shift inflation risk to the upside.  A final comment on the balance of risks.  The recent behavior of prices has deviated from earlier projections and, in my view, made the Tealbook alternative scenario “Greater Supply-Side Damage” more compelling.  It seems to me to be an entirely plausible characterization of the economic environment we now face. I want to take one more moment to try to summarize my sense of the economic context in which we will consider a range of policy actions today and tomorrow.  The economy is growing modestly and, I expect, will grow slightly faster in the near term and medium term.  Revisions of earlier numbers have evoked a downshifting of growth expectations, but not a forecast of outright deterioration of the economy.  I am wrestling with the recognition that our forecasts have both overestimated growth and underestimated inflation, and this introduces a degree of ambiguity that is influencing my views about policy; I’ll address that in the policy go-round tomorrow.  Let me conclude with one parenthetical comment.  The atmosphere in which the market and public are anticipating policy and in which we are making policy has deteriorated in the sense that the recognition of slow growth and persistent unemployment has spread and intensified.  Since last July, we’ve seen the GDP revisions, the raising of the debt ceiling—a spectacle that dominated attention—the downgrade, a volatile equity market, a worsening situation in Europe, and a bad jobs report following earlier weak reports.  In my opinion, all of this has contributed to a public psychology of impending crisis.  While this may color how policy decisions will be perceived, I don’t believe we should give it undue emphasis in crafting this meeting’s decision.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an overview of the economic conditions in the Sixth District and discussing their own economic growth outlook and inflation trends. They also mention the risk of financial system instability and the public perception of an impending crisis, but there is no disagreement or contention present.

Passage number 204.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic conditions in both the Third District and the nation remain weaker than they were earlier in the year.  Not much, though, has really changed in terms of the outlook since our last meeting.  The question is why, and how long will the slowdown last.  We had thought earlier this year that the weakness would largely be temporary, but it is certainly turning out to be somewhat more persistent than we thought.  Perhaps more relevant is that we have been hit by more shocks since the last meeting, including Hurricanes Irene and Lee and the increased likelihood of disorderly resolution to the sovereign debt crisis in Europe.  Many forecasters have revised down their forecasts for 2011, and some also for 2012, although by a lesser amount.  However, there remain a few forecasters who are at this point predicting out and out recession.  In the Third District, manufacturing activity continued to contract in September after a sharper drop in August.  The August drop was undoubtedly affected by the events in Europe and the debacle over the debt ceiling debate in the United States.  The September numbers were clearly influenced by the hurricanes and the subsequent severe flooding in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.  Thus, I find it very difficult at this point to get a very firm reading on manufacturing performance in the District, and I remain somewhat uncertain.  However, both indexes for prices paid and for prices received bounced back higher than they had been after the bad August numbers.  Labor markets continue to struggle, with little progress.  But there appears to be a dichotomy in the labor market.  My contacts report that the job postings for lower-skilled workers are finding a plethora of applicants who are either highly qualified or overqualified, or, on the other hand, not qualified at all, while firms looking to hire a more specialized skill are having great difficulty finding qualified workers.  They have many job openings, and when they do hire, they tend to hire individuals from other firms rather than out of the unemployed. Business leaders continually report to me, much like President Lacker, uncertainty, uncertainty, uncertainty—whether it be Europe, whether it be U.S. regulatory reform, whether it be tax policy, and the list goes on and on and on.  They rarely complain to me about a lack of liquidity or that interest rates are too high for them to conduct their businesses as time goes on.  The real estate sector shows few signs of life, as many people note.  Sentiment remains subdued in the District.  However, manufacturers do expect a pickup in activity over the next six months, and that was a rebound from what we observed in the August survey.  In other sectors, activity is expected to show very slight growth in the near term, and contacts report that they are concerned about the downward trend in consumer confidence.  While their outlook is still positive, it is dripping with uncertainty.  National conditions are similar to those in the District.  While we are seeing weak activity, 12-month inflation rates continue to accelerate.  It’s a quite different situation than we faced in the fall of 2010 when we resumed asset purchases.  At that time, real activity was weakening and inflation was falling. To my mind, the big risk facing the U.S. economy is the potential for a large financial market shock stemming from Europe.  The issue we should be focusing on is what we should do in the event that that should occur, and I agree with President Rosengren about the importance of us doing contingency planning and thinking about the consequences of that, should that crisis arise.  This seems to be a much more salient question than how we might lower longer-term interest rates 10 or 15 or 20 basis points from their already historically low levels. I don’t think it makes much sense for us to try to fine-tune the real side of the economic recovery at this point.  A large shock hit the economy, and with the benchmark revisions, we know it was even larger than we thought.  The Fed responded in our role as lender of last resort to try to stem the financial instability and in our monetary policy role by reducing interest rates, easing credit conditions significantly.  We have provided and continue to provide a historically large amount of liquidity and monetary accommodation.  Interest rates are near record lows, and we’ve said they’ll be so for a long time.  If our purpose is to provide more certainty and confidence to the markets, we can best do that by stopping trying to tweak a little to no benefit.  We undermine our own credibility and perhaps even the general public’s confidence in us by giving the public the impression that we react to short-term events with little clear understanding or communication of the underlying frameworks that are guiding us.  I hope we can continue to develop a clear framework for our operations in our upcoming meetings.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 210.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After reviewing the messages from my directors and business contacts, I think the best way to characterize their commentary is that the U.S. economy is treading water at the moment.  No one I speak with disagrees with the view that the economy is largely moving sideways relative to trend growth.  As of now, none see their own businesses dropping off as if the economy were in recession.  Manpower Employment Services noted that its July and August business was volatile—down and then up a bit.  Most of Manpower’s clients are experiencing flat or, at most, small increases in revenue, and some are making contingency plans to cut back on their workforces in case the economy deteriorates.  Other contacts noted similar contingency planning.  One of my region’s best-performing large manufacturers with a globally diversified business line described the current situation by saying, “The ice keeps getting thinner.  We expect things will be fine unless the ice breaks.”  It sounds like nice theater, but here’s the scary part:  The company has instructed all of its units to mock up plans for a 30 percent reduction in capital expenditure spending if it finds it needs to pull the trigger.  To recount the recent fundamentals succinctly, developments in Europe and Washington, weak U.S. economic data, and the associated volatility and net declines in U.S. equity markets all have had negative effects on household and business confidence.  Cyclically sensitive industries, like autos, are expressing substantial concern over the drop in consumer sentiment and the potential for a falloff in demand in the fourth quarter. In financial markets, several contacts noted how things today feel eerily as they did in 2008 before Lehman went down, and one can hardly blame them, considering the risk to financial institutions in Europe, highlighted most recently by the funding stresses faced by the French banks over the past couple of weeks.  One contact noted the widely held expectation that the U.S. economy is in for a long slog but no double dip.  However, they are concerned that this forecast couldn’t hold up to the financial contagion that would result from further significant stresses on some big European banks.  Of course, substantial progress has been made.  Since 2009, U.S. banks are better capitalized and have greater liquidity cushions, and the risks from excessive leverage have fallen in some sectors.  For example, our financial contacts tell us that hedge funds have been reducing leverage for some time.  Consequently, the recent equity market declines did not experience any amplification effect from forced sales to meet their debt obligations.  Instead, recent equity sales likely reflected greater pessimism in general about the economic situation—greater economic risk, for sure, but less leverage risk.  That’s what our contacts suggest. Finally, a different parallel to 2008 is the concern over inflation pressures.  Like today’s situation, back in 2008, there were substantial concerns over the risks of continued higher inflation.  Indeed, my directors and I, in August 2008, voted for an increase in the discount rate in order to reduce those inflationary pressures.  In my opinion, that turned out not to be the right move.  Inflation concerns evaporated quickly with the economic downturn and commensurate with the decline in actual inflation.  Today, with the currently weak business outlook, the pass-through of earlier high materials costs into prices is waning.  At this point, let me take the opportunity—President Lacker made the comment about how output gaps and resource slack in our models depend importantly not just on how you would detrend these objects but also on a comparison with the efficient flex-price equilibrium.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. While some contacts and directors believe that the U.S. economy is treading water and moving sideways, there are also concerns expressed about potential risks and stresses in the economy, especially regarding European banks and inflation pressures. There is a difference in opinion and uncertainty about the future economic situation.


Passage number 211.

Passage number 215.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 216.
 MR. EVANS.  Okay.  Right.  Our DSGE model obeys that type of definition—the Woodford definition.  But here’s the important thing.  It sounds as though we don’t quite know what we’re doing when we talk about resource slack.  That’s not right.  It fundamentally comes down to, what do you think are the sources of the shocks that hit the economy.  In the flex-price equilibrium, it’s going to depend on whether or not you think they are technology shocks, so that in the efficient equilibrium, output is a lot lower in a potential output—or flex-price equilibrium—sense or whether you think that demand is lower, and it’s not the case that potential output is lower.  So if you think that the most recent downturn and impediments to growth are due to technology shocks or higher wage bargaining on the part of workers that leads to higher wages and then to a higher unemployment rate, that would in fact lead to thinking that there’s not as much resource slack and there would be more inflationary pressures.  But if you take the view that they are demand shocks, as our Chicago DSGE model does in fact find, then there’s a lot of resource slack—indeed, there’s a ton of resource slack as they continue to update that model—and inflationary pressures are lowered.  Again, it’s a difference of opinion on what the driving forces are for the current period. To sum up, here’s my simple view on our current macro forecasting exercises.  The economy is performing pretty poorly right now.  There’s no meaningful difference between today’s world and one that has the NBER’s “bad housekeeping seal” of being labeled as in recession.  One typical response during periods of economic weakness, like we face today, is to spend a lot of time trying to figure out whether or not the economy is falling into a recession.  That effort just isn’t necessary at this point.  Whether growth is going negative or slightly positive is not the issue.  Even a continuation of modest positive growth will leave us with large resource gaps, appropriately defined, for an unacceptable period of time.  I continue to agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that substantial slack will result in inflation over the medium term coming in under my interpretation of our objective—namely, 2 percent.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is presenting different perspectives on the sources of shocks in the economy and their impact on resource slack and inflationary pressures. The speaker acknowledges that there are different views and interpretations but does not argue or disagree with them.

Passage number 219.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since the last FOMC meeting, economic activity expanded modestly while inflationary pressures eased in the Tenth District.  Mining and manufacturing job gains helped push the District’s unemployment rate lower.  Strong export demand, particularly for food and chemical products, supported manufacturing activity and boosted factory employment almost 4 percent above year-ago levels, roughly double the national rate.  More District contacts reported labor shortages for high-skilled positions, but wage pressures were muted.  Robust global demand for commodities underpinned the District’s economic growth.  The number of active drilling rigs in the District climbed in the intermeeting period, and contacts expect additional increases in coming months with the possibility of tight global energy supplies and higher prices.  Smaller-than-expected crop production, record-high agricultural exports, and historically low inventories for grains are driving agricultural commodity prices and profits higher. The surge in farm incomes is rapidly being capitalized into District farmland values, which continue to climb at an annual rate of 20 percent.  In response to the run-up in prices, land brokers tell us that the number of scheduled farm auctions has increased in recent weeks.  A typical financing arrangement for a farm purchase is 20 percent cash, 50 percent debt against the purchased farm, and 30 percent debt pledged against other owned assets, which typically are another farm.  We continue to watch these developments, and especially the use of leverage in these transactions, very closely. Still, District growth has not been immune to the economic weakness.  Consumer spending slowed despite solid back-to-school shopping and auto sales, and weaker demand slowed the expansion at District factories.  Contacts expected the growth in consumer spending and factory activity to slow further over the next few months. Turning to the national outlook, the data have painted a mixed picture.  The quarter opened with promise compared with the first half of the year, as some of the temporary factors that weighed on economic growth have dissipated.  Unfortunately, the more recent releases have been less encouraging, and financial markets are unsettled.  In terms of the most likely outcome, I expect that the economy will avoid recession and growth will gradually pick up over the next few years.  Monetary policy is highly accommodative, and the passage of time should help repair household balance sheets and, eventually, the housing market.  But I have marked down the strength of growth over the forecast horizon, as the labor market recovery is taking longer than previously anticipated and fiscal policy will be a larger drag.  Furthermore, the downside risks to the growth outlook are considerable and have increased.  The sovereign debt situation in Europe is very unstable, and a full-blown financial crisis would have the potential to spill over to the United States via interconnected financial markets.  Near-term solutions to problems in our housing market remain scarce, and the recent declines in consumer sentiment are reminiscent of 2008. The inflation picture complicates our decisions.  Price pressures are broad based, and inflation recently has been above 2 percent.  With a gradually rebounding economy, a depreciating dollar, and stable inflation expectations, I do not expect that inflation will decline much below 2 percent over the next few years.  While slow growth poses a downside risk to inflation in the short run, higher energy and commodity prices, along with an extended period of highly accommodative monetary policy, pose upside risks to inflation over a longer horizon. In summary, I expect the recovery to continue, with economic growth gradually picking up the pace after a weak first half while inflation remains near 2 percent.  However, the risks to the growth outlook have moved higher and seem skewed to the downside, given the events in Europe.  Thank you.

The use of "Mr. Chairman" indicates that there may be a disagreement or differing opinions between Mr. Bullard and the chairman. However, further context is needed to determine the exact nature of the disagreement.


Passage number 224.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot answer the question as the passage provided is incomplete.


Passage number 225.
 MR. BULLARD.  Can I just ask one question of Vice Chairman Dudley.  I thought the whisper on the EFSF was that, yes, they’re going to expand it to €1 trillion, but they don’t want to do that because it will take the pressure off the Spanish and Italian governments.  Is that a reasonable assumption, or do you think that that’s broken down some.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question by Mr. Bullard and asks for Vice Chairman Dudley's opinion on a possible assumption related to the expansion of the EFSF.


Passage number 226.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I’ll give my answer, and then Steve can give his answer.  My take on it is that getting it through the parliaments is so problematic that they don’t want to add any noise to the process by talking about their need to upsize it or leverage it.  I think they want to get it through the parliaments first with its expanded powers.  And then once they have the expanded powers—it’s like TARP in the United States.  Once TARP got through, it got used for totally different things than what it was originally proposed for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply giving two different perspectives or individual responses to a situation.


Passage number 227.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  Note the distinction though, Jim, in what Bill just said.  There’s a difference between what Bill just said and saying, “Okay.  We’re going to come back and ask for another TARP now.”  And I think that is a distinction in the minds of the Europeans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 228.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  My view is that after the parliament has passed the legislation, there may be fuller discussion about how to leverage the EFSF to maybe backstop Spanish and Italian debt, but there’s a reluctance to put that on the table today because that could make it much more difficult to actually get it passed through all of these parliaments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal view about the sequence of events regarding the legislation and the potential discussion about leveraging the EFSF.


Passage number 229.
 MR. KAMIN.  If I could just add to that, I completely agree with everything you’ve said, including the fact that right now European leaders are focusing almost exclusively on getting the current changes to the EFSF passed.  A couple of weeks ago, I had your idea in mind, and I hoped it were true, but every single European, including many ECB officials that I’ve talked to, has provided me with not the tiniest hint that they have in mind this expansion of the EFSF’s capabilities and they’re just keeping it secret.  I just haven’t gotten any information that would suggest that view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kamin, agrees with everything that has been said previously and shares his own thoughts and experiences in support of that agreement.


Passage number 230.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I can confirm that from some meetings of my own.  So they’re keeping the secret very, very tightly to the vest.  Governor Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the author has had some meetings that confirm the subject being discussed is being kept a secret. It does not introduce any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 231.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage. It only includes a polite expression of gratitude towards Governor Duke.


Passage number 232.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Credit metrics continue to improve, and charge-offs continue to drop.  With the exception of residential real estate and construction loans, credit quality is now back to historic norms, indicating that the credit healing cycle is maturing. In the last round, a number of you discussed the apparent preference of banks for cash over lending.  I reject this notion, and I would further caution that if we could somehow through monetary policy force banks to make loans to someone, anyone who was willing to borrow the money, then we would not likely be happy with the loans that they found to make.  But I will agree with President Fisher that there are likely some adjustments that need to be made to our supervisory policy that would make it easier for community banks, in particular, to go back to lending to the small businesses that are in their communities.  Governor Raskin and I are working through a subcommittee of the supervision committee here at the Board, and I would urge all of you to also work with your Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council for information on how we can do this. But all of the work on supervisory matters won’t offset the lack of loan demand.  Every banker that I’ve spoken with right now cites their number one problem as nearly nonexistent demand for new loans, even as loan runoff accelerates.  Problem loans are being sold off, charged off, and paid off.  Banks have exited some business lines, and runoff in those lines is no longer being replaced.  And what recent loan growth has been experienced has been in areas such as auto, where turnover is rapid.  So portfolios are shrinking even as new production is too weak to offset the runoff.  Those banks that are expanding loans admit that much of their growth comes from refinancing loans off the books of other banks, and as competition heats up, they find a need to watch out for their back door—that is, existing loans going to competitors—as well as to compete to bring new loans into the front door. Almost every bank noted continued strong deposit growth, but deposits are a mixed blessing, as the need to invest funds from deposit growth adds to the pressure to find productive assets for the investment of funds from loan runoff and maturing securities.  Right now, asset–liability management strategies seem focused on running down nondeposit liabilities and buying securities, primarily agency MBS.  Interest margins are shrinking, and the potential for CD rollovers to continue to lower interest cost is diminishing.  On the positive side, the abundant liquidity has created a ready appetite for portfolios and businesses being shed by foreign banks.  U.S. banks have snapped up businesses offered by RBC, HSBC, and ING and the CRE portfolios divested by the Irish banks.  On the negative side, most banks are steadily working to reduce their expenses to offset weaker income.  Expense reduction is taking the form of closing branches, reducing head counts, exiting products, and, in some cases, selling businesses. The area where reduced capacity is the most stunning and the most worrisome to me is mortgage origination.  The mortgage servicing business has become quite concentrated and is now faced with a number of challenges, such as the treatment of mortgage servicing rights in Basel III capital requirements, as yet unknown servicing standards, litigation risk, and subpar returns as the cost of servicing past-due loans continues to climb.  Much of the profit in loan origination comes from the sale of servicing rights.  So as the attractiveness of servicing declines, the servicers are less inclined to buy the production of others.  Then the wider network of brokers and correspondent bank originators is finding fewer places to sell production, and they, in turn, are reluctant to maintain or add to capacity.  And as capacity declines, originators use price to control the flow of volume, which might explain in part why the response to lower rates is less than might be expected. Capital does not seem to be a problem for most banks, as asset quality improves, earnings turn positive, and balance sheet growth is sluggish to negative.  But the drop in market cap as the financial sector has gone distinctly out of favor with investors is stunning.  Our forecast of weak economic growth translates into even weaker loan and revenue growth for the banks.  So it’s hard to formulate a story about positive upside potential for bank investors, and the potential for downside surprises remains high.  Even banks with limited exposure to Europe or mortgage litigation will have trouble attracting investor interest.  Three years ago, we worried about the financial system collapsing as a result of poor liquidity and steep losses on assets.  Now, it seems more likely to gradually but steadily shrink down to wherever capital and expenses match revenue and asset generation prospects. All in all, the outlook for banking is no longer scary, but it’s certainly gloomy.  However, to end on a more positive note, banks have the capital, the liquidity, and, importantly, the profit incentive to lend whenever demand picks up.  Businesses, in general, have cash, cash flow, and credit availability to expand should confidence return or sales prospects look brighter.  And households, notwithstanding the remaining problems with mortgages and home prices, appear to be under much less financial strain, as evidenced by low delinquency on other consumer debt and quite reasonable debt-to-income ratios.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information about the current state of the banking industry and offering her analysis and observations.


Passage number 233.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 234.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only contains a polite expression of appreciation ("Thank you") and the mention of Governor Raskin without any indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 235.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The good news is that the economy has not fallen off a cliff despite the confidence shock that was precipitated by the debt ceiling impasse, the downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating, the worsening of the debt crisis in Europe, and financial market volatility that has occurred since the time of the August meeting.  We have staggered through August without a financial collapse.  That said, to me we look stuck.  The recent unemployment report shows an economy with little momentum.  Payrolls were flat in August, the workweek fell, and aggregate hours worked in the private sector have declined over the past few months. Businesses are likely holding back on hiring because they are unsure when their customers will fully return.  Meanwhile, consumers are still coping with the sharp loss of wage growth and wealth, driven now by a triple whammy:  low rates of disposable income growth, drops in home equity, and, now, hits in terms of volatility in the stock market.  Consumers are also coping with an uncertain future.  Indeed, discretionary consumer spending, a category that excludes housing, food, and health care and includes things like restaurant meals, entertainment, education, and most durable goods, is still down 1.2 percent more than three years after the business cycle peak.  Going back decades, such spending has never remained weak for that long.  Moreover, consumer spending is showing no signs of returning to the growth rates we saw during the recoveries of the 1980s and 1990s.  In this environment, it seems quite likely that both firms and households will be easily frightened by any new adverse economic news, be it gas prices that are remaining stubbornly high or unease about policymakers’ abilities to reach consensus on important issues. At the same time, measures of inflation seem to me to indicate stability.  The 12-month change in core PCE prices is around 1½ percent.  Moreover, longer-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey continue to hover in the same range they’ve occupied for some time, and inflation compensation from TIPS markets has fallen recently. It appears that the ongoing weakness in the labor market is keeping inflation in check, and that there’s not much risk of an unhinging of inflationary expectations that would feed into a dangerous wage–price spiral.  That said, there remains the worry that persistently high unemployment could push up the structural unemployment rate in the long run, leading to a situation where the labor market outcomes that are consistent with price stability are much less satisfactory.  At present, it’s my view that we’re probably a long way from that occurring.  To be sure, some estimates suggest an increase in the structural unemployment rate of up to 1 percentage point, and that has already happened.  But most estimates still put the structural level far below the actual level of unemployment.  However, if labor market conditions don’t begin to improve sometime soon, structural unemployment could rise further.  In particular, the unusually high share of long-term unemployed—with the share of those unemployed for 27 weeks and longer now at 43 percent, well above the 15 percent historical average—raises concerns that workers will at some point begin to find it difficult to reenter employment as their skills decay. The possibility that the long-term unemployed will reduce our country’s future growth potential is exacerbated the longer high long-term unemployment exists.  From this perspective, the long path to recovery is relevant.  In most recoveries, the ratio of residential investment to GDP jumps and provides a significant impetus to the recovery, but this has certainly not happened in this recovery, and I’m hard-pressed to see how it will happen anytime soon.  As a result, I expect it will be quite some time before the unemployment rate comes down in any significant way.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that the economy has not collapsed and that measures of inflation indicate stability, but she also expresses concerns about the lack of momentum in the economy, the ongoing weakness in the labor market, and the potential negative impact of persistently high unemployment. She argues that businesses are holding back on hiring and consumers are coping with a loss of wage growth and wealth, leading to weak consumer spending. Overall, she feels that the economy is stuck and unlikely to improve significantly in the near future.


Passage number 236.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  You’re certainly fully employed.  [Laughter]  All right.  We will recommence tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.  A reception is available on the terrace, followed by an informal dinner.  No business will be done.  Thank you, all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 237.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The word "Yes" suggests that there is contention or disagreement in the passage, but without additional context, it is not possible to determine the nature or extent of the disagreement.


Passage number 238.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Very much so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanations:
The phrase "very much so" typically indicates strong agreement or affirmation, rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 239.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I am going to roll that into my briefing.  I will be starting off with a couple of paragraphs on that.  But maybe Seth can say a few words on the IOER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Mr. English mentions that he will incorporate the topic into his briefing, and suggests that Seth can also share some thoughts on IOER. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 240.
 MR. CARPENTER.  You asked if we had scope to do any more work on the costs and benefits.  I feel that on the benefits side, we have as much knowledge as we are going to get.  The economic effects are likely small; we know the sign, but the magnitude is very small.  So then I think that it is the political economy subsidy issue that policymakers obviously will have to weigh, how important that is to you. On the cost side, though, it is possible that we could do a bit more work, by talking to banks and money funds, to try to make more precise the mechanisms where we think disruptions would be, how big they might be, and what the probabilities are.  We could talk to banks; we also could talk to the Treasury to understand its constraints about the bill-auction mechanism, per se.  I suspect we could do a little bit more to try to clarify the costs and get back to you with a memo.  Does that seem like a reasonable plan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the knowledge and potential for further research on the costs and benefits of a certain issue.


Passage number 241.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You know, you face the difficulty of talking to outsiders without tipping a likely move.  You need to think about whether it’s possible to disguise that discussion in the context of a broader set of issues about market function, for example.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The sentence is stating a need to consider the possibility of disguising the discussion in the context of a broader set of issues.


Passage number 242.
 MR. CARPENTER.  One possibility is to use the fact that since the spring, market rates have fallen pretty significantly, and talk about that as a pattern and ask what sort of effects they have seen, and then ask them to extrapolate on that if that trend were to continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is describing one possibility for a discussion topic, which is to talk about the fall in market rates and its potential effects. There is no evidence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 243.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That sounds like a useful idea.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply acknowledging an idea as being useful.


Passage number 244.
 MR. LACKER.  I would just suggest to the staff that it might be useful to supplement that with a more microeconomically focused investigation into who holds what, and what relevant margins of substitution, for which investors, link the IOER, the market funds rate, GC collateral RP rates, and short-term Treasury rates.  Obviously, there are players that can’t participate in all markets.  Pair-wise, you can figure out where some participate and define what those margins of substitution are.  I think this would help us understand how changing IOER would pass through to six-month bill rates, for example, and other relevant borrowing rates.  In addition, I think it would be broadly informative to monetary policy operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is a suggestion made by Mr. Lacker to the staff, suggesting that they conduct a more microeconomically focused investigation into various rates and market participants. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 245.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Yes.  That seems exactly right.  And to the extent that we are worried about disruptions, we could also think about the opposite side of the market, who the ultimate borrowers are and to what degree they would be able to substitute.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the statement and expands on it by suggesting considering the opposite side of the market.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 246.
 MR. LACKER.  Right, exactly.  Same thing on the other side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage is exhibiting disagreement. This can be inferred from the phrase "Same thing on the other side," which suggests that there is a contrasting viewpoint or argument being presented.


Passage number 247.
 MR. CARPENTER.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The word "absolutely" does not indicate any contention or disagreement, but rather emphasizes the speaker's strong agreement or affirmation.


Passage number 248.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage consists of polite expressions and minimal information, but it does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 249.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Bill.  Any questions.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statements "Thank you, Bill" and "Any questions" are simple expressions of gratitude and an invitation for further clarification. The mention of President Kocherlakota at the end does not introduce any conflicting ideas.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 250.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to make a comment about the use of the date as opposed to my suggestion yesterday of using an announcement of expected duration of our stay at the zero lower bound.  Right now, if the Committee were to stay with the mid-2013 date, in some sense the default is reducing accommodation from that, because you are moving closer to the time when that date is going to take place.  So the default stance is that you are reducing accommodation.  That is very different from when you choose to leave the fed funds rate the same.  In that case, you are not reducing accommodation, you are keeping accommodation the same.  If, instead, the Committee had said in August that they expected that conditions would warrant keeping the fed funds rate exceptionally low for two years, you could leave that statement in place, roll forward six weeks, and you would have the same level of accommodation in place. Now, I have talked offline to some of you about this, and I agree with the general sentiment that we don’t want to be making too many changes at one time.  I’ll take that as read.  But I do think that, going forward, we are going to spend a long time at the zero lower bound.  It is worthwhile to make this change—away from a date to a duration—to get away from the automatic tightening that is built into this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, is expressing his disagreement with the use of a specific date as a measure of monetary policy, suggesting instead to use an announcement of expected duration of staying at the zero lower bound. He argues that using a date as a default reduces accommodation, while leaving the fed funds rate unchanged keeps accommodation the same.


Passage number 251.
 MR. ENGLISH.  To respond to that for a second, if everything played out exactly as the Committee expected, then that duration would have to be reduced by six weeks at every meeting.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply acknowledging and expanding on a previous point made by someone else, rather than introducing any new points or arguments.


Passage number 252.
   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that something is correct.


Passage number 253.
 MR. ENGLISH.  It’s a tradeoff.  In which case are you going to be changing things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that there is a tradeoff involved and asking a question about when changes will occur.


Passage number 254.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But that’s how raising the rate usually works, Bill, right.  If you look at a usual kind of monetary policy rule, you will set the rate according to current conditions.  But if you are below trend and there is mean reversion, you are expecting conditions to improve, and as they do, you raise the rate accordingly.  Even if you are on your forecast path under the usual fed funds rate in normal conditions, we would be raising the rate along that path, even if things just played out according to what we expected.  So that’s right.  I’m trying to design a system at the zero lower bound that will work the way our fed funds rate movement will usually work.  I will talk more about this in my policy statement, where I think our not using this over the past 10 months has actually had a cost.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 255.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think the one thing everybody agrees on is that the mid-2013 language needs further elaboration.  And we will continue to work on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that everyone agrees on the need for further elaboration on the mid-2013 language, indicating consensus rather than disagreement.


Passage number 256.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Right, sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply agrees with the statement.


Passage number 257.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That is certainly a useful suggestion.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a positive response indicating agreement with the suggestion.


Passage number 258.
   MR. FISHER.  I wanted to ask simply a point of information.  Is it true to say inflation has moderated since earlier in the year.  On a year-over-year basis.  Now, we expect it to moderate, and the rest of the sentence is correct.  But is that correct.  I want to check.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification on whether it is true to say that inflation has moderated since earlier in the year on a year-over-year basis.


Passage number 259.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I guess what I was looking at in writing that down was things like CPI inflation.  The six-month change was up around 5 percent in the spring, and it’s around 3.6 percent in the latest numbers.  Three-month changes were up around 6 percent in the spring, and now are around 2.6.  So those measures have come down.  The PCE numbers look about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply provides information about changes in CPI inflation and PCE numbers without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 260.
 MR. FISHER.  I was looking at the 12-month for core and the trimmed mean, et cetera.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Fisher was looking at certain figures related to core and trimmed mean.


Passage number 261.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The 12-month numbers have not come down mechanically because some of the deflation-like numbers are being left out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact about the calculation of numbers and does not express any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 262.
 MR. FISHER.  I would just be careful about that.  That’s our expectation, but I don’t think that statement is correct because it depends on what time interval you measure, 12 months, 6 months.  I would moderate it somehow were I to support alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Fisher, is expressing disagreement with a statement and suggesting a different perspective. He cautions about the correctness of the statement and implies that alternative B should be moderated in some way.


Passage number 263.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without knowing the specific passage, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 264.
 MR. LACKER.  I was going to support that.  It has the look of cherry-picking the statistic you’re looking at.  We don’t want to get caught shifting which one we are focusing on or appealing to from meeting to meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any direct disagreement or contention. Mr. Lacker simply expresses his intention to support a statement and expresses concern about cherry-picking statistics. However, without further context, it is not clear if others in the conversation agree or disagree with his viewpoint.


Passage number 265.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, except that in the August statement, which is the first page of the handout, we said, “More recently, inflation has moderated as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their earlier peaks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply providing information about a previous statement without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 266.
” MR. LACKER.  We set the precedent there to focus on less than 12 months of inflation, right.  “Are we going to stick to that.” is the question we need to ask ourselves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a decision that was made in the past and questioning if it will continue to be followed in the future.


Passage number 267.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It’s a fair question.  We could say inflation appears to be moderating, which might be better given the commodity price behavior.  Let’s put that down as something for consideration if anyone wants to advocate that.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is presenting a question and suggesting a possible alternative viewpoint, but there is no clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 268.
 MR. EVANS.  I could be wrong, but this seems to be a relatively new development in our statement, right.  Because we used to use the term “underlying inflation,” and underlying inflation had a connotation of a little more ambiguity for good or bad, right.  I mean, we have all cherry-picked at times, “I’ve been saying 12 months.  Now I’m going to roll into the 3-month window because that’s what I think is more indicative of our pressures.”  And when we took out the underlying measure concept, we bought into this other problem, which is that we really ought to be talking about inflation over the medium term, with the emphasis on forecasting.  We ought to think more carefully about how to deal with this.  I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Evans, is expressing his agreement with the idea of focusing on inflation over the medium term and emphasizing forecasting.


Passage number 269.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Except that one suggestion that the Vice Chairman and others have championed is that the first paragraph ought to be sort of a retrospective of what we see has happened and that our forecast should be in a different part of the statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply describing a suggestion made by the Vice Chairman and others.


Passage number 270.
 MR. EVANS.  But “underlying inflation” is helpful for that, and it’s also more related.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any context or statements that suggest contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that "underlying inflation" is helpful for something and is related to something else without explicitly stating any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 271.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don’t want to go through that whole discussion again, but a very similar concept is “medium-term projections of inflation,” which would be equivalent to “underlying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 272.
” MR. EVANS.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 273.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m sorry.  President Pianalto, did I skip you.  Did you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite and apologetic statement.


Passage number 274.
 MS. PIANALTO.  I have a question, but not on this issue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Ms. Pianalto simply states that she has a question unrelated to the current issue being discussed.


Passage number 275.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage as it only consists of a statement prompting someone to proceed with their intentions or message.


Passage number 276.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Bill, in your comments about reinvesting our MBS into Treasuries versus reinvestment into MBS, you made a comment that it reduces the effect of the program.  I know we only put this possibility on the table yesterday, so you didn’t have time to think about it further or talk to anybody, but what kind of market reaction will we get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and asking for further information or insights.


Passage number 277.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I’ll look to Brian Sack in a second, and he may have a different sense, but mine is that markets don’t know exactly how big the maturity extension program is going to be.  They don’t know exactly how we would be handling reinvestments and so on.  My guess is they probably expect we would be reinvesting agency securities into longer-term Treasuries as well, but nonetheless, taken together, the package will look broadly similar to what markets are expecting.  I don’t think there will be a big disappointment.  They will, I think, be surprised if the Committee decides to reinvest into MBS.  That’s something that I haven’t been reading a lot about, and as I said in my remarks, we do think that would probably have some effect in the MBS–Treasury spread.  Brian, do you have thoughts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. English, is simply expressing his opinion and making predictions about market expectations. He mentions that the markets may be surprised if the Committee decides to reinvest into MBS, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention with anyone else.


Passage number 278.
 MR. SACK.  I agree.  The major surprise will clearly be on the MBS side.  So I think you would see a sharp reaction of the MBS spreads to the announcement.  In terms of how Treasury yields would respond, as Bill suggested in his briefing, the effect would be modestly less than if the reinvestments went into longer-term Treasuries, but my guess is that, relative to market expectations, the maturity extension part of it will essentially meet expectations and won’t prompt much of a backup in rates.  I think that the program is a little bit bigger than most people assume, at $400 billion, and as I will talk about later, if you went with this proposal, we’d actually have a maturity distribution that’s pretty skewed to the long end.  Those two things suggest that the maturity extension piece will meet expectations on the Treasury side in terms of preventing a backup in rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, is expressing agreement and providing his own thoughts on how the market will react to the proposed program.


Passage number 279.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 280.
 MR. FISHER.  Could either of you continue on.  What are the negatives of reinvesting the roll-offs in MBS, in your opinion.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question asking for the opinion of someone regarding the negatives of reinvesting roll-offs in MBS.


Passage number 281.
 MR. ENGLISH.  As I said in my remarks, I think there are two.  One is the Committee might be seen as allocating credit, and you’ve been nervous about that in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement about the potential allocation of credit and acknowledges a previous state of nervousness about it.


Passage number 282.
 MR. FISHER.  We went through that before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement by Mr. Fisher indicating that they have previously discussed or addressed a particular topic. There is no contention or disagreement presented in the statement.


Passage number 283.
 MR. ENGLISH.  And the other is that when it comes time to exit, your portfolio of agency securities will be larger, and therefore the sales of them will take longer or will have to be more rapid.  There will be some adjustment to be made at the end to unwind this and get back to a Treasury-only portfolio, which the Committee has been absolutely clear it wants to get to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a hypothesis or prediction about the potential challenges of unwinding a portfolio of agency securities.


Passage number 284.
 MR. FISHER.  So we have a pretty clear concept of what the costs are.  We also have a pretty clear concept of what the benefits would be.  If that spread is widened, we do believe, as you just summarized, that it will impact mortgage-backed rates and help decrease that spread over 10-year Treasuries.  Is that a correct summary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states their understanding of the costs and benefits and then asks for confirmation of their summary.


Passage number 285.
 MR. SACK.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a statement affirming the correctness of something, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 286.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression used to show gratitude towards someone.


Passage number 287.
 MR. SACK.  A few more things to note.  Past FOMC communications have left this door open, as Bill indicated in his briefing.  At the same time, in terms of the longer-run strategy, the Committee has emphasized the move to a Treasury-only portfolio.  So I think there will be some discussion of that and perhaps some confusion.  The other thing is that there are broader housing initiatives in play at the moment, and don’t be surprised if you took this step to see a discussion of this step in terms of how it interacts with those other initiatives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It mentions potential discussion and confusion about certain topics, but there is no explicit disagreement stated.


Passage number 288.
 MR. FISHER.  If I may, Mr. Chairman, would it be considered, in your opinion, counterproductive to those other initiatives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question being asked for clarification.


Passage number 289.
 MR. SACK.  No.  In terms of effects, I think it would be very productive.  I’m just making a few points about how this will be discussed and what the market commentary will be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion about the potential effects of a certain topic and discussing how it will be debated and commented upon in the market.


Passage number 290.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The response "Yes, sir" is simply an affirmation or agreement with the statement or question that preceded it.


Passage number 291.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 292.
 MR. LOCKHART.  To follow up on the mortgage-backed securities questions, if by reinvesting we’re putting pressure on those rates, we’re also putting pressure on Treasury rates that are often references for mortgages.  Is it possible that our prepayment assumptions need to be adjusted so that the actual duration of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio will somewhat soften and, therefore we have a two-step duration concern.  One is that we are changing our mix, and the second is we have to rethink what the prepayment assumption is.  Is that possible, Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if it is possible to adjust prepayment assumptions in order to soften the duration of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio.


Passage number 293.
 MR. SACK.  Yes.  We have prepayment projections where we expect about $200 billion of principal payments on agency debt and agency MBS by the end of June of next year.  That would be the amount under our current projections that we would be switching into mortgage purchases.  If those purchases pushed down rates by more than we had assumed in the Tealbook, that number could be higher and result in even more reinvestment in MBS.  I don’t think the size of the rate effects we’re talking about will affect that too much.  Another thing to note is that, at $200 billion, we’re actually already pretty high relative to prepayment models produced by Wall Street.  So there’s a lot of uncertainty around that $200 billion number, and my guess is, under the current rate structure, the risks are toward being smaller than that than being bigger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and expressing their opinion, but there is no indication of conflicting views or disagreement.


Passage number 294.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about President Lacker that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 295.
 MR. LACKER.  I have a couple of questions about the mortgage-backed securities thing.  First, for the record, I think I know the answer to this question.  In your staff presentation yesterday, I didn’t recall any mention of dysfunction or dislocation in the mortgage-backed securities market.  I take it you don’t have any to report on, or if there are, I’d appreciate hearing that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and seeking clarification.


Passage number 296.
 MR. SACK.  No.  We don’t think there is dysfunction in the mortgage-backed securities market at this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that they do not believe there is dysfunction in the mortgage-backed securities market at this time.


Passage number 297.
 MR. LACKER.  So the staff’s view is that, compared with not doing the MBS reinvestment, this would likely lower the MBS spread by some measure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the staff's view on the potential impact of MBS reinvestment on the MBS spread.


Passage number 298.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Likely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a person's name followed by the word "likely," suggesting that the person is probably involved in something or has a certain characteristic. However, without further context, it is not possible to determine what exactly is being implied.


Passage number 299.
 MR. LACKER.  So doesn’t this mean that Treasury rates would be higher than they otherwise would be because we’re taking less Treasury out of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of fact and does not present any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 300.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That’s what I tried to say in my remarks, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. English simply agrees with the previous speaker's point.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 301.
 MR. LACKER.  If we’re able to reduce the MBS spread, there’d be some other borrowers in the economy that would face higher cost than otherwise, right. Does the staff have a sense of the differential effect on spending.  Is lowering mortgage rates going to result in enough spending to counteract the reduced spending on the part of the people for whom borrowing costs are going to go up because of this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is suggesting that lowering mortgage rates will result in increased spending, while questioning the potential negative impact on borrowers facing higher costs. This implies that there is disagreement about the overall effect on spending.


Passage number 302.
 MR. ENGLISH.  As I said in my remarks, the reason to do this would be the sense that the housing market is in particularly poor shape, and so providing assistance there is likely to be, at the margin, more useful, but I don’t have any numerical exercises I can point to on that.  We had about 18 hours to think about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. English simply explains that he does not have any numerical exercises to support his statement.


Passage number 303.
  [Laughter] MR. SACK.  And we do think the upward pressure on Treasury yields relative to the other proposal will be limited.  I was trying to explain in the answer to President Pianalto’s question that even at $400 billion without the reinvestment piece added on, the maturity extension program is still sizable relative to market expectations and is probably skewed more toward longer-term securities than most market participants expect.  I think those factors will help limit any upward pressure we see on Treasury yields.  It is hard to judge exactly what is priced in.  We should appreciate that there is some uncertainty about these market responses, particularly about how far out on the curve we’re expected to go on the maturity extension program.  In general, it’s a fair assumption that the backup in Treasury yields will be quite modest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their reasoning and acknowledging some uncertainty about market responses.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 304.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I agree there isn’t dysfunction in the MBS market, but the MBS–Treasury spread is pretty wide.  It’s gone up about 50 basis points in recent months.  We think that’s because with rates very low, the expected duration is probably longer than usual, so investors are a little chary of buying the MBS, and there’s a lot of uncertainty about the duration.  That spread has widened out, and this would be a way of taking a step to try to unwind some of that widening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. English acknowledges that there isn't dysfunction in the MBS market, but he disagrees with the widening spread between MBS and Treasuries. He believes the spread has widened due to investors being cautious about buying MBS and uncertainty about their duration. He suggests taking a step to unwind some of that widening.


Passage number 305.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Is some of it due to net supply–demand balance.  Is there a change in the flows, Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is presenting a topic and asking questions for further discussion or investigation.


Passage number 306.
 MR. SACK.  Some of it is due to at least concerns about supply related to the discussion about government refinance programs.  The point is that those programs could cause a large amount of refinancing of the higher coupon into the production coupon, and I think that is putting some upward pressure on the production coupon spread.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that some of the concerns about supply are related to the discussion about government refinance programs, which could cause refinancing of higher coupon into the production coupon, leading to upward pressure on the production coupon spread.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 307.
 MR. LACKER.  Bill, on the sources of uncertainty, do you think you know better than the market about those things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is questioning Bill's knowledge compared to the market's knowledge about sources of uncertainty. This implies some level of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 308.
 MR. ENGLISH.  No.  It’s simply risk that we could take out of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that taking risk out of the market is a possibility.


Passage number 309.
 MR. LACKER.  It’s real risk.  I mean, it’s risk to us, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker and the context suggest that both parties agree that there is a real risk involved.


Passage number 310.
 MR. ENGLISH.  So it’s duration risk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 311.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage consists of just one word, "Okay," which does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 312.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A two-hander from the Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 313.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What I hear the staff saying is that the effect on Treasury yields is quite small because, one, you’re not moving that much money away from the Treasury market and, two, the program is still going to be as big or bigger than expectations.  In addition, it will also have a pretty sizable effect on the mortgage basis because it is unanticipated.  It’s going to change the whole risk–reward perception of private investors in the mortgage market because they are going to realize that if the mortgage basis winds out dramatically, the Fed is now more likely to intervene, and that’s going to change the dynamics in the mortgage market.  Now, why would you do it in terms of who gets the benefit.  Well, I think the marginal propensity to consumer of people who are refinancing is probably pretty high relative to other participants in the economy who might be affected by that couple of basis point backup in Treasury bills.  And, too, there’s an ancillary, broader benefit to the extent that you can make housing markets slightly less distressed.  While the benefits are obviously hard to quantify, if the housing sector is in a little bit better shape, that has a whole other set of benefits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 314.
 MR. LACKER.  If I could respond, the stress in the housing market isn’t among people who are going to be capable of refinancing at a slightly lower rate.  These are people that have good credit now.  The distress is somewhere else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Lacker is agreeing with a previous statement that the stress in the housing market is not among people who have good credit and would be capable of refinancing at a slightly lower rate. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 315.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Assume you have a demand curve for mortgage rates, the demand will be slightly stronger for housing than it was before if mortgage rates are a little bit lower, and I think that has consequences for households.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments. It simply states a relationship between mortgage rates and housing demand, and the author's belief about its consequences for households.


Passage number 316.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Can we save the substance for the go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question asking if it is possible to save the substance for a specific purpose. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 317.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply includes an annotation indicating laughter.


Passage number 318.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I have an empirical question.  Pick your number of what you think this would do to mortgage rates or the mortgage spread—10, 15, 20 basis points.  The question I want to ask is:  Based on what’s happened over the last three years, what’s the empirical evidence about how that will change housing starts, sales of existing homes, or house prices.  What’s the empirical evidence we have as to the effect that that will have on the housing market measured by the things that we are interested in.  Do we have any estimate for that.  Maybe that’s a question for Dave.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for empirical evidence and information, without expressing any disagreement or taking a stance on the topic.


Passage number 319.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  There are two answers to that.  One, if you take our models estimated over longer periods, housing is a pretty interest-sensitive sector.  Second, over longer periods, if you look at the response of house prices to interest rates, there’s not much evidence of a response.  Now, looking at the past few years, it is very difficult to tease out the interest elasticity.  It could be that the interest elasticity is extremely low at the moment, partly because of the difficulties of people qualifying for mortgages with tighter standards and the smaller pool of people who have decent credit scores.  However, the other way of looking at it is that there’s a powerful interest-rate effect in play at the moment, but it’s being swamped by concerns about continuing falling house prices and that sort of thing.  The housing market has certainly been behaving very peculiarly in the last few years.  Everyone agrees on that.  None of the models can explain what’s going on.  Is it decreased interest sensitivity.  Could be.  Is it a very powerful dynamic on expected house price changes and things like that.  Could be.  Is it tighter underwriting standards and credit conditions that are independent of the interest sensitivity.  Could be.  I think some combination of those is at work, and I can’t untangle them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker presents different possibilities and acknowledges that there is not enough evidence to determine which one is correct. They suggest that a combination of factors could be at play, but there is no explicit disagreement with any other viewpoint.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 320.
 MR. PLOSSER.  So it’s likely that the players who are going to be able to take advantage of this maybe won’t be the homeowners and the homebuyers.  It’s going to be the traders who are going to be trying to arbitrage whatever they think we’re going to do between Treasuries and MBS and other things, and whether or not that’s going to have the effect that we want on the real economy is questionable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, suggests that the traders taking advantage of the situation may not lead to the intended effect on the real economy. This disagreement implies a difference of opinion regarding the potential outcome of the traders' actions.


Passage number 321.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That seems too strong to me.  I think it will contribute to lower mortgage rates and more refinancing, and that will matter.  Who’s doing the refinancing and exactly which households are benefiting is subject to question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents the opinion of Mr. English, who believes that lower mortgage rates and increased refinancing will have a positive impact. However, he acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding who will be doing the refinancing and which households will benefit from it.


Passage number 322.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Any other questions" is a neutral and open-ended statement, and President Lacker is presumably inviting further inquiries or discussion.


Passage number 323.
 MR. LACKER.  I just point out that if the Treasury yield difference is little or none, then we have this miraculous ability to reduce spreads everywhere, sector by sector, with no cost to anybody in the economy, and that can’t be the case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is making a point and expressing doubt about the possibility of reducing spreads without any cost to the economy. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage.


Passage number 324.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It could be the case.  Why can’t it be the case.  Suppose we could buy corporate bonds in large amounts.  We would be effectively, through money creation, financing credit extension.  We’d be a new source of credit extension.  I’m not saying that’s a good way to allocate resources, but it would certainly affect spreads.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 325.
 MR. LACKER.  If you look at budget constraints and resource constraints, there’s a certain amount of savings going on, and it’s getting channeled to a certain amount of resources that are going to a certain amount of borrowers.  From that point of view, if we increase the resources going to some borrowers, it has got to come from somebody.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The passage implies that there is a limited amount of savings and resources that are being channeled to a specific group of borrowers. If resources are increased for some borrowers, it would have to come at the expense of someone else, indicating a potential disagreement or contention over the allocation of resources.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 326.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s only with a total output being given.  This is the basic error of the crowding out arguments that you’ve been hearing, which is that holding output constant, if you increase deficits, you’re going to reduce investment.  That’s not true if output is, in turn, endogenous and responds to fiscal conditions.  If output responds to monetary policy stimulus, that’s going to affect income and saving. I feel like we pretty much covered the issue here.  [Laughter]  Any further questions.  [No response]  If not, why don’t we just go now into the go-round.  And we’ll start at the far west of the country with President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

There is contention in the passage regarding the relationship between deficits and investment. The speaker argues against the idea that increasing deficits will reduce investment, stating that it is not true if output is endogenous and responds to fiscal conditions. This contradicts the "crowding out" arguments that the speaker mentions earlier in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 327.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: Without the full passage, it is difficult to determine the specific point of contention or disagreement. However, the fact that MR (presumably a person or entity) is mentioned suggests the potential for disagreement or divergence of opinions.


Passage number 328.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  As I mentioned yesterday, maturity extension is an effective policy tool that can help lower longer-term interest rates.  I was going to comment on lowering the interest rate on reserves, but I understand we will get more memos on that between now and the next meeting.  We will look forward to that memo and that discussion next time.  I supported pursuing this particular policy of maturity extension at the last meeting, and I think the case for taking this step is, if anything, even stronger today, given the deterioration in the economy and even greater downside risks.  I also support reinvesting principal payments from agency securities in agency MBS for the reasons discussed yesterday, also summarized by Bill English.  Specifically, I see this as lowering spreads on MBS, and I also think, importantly, it creates space for further Treasury purchases.  As Vice Chairman Dudley said, there could be a very powerful signaling effect of this as well.  This is the right step at this time. Let me say a word about the appropriate stance of monetary policy, and how that has changed since last November.  Governor Yellen made these very same points yesterday, so I will try to be very brief.  Basically, we looked at where the forecast was in the November Tealbook from last year and compared that with the forecast as of the current Tealbook.  Regarding monetary policy, I think it makes sense to be forward-looking and consider the forecasts, as opposed to where we are currently. The November 2010 Tealbook forecast for the unemployment rate at the end of 2012 was 7.9 percent.  Today it is 8.7 percent.  And the Tealbook forecast for core PCE inflation next year has climbed from 1 percent to 1.5 percent, an increase of ½ percentage point.  Obviously, there are factors telling you to have less monetary accommodation, and some saying that you should have more monetary accommodation, relative to our forecast from last November.  But when I plug these forecast changes into a Taylor 1999 policy rule with coefficients of 1½ on inflation and minus 2 on the unemployment gap, it implies a reduction in the funds rate of 85 basis points.  Based on this simple metric—which only incorporates the information about the change of our modal forecast—the change in the outlook argues for significantly more policy easing than we thought appropriate back in November based on the outlook that we had at that time.  I think alternative B takes us a step in that direction. Finally, I would like to comment on the need for more contingency planning.  I completely agree with President Fisher’s remarks yesterday, and also the remarks of others who followed on yours.  I am very concerned that economic conditions could take a serious turn for the worse, especially if the situation in Europe spins out of control.  We need to think carefully now about what we will do if the worst-case scenario materializes.  In that event, we would likely be employing unconventional policies and operating at the zero lower bound for many, many years, much as Japan has.  In contemplating such a situation, I am sympathetic to President Bullard’s point that we need to get away from one-shot, fixed-duration policies that we have used in the past, and move instead to a more systematic framework.  In particular, we should plan now about how we would conduct and communicate asset purchase programs that are more open-ended and adaptable to changed circumstances.  As I mentioned yesterday, I think we will clearly need to broaden the set of securities that we purchase to include mortgage-backed securities.  Furthermore, I am increasingly worried that we could find ourselves in a situation where the yield curve is essentially flat at very low rates, and the economic situation is still not satisfactory.  I think the traditional LSAP and communication policies may not be sufficient to achieve our macroeconomic goals.  If you look at Japan and Switzerland, they both currently have 10-year government rates of around 1 percent.  If we find ourselves in a situation like that—even after we have used all of our LSAP and communication policies—we really do need to think seriously about outside-the-box approaches to monetary policy, including the use of emergency-type programs or other approaches.  We need to be doing that planning now rather than later.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage contains the opinions and statements of one person, who expresses support for a particular policy and discusses the need for contingency planning. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 329.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Bullard.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 330.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my comments, I will generally support alternative B and talk about alternative B.  Let me start with paragraph 1, the last sentence.  I, too, thought that the phrase, “Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks,” was a little bit strong.  I think it has been an improvement to eliminate the confusing references to underlying inflation, and I would take it that our basic measure of inflation, when we say “inflation,” is PCE inflation measured from a year ago.  I’m looking at page 23 of the data sheets here, which has all our data on consumer prices.  This is what is presented to the Committee.  There are six charts here, with a lot of upward sloping charts in 2011, so I think it might be a little bit strong to say this.  I have a suggestion that I think more accurately will reflect your view, Mr. Chairman, which is that instead of using “Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year,” we could say “Inflation is expected to moderate as prices of energy and some commodities have declined.” The new first part of the very last sentence in paragraph 1 would be “Inflation is expected to moderate.”  It would mean that, indeed, we think headline inflation is going to come down.  Yes, it is kind of high right now if you look at these charts, but we think it is going to come down.  That very much reflects the staff view and the view that you expressed earlier in your comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard disagrees with the phrase "Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year" and suggests an alternative wording that he believes more accurately reflects the view of the committee.


Passage number 331.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Could I just explore that for just a second.  The only objection is that we also say in the next paragraph, “The Committee anticipates inflation will settle in coming quarters,” which is a little bit repetitive.  What about something like the earlier suggestion, “Inflation appears to be moderating;” is that better.  It’s more descriptive, rather than pure forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing different options for phrasing a statement about inflation, without expressing disagreement with any particular viewpoint.


Passage number 332.
 MR. BULLARD.  There are an awful lot of upward moving lines here.  It is true that these three-month averages show little blips down, but that might be a little bit of a thin reed to hang your hat on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is simply expressing his observation about the upward moving lines and questioning the reliability of the small downward blips.


Passage number 333.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So, it “appears”—what is your view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for the listener's opinion or perspective.


Passage number 334.
 MR. BULLARD.  “Appears to have moderated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. "Appears to have moderated" suggests that the subject has become less extreme or intense, but it does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 335.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “Inflation appears to be moderating.”  Does that help.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that inflation appears to be moderating without any conflicting statements or differing viewpoints.


Passage number 336.
 MR. BULLARD.  What is wrong with just “expected to moderate”.  I think that’s fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MR. BULLARD suggests that using "expected to moderate" is fine, indicating agreement with the statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 337.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  My critique of that is, I think it is very important that the first paragraph be a statement of what we see, not a view about our forecast or our expectations.  It should be a description of our view of reality.  When you say “is expected to,” then you are getting into something more forward-looking, and I am not in favor of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The speaker expresses disagreement with the idea of using language that suggests expectations or forecasts in the first paragraph. They believe it should solely describe their view of reality, without any forward-looking statements.


Passage number 338.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s see.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 339.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  One suggestion I would have is that the Committee actually specify exactly what inflation rates they had in mind when they say that inflation rates are moderating.  I think it is certainly true of the three-month frequency.  Maybe it is also true of the six-month frequency.  If the Committee has a particular frequency in mind, then you can make reference to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is suggesting that the Committee should specify the exact inflation rates they had in mind when they said that inflation rates are moderating. He is indicating that there may be differing frequencies at which inflation rates are moderating, and he suggests that the Committee should clarify which frequency they are referring to.


Passage number 340.
 MR. BULLARD.  I don’t mind the story that it is expected to moderate.  I just don’t want people to look at this picture and say, “Well, what is the Committee thinking.”  PCE inflation measured from a year ago is up close to 3 percent, and core inflation has also gone up quite a bit and is still on an upward slope.  Just say “is expected to moderate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing his concern about people misinterpreting the situation and not considering the current inflation levels.


Passage number 341.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s your proposal, and others can respond as we go around.  Please continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they would like to hear others' responses to the proposal and asking the person to continue.


Passage number 342.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple expression of gratitude from President Lacker.


Passage number 343.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Real growth has obviously been much weaker than we had hoped for, or that we view as desirable.  But as I said yesterday, I think the inflation outlook is central to our policy decision today.  A year ago inflation was running around 1 percent, and it looked as if it had the potential to continue falling.  That made it very attractive to provide more stimulus to aid the real economy, and if that also increased inflation, it was for the good.  I understand the rationale for intervention a year ago.  But now inflation is 2.9 percent year over year, and 2.1 percent over the last three months.  Core inflation is 2¼ percent over the last three months and the three months before that, and survey measures of inflation are ticking up.  I understand what is going on with TIPS yields, but it is a mixed picture on inflation expectations. As I said yesterday, the balance of evidence suggests to me that our asset purchases initiated last November contributed to the rise in inflation, but had little or no effect on real growth.  So my sense is that the alternatives—A or B—to the extent that they have material economic effects, are going to push up inflation and do very little for economic growth.  And with inflation running above what everyone articulates as their preferred rate, I do not think we now want or need more monetary stimulus.  Accordingly, I support alternative C. I understand how raising inflation would reduce real rates and provide stimulus for the real economy.  But I do not believe we could publicly acknowledge allowing inflation to rise and still keep inflation expectations from rising even further from time to time after that.  I do not believe we would have an easy time reversing course and bringing inflation expectations down again without significant real costs.  Even if I was wrong about that, and we could easily raise and lower inflation, we would have set a precedent that would permanently limit the credibility of our commitment to price stability, because always in the back of a market participant’s mind would be the notion that in 2011 we raised inflation deliberately, and we could do it again.  That will affect our conduct and our ability to meet our objectives for years to come.  A strategy of tolerating a bit more inflation in an attempt to reduce unemployment bears, to me, more than a passing resemblance to the strategy pursued in the late 1960s and 1970s, and that was, obviously, such a dismal failure.  I found it disturbing to have heard this notion entertained.  I think it is agreed in hindsight that policymakers then placed excessive emphasis on unemployment, excessive blame on commodity price increases as opposed to their own policy errors, and excessive faith in the sluggishness of inflation expectations.  Now, some of you no doubt view there as being a substantive distinction between the strategies we pursued then and the notion of tolerating higher inflation, higher than it is now today.  I would love to understand it, because I don’t get the distinction at this point. I fully appreciate that unemployment has been painfully high for an excruciatingly long time period, and that high unemployment is associated with substantial losses in well-being for many Americans, relative to an alternative world in which we came into today’s meeting with a much lower unemployment rate.  I understand the compelling urge to do something, even if there are legitimate doubts about how much of an effect monetary stimulus can have at the zero bound, which is the circumstance we find ourselves in.  But if monetary stimulus is effective at the zero bound, what are those effects.  Are they real, or are they on inflation.  I don’t think there is any question that we should be more confident that monetary stimulus is going to affect inflation than it is going to affect real growth.  That comes from a reading of monetary economics going way back.  It is the effect on real growth and the non-neutralities of monetary policy that are the really hard things in macroeconomics and that have divided us and divided the profession from time to time.  I think inflation is one thing that we know monetary policy can affect if it affects anything. As I said, I support alternative C.  On the off-chance that the Committee gravitates to alternative B—[laughter]—I have a couple of observations to make.  First, about the inflation language, I agree with Vice Chairman Dudley that we should keep forward-looking statements out of paragraph 1, and that the movements we made to doing that are sound.  If we have something to say about what we expect inflation to do, let’s keep that grouped in paragraph 2 with everything else about the future.  “Appears to be moderating” is a welcome addition to that.  Under questioning, we can direct people to the three-month rate.  At this point, I don’t think we want to enshrine the three-month rate in the statement.  I’m a little hesitant to do that without thinking that through a little more. Halting our transition to a Treasury-only portfolio is a terrible idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing his own opinion and rationale for supporting alternative C and making suggestions for the inflation language in the statement, but there is no direct disagreement or debate with other perspectives.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 344.
  My head has stopped spinning right now, but— [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  It’s on fire.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. This is indicated by the use of the word "but" which suggests a contrast or disagreement between the speaker's statement that their head has stopped spinning and Mr. Plosser's response that it is on fire. The laughter also implies a sense of disagreement or contradiction.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 345.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  This takes us into the realm of fine-tuning sectoral spreads, and it begs questions.  What about small business lending.  What about municipals.  There are plenty of sectors where there is distress, urgency, and a need.  People are going to ask, “Well, you’re helping out the housing market, why aren’t you helping out our sector.”  That’s the reason we have stayed away from this stuff until the crisis, and we should keep on that track by getting out of the business of subsidizing housing.  This perpetuates this really corrosive political economy in our country of tapping government resources to subsidize the housing market.  I should think we would be a little averse to that, given the damage that caused in the last crisis. About President Bullard’s point on announcing $400 billion versus $45 billion, I think that is a cogent point.  I will make the observation here about quantitative easing.  We apparently are viewing, according to our Vice Chairman, quantitative easing as off the table because of the political backlash we got last year.  That’s my sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, disagrees with the idea of subsidizing the housing market and believes it perpetuates a corrosive political economy. He also expresses disagreement with the decision to view quantitative easing as off the table due to political backlash.


Passage number 346.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would say that’s too strong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not have any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states an opinion or viewpoint without any conflicting perspectives or contrasting ideas.


Passage number 347.
 MR. LACKER.  Too strong.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, simply expresses his opinion that something is "too strong."


Passage number 348.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Not off the table.  The bar is high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The phrase "Not off the table" indicates that something is being considered or is a possibility, while "The bar is high" suggests that certain standards or expectations need to be met. Both statements can coexist without contradicting each other.


Passage number 349.
 MR. LACKER.  The bar is high.  Right.  I have sour feelings about setting a higher bar.  We have had two instances of naked political intimidation in the last week, and I think we all gravitate toward the notion that we set policy the way we see it.  I’d like to believe that we do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses his personal feelings and beliefs but does not indicate any disagreement with others.


Passage number 350.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I was very clear yesterday that we have to set policy based on what we think is right.  But if the politics wreck the efficacy of the policy tools, then we have to take that into consideration as an environmental factor.  There is an important distinction between the two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing two separate factors to consider when setting policy: what they think is right and the impact of politics on the effectiveness of policy tools. They highlight that there is an important distinction between the two factors.


Passage number 351.
 MR. LACKER.  I wasn’t sure I quite understood the extent to which the political backlash would affect the efficacy of the policy without affecting our subsequent actions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty about the potential impact of a political backlash on the effectiveness of a policy.


Passage number 352.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If the policy caused people to think that LSAPs would lead to a big inflation problem or loss of confidence in the Fed’s credibility, the policy would be less effective, and so we might decide that the cost-benefit analysis is no longer favorable.  You’re not not pursuing the policy because of the political pressure, you’re not pursuing the policy because the political pressure is going to undermine how well the policy instrument works in practice.  That’s an important distinction, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply making a distinction between not pursuing a policy due to political pressure versus not pursuing it because the political pressure would undermine its effectiveness. There is no indication of any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 353.
 MR. LACKER.  Would that work through beliefs about our future actions or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any conflicting viewpoints or disagreement. It simply presents a question about the possibility of influencing future actions through beliefs.


Passage number 354.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think it can work through a whole variety of ways.  It could affect inflation expectations; it could affect our future credibility.  I think there are a lot of channels.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While there is a discussion of different possible effects, there is no direct contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 355.
 MR. LACKER.  Those both seem like our future actions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply stating his observation that the mentioned actions appear to be part of their future plans.


Passage number 356.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There was some evidence that the reaction affected market expectations of the continuation policy, and that reduced the stimulus impact.  Both internally and externally, assuming we do the maturity extension, I think we ought to note it has its own legitimate benefits.  In particular, it does not create massive additional excess reserves, which could create problems for our banking system.  Second—and I think the evidence already suggests this in terms of what we are seeing in markets—because it doesn’t increase high-powered money, it may have less effect on inflation expectations, which would be a positive from your perspective.  I think it has some legitimate benefits, even aside from these calculations.  Let me just assure everybody that we will do what we need to do, and political interference will not determine our policy actions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 357.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m glad to hear that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker expresses his gratitude towards the Chairman without expressing any opposing views or disagreements.


Passage number 358.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  If I might just say one word about the analytics between the 1970s and today.  There is, of course, one very important distinction, which is that we are at the zero lower bound in the liquidity trap.  You are familiar with the Krugman 1998 paper, which says in that particular case there may in fact be a permanent tradeoff—or at least a very long-lasting tradeoff—because only by increasing inflation expectations can you lower real rates at the zero bound.  I’m sure you know that literature.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging a distinction in the analytics between the 1970s and today, specifically regarding the zero lower bound in the liquidity trap. The mention of the Krugman 1998 paper is presented as a shared understanding.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 359.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is a privilege to follow my esteemed colleague from Richmond.  Here we provide the full range of options with just two commenters.  [Laughter] The economic outlook in the Tealbook clearly calls for action, and I would argue that the Tealbook outlook is on the optimistic side.  As I look at the pricing of Greek debt and credit default swaps, I wonder whether the baseline forecast should include a Greek default.  However, even with a more benign assessment of Europe, my forecast for both inflation and unemployment are consistent with significant action.  My preference for this meeting would be to do three things.  First, I would explicitly condition the forward guidance on economic outcomes, as President Evans has discussed recently, using language similar to what is in alternative A.  Second, I would reinvest principal payments of MBS back into MBS.  I strongly support that.  Third, I would do the Twist, but signal that should financial instability increase, or the economy deteriorate further, more-aggressive policy would be considered.  In particular, if conditions were to worsen, we should be considering targeting intermediate Treasury rates consistent with our conditional language and expanding our balance sheet.  While my preference is a combination of A and B, I can support alternative B with paragraph 3.  I do hope that the forward guidance based on the SEP is considered for our next meeting.  I actually agree with President Kocherlakota that it might be worthwhile considering whether using two years, rather than a calendar date, would be a more appropriate way of describing time. I normally don’t comment on language, but this time I feel I should.  In paragraph 1, I think the criteria should be that it’s factual and consistent.  If we use three-month inflation rates, we are, in effect, going to be describing commodity prices and oil prices.  That doesn’t seem to be what we are trying to convey.  For retrospective, I actually agree with President Evans that we should be using core or underlying inflation, so we don’t overweight temporary supply shocks.  Prospectively, we should be using total, because in the medium-term total and core are likely to be quite similar.  Going forward, we could come up with an agreement that if we are going to characterize it, then we characterize it consistently in that fashion.  In terms of paragraph 3 and 3′, this is a one-time program, as we discussed yesterday.  Talking about it in total makes much more sense than talking about it parsed in nine ways.  In particular, when I look at the language at the bottom of paragraph 3, “The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities transactions and the overall size of the maturity extension program,” I would not use that language.  I would go back to the August language that says, “The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.”  I don’t think that parsing an extension program into very small bits will be particularly effective.  That language implies that we might consider doing that, and I don’t think we should.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The author expresses disagreement with the baseline forecast and suggests adding a Greek default to the forecast. They also disagree with the language used in paragraph 1 and suggest using different criteria for describing inflation rates. Additionally, the author disagrees with the language used in paragraph 3 and suggests going back to the August language.


Passage number 360.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named President Fisher. There is no mention of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 361.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a polite phrase expressing gratitude and acknowledging President Lockhart.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 362.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I usually begin my policy round statement declaring support for one of the alternatives, and that is usually alternative B, which is appropriate for a member of the quiet middle.  Today, I am going to take a different approach.  Because I am a nonvoter at this meeting, I am going to give myself permission to put some arguments on the table for the sake of devil’s advocacy.  As I stressed in the economy round, I would argue that the ambiguity of the moment should give pause, pointing to a preference for alternative C at this meeting.  One might prefer alternative C not out of strong conviction that no action is called for, but out of preference for not acting quite yet.  The case for holding off is included in the broader Tealbook case for alternative C, which Bill English just recited.  I would add to that case, as devil’s advocate, that an approach that might have the most positive impact in jolting the economy out of its apparent torpor is a binary one.  By that I mean either do nothing or go all in, but avoid incremental half-measures. Let me present three reasons for holding our fire at this meeting.  First, the hard data and anecdotal reports suggest that the second half of the year will be better than the first half, even if not by a lot.  The staff Tealbook forecast assumes that an alternative B is required to generate this outcome.  I would argue that skepticism on this point is warranted.  Even conceding that the very modest rate effects assumed by the staff will be realized from an alternative B policy, marginally lower longer-term rates won’t stimulate much additional borrowing and business activity producing job growth.  Lower longer-term rates might stimulate some refinance activity by homeowners and commercial real estate owners, but short of some top-down program of comprehensive mortgage refinancing, the effect is likely to be marginal on real-side activity.  Second, while acknowledging the sentiment that the Tealbook benchmark implies an uncomfortably slow decline of the unemployment rate, one could be just as uncomfortable with the persistent upward drift in core inflation measures.  As the Tealbook shows in charts labeled “Evolution of the Staff Forecast” on page 31, misses giving rise to upward revisions in unemployment forecasts have been matched by misses in upward revisions of core inflation forecasts.  A benchmark forecast that has a fairly large drop in inflation premised on an unemployment rate projected to remain high, in my opinion, should be questioned.  A third argument for holding fire is to let a little time pass to gain perspective on the circumstances the Committee is facing.  Per this argument, sentiment is being weighed down by an unfortunate confluence of bad or troubling news that arrived in a very short span of time.  By that I mean benchmark revisions, the debt ceiling spectacle, the S&P ratings downgrade, Europe, the jobs report, Hurricane Irene, and inflation numbers. I would argue that, considering both the data and the reports from contacts, the economy is not presently on a slippery slope to recession.  This view argues for giving ourselves a little more distance from the events of late July and early August before concluding that the economic landscape has changed so fundamentally that the economy cannot achieve escape velocity without further action on our part. Turning to the action side of what they called a binary approach, I would argue this:  If there is no progress toward firmer economic growth, and there is actual deterioration and/or it becomes clear that the European issues or the fiscal mess in this country are likely to suppress economic activity going forward, stronger action than alternative B is needed, conditioned, of course, on no deterioration of the inflation outlook.  It may be the case that a sequence of incremental policy steps ultimately accumulates to a big step.  But if a jolt to the patient is what is needed, one big step may be preferable.  So going all in—the expression I used earlier—could resemble President Bullard’s proposal: an open-ended, quantitative easing commitment to be held in place until the Committee is satisfied that a sustainable recovery is firmly established or until we have to change course to meet our price stability mandate.  Again, I am presenting these arguments in a devil’s advocate vein, not in outright opposition to alternative B. Switching to angel’s advocacy, if that is a term, regarding alternative B, just a couple of comments.  First, I favor 3′ as being somewhat more flexible.  Second, I am sympathetic to the mortgage-backed securities reinvestment proposal.  I think it might make a difference.  If I could wave a magic wand once to help demand, it would be to lower all mortgage payments in the country.  Third, in response to President Bullard’s suggestion, I agree that there is something slightly wrong with the description of inflation in paragraph 1.  A simple fix would be to add the word “somewhat,” “inflation has moderated somewhat,” to try to capture a little bit of the ambiguity and slight disappointment we feel in the way inflation has evolved during the year.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes - there is disagreement within the passage. The speaker presents arguments for holding off on taking action (alternative C) and also presents arguments for taking stronger action (going all in). This shows a disagreement or contention in the speaker's viewpoint on what the appropriate course of action should be.


Passage number 363.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreeing statements. It consists of a simple expression of gratitude by President Kocherlakota.


Passage number 364.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You said conditional on B, you thought inflation would be what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a statement or belief made by someone.


Passage number 365.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think it is going to average slightly above 2 percent over the next two years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their belief or prediction that the average inflation rate will be slightly above 2 percent over the next two years.


Passage number 366.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think there has been a miscommunication that I do need to address—just a couple of preliminary points.  There is a pretty broad agreement that we are flexible inflation targeters, and President Bullard and others have made that acknowledgement.  That is the only one that is consistent with the dual mandate so that means that we are looking at medium-term inflation and allowing for some flexibility in the short run. Just a comment on the Taylor rule, which is on current variables, so a worsening in the outlook associated with financial distress would not appear in any way in that kind of model. But let me address the thing that you have said a number of times, and I really don’t understand.  It’s true that I have said in a number of speeches that our target is 2 percent or a bit less, by which I mean that if you look at the SEP, it reports that the central tendency of our Committee is 1.7 to 2.0 percent.  What I’m saying, basically, is that the target is 1.85, let’s say.  What I have never said—and I don’t think anybody around this table has ever said—is that we will not tolerate inflation above 2 percent.  That is a very different proposition.  Under a flexible inflation-targeting regime, with quadratic preferences or whatever weights you want to put in it, depending on the state of unemployment, there would be times when you would tolerate inflation a bit above the target.  In particular, there is no inconsistency with having inflation a bit above 2 percent and having a π* that is 1.85 percent.  I understand that you have concerns, and you have every right to disagree.  But on that one point, I really don’t think that that is correct.  The ECB has a somewhat different kind of approach where they seem to have a ceiling.  But we have never expressed a ceiling approach to inflation.  Rather, we have a target around which there is going to be some random variation and policy variation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is clarifying their position on inflation targeting and addressing potential misunderstandings.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 367.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman, I think that this underscores the challenges of communicating with the public on this point.  I think that the public perception of our framework is closer to the idea that we will not tolerate 2 percent.  It would be very helpful to clarify—exactly as you have now with me—what our inflation target means and what it does not mean.  In my view, the reactions to President Evans’ recent remarks show that there is a sense in the general public and in the media that our medium-term targets really translate into something we have to meet on a year-by-year basis. Those of us that are involved in the idea of monitoring cost recovery for the product office might be familiar with this example:  In the product office, they are supposed to recover costs over a 10-year horizon.  The way we implement that is by watching them closely on an annual basis to make sure they are doing cost recovery.  With that, I think it will be very helpful—certainly for my own thinking about policy—for the general public to hear exactly this clear explanation you just gave to me about what the framework is.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Mr. Kocherlakota expresses disagreement with the public perception and media's understanding of the Federal Reserve's inflation target and argues for the need to clarify it.

 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.   Let’s turn now to President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple transition to a new topic about President Pianalto. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 371.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This is a difficult decision in a highly uncertain economic environment, but today I support alternative B.  Over the last several months the incoming data have made it clear to me that the slowing of the pace of the recovery has persistence.  It isn’t just a temporary response to supply disruptions and high commodity prices.  In addition, the incoming data have significantly increased the downside risk to growth.  While it is extremely difficult to forecast recessions, I think the deterioration in consumer and business sentiment and in the international economic conditions have left us on the cusp of a recession.  I still project that the economy will avoid a downturn this year, but I think that a little extra accommodation would help lower the risk of a downturn. My primary concern about providing more accommodation is the inflation risk.  As I mentioned in yesterday’s economic go-round, I think it is most likely that inflation will be at or below the rate consistent with price stability in the medium term, but with core inflation measures coming in higher than expected for several months now, including in August, there is a risk of underestimating underlying price pressures.  In judging the inflation risks, I do take some comfort from the stability of various measures of inflation expectations at rates that are consistent with price stability.  I think this leaves us room to adjust policy in response to the increased risk of recession, but because the margin for error on the inflation outlook is not large, I would prefer that the maturity extension program be structured at a monthly pace as described in the language in alternative B(3′).  This approach would give us more flexibility to alter the program if underlying inflation does not moderate. I prefer to continue to reinvest maturing agency debt and MBS into Treasuries.  We told the public that we wanted to return our portfolio to a Treasury-only portfolio.  If we decide that this is an appropriate way to go, I would rather wait to do this at our November meeting because that is a meeting where you will have a press conference.  It will give you an opportunity to talk about the change in our reinvestment strategy. I also hope that at our November meeting we will be able to incorporate into our statement some of the elements of an enhanced communications strategy that we discussed yesterday.  I would especially support including language along the lines of paragraph 2 in alternative A.  I would leave the language in that the Committee discussed the range of policy tools.  We announced that we changed this meeting to a two-day meeting in order to provide us time to discuss our alternative policy tools.  And finally, in paragraph 1, I do prefer changing the language around the inflation situation to “inflation appears to be moderating.”  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Pianalto, is expressing her own opinion and explaining her decision to support alternative B. She discusses the uncertain economic environment, the slowing of the recovery, the increased downside risk to growth, and the risk of underestimating underlying price pressures. However, she also mentions some of her preferences and suggestions for the policy, such as structuring the maturity extension program at a monthly pace and waiting until the November meeting to change the reinvestment strategy. Overall, there is no clear disagreement or argument presented in this passage.


Passage number 372.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Evans.

Passage number 373.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  First Vice President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement indicated in this passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from someone named George to an unknown recipient.


Passage number 374.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy appears to have lost some momentum in recent months, and labor market conditions certainly are weak.  Furthermore, the downside risks to the growth outlook are considerable and have increased, especially with respect to the situation in Europe.  Yet price pressures are broad-based, and inflation has been above 2 percent recently.   Regarding the policy options, my views are influenced by three factors.  First, I do see the recovery as continuing, although at a lower level over the near term.  Second, inflation is currently elevated and does not appear to be influenced solely by temporary factors.  Third, current policy remains highly accommodative.  Based on these factors, adopting additional accommodation at this time seems somewhat premature, although I do prefer that we keep the tools discussed under alternatives A and B on the table as we go forward.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. George presents her views and factors that influence her decision without contradicting or disputing any other statements.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 376.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The economic outlook has deteriorated significantly since our August meeting and downside risks are looming ever larger.  I’ve become increasingly concerned that the economy is near stall speed and could easily slip into recession.  As I explained in the economic go-round, I see the modal outlook as decidedly worse than a year ago when we decided to adopt QE2.  In particular, my outlook under current policy settings, like the Tealbook’s, is for unemployment to stay horrifically high for years while inflation over the next two years declines below mandate-consistent levels.  I can’t see how such a forecast can be consistent with optimal policy under an inflation-targeting strategy if we interpret that as a forward-looking approach in which we choose policy to minimize a loss function, including deviations of inflation from target and deviations of unemployment from its long-run equilibrium level.  In addition, we face downside risks that are exceptionally large at a time when policy is constrained by the zero bound.  Therefore, I strongly support taking actions at this meeting to foster a stronger recovery, assuming they pass a cost-benefit test. In my judgment, the maturity extension program, even though it is obviously not a panacea, is a cost-effective tool for providing some additional monetary accommodation.  I support Vice Chairman Dudley’s suggestion that we roll over maturing MBS principal back into MBS rather than into Treasuries.  I agree with the arguments he and others made for this strategy.  Reducing the spread of MBS yields over Treasuries will have greater bang for the buck and would avoid a reduction in market liquidity that could result from our increasing dominance in the long end of the Treasury market. Regarding specific language, I would prefer the first variant of paragraph B(3) because conveying our intent to complete the full program seems likely to provide the greatest extent of stimulus and would be consistent with our communications about the previous round of longer-term Treasury purchases.  That said, I see good reasons for engaging in regular reviews of this program over coming months.  In particular, if the strains in European financial markets intensify much further, it’s quite plausible and perhaps likely that safe-haven flows would flatten the Treasury yield curve to the point where there might be little or no benefits to proceeding with our maturity transformation program.  In light of such considerations, I’d be willing to support the second variant of paragraph B(3) if that language seems preferable to other members.  Finally, I strongly support the bracketed language in paragraph B to underscore that the Committee is prepared to employ additional policy tools as appropriate.  Indeed, as I noted yesterday, I believe that communications may be the most powerful tool that’s still in our toolbox.  I continue to see advantages to the approach in alternative A, but this is something we need to give further consideration to in the context of the larger discussion of our monetary policy framework in November.  I also strongly agree that we need to consider out-of-the-box or blue-sky approaches should things deteriorate further, and that it’s important to develop those tools now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Yellen supports alternative B, while also mentioning advantages to the approach in alternative A. She also suggests considering "out-of-the-box" or "blue-sky" approaches if the situation worsens further. This indicates differing opinions on the best course of action.


Passage number 377.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No (Insufficient information)


Passage number 378.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to particularly thank you for noting yesterday that I have learned to use the lingo of the FOMC, but I’m not yet able to plug my assumptions into a Taylor rule so I’m going to have to make up for that by expressing myself in terms of munitions metaphors. When I look at the forecast, and particularly the inflation forecast, I could support alternative C.  I’m concerned about the trajectory of the revisions to inflation and am mindful of the comments that President Kocherlakota has been making.  But going back to the framework that I used in making business decisions, I also got used to asking:  What is the worst possible outcome that could occur as a result of taking an action, and if that happened, would we be in a position to deal with it.  When I looked at the estimate of the inflation effect in the forecast under the baseline and all the alternative simulations, only the “Greater Supply-Side Damage with Higher Inflation Expectations” scenario breached 2 percent on total or core PCE, and that one peaked out at 2.6 percent, which didn’t seem like an awful outcome.  Further, if the forecast and the estimates of inflation that would be generated by this action were wrong and we did, indeed, get more inflation than we expect, I think we know what to do about it.  It might be difficult to decide to do that, but we do know what to do about it.  And at that point, we would also know that this balance sheet gun is truly out of bullets and that we wouldn’t be able to use it anymore. As to the “keeping the powder dry” philosophy, I will admit that the experience of the last few years has made me more inclined to go ahead and shoot now.  But even if I were inclined toward keeping powder dry, I’m not sure that this is the specific dry powder that would be helpful in a financial crisis that was precipitated by a European crisis.  In that case, our balance sheet would be likely to grow again as a result of liquidity-providing actions, and I don’t think this would necessarily be the tool we would choose in that circumstance.  However, if we’re going to take this action, it’s important to get the maximum effectiveness out of it.  For this reason, I support the first paragraph 3 rather than 3′.  We get the full stock effect immediately, and the reduction of uncertainty offsets the loss of flexibility.  Second, it’s important to aim precisely, and I support the reinvestment in mortgage-backed securities as a way to make this action, if only marginally, more effective in the housing market where I think the weakness is a significant impediment to recovery.  Finally, President Bullard said that the Committee would not announce a series of interest rate moves in advance and that that is what the first characterization of paragraph 3 is, but that’s exactly what we discussed yesterday in terms of the forward guidance—announcing a series of actions in advance.  Again, I think 3 is more powerful.  In paragraph 6, I have some discomfort with the bracketed language because it seems to leave us in the position of reloading, and I’m not sure exactly what sort of actions might be expected as a result of that language.  Given my strong concerns about reducing the IOER, I would be really uncomfortable about setting up expectations for additional action that I’m not sure that we would be able to meet.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Duke is expressing her thoughts and opinions on the forecast and the potential actions the Committee could take.


Passage number 379.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards Governor Tarullo.


Passage number 380.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given that I have for some time believed that there was no real momentum in the economy or, more precisely, that the momentum that existed was provided only by fiscal and/or monetary stimulus measures at their peak of impact, I do believe we are still in a position where we need further stimulus.  Like many people around the table, I would prefer that we had more of a structure within which we could provide that stimulus as appropriate, both timing and quantity.  We don’t right now, and certainly with respect to the communications options, it’s going to take some time to develop it whether, as Charlie Evans suggests, through public preparation before a move or through some change in the economic projections.  In light of that, I would support alternative B.  The maturity extension is, for the reasons many of you detailed yesterday, a program of limited efficacy, but as I suggested yesterday as well, the very limitations are, in some sense, appropriate given that we don’t have a broader structure, and I don’t think anybody is going to misunderstand this as the first step in some broader program. On inflation, it is surely the case that inflation has been higher than many, if not most, of the people around this table expected.  On that, I would say two things.  One, I find the staff’s explanation as to why the factors pushing up inflation are temporary more compelling than the explanation of factors as to why the relatively weak performance of the economy is temporary.  And two, as many of you, most recently Janet, have suggested, if we’re not willing to contemplate any increase in the potential inflation rate, even over a short term, notwithstanding a path toward the long-term rate, then it doesn’t seem that we have a flexible inflation-targeting strategy anymore.  We have a hard target, and I have never understood that to be the framework under which this Committee functioned. With respect to specifics, I’m sure whatever language those of you with an intense interest in the inflation language come up with will be fine with me.  For the reasons Betsy stated, I also would favor paragraph 3 rather than 3′, but if there were a strong view among others for 3′, I would not oppose it.  Given what I said earlier, I am for the MBS rollover as well.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The main focus of this passage is on the author's beliefs and preferences regarding economic stimulus and inflation targeting. There is no direct contention or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 381.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is simply thanking Governor Raskin and does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 382.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Persistent weakness in labor markets, accompanied by the significant risk that sustained high unemployment could push up the structural unemployment rate in the longer term, suggests to me that continued accommodation is warranted.  However, in order to make a notable difference to the economy, a sizable action is needed in my view, well beyond the Twist described in alternative B.  While I agree with the qualitative features of this plan—removing duration risk from the market without increasing the size of the balance sheet—it is unlikely that the magnitude we are considering by itself will deliver an impulse sufficient to get the economy out of the doldrums.  The largest boost to economic growth I’ve seen for this action is ½ percentage point, and even this modest number may end up being too high.  At a 10-year yield of 2 percent, much of the impact on longer-term interest rates is now probably discounted, and while it’s still early, I would be surprised if this move alone would have a significant positive impact on the economy.  Nonetheless, at this juncture I think we need to do all we can to raise mean expectations of growth.  From this perspective, I note that Committee participants with the help of staff have brought forward very interesting variations in the tools we have, and I believe that these variations could be useful in nudging the economy to greater growth. Before briefly commenting on certain specific portions of alternative B, I want to say that contingency plans are important.  We should do contingency planning.  But we also have to do what we can to keep these contingencies from hurting us now, by creating the conditions now for stronger economic growth by inoculating, so to speak, the economy or partially insuring it from the impact of greater harm later on.  For example, if the situation worsens in Europe and dollars become more of a safe haven leading to appreciation, clearly we would see our net exports declining, and, all else being equal, we would be led to weaker economic growth, which brings us back to where we are now and the ultimate challenges that we are looking at.  Obviously I’m discounting here the effect of greater financial disruption.  But I do want to make sure that we don’t use the necessary steps regarding contingency planning as just a way of kicking the can down the road in terms of what we can be doing now.  In terms of that, I am heartened by a lot of the different suggestions that have been made.  I think that Narayana’s suggestion about moving from a date certain to duration has particular virtues in these times.  It would be something, too, that would not require us to change language with the rapidity that we currently do, and that suggestion has potential. In terms of 3′ versus 3, I’m sensitive to Jim’s concern regarding stimulus fatigue.  Most of us remember that one reaction to QE2 was the fixation on the total program size, the notion that what was done in QE2 was government spending of a magnificent magnitude.  If we’re of the view that this level of analytical understanding in the public hasn’t changed much, we may want to consider repositioning how we as individuals communicate this and how our press people present it.  On the reference to housing in paragraph 4, I want to just remind us all that it is the failure of the housing market to bounce back that is a significant factor in holding back economic growth.  While it may not be time to do this now, I would favor the slight enhancement in mortgage market conditions that is implied by paragraph 4 in alternative B.  I don’t think that there is really something to watch here or that we need to wait in terms of understanding what’s going on in the housing market.  But I do feel sensitive to the concerns that we may want to analyze more closely the effect regarding credit allocation and the real improvement that would come through such action.  I want to say something about paragraph 6 and the bracketed language regarding the fact that “the Committee discussed the range of policy tools available to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price stability” and note in deciding whether to include that language that it does appear to be the truth.  [Laughter]  Finally, I close by saying that in terms of the inflation language, I am moved by the current structure that paragraph 1 continues to be where things are now, and that we put in paragraph 2 the Committee’s views regarding what will happen to what we are seeing.  I would be fine adding the language “appearing to moderate.”  Thank you.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 384.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, a couple of observations on the Taylor rule.  I’ve never liked it, and I particularly don’t like it in the current set of circumstances.  The reason I don’t like it in the current set of circumstances is that I think that it doesn’t really work well because we know that the equilibrium real rate of interest is not anything close to 2 percent, which is assumed in the rule.  We could actually solve backwards.  We’ve seen the economy perform very, very poorly despite what’s supposedly a very stimulative monetary policy.  Well, why is that.  Because the monetary policy hasn’t been as stimulative as we thought, and that underscores one fundamental flaw of relying on the Taylor rule as your guide to policy. A second problem with the Taylor rule is that we have an economic situation where the losses are very asymmetric.  If we turn out weaker than we want or expect, there’s a really good chance we’re going to end up in a debt deflation, Japanese-style trap and we’re not going to be able to get out.  The losses on that side are very high relative to the losses if things turn out to be a little bit better than we expect, and if we get a little bit more inflation than we expect.  In that environment, even if we thought that the Taylor rule was the right formulation, we should be following a policy easier than the Taylor rule because of this asymmetric loss function.  That’s about the big picture stuff.  Let’s get down to the statement. First of all, I’m a little bit worried that the markets are going to take what we do today as us being done.  In other words, we’re doing the maturity extension program because the bar is too high to do an LSAP, and so that’s it.  We want to lean against that expectation.  In alternative B, paragraph 6, rather than have the phrase “employ its tools as appropriate,” I would prefer to strengthen that a little bit to say “to employ the full range of its tools as appropriate.”  Keep it open ended, indicating that we could do more should things continue to go badly, which they very well might over the next six weeks.  The second point is on paragraph 4.  I do favor investing MBS into MBS.  But I would flip the sentence order in paragraph 4.  I would put the new policy action, “To help support conditions in the mortgage market, the Committee will now reinvest…” and then I would follow with the second sentence, “The Committee will maintain its existing policy...”  This would give a little bit more prominence to the new policy action rather than the thing that you’re maintaining.  In terms of 3′ versus 3, I have quite a bit of sympathy with what President Bullard has been saying on this, but I don’t think it works in this particular case of the maturity extension program because you can do less, but you can’t do more.  You’re limited at $400 billion by the nature of the constraints on our balance sheet.  If we were ever to do an LSAP, I would be inclined to do 3′ because there is some value to having something that you can stop earlier or you can keep going.  But in the case of the maturity extension program, there is no option to keep going beyond nine months.  So I think that 3′ is actually weaker than 3, and I do not support it in this particular set of circumstances. In terms of alt A, I would prefer to have more information that we could share with people about our reaction function.  I don’t think the date is really sufficient, but yesterday’s conversation made it very clear there was no consensus on how exactly to do that.  We should look at the SEP and try to discover what our ranges of views are on this subject, both in terms of what triggers would be interesting to us and whether any broad consensus would come out of those numbers.  We may find that there’s no consensus and that this is a blind alley, but if there’s a reasonable consensus, then maybe the SEP is something that can support this going forward. And finally, I absolutely favor contingency planning in this environment.  This is about as dark as the Committee has been regarding the downside risks that I can remember since maybe the dark days of the fall of 2008.  The European situation, in particular, looms very large.  We absolutely have to have contingency planning not just about our monetary policy stance, but also about what liquidity facilities we would deploy and in what manner.  In other words, what’s our program escalation should things go in the wrong direction for market functioning.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses disagreement with the use of the Taylor rule in the current circumstances and argues for a policy that is easier than the Taylor rule. They also propose changes to the statement and express concern about the markets' interpretation of the actions being taken.


Passage number 385.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much, and thanks, everyone, for comments.  Arthur Burns once wrote a speech called “The Anguish of Central Banking.”  I can really relate to that.  [Laughter]  Many of you are taking strong positions for debating purposes, but I am sure all of you are introspective and appreciate how very important these decisions are and how difficult they are given how little we know and given the wide range of complex economic and political forces—and even natural forces from hurricanes to earthquakes—that are at play as we think about this.  These are very, very difficult decisions, and I appreciate everyone’s serious consideration. I was very pleased that we made a good start on contingency planning.  What it tells me, though, is that as difficult as the decisions are today, they conceivably could get a lot more difficult.  For example, there are scenarios where deflation risk increases, and we look at LSAPs and have to figure out how we would manage that.  There are scenarios where we would want to change our framework.  I suspect that, barring a major change in the outlook in the next few weeks, it’s going to take us a bit of time to fully work through all of those options.  I am, therefore, not sure what the next steps are likely to be and how quickly they will come. That fact that it’s difficult to judge how quickly and how aggressively we’ll be able to move in the future is a consideration for me because I do think that the recovery is in some danger.  Recession risks are increased.  Financial volatility and financial stress are very important headwinds.  At the same time, while acknowledging that inflation hasn’t fallen as quickly as we expected, all the fundamentals suggest that, as best as we can tell—and of course, our forecasting is not particularly good—most of the pressures are toward stabilization or decline in inflation.  Given that, I feel that we need some kind of bridge from now until the time when we either face some even more dangerous situation or choose to make fundamental changes in our framework or communication.  For that reason, taking into account the very good arguments made—I was going to say on both sides, but there are probably about five or six different sides here [laughter]—I would propose to recommend alternative B to the Committee today.  The idea is that we will provide some support for the economy and some reassurance that the Fed continues to be there.  Clearly, it’s not a panacea, as a number of people have pointed out, but I do think of it as a bridge toward whatever future action this Committee may find to be appropriate. I favor the reinvestment into MBS.  I note for those concerned about this reinvestment that all this does is maintain our current level of MBS.  It doesn’t increase either our balance sheet size or our holdings of MBS.  It has the advantage, first of all, of focusing on a troubled sector—the housing sector.  But we also talked a lot about market functioning the last two days, and by reducing the purchases of longer-term Treasuries, we’ll actually reduce some of the pressures in the market functioning in the Treasury market.  I think that’s constructive.  That’s my recommendation.  I do want to reiterate what I said before about maturity extension.  It is a different policy from the LSAP.  It is not as powerful, and it is, of course, not repeatable, but its advantages include having fewer implications for excess reserves, for the size of the balance sheet, for our exit, and for inflation expectations.  In those respects, it’s a policy worth considering. In terms of the language, in the first paragraph we’ve had two suggestions on inflation.  One is “inflation has moderated somewhat since earlier in the year.”  The other is “inflation appears to be moderating.”  I don’t feel strongly about that.  Does anyone have a comment.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of an individual expressing their own views and recommendations, with no opposing arguments or conflicting opinions presented.


Passage number 386.
 MR. LACKER.  Would “appears to have moderated” be more consistent with Dudley’s dictum regarding the first paragraph.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply asks whether the phrase "appears to have moderated" is more consistent with Dudley's dictum regarding the first paragraph.


Passage number 387.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s fine with me.  Is that okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both phrases express agreement and acceptance of the situation.


Passage number 388.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That’s fine with me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "That's fine with me" indicates agreement and a lack of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 389.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the fact that President Plosser exists. It does not provide any information about any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 390.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Just an observation.  In some respects, the moderation of fuel and energy prices is what’s really driving the moderation of overall inflation at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement by Mr. Plosser is an observation about the moderation of fuel and energy prices driving the moderation of overall inflation. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage.


Passage number 391.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  And that’s what it says in the sentence here, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply suggests that the sentence being referred to aligns with the previous statement.


Passage number 392.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Fuel and energy prices have moderated, period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Fuel and energy prices have moderated, period" is a straightforward statement of fact without any contradiction or dissenting opinions.


Passage number 393.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right, but we count those.  “Appears to have moderated,” is that fine.  All right.  Any objection.  Okay.  “Inflation appears to have moderated.” I’m going to come back to 3 versus 3′ because I would like to hear the Committee’s view on that decision.  First, on paragraph 4, does anyone have a reaction to the Vice Chairman’s suggestion of reordering those two sentences.  Any particular concerns.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker asks for objections or concerns, but none are expressed.


Passage number 394.
 MS. YELLEN.  Good idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The use of the phrase "Good idea" suggests agreement and lack of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 395.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If we did that, it would be, “to help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest . . . in agency mortgage-backed securities.  In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.”  Have you got that. I have a compromise suggestion on paragraph 6.  On the one hand, as Governor Raskin very appropriately pointed out, we did discuss the range of policy tools.  The statement should correlate to some extent with the events of the meeting.  On the other hand, I think that “the full range of its tools” is a little aggressive.  I would propose that, as a number of people have suggested, we go back to the language of August, which is identical to this without the brackets.  “Discussed the range of policy tools” is a reasonable step.  I don’t think it promises any additional action in the near term.  Is that okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests a compromise by proposing to go back to the language of August, while stating that they believe "the full range of its tools" is too aggressive. This indicates a difference in opinion on the appropriate level of action to be taken.


Passage number 396.
 MS. DUKE.  “These” rather than “its.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 397.
” MR. ENGLISH.  Yes, change “these” to “its” to make it work with the brackets.  You could go back to “these” if you want to use exactly the language in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English is suggesting a modification to make the language in the brackets align with the usage of "its" instead of "these." He also provides an alternative option to retain the original language if desired.


Passage number 398.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let’s make “these” into “its.”  In other words, let’s just take paragraph 6 as it stands without the brackets, which is essentially the August language. Now the somewhat substantive decision is 3 versus 3′, and we will come back to a couple of issues there in a minute.  Paragraph 3 gives the full amount, but it does note that there will be review of the program in light of incoming information.  Paragraph 3′, which is more along the lines that President Bullard has advocated, gives a monthly rate.  Perhaps it’s a bit more contingent.  We will have the same last sentence in either case, which will be some kind of regular review.  I’d be inclined to take a straw poll on this decision unless there’s anyone who wants to make a comment.  Anyone.  [No response]  How many are in favor of 3, which gives the $400 billion total number.  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.  How many are in favor of 3′.  [Show of hands]  One, two, three, four, five, six.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting two options and asking for a vote to determine which option the group prefers.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 399.
 MR. TARULLO.  Some of these people are voting against alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The statement "Some of these people are voting against alternative B" indicates that there is disagreement or opposition among the group of people mentioned regarding the option B being voted on.


Passage number 400.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: passage?


Passage number 401.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It should be a vote for B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 405.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s all right.  Your wisdom is still welcome even if you don’t agree with all of what we’re doing here.  [Laughter]  Did we have seven to six.  I see a mild majority for 3. Finally, but in order to maintain the review aspect, President Rosengren, you wanted to change the last sentence there, “regular review”  back to what was in August.  Is that right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 406.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren is simply affirming that the statement made by someone else is correct.


Passage number 407.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The last sentence of paragraph 3 now says, “The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities transactions and the overall size of the maturity extension program in light of incoming information.”  What we had in August was, “The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate,” a simpler statement.  Any preferences.  Jim, do you have a preference.  Narayana.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply describes a change in language used by the Committee and asks for a personal preference from Jim.

Passage number 415.
  [Laughter] MR. ENGLISH.  It’s going to be “Operation Twist” no matter what you say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states that regardless of the speaker's opinion or input, the operation is going to be called "Operation Twist."


Passage number 416.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I understand that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of "[Laughter]" suggests a light-hearted or humorous tone, but it does not indicate any disagreement or contention between the speaker and the audience.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states a phrase without any conflicting opinions or opposing arguments.


Passage number 418.
”  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We should have done statement A, which has both the MEP and the communications, so that we could have “Twist and Shout.”  [Laughter]  Never mind.  It wasn’t my idea.  Further comments.   In a moment we’ll take a vote.  Let me say that at the end of the vote, Brian, you’re going to talk just a little bit about implementation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of lighthearted remarks and the speaker expressing their opinion and plans for the future.


Passage number 419.

Passage number 423.
 MS. DANKER.  We’ll see.  I’m starting with alternative B that was handed out.  The first paragraph is the way it was except the second-to-last sentence starts, “Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year,” and then continues as it was. Paragraph 2, unchanged. Paragraph 3—we’re keeping paragraph 3, dropping paragraph 3′, and the final sentence of paragraph 3 is being removed and replaced with the analogous sentence from the August statement that starts, “The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings,” and so on. Then paragraph 4 will begin with the sentence that starts, “To help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.”  Then, “In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auctions.” Paragraph 5 stands as is, and paragraph 6 stands as is minus the brackets.

Passage number 429.
 MR. SACK.5  I will offer a brief description of how the Desk plans to implement the Committee’s decisions regarding the SOMA portfolio. Following recent practices, the Desk intends to release a statement with operational details on these initiatives at the same time as the release of the FOMC statement.  A draft of the Desk statement is provided in the handout for your reference. Let me begin with the $400 billion maturity extension program. The Desk plans to distribute the purchases from this program across five sectors based on the approximate weights shown in the table contained in the statement.  This distribution has been designed to extend the average maturity of the SOMA portfolio.  For that reason, it allocates a much larger share of the purchases to longer maturities, including those beyond 10 years, than in previous asset purchase programs.  Of course, this distribution could be altered if market conditions warrant. In terms of selling assets, the Desk plans to conduct regular operations to sell Treasury securities with remaining maturities of three months to three years.  Securities with less than three months to maturity will not be sold to provide the markets and the Treasury with greater certainty about the maturity profile of SOMA holdings.  These operations will be structured to receive bids across a range of securities and to accept them based on their attractiveness to market prices.  We will be selling roughly three quarters of the SOMA holdings in the eligible maturity range. At this point, the Desk anticipates conducting 14 purchase operations and 6 sale operations per month.  A schedule of both purchase and sale operations to be conducted over the following calendar month will be released on or around the last business day of each month.  A schedule of operations expected to take place in October will be released on Friday, September 30. Let me now turn to the agency MBS reinvestment program. Principal payments from holdings of agency debt and agency MBS will be reinvested in agency MBS through purchases conducted in the secondary market.  Based on current projections, the Desk anticipates that reinvestments will total about $200 billion by the end of June, thus resulting in an average monthly pace of purchases of $20 to $25 billion over that period.  However, I should note that the prepayment rate on the MBS portfolio is quite uncertain in the current environment, and hence the actual pace of purchases could deviate meaningfully from our projection.  5 The materials used by Mr. Sack are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). The Desk intends to conduct these purchases internally, rather than relying on an external investment manager.  Recall that we had established this capability by the end of the earlier asset purchase program.  We would expect to be active on most trading days, and purchase operations would be conducted through a competitive bidding process over an external trading platform.  We will continue to rely on external firms for middle-office support and custodial services. In terms of other operational details, we anticipate that the purchases will be concentrated in newly issued agency MBS, as these securities have greater liquidity and are more closely tied to primary mortgage rates, although the Desk may purchase other agency MBS if market conditions warrant.  We also would like the flexibility to use dollar roll transactions to facilitate the settlement of our transactions.  The settlement conventions for agency MBS and dollar rolls mean that the SOMA balance may fluctuate around $2.6 trillion. Purchases of MBS securities will begin on October 3, 2011, and the current practice of reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in Treasury securities will be halted at that point.  The Desk will continue to publish on the eighth business day of each month the planned amount of reinvestment purchases for the next month, but we will no longer be including a calendar for the reinvestment operations since we will be purchasing on most trading days in the secondary market.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing a description of how the Desk plans to implement the Committee's decisions regarding the SOMA portfolio.


Passage number 430.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any questions for Brian.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude and invites questions for Brian. The mention of "President Lacker" does not provide enough context to determine if it introduces any disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 431.
 MR. LACKER.  This is a question more generally about what conversations we’ve had with the U.S. Treasury and what we’ve gleaned from those about their debt management.  Are they going to react.  Do they pledge not to offset us.  What do we know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking about conversations and information regarding the U.S. Treasury's debt management and potential reactions or pledges. This suggests that there may be differences or conflicting views about the Treasury's actions or intentions.


Passage number 432.
 MR. SACK.  We speak to Treasury regularly about debt management issues, and not surprisingly, we’ve been discussing that in the context of a maturity extension program in recent weeks.  My understanding is that Treasury has no intention of reacting to our program in terms of shifting its issuance any time soon into longer-term securities because we’re conducting the maturity extension program.  You should keep in mind, though, that they are on a course right now that is extending the average maturity of their debt, and they’ve been doing that for some time, consistent with the recommendation of their borrowing committee.  The weighted-average maturity of their debt will continue to extend, but that pace isn’t going to accelerate just because we’re doing the maturity extension program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and clarifying that the Treasury has no intention of reacting to their program by shifting their issuance into longer-term securities. They also mention that the Treasury is already on a course to extend the average maturity of their debt, which aligns with the recommendation of their borrowing committee.


Passage number 433.
 MR. LACKER.  They’re going to continue extending the maturity of what they issue while we’re trying to reduce the maturity of what’s in the hands of the public.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It states two separate actions happening simultaneously - the Fed extending the maturity of what they issue and the speaker desiring to reduce the maturity of what's in the hands of the public. These actions can coexist without necessarily implying disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 434.
 MR. SACK.  That’s right, but let me make a few more comments on that.  The additional maturity extension that’s going to be realized is already under way based on debt management decisions they’ve made to date, and my sense is that they’ve maybe reached the point at which they are ready to start to pull back from that objective.  Yes, we will continue to see a lengthening of the weighted-average maturity given past decisions, but I think we’ll see that lengthening begin to slow and at some point stabilize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, states that the lengthening of the weighted-average maturity will begin to slow and stabilize, suggesting a decrease in the extension. This contradicts the earlier statement that the additional maturity extension is already underway.


Passage number 435.
 MR. LACKER.  How does the magnitude of what you expect to be subsequent extension of the maturity of what’s in the hands of the public due to their issuance compare with what we’re doing with the maturity extension program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It simply states a question asking for a comparison between the expected extension of maturity of what is in the hands of the public and the maturity extension program.


Passage number 436.
 MR. SACK.  I believe the effects of the further extension that we expect would actually be larger than the effects of the maturity extension program that has been proposed today.  A few things to note.  One, that’s already priced into the market.  The weighted-average maturity of Treasury debt today is 62 months.  As far as we can tell, the market expectation is that that’s going to reach 70 months—another 8 months of extension—but we believe that’s fully expected and priced into the market.  Second, it doesn’t seem that Treasury is intent on purposefully pushing beyond what’s in the markets and, if anything, seems to be shifting perhaps in the other direction.  And, third, we can think of these effects as being in place and then think about the FOMC’s programs as trying to affect financial conditions around what would have been realized under Treasury’s path.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their own belief and providing reasons for it, but there is no opposing viewpoint presented or any disagreement with others.


Passage number 437.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That is what we did in the memo that was distributed to the Committee.  We built in assumptions about what Treasury was up to, and looked at our program at the margin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating what was done in the memo and how they analyzed their program.


Passage number 438.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  You’re telling me that there’s a fair amount of uncertainty about what they’re going to do. SEVERAL.  No.  Not really.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Both speakers seem to agree that there is uncertainty about what they're discussing.


Passage number 439.
 MR. LACKER.  Go to 70 or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply suggesting an option or asking a question without expressing any clear disagreement or argument.


Passage number 440.
 MR. SACK.  They’ve been clear that they will not be changing their strategy in response to our program.  There’s no ambiguity about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating that the other party has been clear in their position and there is no room for interpretation or ambiguity.


Passage number 441.
 MR. LACKER.  But you don’t know what their strategy is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply stating that he does not know the strategy of the people being referred to.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 442.
 MR. SACK.  Their strategy is that they realize the weighted-average maturity will continue to lengthen, but that they’re going to start, over time, to make adjustments that should cause that lengthening to slow and eventually to stop.  They have not given a precise number of what their weighted-average maturity target is.  I’m not sure if they have one at this point, and they’re engaged in a very active discussion of these issues with their own borrowing advisory committee.  I’m not sure.  I don’t think it’s precisely settled in their mind exactly where they want to end up, but it is my understanding that they do not want to continue to lengthen indefinitely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, is unsure about whether the Federal Reserve has a precise weighted-average maturity target and whether it has been settled in their mind where they want to end up. This suggests a lack of agreement or consensus on the matter within the Federal Reserve.


Passage number 443.
 MR. LACKER.  This contrasts notably with the first Operation Twist in which cooperation was fairly clear with the Treasury.  We understood what they were doing with their portfolio and what we were doing with ours.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 444.
 MR. FISHER.  But, Mr. Chairman, this is a very delicate issue, and I think you’re going to have to figure out if there’s a way to do it when you put out the Frequently Asked Questions on September 26.  There may have been virtues back in 1961 to doing it hand-in-glove.  There could also be drawbacks to being perceived as doing it hand-in-glove now.  You’re going to have to carefully vet this wherever you vet these things to make sure that we don’t look like we’re setting this up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing caution and suggesting that careful consideration should be taken in handling the issue, but there is no disagreement or contention present in the passage.


Passage number 445.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We have been very clear:  We don’t want to involve the Treasury in monetary policy decisions or monetary policy execution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that the Treasury should not be involved in monetary policy decisions or execution, and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 446.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, but I would address this in the Frequently Asked Questions that we provide.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher is simply stating that he would address a certain topic in the Frequently Asked Questions that they provide.


Passage number 447.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There was a Financial Times story, which I believe made the point that should the Federal Reserve undertake any kind of maturity extension program, the Treasury would not react to that.  That’s the appropriate thing we’ve asked them to do, and I’ve received assurances to that effect as well.  Any other questions.  [No response] First, let me note that we’ll have a special topic in January called “The Role of Financial Conditions in Economic Recovery: Lending and Leverage,” which was a very popular winner among the FOMC participants and certainly is a topical issue.  I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for agreeing to lead the preparations for that special topic.  The next meeting is another two-day meeting, fortunately, Tuesday and Wednesday, November 1–2.  Lunch is available, and for those who can stay, Linda Robertson will be providing a presentation.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information and updates.


Passage number 448.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Mr. Chairman, there was such a call for contingency planning that November seems, at least under certain circumstances, pretty far away.  Is there any thought in your mind as to how we can address that between meetings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any indication of contention or disagreement. It is a question asked in a neutral manner about how to address contingency planning between meetings.


Passage number 449.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You should help me, Bill.  My understanding is that we expect to get the framework memos out exceptionally early in the intermeeting period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a statement followed by an explanation.


Passage number 450.
 MR. ENGLISH.  We’re aiming to do so, but we wanted to do so this past intermeeting period, too.  Yes, we will try our hardest to get the material out in early October so that there will be plenty of time for people to think about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. English is simply explaining that they will try their best to release the material in early October to allow for sufficient time for people to review it.


Passage number 451.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If there are Reserve Bank contributions that would like to be made, please be in touch with Bill, and we’ll try to coordinate additional materials.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating that if there are any Reserve Bank contributions that need to be made, the reader should contact Bill to coordinate additional materials.


Passage number 452.
 MR. LOCKHART.  The process sounds like react to memos and circulate views and essentially do it all that way between now and November.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, is simply describing the process of reacting to memos and circulating views.


Passage number 453.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What else would you suggest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contentious or disagreeing statements. It simply asks for suggestions or additional ideas.


Passage number 454.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Well, we may be overtaken by events.  You never know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lockhart is simply expressing uncertainty about the future and the possibility of unexpected events occurring.


Passage number 455.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Are you proposing a videoconference or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking about the possibility of using a videoconference for an unspecified purpose.


Passage number 456.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Yes.  Something like a videoconference where we can have a spontaneous exchange of views as opposed to the formality of reacting to a memo and circulating that and then reacting to someone else’s reaction, and so forth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the idea of having a video conference for a more spontaneous exchange of views.


Passage number 457.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We’re certainly prepared to do that, either assuming we get early preparations or if the situation changes in a significant way.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that they are prepared to do something under certain conditions.


Passage number 458.
 MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman, to draw a distinction, I think you’ve been referring to more conventional monetary policy contingencies.  I believe that staff at the Board and the New York Fed have already been thinking about liquidity facility contingencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show contention or disagreement. The speaker is acknowledging the distinction between different types of monetary policy contingencies and expressing their belief that the staff at the Board and the New York Fed have already considered liquidity facility contingencies.


Passage number 459.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Oh, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given response "Oh, yes" does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 460.
 MS. YELLEN.  Is that what you were thinking of, liquidity and the like.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply asks a clarifying question.


Passage number 461.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I really wasn’t, in my mind, making a distinction.  I’m just noting there’s such a call, and November may be too late in some respects.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, is stating his personal perspective on a situation and expressing that he did not make a distinction. There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 462.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, on the purely financial stability side, we have an ongoing LISCC, an Office of Financial Stability, and other coordination occurring on an operational daily basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating that there is ongoing coordination in terms of financial stability. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 463.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Would it be inappropriate for the Board to have a meeting or a conference call so that we are filled in on what the Board staff is thinking in terms of the liquidity provisions and other things that might arise during such a time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward question about whether it would be appropriate for the Board to have a meeting or conference call to discuss the staff's thoughts on liquidity provisions and other potential issues.
