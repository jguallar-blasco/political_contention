{"2014FOMC20140129meeting.txt": [" MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you very much.  I don\u2019t have any objections to the first change, in terms of \u201creaffirms its judgment\u201d versus \u201cjudges.\u201d I\u2019m not sure the nuances there will be picked up by the marketplace, but, nonetheless, I\u2019m fine with that. Regarding the second change, though, there remains considerable uncertainty both in the marketplace and around this table about what we mean by true maximum employment and what it actually is.  And I think we struggle with understanding what it means and how it varies over time. I\u2019m concerned that, unfortunately, over time, the markets and the public have come to think of what we report in the SEP as somehow our target as opposed to some information about our assessment, despite what we\u2019ve said.  We had a discussion about this when we first launched this statement\u2014and maybe this is a topic for the Committee coming up\u2014but I\u2019d be inclined to try to drop the last two sentences of that paragraph altogether so that we don\u2019t find ourselves having to change the unemployment numbers every time the SEP changes.  We ought to thinkabout doing that\u2014at least dropping the last sentence even if we don\u2019t drop the second-to-last sentence.  So I\u2019d like to put that on the table as something for discussion and for consideration by this Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will again abstain from the vote on the adoption of this statement.  On the one hand, I continue to believe that it doesn\u2019t actually reflect a strong enough consensus among Committee members to permit a more effective communication of our policies to the public.  On the other hand, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s done any particular harm, and, particularly as interpreted and explained by the current Chairman\u2014and, I\u2019m quite confident, the future Chair\u2014I\u2019m very comfortable with those explanations. I do welcome the prospect of further discussion of the entire statement.  Some of you may recall that my original concerns a couple of years ago were focused on the absence of what I thought to be an explicit enough statement of our having a symmetrical loss function with respect to the two policy aims of the dual mandate set forth in the Federal Reserve Act, which is, after all, the source of this Committee\u2019s powers. I continue to have those concerns, although, more recently, I join Eric in having some concerns about the way in which the inflation number is actually understood\u2014whether it is understood as a target, properly stated, or as more of a ceiling.  I dare say that some members of the Committee would be distressed with a forecast that inflation would be 2.6 percent, 2.4 percent, and 2.3 percent, respectively, over the next several years.  But, as we sit here today, we have a forecast of inflation at 1.4 percent, 1.6 percent, and 1.7 percent, respectively, over the next three years\u2014that is to say, deviating on the downside by exactly the amounts hypothesized as upside deviations a moment ago.I want to be clear:  I pose this hypothetical not to argue for a specific policy response, but just to draw attention to what I think is at least a latent issue with respect to the stated goal of 2 percent inflation in the current statement. So when it comes time for Committee deliberation on this, I would be very interested in hearing an elaboration of not only the points that have already been made by some of our colleagues but also, I hope, the points that will be made by others of you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support further exercises.  As Governor Stein and I have been predicting for a few meetings, short of full implementation, we\u2019re always going to be left wanting to know some more about the effects of this.  I have some serious concerns about how we\u2019re going about this, though.  I think we\u2019re putting the cart before the horse to expand the time frame and to authorize full allotments at this time, even with the check-in that they talk about, before having the benefits of the staff\u2019s analytical work, which I support and strongly encourage.  We should have the benefit of that work.  If we\u2019d commissioned that in September, as I\u2019d suggested, I think we\u2019d be in a good position now, and I\u2019d feel comfortable authorizing the steps the way they\u2019re laid out in this resolution.  But I\u2019m not, given the open questions we have.  President Plosser outlined a lot of them.  One thing I\u2019d add is that the staff seems to view increasing the bargaining power of some financial market participants as an important benefit of that.  I find that really puzzling because it implies a diminution of someoneelse\u2019s bargaining power, and you don\u2019t usually think of monetary policy operations as targeting the allocation of bargaining power. There are two elements of irreversibility to the path we\u2019re on that give me pause.  One was mentioned by the manager, and it\u2019s that some market participants have been reluctant to join the program, not knowing how long we\u2019re going to be committed to this.  That\u2019s one of the reasons he advocates a one-year extension.  I think that, in some of the documentary material, he refers to that reluctance as due to switching costs\u2014costs of severing counterparty relations.  Well, by the same token, should that switching occur, we\u2019ll be in a situation in which backing away from the program would impose switching costs again, and that would raise a hurdle and would impede us from changing course if we weren\u2019t ready to go full steam ahead in this direction. I think it\u2019s too soon to go raising barriers to our changing course.  It\u2019s too soon to commit on that basis. The other thing is the fed funds market.  Yes, 5 basis points is below generally where we\u2019ve seen things, but this is a collateralized transaction, and you\u2019d expect that to trade a little bit below an uncollateralized transaction like federal funds.  The risk here is that we suck all of the large dollar transactions out of the market\u2014the Federal Home Loan Banks and the GSEs\u2014 and what we\u2019re left with is the odd-lot stuff. Now, on a day-to-day basis, federal funds trades range up to 30 or 35 basis points.  So there are a bunch of trades up there in the 20s and low 30s, and they could dominate the effective rate.  The effective rate could conceivably go from low, from about the middle single digits, up to more than 20.  I don\u2019t know\u2014the Desk obviously has the data on it, and I don\u2019t think we need to get into that.  But the principle here is that if we expand too rapidly, we could trigger the shift out of the federal funds market that the staff is, I think, rightly concerned about and that we need some analysis of.  We\u2019ve got legal contracts,  OIS and the like, that are pegged to and that write in, as with LIBOR, this effective rate, and here we\u2019re risking changing drastically the meaning of that rate.  We ought to be really cautious as we tiptoe up to that. So I\u2019d prefer that we shorten the time frame to a horizon just after a meeting at which we\u2019re confident staff analysis can come back to us, and that we not authorize full allotment at this time and we just authorize $5 billion.  I think that would be enough for another round of operations.  Clearly, we learned a lot at year-end, but, since year-end, there\u2019s been a step-up in usage that we\u2019re learning from, in terms of the effect of this program on the structure of money markets.  So that would be my suggestion for this resolution", " MR. FISHER.  Well, as you know\u2014and I\u2019ve expressed it in the media\u2014I have enormous confidence in the way you\u2014and your deputy, by the way\u2014operate.  But I do think President Plosser and President Lacker have some good points, and I am a little uncomfortable going to full allotment.  I would like to have this Committee fully briefed; a lot of this is quite esoteric for all of us.  Again, this isn\u2019t questioning our confidence or my confidence or any participant\u2019s or member\u2019s confidence in you, because we have enormous confidence in you.  But I do think, Mr. Chairman, that President Plosser and President Lacker raise a very good question.  I\u2019m uncomfortable with full allotment for the same reasons that they expressed.  Again, I want to underscore\u2014and Simon knows this, and you know this because you\u2019ve seen it in the New York Times\u2014that I have tremendous faith in you.  But I think we need to be educated in the process  along the way, and if it\u2019s not critical that we go to full allotment in order to achieve a better understanding of this exercise, then, unless you were to say it is critical, I would argue the same as President Plosser and President Lacker.  I\u2019d feel uncomfortable", " MR. POTTER.  Yes", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I had a really\u2014almost silly\u2014technical question.  David, the question is about the 1.9 percent assumption on expected inflation in the last chart, in the bottom right of your handout\u2014and it was discussed in one of the memos.  Because the  methodology changed, and therefore it lowered the longer-run average by one-tenth of 1 percent, you lowered expected inflation to 1.9 percent.  I think that\u2019s a weird way of doing it.  Given that consumers think our target is 2 percent, wouldn\u2019t you think they would still think our target was 2 percent.  I didn\u2019t understand the logic of that", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I just didn\u2019t understand it.  I wouldn\u2019t have done it that way, I guess", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But we\u2019re telling them, on the new thermometer, that we\u2019re going to still be at 32, not 31, right", " MR. TARULLO. Mr. Chairman, can I just piggyback on Bill\u2019s question.  Steve, have you incorporated in your baseline economic growth forecast any sense of the reaction that emerging market countries may have in order to stave off more financial problems.  That is, if they follow normal prescriptions, they\u2019re going to do some tightening of monetary policy and maybe implement some austerity measures, which will presumably bring growth down.  And although that may have the salutary effect of holding off a set of currency problems, it would presumably be reducing economic growth", " MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  But I love your point, which is one I\u2019ve tried to emphasize in the past\u2014that a great inflation-targeting bank will keep inflation right at target all of the time, and then you won\u2019t have anything to study other than the fact that inflation is at target all of the time. But maybe a way to put President Evans\u2019s point is that if you look at a chart like this and you say that inflation expectations are anchored, then you get the impression that a situation like the one in Japan couldn\u2019t develop in the United States because, well, inflation expectations are anchored, so it can\u2019t happen.  But, as policymakers, I think what we want is some sense of, under what circumstances would we get stuck in a zero-nominal-interest-rate, low-inflation environment.  And I think we\u2019ve struggled to be able to say something coherent about that and to be able to put a probability on that.  So I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, President Evans, but I guess, in my interpretation of what he said, that what would be useful topolicymakers is some kind of statement about how likely that outcome is, what types of things might lead to that outcome in the United States, and, maybe beyond that, what could we do to avoid that. For that, you would need a model of why longer-term inflation expectations might drift, and we don\u2019t really have that model", " MR. KILEY.  It\u2019s certainly the case that the staff did a lot of work on a variety of DSGE models with different types of financial frictions and shocks and on how the different shocks are transmitted through those mechanisms. You\u2019re definitely right that those mechanisms and shocks can have effects on activity and inflation that differ from those of other demand shocks.  So it\u2019s the case that financial frictions can alter the way in which shocks are transmitted both to the real economy and to inflation.  But I think it\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s no common result across those models, because there are lots of financial frictions now.  And so I don\u2019t think it would be fair to say that it\u2019s a general feature that shocks, other than monetary shocks, become much more important in explaining inflation in some different way.  It\u2019s a much more open area", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The memos have done a very nice job of clarifying staff members\u2019 positions on the important but difficult issue of which labor market and price anomalies reflect transitory movements and which reflect trends. The very low payroll number last month is assumed to be an anomaly, suggesting that much stronger payroll employment growth is imminent.  Similarly, part of the very low inflation numbers is an anomaly, suggesting that we will soon see PCE inflation moving toward our 2 percent target. In contrast, the large declines in labor force participation are assumed to be permanent, reflecting primarily demographic and cohort trends.  While the parsing of these data patterns into transitory or trend categories seems reasonable, I would note with the benefit of hindsight that we have not always been able to distinguish well between what is transitory and what is a trend. A simple example is the assumption that Internet investments during the dot-com phase reflected a change in trend productivity growth that could justify high stock prices rather than a transitory fluctuation, only to be revised down once the dot-com bubble burst. Thus, while assessments made by the staff are reasonable, our actions should reflect the inherent uncertainty around such judgments.  The payroll employment number was a surprise.  The 10-year Treasury rate moved down substantially after the announcement and has only fallen further with growing concerns around emerging markets.  Financial markets seem to have taken to heart at least some of the surprise information, at least for now.  The Tealbook makes clear that it is assumed that the low payroll employment is transitory, because it is incongruent with both the other labor market indicators and the stronger GDP growth we have seen recently.   However, the highly correlated movement of global stock prices surrounding emerging market concerns and the decline in the 10-year Treasury rate since our last meeting, despite strong GDP numbers and our strong GDP forecast, give me some pause about the forecast. The recent serially correlated misses on many of our PCE inflation forecasts are also assumed to be transitory.  However, the longer we miss significantly on our forecast, the less confidence we should have that inflation will be inexorably drawn higher by the gravitational force of our 2 percent target.  The staff highlights that in Japan the long-term expectations for inflation moved little despite inflation being below zero for over a decade.  The observation is very consistent with work my staff has done.  They show empirically that Japanese inflation data may have been more responsive to short-run inflation expectations than long-run expectations.  Similarly, the model that relies on well-anchored expectations fits the past 20 years of data reasonably well but is sensitive to the time period over which it is estimated.  If it turns out that, in very low inflation environments, short-run inflation expectations are more important than long-run expectations in describing the inflation process, we should be much less certain how quickly we will return to our 2 percent inflation target. The staff paper on labor force participation is good.  The paper provides a nice statistical summary of both demographic and within-cohort trends.  While I agree with the demographic exposition, the within-cohort trends seem tenuous. While there were sound economic reasons for the rise in labor force participation by women in the 1970s and 1980s, the economic rationale for a trend reduction in participation by prime-age male cohorts is less clear, and, thus, questions remain as to whether their lower participation rates will be reversed by a stronger labor market. In summary, we should be cautious about our inferences regarding which data reflect transitory influences and which reflect trends.  The implications of this uncertainty for policy,  which I will discuss tomorrow, suggest that a patient approach to removing accommodation is warranted. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the policy decisions in alternative B and the statement language as drafted.  I am comfortable with taking the second tapering step, and I am also comfortable with the conclusion that the public and markets will likely form that $10 billion per meeting is the baseline intention of the Committee. I would like to make a few comments regarding communications challenges ahead.  As long as the unemployment rate is above 6\u00bd percent, I anticipate increasing public pressure for more information on what \u201cwell past 6\u00bd percent\u201d means.  And considering the proximity of the 6\u00bd percent unemployment marker, we know the statement is going to have to change before long.  We can see that coming.  We should think now as a Committee about the language to use once we get to 6\u00bd percent.  On those questions, I am reluctant to put down another unemployment rate marker, as in alternative A.  I would prefer to keep our explanation of the Committee\u2019s reaction function post-6\u00bd percent more qualitative than quantitative, if that can be done. As I said yesterday in the economy go-round, I think a falling unemployment rate may be less reflective than we would like of increasingly satisfactory conditions in the labor market when you view it holistically.  In my view, we just don\u2019t fully understand the factors driving the decline in the unemployment rate.  As the staff memo points out, the data on the inflows to and outflows from the labor market within demographic groups do not speak very loudly on the separation of structural from cyclical factors.  As a result, I think there is more uncertainty than usual about the path of the unemployment rate, about how much of the decline reflects reduction in slack, and about what level of the rate per se is consistent with full employment. I recognize that resorting to a qualitative characterization of the conditions that would prompt liftoff carries risks.  Reliance on qualitative statements that are open to interpretation, both within and outside the Committee, risks some confusion and volatility in trading markets.  To deal with the risks associated with qualitative guidance, I think we should consider less relative reliance on the statement in communications over the coming meetings and more weight on other communications methods in our arsenal\u2014namely, the SEP, press conferences, and the minutes.  I think there might be value in reopening the question of enhancements to the SEP.  I will also support the suggestion of President Bullard, I believe, and others to go to press conferences every meeting supported by refreshed SEPs.  I say that with considerable empathy for our new Chair [laughter], given the singular and concentrated burden of press conferences.  The Committee has time to deliberate about the design of a communication strategy around the  coming meetings.  I am raising the issue now to urge work on these concerns, I hope, well before we get to the \u201cwell past\u201d period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B today, but I do think, as President Lockhart suggested, and as Governor Stein suggested yesterday, that one of the things that we need to be doing is looking beyond the decision today to the challenges, particularly communication challenges, we are going to face in coming meetings.  I think the challenge is going to be, at least, that there is a reasonable likelihood that our 6\u00bd percent threshold will probably be met sooner than we originally anticipated.  There could be a challenge if we reach that threshold and are still in a position of trying to ease policy by continuing to purchase assets. We will not have completed the asset purchase program by then.  I think that is going to present us with some challenges for communication.  And, indeed, while there are risks that things could turn bad again, there are also risks that things could turn much better faster than we anticipate.  I think we have to worry about that as well. To put it a different way, suppose the alternative scenario offered in the Tealbook comes to pass.  Suppose the forecast turns out to be somewhat better than the Tealbook forecast.  What kind of policy and communications will we have to engage in at that time.  They could be quite complicated.  I think that we need to be thinking ahead about how our communications and policies will react in those circumstances.  In particular, I think that if we are still buying assets when we reach the 6\u00bd percent threshold, we face two sorts of problems.  Some may say, \u201cWell, there actually is no conflict because we haven\u2019t said we would do anything at 6\u00bd percent, so we will continue to buy assets and we will not raise rates.\u201d  But I think the language in the statement is going to prove to be problematic.  We have placed a lot of emphasis in our statements on both the unemployment rate and the labor market in particular.  One of the risks we face is that\u2014as President Williams said yesterday, and others of us have said\u2014if in fact the unemployment rate turns out to be a better summary statistic for labor market conditions than we have been assuming, then we are going to find ourselves in a difficult position where we are putting too much weight on labor market conditions.  I actually think that the better argument for keeping rates low longer, so to speak, is low inflation, not necessarily the unemployment problem or the labor markets.  So one thing we need to begin thinking about is how to perhaps shift the emphasis in our language about the reasons that we may not want to raise rates. Now, having said that, I would also note that if you look at the various rules put together in the Tealbook, by the second quarter of this year, for all but the nominal income targeting rule, we are no longer constrained by the zero bound.  Rates are positive in almost all those rules except for one in the second quarter.  I would also add that most of those rules don\u2019t rely on the unemployment rate.  They are looking at the staff\u2019s measure of output gaps.  Clearly those are related in some sense, but they are not necessarily driven by the unemployment rate per se.  So I think we will find ourselves in a position in which the rules are telling us we\u2019re not constrained by the zero bound.  How are we going to behave.  That is going to present some communications challenges for us, and even though inflation will be low, the zero bound won\u2019t be binding any longer. Again, I think this will be a communications challenge, and it\u2019s important for us to anticipate now how we will deal with that.  Our statement has become very complex, with many moving parts, and I think we need to seriously consider revising the statement going forward.  If the forecast continues to play out as in the Tealbook, or somewhere between that and the  alternative scenario, I think we may face a challenge, and I would be inclined to encourage speeding up the pace of tapering if that scenario comes to pass. To summarize, I want to encourage that we not just think about what we will do if things get worse\u2014we need to think about what we\u2019ll do if things get better than we anticipated and what kind of language we will use or what kind of actions we will take in those circumstances. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  In December, we took our first step on the road toward ending our purchase program, and alternative B continues on this road at a steady pace consistent with the improving economy.  Alternative B also follows through on the state-contingent plan we laid out in December.  Markets weren\u2019t disrupted by our plan, in part because we successfully communicated that tapering purchases didn\u2019t mean we were in a hurry to raise the funds rate.  Market perceptions regarding asset purchases and the future funds rate path are currently well aligned with our own. On specifics of language, I find that in the second sentence of paragraph 1 it\u2019s simply too negative to say that labor market indicators were mixed.  In fact, essentially all indicators continue to show improvement.  Payroll gains were a disappointment, of course, but the Tealbook discounts their signal while noting that the disappointing gains were nonetheless consistent with, and I quote, \u201csome improvement in labor markets.\u201d I recommend we replace the  second sentence with the following: \u201cOn balance, labor market conditions have shown further improvement.\u201d  I think it is more accurate, and it avoids the risk of being misinterpreted. Like President Evans and many others, I agree with you that our forward guidance has been very successful, but clearly paragraph 5 is about to reach its expiration date in the reference to 6\u00bd percent unemployment.  The quantitative forward guidance in that paragraph as amended and bolstered with strong qualitative post-threshold guidance has succeeded in bringing market expectations about liftoff into alignment with our own views, but much of this paragraph is written with explicit or implicit reference to the 6\u00bd percent threshold. And I just want to mention that we could easily reach that threshold very soon.  Perhaps we actually already have, once we\u2019ve seen the January data.  So I think we need to rewrite the forward guidance for the post-threshold world as soon as possible.  I agreed with President Lockhart\u2019s comments, but he said \u201cover the coming meetings,\u201d and I don\u2019t think that is realistic. I think it has got to be between now and March that we really think about this, given that unemployment could be down below 6\u00bd percent very soon. Another issue I\u2019d like to bring up is our forward guidance on asset purchases. The unemployment rate is linked to our guidance on asset purchases as well\u2014once the unemployment rate is in the low 6s, it may be hard to understand what we mean by \u201csubstantial improvement in the labor market.\u201d  So it would be helpful to see options around both of these paragraphs, with some analysis, well in advance of our next meeting. A critical decision in thinking about paragraph 5, of course, is whether we want to refine our quantitative guidance as in alternative A or rely on purely qualitative guidance regarding the future path of the funds rate.  And here, like President Lockhart, my view is that with market expectations well aligned with our own, the experience in December suggests that clear   qualitative guidance can effectively signal the ongoing need for a highly accommodative stance of policy.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Knowing how much, over the eight years we have served together, you must have enjoyed my policy lectures\u2014I mean, statements [laughter]\u2014I gave thought, in honor of your final meeting, to reviewing and recapitulating the highlights of my recommendations and commentary about how to conduct monetary policy.  Instead, I have written a throwback statement consistent with the theme evinced by the many throwback baseball caps that were given to you last night.  My policy statement is in the style that was common under your predecessor, when, as our Chair-to-be noted last night, the Chairman spoke first on policy matters and the policy go-round was noted for its brevity.  So here goes:  \u201cI support your policy proposal, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  But what is the language that we would use, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  I\u2019m not sure this is an improvement.  We said at the previous meeting, \u201chaving become more nearly balanced.\u201d  Now we don\u2019t want to say that we\u2019ve made further improvement"], "2014FOMC20140304confcall.txt": [" MR. ROSENGREN.  My hope is that the forward guidance language we choose does the following.  First, as in the memo on the different options for forward guidance, I believe the language should have a neutral effect on expectations.  Expectations seem appropriately aligned with the Committee\u2019s thinking at this time.  Given the weakness in incoming data, I would certainly not want the language to tighten financial conditions. Second, given the market focus on calendar dates, the language needs to avoid adding to uncertainty around the implications for our current thinking on the likely liftoff date.  This is achieved by the statement that the current target range for the federal funds rate will be maintained \u201cfor a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.\u201d It is tied to our actions\u2014namely, the tapering program.  Since the tapering program can be slowed down or sped up, it has flexibility.  However, the modal interpretation of this language will be that liftoff would likely occur in the latter half of 2015.Third, the language should be as simple as possible.  The difference between purchases and liftoff and between triggers and thresholds has been surprisingly difficult to communicate, as witnessed both by the rise in short-term rates that followed the announcement of possible tapering in the middle of last year and by the confusion that persists around the 6\u00bd percent threshold. In my view, the option that gets closest to these objectives is option 2.  It is designed to have a neutral effect on expectations, provides clarity on likely liftoff, and has a relatively simple construction.  However, I think it should be simplified further. For option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the first area highlighted in blue with \u201cthe Committee will consider the projected pace at which labor markets are normalizing and the projected pace at which inflation returns to the Committee\u2019s longer-run goal of 2 percent.  In assessing the improvement in labor market conditions, the Committee will consider a broad range of indicators.\u201d  The concept of normalizing seems more consistent with the concept of the long-run unemployment forecast provided in the SEP, although normalizing would incorporate more than just the unemployment rate. For option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the second area highlighted in blue with \u201cat least as long as labor market conditions are in the process of normalizing, inflation projected between one and two years ahead does not significantly exceed 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\u201d  This refers back to returning to normalized labor markets.  It also replaces language that sounds like an inflation ceiling, \u201cdoes not exceed 2 percent,\u201d with \u201cdoes not significantly exceed 2 percent.\u201d In terms of the other questions, I would not include language on financial developments at this time.  I do not believe we have clarity or consensus on this issue yet, and we probably   need to have much more discussion on that topic. I am comfortable with paragraph 6 in options 1 through 3, and I would highlight one concern, which is that some of the SEP submissions may not be consistent with the guidance we are providing.  This is likely to provide less clarity than desirable, and it highlights more work that needs to be done on the SEP.  Ideally, how we report the SEP should be as consistent as possible with any guidance provided in the statement.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Rosengren.  President Lockhart", " MS. PIANALTO.  As today\u2019s discussion demonstrates, the communication challenges before us are significant.  In my view, we face two broad challenges.  The first, and more pressing, challenge is communicating the conditions that will most likely lead to liftoff for the federal funds rate.  The second is communicating the likely pace of adjustment after liftoff. The first challenge is simpler to address than the second, although I\u2019m not sure, after today\u2019s conversation, that it\u2019s going to be quite that simple.  But I do believe that our experiences, first with the date-based guidance and then with the unemployment thresholds for the fed funds rate liftoff, highlight the importance of proceeding cautiously with very broad changes to our forward guidance.  For now, I suggest that the Committee focus on addressing the first challenge\u2014that is, the timing of liftoff\u2014and then take some time over the spring and summer to study and discuss the efficacy of approaches to guidance on the pace of adjustment after liftoff. To address the communications challenges around liftoff, in my view, it would be most effective to revise the forward guidance to simply refer to labor market conditions in broad terms and to establish an explicit inflation floor.  In my economic outlook, the labor market will continue to improve gradually, and the inflation forecast is likely to be the key driver in the timing of liftoff.  In addition, since the current statement language has an inflation ceiling and other wording that comes close to an inflation floor, the formal establishment of an inflation floor wouldn\u2019t represent a large change in guidance or a large change in our approach.   Of the forward-guidance options circulated to the Committee, I view option 5 as the best starting point because it provides continuity with the current statement and includes the full range of factors that the Committee will consider in deciding on liftoff. However, I believe that the reference in option 5 to \u201cat least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away\u201d could prove to be problematic.  One reason that it could be problematic is that the Committee is likely to have difficulty in clearly defining a complete recovery in labor markets, just as we had some trouble with the guidance around the LSAP program that referred to a simpler notion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  A second reason that it might be problematic is that such guidance would imply that the Committee can accurately predict complete recovery in the labor market at least one year in advance, even though the simpler exercise of forecasting the unemployment rate over the last two years has been difficult.  And a third reason is that we haven\u2019t had the time for careful study of the efficacy of waiting to raise rates until just one year before the labor market recovery is complete. For these reasons, I would prefer a version of option 5 modified to drop the reference to complete recovery in labor markets, and, in place of that language, I would insert the inflation floor language that\u2019s provided in the second sentence of option 3.  The inflation forecast will capture many of the factors that are likely to determine liftoff, but they are more difficult to spell out in simple terms in the forward guidance.  When you look at the December SEP, it suggests that using a 2 percent inflation floor would also be generally consistent with the Committee participants\u2019 forecasts and policy views.  Based on the limited information available in the December SEP, it looks as though the liftoff for many participants was being driven more by an inflation forecast than by the unemployment threshold.   So, with those general comments, let me very quickly turn to the questions that were posed to the Committee.  Regarding whether to include a general statement on policy decisions, I believe that it would be helpful to include the guidance that is provided in the second and the last sentences of option 5.  I think any further general statement that the Committee wishes to make would best be presented in the annual Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  As for linking liftoff to LSAPs, I believe that the statement language should preserve the guidance that\u2019s provided in the current statement.   To do otherwise might suggest a shift in our policy position.  Regarding thresholds, triggers, and floors, as I just stated, I would prefer forward guidance that includes an inflation floor. In response to the second question, I believe that it is best to include financial developments or financial stability in the broader list of indicators that the Committee will be monitoring to decide on liftoff.  And, in my view, the wording in option 5 is appropriate. In response to the third question, at this point, with liftoff likely to be some way off, market expectations seem to reflect an anticipation of gradual changes in the fed funds rate target after liftoff.  So, at least for now, I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s necessary to add more-explicit language that could, over time, prove to require changes.  Instead, as I\u2019ve indicated, I\u2019d prefer to focus now on addressing the challenges of liftoff communications and to use an inflation floor to address that issue. The Committee can take time again over the spring and summer to study and discuss the efficacy of approaches to guidance on the pace of adjustment after liftoff. At this time, in response to question 4, I don\u2019t have any other changes to suggest.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Pianalto.  President George", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019ll make a few comments here.  First\u2014and I think this picks up on a theme that Dennis introduced, and several people have echoed it since then\u2014I do believe that, particularly as we pass the 6.5 percent threshold, we\u2019re better advised to have somewhat generally stated standards in the FOMC statement, which can be elaborated upon as circumstances dictate.  I might deviate a bit from what Dennis stated in expressing a strong bias in favor of having the Chair do most of that elaboration, particularly, though not exclusively, in the press conferences that she\u2019ll be conducting.  To the degree that we think of communication of forward guidance as itself an element of monetary policy, I think it becomes particularly important to have an authoritative voice elaborating that position, and there\u2019s no alternative here, really, but the Chair. A second point is, although I\u2019ve got, personally, a fair amount of flexibility on the specific language that we will adopt, consistent with that notion of general standards, I do think it\u2019s important that we not lose the advantage of what we\u2019ve gotten already in the language that we\u2019ve inserted into the existing paragraph 5.  One of those things is the notion that we are likely\u2014not certain, but likely\u2014to stay at the zero lower bound well past the time when we pass a 6\u00bd percent unemployment rate.  And, second, as we begin to increase interest rates, we will, to use our euphemism, \u201ctake a balanced approach.\u201d It might be advisable to substitute in that \u201cbalanced approach\u201d language something that makes mention of\u2014and I\u2019m not sure this is theright term\u2014the headwinds that we\u2019ll be confronting, because those give a justification for why we think the path upward is, again, not likely to be steep, although we\u2019re not prejudging anything. I would just note in passing that, although I\u2019ve got a fair amount of flexibility on the language and, in some respects, I like some of the earlier statements in option 2 rather than in option 5, I really am less concerned with that.  I would say, though, that I think there\u2019s a bit of a risk here.  Not many people have proposed it, but there\u2019s a bit of a risk that too much reliance on projections as our standard becomes a bit circular.  That is, it almost is the conclusion being stated as the standard.  If you think inflation is going to be below target and employment is going to be below target, and that\u2019s your projection, then, almost by definition, you\u2019re going to be in favor of a longer period of accommodation, and you\u2019re in favor of it because of your expectation that that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to be.  So I\u2019m not sure it communicates an enormous amount of information very effectively, but I say that with the understanding that we already use projections and we\u2019re going to continue to use projections as we go forward here and in other parts of the statement. The next point is that what we\u2019ve got now is, first, some indication of when we\u2019ll begin to raise rates and, second, some indication of how steep a climb we\u2019ll have once we begin.  That\u2019s where, I think, we don\u2019t want to lose the benefits of the communications we\u2019ve had to date, and we want to keep market expectations about where they are. We haven\u2019t yet said anything about the endpoint, and this is where I, like several of you, find paragraph 6 in a few of the options attractive, because it does state an endpoint.  And it seems to me it\u2019s an endpoint that, while not giving a specific number, communicates something about how we\u2019ll be thinking about policy along the way.  Richard is quite right that we haven\u2019t had a debate on that, and it may be   that it would be premature to adopt it.  But, unlike Sandy, I\u2019m a little bit concerned about taking it one step at a time.  Let\u2019s just say when we\u2019re going to begin, and sometime later we\u2019ll talk about how steep a climb, and sometime thereafter we\u2019ll talk about the endpoint.  I think it\u2019s preferable to say something about all three\u2014again, in somewhat generally stated standards\u2014and then allow the Chair to elaborate after listening to the whole Committee during the quarterly meetings that are followed by press conferences. With respect to the financial-stability point, I think Jim had it just right. It would be useful to make reference to it, but not to make too big a deal of it.  And a simple minimalist reference to financial-stability considerations would be just fine, from my point of view, but I don\u2019t feel very strongly about that. In conclusion, Madam Chair, I would stay away, as much as possible, from projections being the basis for the standards.  I agree with what I think is the somewhat emergent consensus, with a lot of variation\u2014that we go with a basic minimalist approach.  But with respect to the specific language, this is one for which I happily give you my proxy so that, as you try to allocate the votes, you\u2019ve got an extra one just to lean in whatever direction you think useful. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks\u2014much appreciated, Governor Tarullo.  Governor Stein"], "2014FOMC20140319meeting.txt": [" MR. ROSENGREN. My question is on figure 10.  If I\u2019m reading this right, the move from the dark blue to the light blue means that the brokers have been moving down their expectations for the fed funds rate since January.  It looks like the December SEP is consistent with that lower rate, and I know we haven\u2019t gotten to it yet, but when we look at our own dots, they\u2019re moving in the opposite direction.  They\u2019re moving up quite substantially.  Do you see it as a potential problem that the dealers are moving down, while our SEP is going to be moving up fairly substantially", " MR. POTTER.  I think volume between private counterparties has definitely gone down.  That\u2019s clear from that", " MR. EVANS.  Madam Chair, if I could, I would like to take the opportunity to ask the staff or someone to write us an opinion on what the appropriate wedge is between PCE and CPI inflation, because I wasn\u2019t actually expecting as low a number as two-tenths.  When I have asked before, I was thinking I had heard more like between three- and five-tenths.  And I think it\u2019s increasingly important for us to have a better feel for that issue", " MR. TARULLO.  You can revise, Richard", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I was going to make an observation on the SEP, and if the staff want to react to it, they are very welcome to.  When I\u2019m looking through the SEP, and I compare the changes in the 2016 numbers in terms of growth and inflation and unemployment,   and then I compare those with the change in the interest rate projections, it seems like the change in the interest rate projection is pretty large relative to the change in the central tendency and, in fact, the ranges. If you look at the unemployment rate, the changes are basically two-tenths at the top end and one-tenth at the bottom end, but the longer run is also being brought down by two-tenths at the top end.  On the range, there is a change of two-tenths at the top end, but that is offset by a one-tenth increase at the bottom end.  So basically you have a net change in the unemployment rate projection from December of, it looks like, one-tenth of 1 percentage point.  And if you look at the inflation numbers, they are basically unchanged for the central tendency, but they are actually lower for the range. So you get a 50 basis point move in the interest rate projection for what essentially seems like a marginal change in the unemployment rate projection and a change in the inflation projections that actually goes the other way.  If one were looking at this from the outside, would one view this as all fitting together. In contrast, I think the Tealbook forecast hangs together a lot better, because there you have upward revisions to inflation, downward revisions to unemployment, and then you have an upward revision to interest rates. It seems to me like we have a little bit of a challenge as a Committee here because either the SEP doesn\u2019t hang together or there is just unbelievable interest rate sensitivity to incredibly minute changes in the unemployment rate. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, you would expect, what, one-fourth of a point, two-tenths, on the interest rate for a movement of one-tenth in the unemployment rate with Taylor (1999), right", "  At a granular MSA level, my staff has found that recent sales have fallen more in those cities with a large investor presence. Furthermore, sales have slowed most in cities in which home prices have risen fastest relative to rents, implying that investors may be running out of attractive buying opportunities to pencil out.  But I\u2019m skeptical that a decline in investor demand is a significant factor behind the  falloff in overall existing home sales.  My staff has found that the timing and the size of the sales decline were very similar across all of the broad regional markets.  So any location-specific factor is unlikely to be the whole story.  In fact, their empirical analysis indicates that before the winter weather hit, about half of the drop in home sales can be explained by last year\u2019s jump in mortgage rates.  Looking ahead, their models predict that home sales should pick up, boosted by the underlying fundamentals, and this outlook is supported by what some upstream housing-related businesses are telling us.  For example, a major window and door manufacturer in my District reports solid orders and sees a pickup ahead.  This suggests that the latest disappointing housing data are just a soft patch, and that growth in housing will provide greater support for the recovery later this year. Turning to inflation, I continue to expect that it will gradually return to our 2 percent target over the next few years.  Admittedly, so far the consumer price data have shown little sign of cooperating with my projection.  The 12-month overall and core PCE inflation rates have stubbornly remained at about 1 percent for almost a year.  Furthermore, labor cost growth remains muted, and my business contacts uniformly indicate that they\u2019re still implementing modest wage increases and unchanged merit pools.  On a more optimistic note, financial market participants appear to have become more confident about the return of inflation to our target. This assessment is based on what financial derivatives, such as inflation caps and floors, are saying about the risks that inflation will move too high or too low. So my staff has been tracking the implied risk-neutral probability that inflation over the next year will be in a 1 percentage point range around our target.  Just to be clear, this is based on CPI data, and we put a 0.3 percentage point gap between rates of PCE and CPI inflation, so we were looking at a 2.3 percent CPI.  They find that the probability that inflation will be in this target range has almost doubled over the past year, moving up from about 20 percent to 40 percent, and financial market participants are putting money on the table that both the upside and the downside tail risks to the inflation outlook are lower than they\u2019ve been in recent years.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My own forecast is quite similar to that of the Tealbook.  I have the economy growing for the rest of this year at roughly 3 percent and then growing slightly faster in 2015.  This growth is sufficient to return the economy to my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment of 5\u00bc percent by the end of 2016, which, if correct, means that it will have taken nine years to reach full employment from the beginning of the recession in late 2007. Because I expect the PCE inflation rate in 2016 to undershoot our 2 percent inflation target by a bit, I have the federal funds rate somewhat lower than the staff assumption at the end of 2016.  Thus, almost a decade after the onset of recession, we will still be undershooting the explicit inflation target we have adopted.  Such a prolonged miss on inflation and unemployment is one reason for doing all we can to ensure that the return to full employment occurs as quickly as possible. I would note a couple of caveats associated with my forecast.  First, I want to thank the staff for doing an incredibly painstaking job estimating the impact of weather on data for the first quarter of this year. My own staff did a careful but somewhat less comprehensive appraisal of the impact of weather on recent data and, like the Board staff, concluded that the effect on this quarter\u2019s real GDP would be rather modest. My estimate of first-quarter real growth, at a bit below 2 percent, implies that growth this quarter likely would have been roughly only 2 percent even in the absence of weather problems.  This makes me worry.  To date, the incoming data provide little evidence of a self-sustaining recovery that attains or exceeds 3 percent growth.While I and many others are forecasting such a recovery, tangible support for the forecast has yet to appear in the data, providing ample reason for caution as we consider our policy tomorrow.   A second caveat is that I still believe that the risks to the forecast are slightly skewed to the downside.  My modal forecast assumes that a variety of foreign disruptions do not turn into a much larger headwind.  Were developments in Ukraine or China to take a turn for the worse, the U.S. economy might face more severe headwinds.  In particular, problems in Ukraine have the possibility of being very disruptive to the fragile recovery in Europe.  Furthermore, European banks are much more exposed to Eastern Europe and emerging markets than U.S. banks and are less well positioned to suffer another adverse shock.  Similarly, developments in China have sent reverberations through financial and commodity markets.  More-severe economic problems there have the potential to be disruptive.  I would note that the 10-year Treasury rate has remained fairly stable, somewhat below 3 percent, since the end of last year.  These sustained low rates in the face of an improving economy suggest to me that investors continue to put significant weight on the possibility that international developments could derail our forecast of accelerating growth. A third caveat is that I continue to estimate that there is significant slack in labor markets. Not only is the unemployment rate at 6.7 percent, well above my estimate of full employment, but other indicators of slack tell a similar story. My staff has been looking at broader measures of unemployment such as U-6.  This broader measure of unemployment rose significantly during the recession and remains elevated relative to historical averages and also relative to our more traditional U-3 measure. The main driver of the unusual increase is the large number of workers reporting that they are working part time for economic reasons.  Last week\u2019s employment announcement reported that 7.2 million Americans want full-time work but are currently   working part time.  This compares with only 4.6 million workers in that situation in December 2007. Furthermore, of those 7.2 million workers who are part time but seeking full-time work, 4.3 million report that the reason they are part-time is because of slack work or business conditions.  Note that unlike those that are classified as marginally attached to the workforce, there is no doubt that these people are willing to work since they are already working.  While much more work needs to be done on these measures, that these measures remain so elevated appears consistent with the contention that significant slack remains in the labor force. Whether one looks at the elevated measures of labor market slack or the continued low readings on compensation and PCE inflation, together they provide ample justification for maintaining a highly accommodative monetary policy for a considerable time.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My forecast is not much changed and remains close to the baseline, except that I\u2019ve got a lower path for the funds rate, and I moved up my funds rate from 1.75 percent to 2 percent in 2016. I\u2019m going to devote the bulk of my remarks to the issue of labor market slack, as several others have.  But, first, I\u2019m going to briefly revisit the SEP issue because I\u2019m sitting here feeling as though we didn\u2019t quite get to the heart of it in our earlier discussions.  The 50 basis point change in our SEP for 2016, in the face of a downbeat paragraph 1 in the statement and market expectations of no change at all, is going to be very hard to explain\u2014more specifically, very hard for you to explain.  [Laughter]  There are three possible explanations, and this is about the disagreement between the new SEP and the expectation of the market.  The first is that we think the economy is better than the market thinks it is.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. The second is that the market misunderstood our reaction function and has new learning to do on that subject.  First, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, but, second, we\u2019re at the beginning of the normalization process.  It\u2019s going really well.  The single worst thing we could do is to send a confusing signal about our reaction function.  So that\u2019s not an answer we want to provide, and, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true. The third explanation is that the market doesn\u2019t really understand how the SEP works and how it gets put together, and I think that\u2019s where the truth is.  Specifically, what I\u2019m hearing is that\u2014I\u2019m not sure everyone around the room is aware of this\u201425 of the basis points are due to   what we euphemistically refer to as a change in personnel on the Committee since December. Another 25 basis points are due to the fact that 13 of the 16 members who are in the room now have an increase of 25 basis points or less.  Somehow that works out to be an increase of 50 basis points in a world in which people are going to rip to that page of the SEP, look at the dots, and, in the 30 minutes between the time when the statement goes out and the time when you walk in front of the cameras, some of them are going to land on the second explanation.  Even if they don\u2019t this time, they will some other time.  This is probably stretching a metaphor too far, but it\u2019s like the scene of a nuclear plant that\u2019s blown up, and a series of engineers are all saying, \u201cWe did the right thing.  We did exactly what we were supposed to do.  It was right here in the book", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Governor Powell and President Kocherlakota highlighted the challenge of forward guidance at a time when the SEP is based on a different set of assumptions concerning optimal policy, which may or may not be consistent with the forward guidance.  This is a little bit radical, but I wonder if we should rethink the SEP and not hand out the SEP at this meeting, saying that we are going to revamp the process and think more carefully about how we make forward guidance consistent with what we\u2019re doing for the SEP.  I know that is somewhat  dramatic, but I am a little worried that there have been a number of meetings at which the SEP and the forward guidance have been inconsistent.  At some point, we\u2019re going to have to do it. This is your first meeting.  Saying that we need to revamp it and we\u2019re going to take the time now to do it\u2014judging from the faces, I\u2019m not seeing a whole lot of support, but we should at least think about alternatives.  In effect, you may have to be saying, \u201cI\u2019m disregarding the SEP, and you should focus on the statement.\u201d  That is going to be an awkward conversation, I would think, if the two aren\u2019t congruent", "\u201d MR. POTTER.  \u201c. . .why if it was a plan, could you please have spoken about this plan somewhere.  You could have told us something other than that you didn\u2019t like how the dots looked, so you didn\u2019t want to show them to us,\u201d which might be even worse", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Or you don\u2019t think we\u2019ll finish the task by 2:00 tomorrow afternoon. CHAIR YELLEN.  How do people feel about my making such a statement in the press conference. We normally don\u2019t say anything about how individuals have changed their views", " MR. LACKER.  Yes, I disagree about the remediation, but we can talk about that. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think the other problem is that the SEP puts too much attention on the modal forecast.  If you actually had people write down their probability distributions and then solve for what the fed funds rate was, who knows what we would come up with. The other problem with the SEP is, it basically makes people pay too much attention to what the modal forecast is when, in fact, there\u2019s huge uncertainty about what\u2019s going to happen two and a half years out.  So that\u2019s the other problem with it as a device", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the $10 billion taper today.  We said it\u2019s a high hurdle for altering that path, and I\u2019m fine with that.  My preference today is to retain our January forward guidance with thresholds in paragraph 5 and maintain this policy language until the unemployment rate falls to 6\u00bd percent or inflation rises to 2\u00bd percent.  This statement language remains fully serviceable even if unemployment falls quickly, owing to our additional guidance that the funds rate will remain at zero well past the time that unemployment falls below 6\u00bd percent.  Since there appears to be perhaps a 50 percent probability that unemployment will remain above 6\u00bd percent at the time of our June meeting, changing this language today as in alternative B prematurely risks an adverse market interpretation, in my opinion. My biggest concern today is that alternative B, along with the SEP release, looks like a tightening in our monetary policy stance.  This round\u2019s SEP median federal funds rate dot in 2016 is 50 basis points higher than in December.  From yesterday\u2019s discussion, I accept that the dealers and financial markets are prepared for a change in our forward guidance, but I think the current alternative B language is not enough guidance to validate the dealer survey expectations.  The dealer survey implies that markets have priced in a very strong degree of financial accommodation.  For example, the dealers envision a funds rate liftoff in the second half of 2015.  They also expect the funds rate liftoff to occur four quarters after the end of QE3 purchases.  The survey also suggests that the more likely values of the unemployment rate at liftoff are below 6 percent.  These observations seem important to me.  If our statement is as   vague as alternative B and financial markets see the higher funds rate projections in the SEP, they may price in tighter financial conditions. Turning to more-specific elements of alternative B, the qualitative language in the second sentence of paragraph 5 is about as weak as one could formulate for forward guidance.  It repeats that our goals are to support maximum employment and a 2 percent inflation objective, the third sentence says that we will assess a range of labor and inflation data, and that\u2019s pretty much it. Frankly, this formulation is very much like our June 2011 language before we embarked on stronger forward guidance.  Maybe that\u2019s the choice.  Yes, I can believe that markets are expecting us to change our forward guidance today, but I worry a lot that this guidance is too weak to maintain their expectations, especially given the SEP medians that we\u2019re going to release. One way to strengthen the forward guidance would be to include the 2 percent inflation floor from alternative A.  In my opinion, this addition would move further toward maintaining our prior stance of accommodation, albeit with a slightly different emphasis on inflation.  In adopting this particular inflation floor following a long period of below-target inflation, the Committee would strongly advance the defense of our inflation objective from below.  This would help remind the public that we have symmetrical preferences for inflation over the long run. In terms of post-liftoff guidance, I think paragraph 6 helps because it instills a further expectation that any premature policy tightening will most likely proceed only slowly. Without this paragraph, the risk of a tightening inference by the markets is higher.  But I also think the earlier, fuller Tealbook version of paragraph 7 would have helped a lot.  I realize that many participants feel that our statement is long and unwieldy, and, sure, making efforts to streamline the policy description sounds like a good idea if you retain the most important elements.  But, look, once you\u2019re involved in dressing a pig [laughter], no amount of lipstick is going to change the fact that this is a pig we are working with.  The statement is long and ugly, and it will always, almost surely, be that way. To maintain the link with our prior policy intentions, it seems to me that the important part of paragraph 7 was repeating explicitly our prior commitment that the funds rate would remain at zero well past the time that the unemployment rate goes below 6\u00bd percent.  This would have been separate from our linkage with the end of asset purchases later this fall.  That additional commentary would prove useful if labor market improvement stalls over the next six months.  A labor market stall, combined with a continuation of 1 percent inflation rates, worries me, and hoping that that doesn\u2019t happen involves accepting more risk.  This meeting is one of those opportunities to meaningfully reinforce that we are pursuing goal-oriented monetary policy to reattain both maximum employment and price stability within a reasonably short period of time. Madam Chair, as I said at the outset, my preference today is to simply update our January statement for economic developments and the additional $10 billion reduction beginning in April.  In order to strengthen alternative B enough to reduce the risk of an inadvertent policy tightening, two changes could help.  One change is to adopt the 2 percent inflation floor from alternative A.  This choice would show that we\u2019re defending our inflation objective from below.  The other change is to revert to the original Tealbook alternative B language for the fuller version of paragraph 7.  This choice would include a reference to keeping the funds rate at zero well past the time that unemployment falls below 6\u00bd percent.In addition, regarding the commentary about the \u201cshort-term interest rates\u201d language in paragraph 6, I agree with the suggestion that mentioning the funds rate instead would be better.  After all, that\u2019s what the Committee\u2019s assessment is referring to in the SEP\u2014the funds rate.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo", " MR. EVANS.  Could somebody give us a table of what the historical real interest rates are.  Every time I\u2019ve looked, there\u2019s an enormous disagreement as to exactly how low they are. CHAIR YELLEN.  That was part of the reason for getting rid of that language, as we would immediately be asked \u201cWhat period.  What historical average.\u201d  It\u2019s very different over different periods.  If we leave the language as is, it is consistent with what you see in the SEP, and it doesn\u2019t prevent us from, over time, if we decide it\u2019s appropriate, writing down our views as to what is normal in the longer run if demographics and productivity growth end up being important.  But I think it does point more in the direction of headwinds as what this is about. Okay.  Well, thanks.  I appreciate all of the effort and thought that all of you have put into this.  This is not an easy transition.  I agree that this is something we ought to do today. While I understand we\u2019re not at 6\u00bd percent\u2014and, as President Evans indicated, one could make the case for waiting\u2014I think it\u2019s broadly expected.  And the fact that we are approaching 6\u00bd percent, to me, seems like a compelling reason to move forward today.  I know that what we have here is not perfect as revised forward guidance, but it really does bridge a lot of different views on the Committee. I think the most controversial piece of this is the second sentence of paragraph 6.  I\u2019ve listened very carefully to what all of you have had to say about it in the go-round this morning.  As I counted, there are certainly a significant number of people who would be more comfortable not including paragraph 6.  If I count numbers, since almost all of you weighed in on this, I  would say the \u201ckeep it in\u201d camp outnumbers slightly the \u201ctake it out\u201d camp.  And I would say that my own personal preference is, I would like to weigh in in favor of keeping it in, for the reasons that many of you have explained, especially since we have the dot plot.  If we don\u2019t speak to this as a Committee, the dot plot will basically be what the world has to interpret our views on this.  I\u2019d prefer it if the Committee, when it has a view, articulates that view in the statement.  I don\u2019t think the SEP was ever meant to be a statement of this Committee\u2019s policy views.  And, while I agree, I think we have had some analysis of this issue.  The staff prepared a very thoughtful memo\u2014I believe that it was for the meeting before last\u2014looking at alternative reasons why we are projecting low rates for a time, even after the economy is back at mandate-consistent levels. We include quite a few statements about our collective beliefs. We believe that inflation is going to be heading back up to 2 percent.  We feel some sense of confidence that the labor market will improve over time, and we don\u2019t exactly agree on precisely what the reasons are. So, to me, this is a broadly enough shared view that I would like to see it expressed in the statement as a forecast. Clearly, it is something.  It doesn\u2019t have the same status as the thresholds, which, I agree, were more like commitments.  This is a forecast, and I think it\u2019s stated quite conditionally as such.  So, with your permission, I would like to stick with paragraph 6 and ask us to vote on that. With respect to wording, I heard a great deal of support in paragraph 6 to change \u201cshort-term interest rates\u201d to \u201cthe federal funds rate.\u201d  Is there anybody who would be opposed to doing that. I did hear a considerable amount of interest in changing it.  Anybody who would have\u2014 yes"], "2014FOMC20140430meeting.txt": [" MR. MARTIN.  Thanks, Fabio.  In the spirit of the discussion about funding flows, I will consider in my remarks the consequences of having an ON RRP facility once a run is under way.  First, it is worth noting that central bank intermediation of money markets in times of acute stress, when investors are particularly risk-averse, may be desirable.  But the question is whether the adjustments could be too large or occur too rapidly, and so be disruptive.  In the remainder of my presentation, I will discuss options to reduce the risk that an ON RRP facility could contribute to liquidity dislocations; specifically, lowering the interest rate offered at the facility and maintaining caps on the facility, or both. As noted in the bottom-right panel, lowering the rate at the ON RRP facility in times of crisis would make it a less attractive option, as long as market participants remain somewhat rate sensitive.  But it may not be reliable enough as a standalone tool.  Lowering the rate preemptively would be difficult and could send a negative signal to market participants and unintentionally trigger a run. Waiting until after a surge of investment at the facility has been observed could mean that lowering the rate happens too late. Instead, imposing permanent but adjustable caps on the facility usage, designed to rarely bind in normal times, could address the financial-stability risk effectively. The caps could be set for each investor, as is the case today, or at some aggregate amount. The cap could also be rigid, so that no investment is allowed above the cap, or flexible, with some investment allowed above the cap, but at a lower interest rate.  The appropriate design would presumably depend on an assessment of the possible risks. Let me start by discussing individual versus aggregate caps.  For individual caps, all counterparties could have the same fixed limit on the amount they can invest.  For example, today all counterparties can invest up to $10 billion, but no more.  Or each counterparty could have its own individual limit\u2014for example, based on historical usage of the program by the counterparty.  One could consider average take-up over a recent period multiplied by, say, 1.5.  A counterparty that has invested $6 billion, on average, in the past would, thus, have a cap of $9 billion.  The main benefit of individual caps is that counterparties know exactly how much they can invest.  In contrast, an aggregate cap would specify the maximum amount of total investment.  For example, it could specify that total take-up at the facility cannot exceed $200 billion.  In the rare instances in which the sum of the bids exceeds the cap, the bids would have to be rationed in some manner.  The main benefit of an aggregate cap is that it would likely be tighter than the sum of individual caps. Let me turn now to rigid versus flexible caps.  A rigid cap could not be breached, as is the case today.  A counterparty cannot invest more than $10 billion at the facility.  A flexible cap could allow some investment above the cap but at a lower rate\u2014conceivably, at a negative rate.  For example, a counterparty could be allowed to invest more than $10 billion, but each dollar above that amount would earn 15 basis points less than the current rate of 5 basis points, or negative 10 basis points. An aggregate flexible cap would work along the same lines.  In all cases, the cap could be adjusted over time. What is the best design for a cap.  This could depend on what risk you are most concerned about.  If your main concern is to have a tight cap, to limit the potential for very rapid increases in take-up, then a rigid aggregate cap may be appealing.  If your main concern is allowing some flexibility for the provision of a safe asset in a crisis, then flexible individual caps may be appealing.  It seems likely that a well-designed system of caps could significantly reduce the financial-stability risks posed by an ON RRP facility in a crisis. The final page of your handout shows the discussion questions that was distributed with the cover memo for the normalization memos.  You may want to address these questions in your comments during the go-round.  Thank you, that completes our prepared remarks.  We\u2019d be happy to take your questions. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Just to follow up on this a little bit, give me the pros and cons of the case in which you would pick option 1.  You\u2019d set the repo rate equal to the IOER rate.  Take-up is unpredictable, as you just discussed, but you put a cap on at some fairly large size that the Committee is comfortable with. Is there anything wrong with that case, or are there good and bad aspects of that case", " MR. MARTIN.  To the extent that we think that banks are really facing balance sheet costs and that you put a cap in so that these balance sheet costs don\u2019t get eliminated, then you have different costs that different financial institutions are facing, and you would imagine that banks are going to take some kind of evasive actions in order to reduce those costs or in order to be more competitive. And so you\u2019re likely not to have a level playing field, and I think we would be concerned about that.  So to the extent that you think that different kinds of institutions are facing different costs, I think we would like to not disadvantage banks in a way that would create potentially very large inequities", " MR. ENGLISH. If I could follow up for a moment, I think there are two issues that the Committee would have to trade off in that case.  One is that if the rate on the overnight RRPs were the same as the IOER rate, for the reason of the FDIC premium costs and other costs the banks face, you might end up with a whole lot of overnight RRPs and not a lot of reserves.  If you put a cap on, then you\u2019d have to ration who gets the overnight RRPs and who doesn\u2019t because the rate would be at a level that would lead to extra demand for the overnight RRPs. The other factor that you\u2019d have to think about is that if you set a high cap\u2014if you had a whole lot of overnight RRPs\u2014you\u2019d be doing a whole lot of transacting and a whole lot of your policy implementation through the nonbank part of the financial sector.  I think some parts of the Committee might be unhappy with that\u2014operating so much with money funds and with GSEs, and not operating in the traditional arena, which is the banking sector. CHAIR YELLEN.  Two-hander", " MR. ROSENGREN. I have a two-hander on that.  I just think we should be agnostic about what the endpoint is, because if we decide to go with a reverse repo facility, until we have some idea of magnitudes and volume and how much it is going to vary, I have no idea whether the reverse repo facility would be a feasible solution in the long run or not.  But if it is, then that is going to imply a much larger balance sheet than we would have if we go with a federal funds rate, and I don\u2019t think we have to decide that until we know how successful the reverse repo facility will be.  I actually think the opposite.  I don\u2019t think we know the endpoint until we know how some of these other tools work. So I would be more interested in taking the approach that in one or two years we learn which of these options are really feasible, and then we have the discussion about what we think is the right solution in 2030.  But I don\u2019t think we should prejudge it in September\u2014I think that prejudging it would be dangerous until we have a better understanding of how the tools work", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you.  I\u2019m sympathetic to the flexibility that has been described right here. One thing that I think I heard somewhere in the presentation or in the questions and answers was that the take-up by money funds is going to depend in part on the perceived permanence of this facility.  So in the testing of this, at some juncture we are going to have to either make a representation that we haven\u2019t figured that out or we are going to have to commit to permanence\u2014aren\u2019t we", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to return to the financial-stability issue. We had a panel in exhibit 3, on the lower left, on possible amplification effects.  And then for potential mitigants, on the lower right, the first one is to lower the overnight repo rate.  And it says, \u201cprobably not a reliable stand-alone tool.\u201d  So I\u2019m going to ask Mr. Martin, why is that not a reliable tool.  It sounded to me like the description that you gave was that maybe the policy decision wouldn\u2019t be the right one in that circumstance.  To me, that\u2019s maybe not a good description, because you are talking to the policy committee", " MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  But, still, what I would think of is a policy rule that reacted partly to a financial crisis\u2013type variable, and, in principle, that policy rule would be exactly the right one, and then that would all be possible.  And then, in that case, lowering the rate would be a sufficient mitigant, and you would offset any probability of crisis.  You are just saying there is some noise around that, and in a crisis situation that might be a problem", "MR. ENGLISH.  But traditionally the central bank provides liquidity against illiquid assets.  That\u2019s the point", " MR. FISHER.  You\u2019re faithful to our franchise. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo", "  If you think it\u2019s going to be binding every quarter, then maybe\u2014 MR. MARTIN.  It also means if they believe it never binds or almost never binds, and if we have a rule that says whenever the cap is not binding everybody gets the maximum bid rate, then they really don\u2019t need to make any of these complicated decisions.  They would just say, \u201cWe\u2019re just going to bid the amount we want because in all likelihood it\u2019s not binding.\u201d  So the complicated part really comes about when they think it is going to hit, but that\u2019s precisely when we want them to think about how much they need that liquidity. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans", " MR. POTTER.  Also, in option 5, if you have the term RRP, and you just happen to be auctioning on that day, depending on how you do it, it would still be a problem", " MR. ENGLISH.  Fair enough.  That\u2019s right", "  MR. EVANS. Thank you.  I appreciate that, because I can\u2019t say I have a great picture of exactly how simple or complicated this is.  And so if it\u2019s actually a rather trivial type of thing and there isn\u2019t really a scenario in which there could be some kind of dislocation of funding or something like that, then maybe it\u2019s easy.  But you might think that for a new innovation proposal of this sort of magnitude you normally would have some type of reports or hearings\u2014I don\u2019t know the right term\u2014to hear from people who are affected, and you\u2019d get some comments or something to help understand it better", " MR. PLOSSER.  But what I\u2019m worried about is, as President Evans suggested, as this gets to be a very big program\u2014if this is the way it goes\u2014what are the potential unintended consequences for market structure, how the money markets are working, who the players are, and where the trades are going to be coming from.  Are some people going to be exiting from this business of supplying overnight funds of various kinds. And will we just be replacing a market with what we do. I don\u2019t quite understand how this is going to work.  I\u2019m a little bit nervous because I think going into the discussion of IOER and the funds rate we thought the IOER rate would provide a pretty solid floor for the funds rate.  It turned out it didn\u2019t, and we now understand better why.  And now we\u2019re talking about something that is much more complicated, and the ripple effects, in terms of unintended consequences on the market structure, are something I don\u2019t feel like I understand, and it makes me a little nervous", " MR. POTTER.  You are not going to have the most efficient set of overnight rates there.  It\u2019s going to be confusing to price term rates as well in that world, because people will be trying to understand, is that wedge going to stay at 100 basis points.  Is it going to move to 50.  Is it going to go to 25. So the effect you\u2019ll have in trying to explain what future policy will be like will also be weak.  Overnight rates at 100 basis points is a significant gap in instruments that should be trading pretty close to each other, and that would suggest that we had messed up in some pretty big way, I\u2019d say.  That\u2019s 100 basis points for an overnight rate on something that, in  normal times, should be pretty close to a perfect substitute\u2014that\u2019s a big wedge we put in the financial system", " MR. MARTIN.  And that means that we would be worried about banks not making as many loans as they would, given that funding rates are so low", "   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That sounds like the IOER rate is a relevant rate.  So what makes the short-term rate the relevant rate", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Who is \u201cyou\u201d in this", " MR. STEIN.  I think in your example you\u2019ve just strongly segmented the market", " MR. POTTER.  I think there are some tradeoffs.  Under some of the options you\u2019d be more confident that the fed funds market as it is today would stay in place.  However, you\u2019d have more focus on the fed funds market.  That means that you\u2019d have a risk if anything goes wrong  in using that as your policy rate.  So that would argue for making it more robust against those risks.  Under the options in which the federal funds rate is less of a focus, I think you\u2019d still want to have some solutions in there, because it\u2019s a relevant rate\u2014is it about $11 trillion in contracts, OIS plus the futures.  And we wouldn\u2019t want to give the impression that we were indifferent to how the federal funds market was reacting, given that people have already entered those contracts.  So there would be two sets of reasons why you would want to \u201crobustify\u201d it, and Bill, I think, is going to say this, but one of the things that we think is a reasonable thing to come out of this meeting is to think about robustifying among all of these options", " MR. FROST.  Right", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a quick follow-up to Governor Tarullo\u2019s question. As long as the fed funds is 90 percent driven by the Federal Home Loan Banks, it seems like an odd market to be very focused on.  So it seems like if we\u2019re going to include the federal funds market as an important component, it would be contingent on coming up with a strategy in which there was a very different composition of who was trading in the federal funds market.  Clearly for option 1 and option 2\u2014but when I get between option 2 and option 3, it\u2019s not clear to me how broad the fed funds market becomes. There will be some trades, but if this light blue is still predominantly coming from the Federal Home Loan Banks, the rate is not indicative of anything other than Home Loan Bank borrowing demand.  And that seems like a very odd thing to target in monetary policy", " MR. ROSENGREN.  So if you generalize it, I agree, but if you were to just use the fed funds rate as what you were focused on, I\u2019m worried it could be very idiosyncratic in a number of instances, and I question whether we want to be highlighting an idiosyncratic rate until we\u2019re more confident about how it\u2019s going to move relative to other rates in the various regimes", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes", " MR. BULLARD. Okay.  Just one more follow-up on this:  We have examples of other central banks that have switched their target rate.  So they must have also had this situation in which there were existing contracts based on their previous target rate, and then they switched to repo or something else.  That must have caused a lot of renegotiation in all these contracts", " MR. LACKER. I see. So what you\u2019re saying is that you\u2019d have to ask them voluntarily to submit to an oversight regime, and you\u2019re not sure you want to do that. Or you\u2019ve asked and they\u2019ve said \u201cno\u201d", " MR. POTTER.  One of the concerns we had at the time, particularly when this came up last year in regard to LIBOR, is that they might want not to produce the data because of the legal risks they might face", " MR. COVITZ.  It\u2019s separate.  It\u2019s going outside the model and asking whether the shock could actually be bigger in its effects than the FRB/US simulation is telling us.  And I think the answer has to be \u201cyes", " MR. KAMIN.  I should mention that for the United States, in this particular scenario, the outcome is \u201cmoderately\u201d benign in the sense that GDP falls 2\u00bc percent below baseline.  So, given that we\u2019re projecting somewhat higher growth, we just avoid that negative GDP that you referred to.  But that\u2019s not true for the other parts of the global economy.  Not to put too fine a point on it, the rest of the world\u2019s economy falls around 4 percent relative to their baseline, which, for the EMEs, puts them, again, perhaps just north of the zero line but, for the advanced foreign economies, actually puts them into negative territory.  And, although we don\u2019t have it broken down per se, that\u2019s mainly going to be concentrated in Europe, in part because not only does Europe suffer the usual downdrafts that the rest of the world experiences\u2014declines in sentiment, increases in financial stresses, and the higher oil prices\u2014but it also gets the effect of Russia cutting off natural gas exports.  Basically, this event puts Europe back into a moderately deep recession.  But, again, the United States\u2014we just skate by.  On the other hand, taking into account the large confidence intervals around these\u2014it\u2019s based on science, but, nevertheless, you could imagine a situation in which this generates, indeed, a recession in the United States. CHAIR YELLEN.  President George", " MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a quick comment.  I found the discussion of the leveraged lending market very interesting, particularly when I think of the scenario that was occurring last spring.  We had the tantrum in financial markets, so, according to the 10-year rate, the rates went up very appreciably.  We had a bunch of supervisory interventions with the intent of slowing down that market.  As was noted in Dan\u2019s briefing, the result was that we actually had more leveraged lending occurring.  And so I think it\u2019s an interesting observation, which is similar to what President Lacker was saying about the Swedish example.  As we think of the ability of exuberant markets to be slowed down, either with monetary policy or with supervisory policy, at least if you look at that spring as an example, it indicates that relatively large movements in both supervisory policy and monetary policy didn\u2019t do much then.  It might be interesting\u2014not today, obviously, being so late, but at a future FOMC meeting when we have the time\u2014to think a little bit more about this, because some of us have been giving speeches about financial stability.  If we were in a Swedish example or one of these other kinds of scenarios, what kinds of tradeoffs would there be, and what would be the magnitudes, between using primarily interest rates to try to slow down a section of the economy.  Alternatively, what are our options for supervisory and  regulatory policy, and do we have sufficient tools to actually address this kind of exuberance with what we have now. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.  Would others like to comment.  President Bullard", " MR. LOCKHART.  March data indicate that the economy has experienced a rebound following the weather-influenced, weaker numbers of December through February, the exception being the housing data.  Overall, however, I\u2019m encouraged by early indications of a resumption of activity levels that are consistent with the thesis that the economy will grow at an accelerated pace compared with the close to 2 percent average of the recovery through midyear 2013.  And that accelerated pace would be around 3 percent, as President Rosengren suggested. In our recent District conversations with directors and contacts, we sought anecdotal support for that working assumption\u2014that the first quarter was heavily influenced by weather, and that there is a rebound under way and an outlook assuming a run rate of growth closer to 3 percent is realistic.  Most of the feedback received was consistent with this view.  Business activity has clearly picked up across my District, and, while better weather has bolstered the near-term outlook of our contacts, sentiment about the balance of 2014 and beyond seems more positive than at the time of the last meeting.  As one contact put it, there seems to be less reluctance to move forward.  According to the country\u2019s largest auto retailer, sales in late March and through April were exceptionally strong, and there is confidence that the current strength of sales can be sustained. A major utility in the Southeast reported that industrial power usage has picked up across 13 of 15 industry categories.  Residential power demand as measured by both consumption and new home hookups has also been rising at a pace that appears to be greater than weather fluctuations would account for. We did hear of constraints to moving forward in some industries.  Home construction is facing labor shortages and building materials cost pressures. Developed lots are said to be in short supply in a number of metro areas.  The anecdotal inputs on the housing sector were not dire, however.  Transportation firms are facing capacity constraints\u2014principally, driver availability.  That said, we did not hear reports that indicate a more generalized experience of growth constraints, wage pressures, or cost pressures. Based on March data and these anecdotal reports, I\u2019m holding to an outlook of medium-term real GDP growth around 3 percent.  This is the same outlook I presented at the last meeting. I\u2019m expecting this growth to be sufficient to keep net monthly job gains in the neighborhood of 200,000, even as productivity growth improves.  My outlook projects unemployment reaching 5\u00bc percent by the end of 2016 and inflation converging to our 2 percent objective about the same time.  With this baseline scenario, I have liftoff for the fed funds rate occurring late in 2015, followed by a gradual process of normalization of the policy rate. In its essentials, my outlook doesn\u2019t deviate significantly from that of this meeting\u2019s Tealbook.  My staff has proposed to me a monitoring and validation framework with a number of indicators but three bellwethers in particular:  industrial production growth, demand for capital goods, and consumer spending.  Interestingly, we saw improvement in all of these categories in the March data. The main point I want to make in this round is that it will likely be very challenging over the coming months to see clear validation in the data of an assumed outlook of 3 percent economic growth.  We may not know for several quarters whether the economy is on a stronger sustained growth path.  Given normal monthly variability of readings, distinguishing between a 3 percent and a 2 percent growth path may take a while.  Certainly, there are risks around my outlook that are well captured by the range of alternative scenarios presented in the Tealbook.  The one I find most plausible is the \u201cWeaker Household Demand\u201d scenario.  Because of the murkiness we may be dealing with as the data come in, I would counsel caution about projecting a funds rate liftoff too early and running risks in the Committee\u2019s communication of the market pulling forward the date.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Lockhart.  Why don\u2019t we do one last presentation.  [Laughter]  Sorry to disappoint", " MR. LACKER.  No\u2014it does", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I\u2019m asking a slightly different question.  You\u2019re basically saying that the unemployment rate today is a good summary measure of unemployment.  Some people are arguing that the unemployment rate today is not a good summary statistic, and that you want to look at the short-term unemployment rate", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The incoming economic data have been consistent with my prior assumption that most of the first quarter\u2019s softness was due to severe weather.  My staff estimates that weather effects depressed GDP growth by a bit less than 1 percentage point in the first quarter.  My forecast for economic growth for the rest of the year remains near 3 percent, and, while progress on the unemployment rate has stalled in recent months, I continue to expect that unemployment rates should resume their decline in coming months. While most of the incoming data have been reassuring, unfortunately the same cannot be said for the recent news on the housing market.  The data on new and existing homes, permits, and mortgage originations for purchases have all been weaker than expected.  Construction bottlenecks; a pullback by potential homebuyers after a run-up in prices over the past few years; and, of course, some weather effects could all be factors that are holding back the housing recovery.  Another potential factor that we should not ignore is credit availability.  That is, tight lending standards might still be holding back the housing recovery.  Some recent reports suggest that mortgage lending standards have fallen sharply, which might be expected to give the housing recovery a lift.  However, analysis done by my staff indicates that the decline in the average FICO score of mortgage borrowers since the beginning of 2013 has been driven by refinancings.  By contrast, FICO scores for newly originated purchase mortgages through February of this year have essentially been unchanged since mid-2012, and they remain at historically high levels.  I still think that the housing market should see a pickup in growth in coming months, supported by job growth, by demographic demand for housing, and by interest rates that remain historically low.  That said, I believe it\u2019s important for the Committee to keep an eye on the sources of recent weakness in the housing sector. Turning to inflation, unlike the Tealbook, I found the latest price data a little surprising, and, for a change, it was a pleasant surprise.  The headline, core, and median CPI all increased 0.2 percent, month over month, in March\u2014more than I expected.  Price gains were notable in the categories of food and shelter, but there was a general move toward higher monthly inflation rates across the distribution of components.  Because this is only one data release, it is difficult to distinguish trend from noise, but it does raise the welcome possibility that inflation might be on a firmer trajectory.  As a result, I have slightly edged up my forecast path for inflation, and I now anticipate that headline PCE inflation will be approximately 2 percent by the end of 2016. In general, I see the risks to my projection as being broadly balanced.  A persistent slowdown in housing does pose a downside risk to my outlook for the real economy.  But it is also possible that severe weather has weighed on economic activity more than I estimate, and the economy could be poised for an even larger rebound.  Depending on whether future price data are more like the March data or those of the preceding months, there are also upside and downside risks to my inflation forecast.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser", " Now, I should emphasize the following point: I see these cross-MSA estimates as being more informative about the true relationship between national unemployment and national inflation than aggregate Phillips curve estimates.  Why do I say that.  Aggregate Phillips-curve estimates are contaminated by the endogenous response of monetary policy to demand shocks", " So the cross-MSA estimates are actually cleaner estimates of the aggregate Phillips curve than we can get from aggregate data. To sum up, like the Tealbook, I continue to expect PCE inflation to remain below target for the next four years.  In the Ninth District, wage pressures remain subdued in the face of less than 5 percent unemployment, and Minneapolis Fed empirical work suggests that the high fraction of workers who are part time for economic reasons at the national level will continue to put downward pressure on inflation as the economy improves.

If I could ask a question, the anticipated action in alternative B has us stepping down asset purchases to $45 billion a month.  I know we\u2019re not on a preset course, but if I just project that continuing into the fall and add up what we\u2019re going to be purchasing until the termination of the purchase program, it\u2019s somewhere around $190 billion, depending on the assumptions that you make about that.  Now, it got my attention that our testing of the overnight reverse repo program at its maximum, nonweird month amounts to $180 billion", " MR. LACKER.

KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I had a question about chart 17 on exhibit 3, which is the answer to the question about expected number of months.  I had a concern that this line of questioning could send the signal that the Committee is thinking about the decision to lift off in terms of a time-contingent basis as opposed to a state-contingent basis. I was wondering if the Desk had contemplated formulating this kind of question, either replacing or augmenting the survey by asking about changes in conditions that would lead to liftoff", " MR. FISHER.  May I follow up, Madam Chair", " MR. NATALUCCI. There\u2019s another financial-stability issue which the memo highlights that you might want to consider and that is that the variability or volatility of take-up of the prime funds is much higher than that of the government funds.  If you have this individual cap and the volatility of take-up is very high, you might see a tradeoff between volatility and where you set the cap, essentially.  So excluding the prime funds would essentially have a take-up that is much less volatile than if you included them.  Now of course, if the prime funds start putting money into the government funds, that might increase the volatility of the government funds, so the tradeoff is not obvious", " MS. LOGAN.

This is very subtle, Stan", " MS. LEONARD. We think the signaling effect that this should have on short-term rates probably wouldn\u2019t depend on which tool you use, but there is uncertainty around what kind of signaling effect an announcement on reinvestments could have in regards supply  For example, for MBS, there\u2019s some endogenous response to our purchases, and that creates at least some uncertainty. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a big issue now, as we\u2019ve been tapering purchases in a very predictable way, but we hear from market participants that there could be a flow effect that is associated with the signal we send about our purchase plans", " MR. TARULLO.  I guess I had been under the impression, just listening to market participants, that regardless of on which part of the yield curve the ceasing of reinvestment would have the most noticeable effects, that the cessation of reinvestments would be read more generally as a prelude to tightening or, if it came after liftoff, it would be read as sort of a ramping up of tightening.  And I guess I\u2019m asking whether the Desk shares that general view", " MR. POTTER. Last year, when we tried to give clarity, it didn\u2019t work too well", "   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I did.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  And it actually builds on what Vice Chairman Dudley was just saying.  I understand the desire to retain flexibility, but I guess I took a slightly different lesson from the events of 2013, which is that the Committee\u2019s desire to retain flexibility in September 2012 left markets with uncertainty about what we meant about sufficient improvement in the labor market outlook.  And then our decisions were viewed as containing information about our reaction function, about how hawkish or dovish this Committee is.  And so that\u2019s a cost of retaining flexibility\u2014that your decisions are not viewed as being necessarily conditional on economic outcomes, but rather on the makeup and the inclinations of the Committee.  My own view of the events of 2013 is that we weren\u2019t sufficiently clear in September 2012, and that\u2019s what led to the challenges.  And I think we should be careful in thinking that through as we are thinking about communicating in the future. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Powell", " MR. ENGLISH.  I think that\u2019s right, that the funds rate has continued to move with other short-term market rates, as Simon discussed.  We think that the overnight RRP rate has set a floor for market rates that has been reasonably good in the period when there was a reduction in bill issuance and rates fell.  I think that what we have learned is really about control and the control that we can get from the overnight RRP rate.  But as Simon indicated, particularly if you were trying to hit a point target, the question of, if the funds rate is 5 basis points or 7 basis points below your point target, how much do you move the overnight RRP rate to get it there. How quickly do markets adjust to the higher floor.  And so how rapidly does the funds rate get there. And also, there is the constraint that if you want to keep the funds market more or less trading as it is trading now, you can\u2019t raise the overnight RRP rate too far, too close to the IOER rate, because that will ultimately undermine the trading in the funds market. So there are just a bunch of things that we don\u2019t really know, and trying to implement an approach in which there is a target for the funds rate that you are trying to hit by moving theovernight RRP rate would require some learning by doing.  And potentially some of that learning would be, do you want to also be constrained by keeping a reasonably large spread between IOER and overnight RRP.  There may be times when you can\u2019t hit your target, and you just have to live with some uncertainty of where the funds rate will be relative to target", " MR. ENGLISH.  I actually disagree with that in normal times, because in normal times, as I said, the funds market is small, we control a lot of the parameters through reserve requirements and through our open market operations, and we have pretty good visibility into, for example, what the Treasury balance is going to be.  So we can make pretty small adjustments and target the funds rate very closely, and we understand that market very well. I would be at least hesitant and would want to think pretty hard about shifting to a system in which we\u2019re implementing policy in an ongoing way through an RRP rate and our operations are overnight RRPs.  I think that\u2019s an implementation process that is feasible, but you would have to do it with a much bigger balance sheet, because potentially you\u2019d be doing a lot of RRPs to push around what is a very, very large market.  And it would just be, I think, a very different set of special factors that we would have to learn about, and we\u2019d learn about them, and we\u2019dfigure them out, and we could do that.  But it is a very different way of implementing policy, and it would have serious consequences for the balance sheet and the size of our operations.  I know Simon will have more to say on that", " MR. ENGLISH.  Can I just add a thought in response to what you said on building expectations about overnight RRP.  I think the Committee can choose to build expectations or not.  In particular, one could imagine in September saying that we are going to use overnight RRP as a tool during normalization, but we don\u2019t necessarily intend to use it in the long run. And I can see a path forward that would involve, let\u2019s say, raising IOER and overnight RRP basically in parallel as you tighten, raising the target range for the federal funds rate, maybe later on you go to a point target.  Over time, the balance sheet is shrinking.  Over time, the overnight RRP isn\u2019t as helpful and isn\u2019t as important in applying a floor.  The setting of IOER is sufficient to pull rates higher. So you allow the overnight RRP rate to fall relative to market rates, relative to IOER, and over time it becomes essentially irrelevant.  Nobody really wants it  because the rate on it is lousy relative to market rates, and so it goes away.  I don\u2019t see that there isn\u2019t a process for proceeding whereby you could use overnight RRP as a tool to give you confidence that you can raise rates when the time comes to raise rates, but not make it part of a long-run toolkit", " MR. ENGLISH. Within the range between overnight RRP and IOER, market rates would move up toward IOER", "MR. ENGLISH.  I agree, at the beginning, when you raise rates in the way I described, you wouldn\u2019t see whether the overnight RRP was doing you all that much good.  It might be that just raising IOER with no overnight RRP would provide a sufficient magnet, would move rates up along with IOER.  You would not see that in the process I described.  You would ultimately see, as the balance sheet shrank and the amount of reserves shrank, market rates moving up within that range\u2014that, say, 20 basis point range between overnight RRP and IOER.  And, as it moved higher, you would have less take-up on the overnight RRP facility.  It would just be less important as a way of providing a floor", "\u201d  You raise IOER, and rates don\u2019t go up\u2014because they might not\u2014and\u2014 MR. LACKER.  So they don\u2019t go up when\u2014you know, for a couple of weeks\u2014so we miss the liftoff by a couple of weeks. We raise the RRP rate at the next meeting", " MR. POTTER.  I think there are a number of issues which are addressed in the previous memo and the memo that you got this time.  The first one is, how robust is the current effective federal funds rate print. And do we feel that we can print the effective federal funds rate in the future, either from the brokered data or the FR-2420.Now, the quality of that as a reference rate could get low if the volume in the markets got low.  And we don\u2019t want a very small cash market supporting $11 trillion of other types of instruments, because that offers lots of incentives for behavior that we don\u2019t want. There is another issue if we try to expand the federal funds rate.  If we take option 2, in which basically we start printing an effective federal funds rate which has the Eurodollar transactions there, whether that could lead to contract frustration claims.  We don\u2019t think that\u2019s a high chance, but that\u2019s a higher risk than under option 1, in which you are printing off the federal funds classic, say, and an overnight bank funding rate, whatever name we go with.  That was one of the issues we addressed in that memo. I don\u2019t think any of the lawyers in the room will be able to give us great confidence on this.  Scott had some reasonably good ideas about how, when we refine the data collection on the FR-2420, we could guide market participants.  I don\u2019t know, Scott, if you want to explain that", " MR. POTTER.  One issue is, suppose we do use the overnight RRP as part of the liftoff and we do have caps, we should think very carefully about what might happen as we\u2019re first raising money market rates.  It wouldn\u2019t be the case, then, that we\u2019d want to trigger one of the caps, because what we\u2019re trying to do is raise rates and use the overnight RRP to make sure we don\u2019t leave any rates behind.  So I take the point that we should think very carefully, if we do use the overnight RRP, about how flows might change as we are initially raising rates. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman Dudley, a two-hander", " MR. ENGLISH.  Those European banks would have to pay more.  That\u2019s the point.  We\u2019re raising rates", " MR. ENGLISH.  I don\u2019t think so.  As I said earlier in my remarks to President Lacker, I think as the balance sheet shrinks\u2014so your long run, is it as rates go up or as the balance sheet shrinks", " [Simultaneous conversation] MR. EVANS.  Well, that\u2019s if you let the cap go", "  So they raise the overnight RRP rate\u2014 MR. EVANS.  No, but there\u2019s a flight to quality.  So they\u2019re busting through the cap", "  President Evans, the weekly average has gone up, which moves up\u2014  [Simultaneous conversation] MR. ENGLISH. If I can clarify something at least\u2014it\u2019s either the cap or the rate, right. You either set a quantity or a price, and I think President Evans is suggesting that you don\u2019t want to raise the quantity because you have concerns about the quantity.  Then you\u2019re going to have to  let the price fall. And that\u2019s a basic monetary policy issue.  Alternatively, if you want to raise the rate and you want to do whatever you think is right for monetary policy, you\u2019re going to have to, at least over some period of time\u2014maybe not immediately, as Fabio was saying\u2014let the cap be much higher", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I thought this was a very interesting and useful conversation.  The part I took away as being especially important is what Fabio said, that the better terminology for these caps is circuit breakers.  It will just give the Committee time to think and react. I think we should be communicating about them if they are put in place, but the idea that they are hard-wired, I think, is wrong. I think the Committee will be making state-contingent decisions in a very short period of time to deal with a crisis. I would actually push back a little bit on what President Evans said about the need to think through these scenarios. I think it\u2019s not humanly possible to think through all of the possible scenarios that will arise in those situations.  I think staff has done an excellent job of leading us through a wide range of important ones, but I think it\u2019s very challenging for us to be thinking through this in the kind of calm we\u2019re sitting in right now with VIX at whatever it is, 11\u00bd\u2014to be thinking about what\u2019s going to happen in these crisis scenarios", " MR. TARULLO.  It\u2019s fairly easy to say that at current levels I don\u2019t have a high level of concern.  Because of my skepticism about how well caps will hold once one is on some sort of trajectory upward, I think my concern may be as much in the way we project it and grow it initially as opposed to the size it actually ends up being", " MR. POTTER.  Option 1 has us printing two rates, the fed funds classic and the overnight bank funding rate.  There\u2019s a little bit of confusion about that", " MS. GEORGE.  We affirmed the broad principles around our 2011\u2014 CHAIR YELLEN.  But not the specifics around that", " MR. RUDD.  The time-varying parameter\u2212stochastic-volatility VAR might not change much at all.  The Stock-Watson model is very close to an accelerationist model but with a very long lag right now, so that might actually pick up a tiny bit.  For the Cogley-Sargent model, I don\u2019t know, because that model allows for possibly sluggish deviations from its trend, and it could interpret a surprise as being a relatively transitory movement away from the trend.  The trend itself might be better anchored than in, say, the Stock-Watson model.  So I think, in order of precedence, Stock-Watson is going to react the most, and the time-varying parameter/stochastic-volatility VAR is probably going to react the least", " MR. RUDD.  Well, but the SPF is saying 2 percent over the next 10 years.  If you back out what the SPF is saying for the 5-year-forward period\u2014in other words, 5 years down the line, what it says about the next 5 years\u2014it\u2019s above 2 percent, and it has been ever since the 10-year average has been 2 percent.  It\u2019s never been 2 percent for 5 years, 5 years forward, which suggests to me that you have to be a little careful about interpreting even the SPF\u2019s 2 percent", " MR. WILCOX.  Not to speak of", "  Only during the period of the crisis itself, but then you\u2019re talking about a couple of years afterward when\u2014 MR. RUDD.  Well, we had the European crisis leading to flight-to-safety flows and things that were affecting Treasury markets in ways that, again, make me worried about using these TIPS-based measures", " MR. BULLARD.  I think it\u2019s a fundamental issue, because what you\u2019re really saying is that, to get inflation to 2 percent, you\u2019ve got to shift longer-term expectations somehow.  And Idon\u2019t think the Committee is even thinking about that.  The discussions I\u2019ve heard, anyway, have not really talked in those terms since September 2012, when we undertook QE3", " MR. RUDD.  Well, for two reasons.  One is, when we put those measures into our models of core inflation, we don\u2019t find that they\u2019re saying the underlying inflation rate is 2 percent.  One of the things Deb talked about at some length in the memo is that, if you think the SPF got it right, it looked as though the SPF was just wrong about the oil shocks.  They were behind the curve, as were futures markets, and so they didn\u2019t really anticipate shocks that occurred that boosted actual inflation. When we put these measures into our core inflation models\u2014that\u2019s what the first two models in panel 5 of exhibit 4 are doing\u2014they spit out levels of inflation\u2014underlying inflation, as we\u2019ve called it\u2014that are lower than 2 percent.  In other  words, looking at the historical behavior of inflation, the historical behavior of supply shocks, the historical behavior of slack, and the historical behavior of these survey-based expectations measures, the survey-based measures have been consistent with inflation rates, in the absence of those other factors, that aren\u2019t equal to 2 percent\u2014even the SPF, whose reported level over the next 10 years is given as 2 percent. You have to be careful, too, about evaluating that forecast.  That\u2019s a 10-year-ahead forecast.  We\u2019re not really evaluating how well that did 10 years later.  We\u2019re just saying, over some longish average period, what happened, but we haven\u2019t really done the exercise of saying we\u2019ve looked to evaluate how well the SPF did 10 years ahead.  What we did do is to back out what they\u2019re saying between years 5 and 10, and there you don\u2019t get 2 percent, which I think is interesting", " MR. RUDD.  Then in January, I believe, when we sent the inflation memo forward to the FOMC, Mr. Wilcox briefed, and I remember there was a kerfuffle about 1.9 percent", "\u201d MR. EVANS.  Well, the CPI is closer to 2\u00bd percent.  They\u2019re going to get it wrong.  That means that we have a big job in front of us", " MR. EVANS.  Related to this, would the market take any signal away from an inference that the dots are higher because existing participants have adjusted their forecast as opposed to the changing composition of the Committee, and that, by itself, could lead to shift in the dots", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It\u2019s not obvious, though, if the dots change because the composition changed, that it doesn\u2019t matter", " MR. ENGLISH.  Oh, absolutely.  No, no.  I would think it would be the reverse in some sense.  It would matter if they thought that, for example, the change in composition had moved the center of the Committee in a particular way.  That would matter", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Isn\u2019t there a slight offset, Bill, too, though, because the long-term equilibrium fed funds rate has come down slightly", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I take President Kocherlakota\u2019s point, but I think making that change in the language at this meeting at a time when inflation looks like it\u2019s actually creeping up, I think people would just have trouble trying to understand what the motivation was for that statement change.  I support the Chair\u2019s proposal in terms of the press conference and the $15 billion taper in October.  I don\u2019t want it in the statement, and I don\u2019t want it in the press conference statement.  I think you want to do it in a low-key way, and if it doesn\u2019t come up\u2014and I\u2019ll be shocked if it doesn\u2019t\u2014it will come up in the minutes, and that will be a fine way to dispose of it. I also have some thoughts about the Taylor rule formulations in Tealbook B.  Not surprisingly, all of them show liftoff occurring either immediately or before year-end.  I think these rules are a very poor guide to policy right now.  These Taylor rules use as their intercept the long-run equilibrium real rate, which has been lowered to 1\u00be percent in their latest formulation.  I think they should be using the short-run equilibrium rate, which is likely to be considerably lower.  Why should the short-term equilibrium rate be lower.  Lower because we can identify significant headwinds that almost certainly have lowered the equilibrium real rate. This is evident in the sluggish recovery, for example, that we have seen in the housing sector.  Also lower, though, because of the counterfactual.  If policy were as easy as implied by the current level of real short-term rates relative to the 1\u00be percent long-run equilibrium real rate, then the economy should be growing much faster than the trajectory we\u2019ve actually been on. Another issue worth considering with respect to these Taylor rule calculations, if the unemployment rate is artificially or temporarily depressed because of a drop in the participation rate, and if the Taylor rule\u2019s measure of the output gap is based on the unemployment rate, which seems to be the way the staff does it, then it would seem that the Taylor rule formulations understate the output gap because they\u2019re taking on board fully the drop in the unemployment rate, which has been driven in part by the participation rate.  That\u2019s another issue, I think.  The bottom line for me is, I think I\u2019ve said this over and over again, but I\u2019m going to say it one more time.  Be careful not to let these Taylor rule calculations influence your assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Now, we\u2019re obviously not doing that because the Committee supports alternative B and it\u2019s not following the Taylor rule formulation, but I do think these rules are a bit misleading in the current set of circumstances. Finally, let me just talk very, very briefly on reinvestment.  I\u2019m not going to go through all the arguments I made yesterday, but just state two things.  One, the reason why I want to end reinvestment after rather than before liftoff is very simple.  Our priority should be to get off the zero lower bound as soon as possible, consistent with the dual-mandate objectives. While it\u2019s true that, on a model-based basis, ending reinvestment first wouldn\u2019t supposedly do anything to short- and long-term rates, or be very minor, we did an experiment last summer that was supposedly very similar, in terms of the taper tantrum, and we saw not only a very large rise in long-term rates, but we also saw a very significant change in the path of short-term rate expectations.  I don\u2019t think you can model these things.  I think you just see how markets can sometimes react in a very violent way, and so I don\u2019t want to take that risk because if we were to experience that sort of event, we might not be able to get off the zero lower bound as soon as we would if we reversed the order and did the reinvestment later.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Well, thank you all for your input on the issue of how to handle October or December.  As we went around, I think the vast majority of you preferred October and to have me do this in the press conference if it comes up.  I did hear some interest in putting it in the statement, but as I understood it, you were willing to go along with the press conference.  I do agree that there could be some reaction to this, and I will do my very best to minimize it, but I don\u2019t want to downplay the potential for some reaction.  It\u2019s because I expect that that I don\u2019t want to see it in the statement, but I think that\u2019s real. With respect to alternative B, there were a couple of proposals for changes, but I think overwhelmingly in the go-round, what I heard was support to basically leave alternative B as it is with minimal red ink today.  I would propose and put that forward at this point for a vote"], "2014FOMC20140730meeting.txt": [" MR. POTTER.  It was a reduction of 25 percent.  We have the numbers.

As I said, I\u2019m not a supervisor.  I think our leverage ratio is calculated as an average.  There\u2019s less of an incentive to do it.  It is not obvious how people are going to apply the Basel III leverage ratio to foreign banking organizations, but they seem to be thinking that it might be applied more at the quarter-end.  There\u2019s some uncertainty.  If you talk to some of the people who have to manage these balance sheets, they are unsure on a number of aspects about what the final rules will look like.  They still have the net stable funding ratio, for example, that has to be finalized. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren", " MR. LOCKHART.  The implication of implementing an overnight reverse repo facility is that you have some doubt that IOER will work, that it will be a powerful enough tool, and that the arbitrage relationships that historically have had some power will not be as potent in the future.  Can you elaborate a little further on how you come to that conclusion, or why you think or doubt that the IOER tool will be powerful enough, and maybe talk about the latest we know about arbitrage relationships", " MR. POTTER.  As we thought of it, there is a tool that would allow you to quickly reestablish control, which is the overnight RRP.  You just have to do it in a much bigger size at that point.  But you would probably not get much of a hit to how credible you were for a few weeks.  You could try to explain that it doesn\u2019t affect how you are going to achieve the long-run objectives.  People in money markets might not listen to that, though.  They might just question whether we are really serious about trying to raise rates", " MR. FISHER.  Does that make you feel good, Eric", " MR. POTTER.  They\u2019d have to go down", " MR. ENGLISH.  What would happen is that the FBOs wouldn\u2019t be borrowing.  More funds would come into the overnight RRP auction or, as you say, if the cap were kind of as we expect it probably would be, it would probably bind, and the rate that would clear at the auction would fall.  That\u2019s actually okay.  That\u2019s kind of what happens at the end of quarters.  It happened at the ends of quarters before we had an overnight RRP program.  Rates would fall, and I think the issues then are exactly the ones that Patrick raised.  There\u2019s kind of a tradeoff.  On the one hand, you may be perfectly happy with that.  You\u2019re not encouraging the sort of adjustments in balance sheets at the end of the quarter, and you may feel that\u2019s okay.  On the other hand, your control over rates is less good.  You\u2019ve said that the funds rate is going to trade in some range and then it\u2019s not trading in that range, and it\u2019s possible that that could also result in different behavior of money market participants.  They would want to make sure they\u2019d have some place to park their money at quarter-ends.  They\u2019d be parking money with folks at low rates not at quarter-ends to make sure they have access to that balance sheet.  It could affect your control some even not at quarter-ends, but that\u2019s the tradeoff.  I mean, all of this discussion is full of tradeoffs.

I have a different question, and Gretchen alluded to this in her comments about the revised principles, and I want to turn attention to the balance sheet for a moment. In the new language in the revised statement, there\u2019s a new bullet that says that the Committee currently anticipates that it will normalize the size of the balance sheet primarily through stopping reinvestments, in other words, primarily through no sales whatsoever.  Then it makes another blanket statement that says we\u2019re not going to sell MBS, and then it makes another statement that says our goal is to return to a portfolio of nearly all Treasuries.  I find these three statements kind of confusing and partially at odds and inconsistent with each other because I don\u2019t know what the path is then to normalizing back to an all-Treasuries portfolio if we\u2019ve flatly said we\u2019re not going to sell MBS.  We\u2019re actually going to be going in the opposite direction for a while probably. I\u2019m trying to figure out exactly how to put these pieces together in a coherent way because to me it\u2019s a bit confusing in terms of how we\u2019re expressing it.  Can somebody help me figure out how the markets and others ought to interpret these sorts of conflicting messages", " MR. MEYER.  I\u2019m going to do something dangerous by disagreeing with my boss", " MR. EVANS.  Well, I\u2019m just saying one of the concerns, I think, throughout this is we don\u2019t get rates up.  If term premiums are going up, then certain rates are going up even more.  The balance is what we presumably care about.  You\u2019re talking a lot about morning-call-type issues here with respect to monetary control as opposed to a little bit more emphasis on the monetary policy transition", "  Market expectations widened, and that\u2019s what caused the money market rate\u2014 MR. POTTER.  It\u2019s possible that people just had a trade on, and that\u2019s what we saw unwind at that point", " MR. LACKER.  Before the minutes, you could have been looking at this, right", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just wanted to follow up on what Simon just said, that the only way markets can get a signal from the Committee is to look at tangible objects.  Doesn\u2019t that bring into question putting so much emphasis on the federal funds rate.  It\u2019s a very idiosyncratic market.  It\u2019s moving around in odd ways.  It seems to me you should be emphasizing other interest rates as policy rates and not the federal funds rate", "  We had a Board briefing that was distributed to the Committee\u2014 MR. BULLARD.  There\u2019s certainly a smaller number of players in the market than there has been", " MR. ENGLISH.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right\u2014sorry\u2014if I\u2019m understanding what you\u2019re saying.  I think the funds rate is moving with other short-term market rates about as it has in the past.  I think with the 25 basis point spread between IOER and overnight RRP, that\u2019s likely to continue to be true.  The question in my mind is, if you raise IOER, for example, without raising overnight RRP, what will happen to the funds rate and the whole panoply of short-term market rates.  Will they move up roughly one-for-one with the higher IOER rate or will they move up less than one-for-one. My concern is they\u2019ll move up less than one-for-one and we won\u2019t have the funds rate where we want it, and there are ways of handling that, as President Kocherlakota said.  You could raise IOER more.  Another way would be to raise the overnight RRP rate to provide a better floor and move all short-term rates up.  But, given the spread that you around the table seem to prefer between IOER and overnight RRP, I\u2019m not so worried about the funds rate becoming suddenly an idiosyncratic rate.  It\u2019s kind of moving with other short-term market rates and there are, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, ways of making that a more robust benchmark as well.  Simon may disagree", " MR. POTTER.  No, I think that\u2019s correct.  IOER is what\u2019s really causing that to happen, and that\u2019s reasonably stable.  The issue is whether you need the overnight RRP to support the arbitrage by putting more competition into the market.  I think our feeling is from the testing that it\u2019s helpful, but people could disagree both about how important the overnight RRP is and whether you really need to worry so much about the precise control in the overnight rates, as President Evans was saying. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans, you have a two-hander", " MR. FISCHER.  Right.  We\u2019re going to let the interest rate go down.  Why do we want to let the market work once every quarter and not otherwise.  Why do we want to not use the rate for the rest of the quarter", "  Then we just move up the overnight RRP\u2014 MR. EVANS.  Yes.  I think it\u2019s a little cleaner if we get as far as 100 basis points on the IOER rate and overnight reverse repo rate is 50 basis points and the funds rate is 50 basis points.  It might have to start off a little bit higher, but once we get going, wouldn\u2019t everything move up the same way.  Or are there added difficulties with a wide spread", " MR. MEYER.  Presumably that restricts bank lending, but it might just shift borrowing out of banks into nonbanks", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the general approach in the revised principles and strategies of normalization.  I\u2019d also prefer the reorganized revised principles, though I do have a few suggestions. First, I view the use of the federal funds rate as a communication tool rather than a hard target.  This is consistent with the second main bullet in the reorganized revised principles memo that says, \u201cThe Committee intends to adjust the stance of monetary policy primarily through actions that influence the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term rates.\u201d  I like that phrasing.  \u201cInfluence\u201d is not the same as \u201ctarget.\u201d  Specifically, we are communicating using a federal funds range, but it is important to move short-term rates more generally.  I am less concerned about a thinly traded market dominated by the GSEs.  I would like some more background provided at future meetings on federal funds trading patterns to get a better understanding of the arbitrage relative to IOER, as President Lockhart had suggested. Second, I like the principles document having no numbers.  Precise numbers have a way of becoming hardwired and difficult to change.  I would prefer that we not hardwire details until we are more confident about how markets will react to our actions and gain experience that can help us better understand the interrelationships among the IOER, the overnight reverse repo facility, and the federal funds rate. Given the concerns raised about the overnight reverse repo facility, it may be worth making a technical change that would help us infer how much we can rely on the IOER alone.  I would suggest that we make a technical adjustment to the IOER of perhaps 5 or 10 basis points at a meeting prior to when we officially begin to tighten policy.  If all relevant short-term rates move up, we can have more confidence that we can more heavily rely on IOER as our policy instrument. I would also note that I would view it as a significant problem if we observed little response by other relevant short-term rates through an announcement that we were tightening policy by 25 basis points using only the IOER.  We have said in speeches and testimony that we are confident that we can raise rates when that becomes appropriate.  Announcing our intention to raise short-term rates with only modest reactions from short rates other than our administered rate would seriously harm our credibility and could lead to unnecessary financial turbulence. We need to carefully balance the goal of meeting our monetary policy objectives with the legitimate concerns raised about the reverse repo facility.  I would view the initial announcement to tighten as critical to meet our monetary policy objectives.  Depending on the market reaction, I would then adjust the reverse repo facility and potentially the IOER\u2212ON RRP rate spread. In terms of the caps, I would eliminate the dynamic aggregate circuit breaker.  The two main concerns raised at the previous meeting regarding the reverse repo facility were that the facility would have too large a footprint in short-term credit markets, and that the facility would exacerbate financial-stability problems during periods of financial turmoil.  Having a large initial spread and an initial overall cap seems sufficient to avoid these two issues.  However, the dynamic aggregate circuit-breakers do not as effectively address either concern and will be quite complicated to explain.  For example, I am not sure why I should be concerned with declines or surges in the reverse repo facility take-up that have been primarily influenced by end-of-quarter window-dressing, which largely reflects decisions being made by foreign branches.  Better understanding the role of foreign branches in short-term credit markets at future meetings would also be useful. In addition, it is not obvious to me that a $100 billion change in the use of our overnight reverse repo facility constitutes an alarming change in short-term markets or will significantly affect the global supply of short-term credit.  Given the size of financial markets, and the fluctuations in the facility to date, the dynamic cap is set quite low and would likely be influenced by one-day declines or surges that seem immaterial as long as the overall cap is not breached. I would also prefer to keep the caps simple.  A complicated structure may imply more permanence than necessary.  I would imagine an initial cap that would be lowered when it becomes clear that the IOER is sufficient to move short-term market rates when that is appropriate.  The key point is that we need to be confident that we can move short-term market interest rates when that is appropriate.  We can scale the reverse repo facility flexibly as we learn more about how rates react to our actions.  I think the revised principles make clear that this is a temporary facility. Finally, I would not rule out using our balance sheet for financial-stability purposes, which is relevant to President Kocherlakota\u2019s comments.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thanks to some helpful memos from the staff and from some other Committee participants, I can be relatively brief on the questions on the table today.  There is one important issue I would like to spend a little time on.  I\u2019ll save it for last. First, I support the general structure of the approach to conducting monetary policy during normalization outlined by the staff, including the directive and the statement.  Like President Plosser, I don\u2019t see a need for the proposed delegations of authority to the Chair.  In the past, we have been able to schedule videoconference meetings on very short notice.  And in this instance, the potential need for consultation is fairly predictable, so we might even want to schedule a videoconference in advance for the week after our liftoff announcement. As for the structure of the overnight reverse repurchase facility, I very much share the concerns expressed eloquently by Governors Tarullo and Powell and President Plosser.  I strongly support their proposal for a significantly lower overall cap.  I agree with President Rosengren; I don\u2019t believe a surge cap is necessary.  It\u2019s complicated and a bit too fussy.  I also support President Kocherlakota\u2019s proposal to issue a public consultation paper.  The implementation of such a facility is clearly as consequential as many other things that we\u2019ve put out for public comment on the grounds that they have an effect on the industrial organization of a particular sector.  And I think there are useful things we could learn from the process, despite all the research that the Desk has done. Regarding the spread between the IOER and the overnight RRP rates, 25 basis points is about the smallest spread I could support, including the option outlined today by the staff of leaving the interest rate on ON RRPs at 5 basis points when we lift off.  If the RP rate doesn\u2019t rise, we can raise IOER within a week or two and limit the egg-on-the-face phenomenon to a relatively short time horizon. Regarding the spread between the IOER and the discount window rate, the rate on primary credit, I question leaving it at 50 basis points.  We haven\u2019t discussed this at all, and we haven\u2019t seen any staff analysis.  We had a fairly thoroughgoing study when we first set the spread at 100 basis points more than a decade ago.  I think it deserves more thought, and I think the Committee would benefit from staff analysis of the pros and cons of a spread of 50 basis points versus restoring what I thought we carried around as our view of the normal spread of  100 basis points. For the most part, I support the new statement of our normalization principles.  I particularly support the revisions to the second bullet point that emphasize the possibility that we could withdraw and wind down the program, and that we intend to use it only as a supplementary tool. Finally, I would like to make a few observations about the plans for our holdings of the securities issued by or backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  There is a tension within the principles as written, and President Plosser raised this question during a Q&A.  In one sub-bullet we state that we don\u2019t intend to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities.  In the second-to-last bullet, we say we want to minimize the effect of reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.  And these two, I think, directly conflict.  If we want to minimize credit allocation, we would obviously plan to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities as soon as possible. You might be wondering what credit allocation looks like.  Fortunately, the staff has provided us with quantitative estimates of the effects.  An August 28, 2012, memo reports the estimates of the effects of buying $500 billion of long-term U.S. Treasury securities and compares that with the effects of buying $500 billion in MBS.  Buying Treasuries is estimated to lower both mortgage rates and the Treasury term premium by the same amount, 21 basis points.  Buying MBS is estimated to lower mortgage rates by more, as you\u2019d expect, 24 basis points, but to lower the term premium by less, only 16 basis points.  Combining these estimates implies that by holding MBS rather than Treasuries, we are lowering mortgage rates but raising the term premium on long-term Treasury securities.  For example, if we sold all of our $1.7 trillion in MBS and bought Treasuries with the proceeds, the theoretical effect would be to raise mortgage rates by 10 basis points, but to lower the Treasury term premium by 17 basis points.  And we have been operating on the notion that the Treasury term premium passes through to other people\u2019s borrowing rates, so borrowers outside the housing market are, in essence, paying higher interest rates by 17 basis points as a result of us choosing to hold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities instead of U.S. Treasuries. Now, there may be reasons for variance", "  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  And the staff may have updated the rest of this, but these are the estimates on which we based our decisionmaking in September 2012, when we embarked on the latest purchase program.  I think they\u2019re the best we have to go on regarding this effect.  So this is a measure, a 27 basis point twist in relative borrowing rates, that we\u2019re engineering by holding MBS instead of Treasuries alone. Now, you might be tempted to resolve this tension by deleting the clause about minimizing credit allocation, but that\u2019s not the only source of tension.  For several decades now the Committee has had standing guidelines for the conduct of System open market operations in federal agency issues.  They state that \u201cSystem open market operations in federal agency issues are not designed to support individual sectors of the market or to channel funds into issues of particular agencies.\u201d  Now, it\u2019s true that these guidelines were temporarily suspended in January 2009, but we did not abolish them, and they\u2019re still on the Board\u2019s website. Moreover, these guidelines have deep roots in Federal Reserve history.  They were first adopted in August 1971, a few years after Congress passed legislation authorizing Federal Reserve purchases of federal agency securities.  They did that with the intent to allow the Fed to buy the obligations of Fannie Mae and Federal Home Loan Banks to support the housing market.  The Board did not want to buy agency securities, and the FOMC initially instructed the Desk to just test doing repos in agency securities but to hold off making outright purchases.  But Congress repeatedly pressured the Fed to use its authority to make outright purchases and had some very contentious hearings on the subject.  Senator Proxmire explicitly threatened legislation to reduce the Fed\u2019s independence. For a time the Fed resisted.  Chairman William McChesney Martin testified that to have any effect on mortgage rates, the Fed would necessarily have to restrict credit to other sectors of the economy, such as state and local governments and business borrowers, consistent with our staff\u2019s 2012 estimate.  He said that it would \u201cviolate a fundamental principle of sound monetary policy in that it would attempt to use credit-creating powers of the Central Bank to subsidize programs benefiting special sectors of the economy.\u201d  Arthur Burns wrote in a similar context, \u201cDecisions as to social priorities in the use of credit are inherently political in character.  If such decisions are to be made at all, they should be made by the Congress, not by an administrative and nonpolitical body such as the Federal Reserve.  After all, tilting credit in favor of some borrowers implies denying credit to someone else.\u201d The most problematic source of tension surrounding our MBS holdings, however, is the March 2009 joint statement by the Department of Treasury and the Federal Reserve, titled \u201cThe Role of the Federal Reserve in Preserving Financial and Monetary Stability.\u201d  The second point in that document states, \u201cActions taken by the Federal Reserve should also aim to improve financial or credit conditions broadly, not to allocate credit to narrowly defined sectors or classes of borrowers.  Government decisions to influence the allocation of credit are the province of fiscal authorities.\u201d So here we are, quite clearly engaged in credit allocation.  Our holdings of Fannie and Freddie securities are lowering mortgage rates by 10 basis points and raising borrowing costs outside the home mortgage arena by 17 basis points, and yet the official policy of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury is that influencing the allocation of credit is the province of fiscal authorities and not the Federal Reserve.  I don\u2019t see how to reconcile these two.  I don\u2019t see how we can justify deciding on our very own that more housing activity and less business investment would be a good thing.  I don\u2019t think we can claim we are ameliorating a dysfunctional market for mortgage-backed securities, as we might have plausibly claimed at the end of 2008.  I don\u2019t see us arguing that we should hold onto Fannie and Freddie securities to avoid realizing capital losses and impairing our remittances to Treasury.  I also don\u2019t see how to ignore the political risks associated with continuing to hold Fannie and Freddie securities indefinitely.  The longer we hold them, the longer the door is open to what I think are mischievous efforts to involve us more deeply or permanently in housing finance. GSE legislation came close to passing in the Senate earlier this year, and it failed because of an apparent inability to bridge the gap between the desire of affordable housing advocates for more resources and the desire of others to limit the resources extracted from the housing finance sector for that purpose.  It seems plausible to me that some bright minds on the Hill will turn to the Fed\u2019s balance sheet to attempt to bridge that gap.  After all, our balance sheet has been raided in the past to provide ersatz solutions to fiscal problems. So I continue to believe it\u2019s a mistake for us to buy and hold securities issued by or backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.  I recognize I may be out of step with the brave new world of central bank activism.  I recognize that our long journey into housing finance is less troublesome to many of the participants in this Committee, but from a broader historical perspective, this strikes me as an important component of our deliberations today, one that deserves careful thought.  Should we continue along the path we seem to be on, of holding Fannie and Freddie securities to maturity, I believe some public explanation of our stance on credit allocation is necessary.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell", " MR. FISHER.  If I may, Madam Chair, Vice Chairman Dudley, I\u2019m not quite sure I understand why, if we are to reduce or taper reinvestments, it forestalls our raising rates.  Could you walk me through that, please", " MR. FISHER.  We have a difference of opinion, though, because I think it really is a function of communication, what we signal ahead of time.  On the second point, if I may, Madam Chair, still, \u201cat some point\u201d is a very broad hole you can drive a truck through.  One possibility, just drop that and say \u201cafter it begins increasing.\u201d  I just want to consider that.  It may not be \u201cshortly,\u201d but when we say \u201cat some point\u201d it\u2019s indefinite", " MS. MESTER.  This is a question for David Wilcox.  I notice that in the Tealbook you basically assumed that the weakness in health-care spending is going to be temporary, and then you adjusted your potential growth accordingly.  We have a lot of business contacts from health care in our District, and they think there may be something more fundamental going on.  Revenue growth at hospitals is way down, and one contact said there\u2019s consumerism going on and, even though there\u2019s the Affordable Care Act, people are now shopping for medical care and may be refraining from taking procedures. So I was wondering, if you assumed in the Tealbook that it was a more permanent decline in the rate of spending on medical care, how would that show up in the forecast.  Would it basically be a reduction in GDP growth.  Would it affect potential.  And then what does it mean for the gap, in your estimate", " MR. EVANS.  This observation has come up a couple of times.  The\u2014what is it, 0.3 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate in history is always associated with a recession, and yet statistical models don\u2019t live by that rule.  Do you have any guidance for us on how to think about those types of anomalies, David", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As usual, I found the financial stability report to be very useful.  I\u2019d like to especially thank the staff for the incorporation of financial-stability risks into the analysis of macroeconomic risks, and here I\u2019m thinking of the discussions of low equity volatility, on page 46 of Tealbook, Book A; credit market turbulence, on page 58 of Tealbook, Book A; and the China crisis memo. I really like the dashboard in the QS report.  This was on page 2.  I think it could be enhanced even further by reducing the number of words in it and just having colors\u2014simplifying it further for policymakers.  You know, it could be highlighted even more.  I don\u2019t think it was brought forward in the presentation today, and I think it\u2019s a great way to frame the assessment of financial-stability risks. Madam Chair, I have three comments about three financial-stability issues.  The first is about bank legal risk.  The second is about a way to incorporate more information into the financial-stability briefing.  And the third is about the overnight reverse repo facility.  The last two are very brief. In terms of legal risk, the QS report noted the potential for legal risk, which is exemplified by recent misconduct findings against very large banks, to shock the financial system.  This legal risk kind of shock could raise concerns about counterparty risk, which in turn could lead to liquidity shortages.  I think we\u2019ve made good steps to bolster the financial system against these kinds of episodes, but such liquidity threats have to be seen as remaining very serious in the context of resolution regimes that still are in need of substantial enhancements. Now, I think this legal risk is a nice example of how possible financial instability need not imply that we should keep monetary policy less accommodative than otherwise.  After all, there is no sense in which you can reduce legal risk by raising interest rates or reducing the size of our balance sheet.  In fact, the presence of this risk could actually be seen as arguing for more accommodation, not less.  Here\u2019s what I mean by that.  A negative systemic shock caused by the realization of legal risk that occurs after liftoff could lead us back to the zero lower bound, and at that point, definitionally, we would be unable to provide as much stimulus as we would like in order to offset the shock. How should monetary policy respond to the risk of hitting the zero lower bound in the future.  Well, the basic conclusion of the macro literature is that risk of insufficient stimulus in the future implies that it\u2019s optimal to preemptively provide additional current stimulus.  So potential instability due to legal risk is actually a reason to keep interest rates lower than otherwise, not a reason to keep monetary policy tighter than otherwise. In terms of additional information, again, here I\u2019m going to be brief.  The QS financial stability report is based only on public information.  I think the stability analysis coming to the FOMC could benefit from more direct incorporation of assessments based on supervisory evaluations.  Now, these assessments are based on information that\u2019s private to the Fed, and I\u2019m sure that the public pretty much expects the FOMC to be able to use this private information to inform our assessments of financial-stability risks. To be clear, if we so desired, this analysis based on supervisory information could be entirely separate from the current QS analysis, and it could, if so desired, remain at the aggregate level to avoid discussions of specific firms.  I think it could be very helpful to have this kind of information brought in at an aggregate level.  There\u2019s no reason necessarily to be discussing specific firms.  So that\u2019s the additional information piece. In terms of the overnight reverse repo facility, what I took away from the thrust of the dialogue we heard earlier today is that the overnight facility will end up being used during the course of liftoff.  At the same time, I think both the staff and participants have pointed to potential financial-stability risks associated with the usage of that facility.  It would be useful, I think, to begin the process of incorporating those kinds of risks into the financial stability report that the Committee receives.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MR. FISHER.  I agree with President George.  This is developed so well.  I think it is much more helpful and gives us greater insight.  I just want to turn to the report on China very quickly, which I thought was superb, and I\u2019m going to counter what my respected colleague, President Kocherlakota, just argued.  I\u2019ll use that as an example, because a couple of things leapt out at me from that report. One is residential investment as a percentage of GDP going from 3 to 10 percent.  That\u2019s comparable with what happened in Ireland, by the way, even though it\u2019s a tinier country, and we know what the consequences were.  But it also strikes me that the overall increase in credit in China over the period of 2007 to 2013 is actually larger than what happened in Korea prior to the 1997 crisis, in Mexico prior to the crisis of 1994, and in Thailand prior to the crisis in 1997.  Here we have a much more integrated relationship with China, a deeper relationship between China and two of the countries that I just mentioned and the rest of that part of the world. Now, this just makes me pray that we will have lessened the amount of accommodation we have.  We will have tightened, however slightly, toward a more hawkish direction, whatever tiny bit, so that perhaps, if this were to lead to the kind of reaction that is illustrated by the graph that you presented in this summary this afternoon, we\u2019d have a few bullets to shoot, because we are at risk here, having become as integrated as we have. So I want to thank you especially for the report on China.  That was thoroughly done.  It does raise the risk of globalization.  If anything, it makes me want to push even further on tightening the screws a little bit so we have something in reserve, just in case things fall apart.  It doesn\u2019t lead me to conclude we should be more accommodative.  It leads me to conclude that we should be better prepared.  That\u2019s the point, and I wanted to thank you for that report.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman Dudley", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  That\u2019s my point.  You\u2019re not that attached to this particular assumption, so wouldn\u2019t it make sense to explore a range of assumptions just to see what happens", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I complained last time about this memo that said that long-term inflation expectations are centered at 1.75 percent instead of at 2 percent.  I don\u2019t really think that that\u2019s right.  At least, you should present results for the person who thinks inflation expectations are still centered at 2.  Then what would the optimal policy rate path look like.  That would be helpful.  Or, if you think medium- or longer-term inflation expectations have drifted up, then what would the optimal policy rate path look like here.  That would be a variant on what Vice Chairman Dudley said regarding changing assumptions\u2014but I think of changing assumptions in a somewhat different way than what he was describing and exploring. Also, I have to say, to come into a policy meeting and present this kind of stuff right before we\u2019re looking at the alternatives\u2014I think it would be more helpful to do something that would say, \u201cIf you choose alternative C, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.  If you choose alternative A, here\u2019s what you\u2019ll get.  And if you choose alternative B\u201d\u2014that would be more appropriate at this point in the meeting than coming with a simulation that stimulates a long debate here.  Thank you", " MR. WILCOX.  President Bullard, we\u2019ll be happy to take a look at that.  It would, I think, really help advance the dialogue if you\u2019d like to put forward evidence that supports your presumption that 2 percent is a better estimate.  We took our best shot in the memo in June at putting forward our evidence, and it would be really constructive to have some dialogue about that.  So I\u2019d very much welcome an alternative statement of empirical judgment.  I recognize that different model specifications will generate different answers, so there\u2019s room for lots of disagreement.  But I think the way to advance the conversation would be to have that", " MR. BULLARD.  Well, the Committee has specifically and repeatedly said in public statements that longer-term inflation expectations are stable.  What you\u2019re saying is that they\u2019re drifting down, and, because they\u2019re drifting down, we have to take policy action.  That\u2019s what these things are saying.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m passionate about this.  It\u2019s conflicting with what the Committee has said publicly.  If you think the Committee should say something else, then give that as policy advice", " MR. BULLARD.  I\u2019m referring to paragraph 1 of the FOMC statement, the last sentence:  \u201cLonger-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\u201d  This is what the Committee has repeatedly said", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support reducing the pace of asset purchases at this meeting as described in alternative B.  I think two aspects of the draft statement for alternative B are likely to garner the most attention in market commentary.  One is the change in our inflation language at the end of paragraph 2.  Those changes make eminent sense because of the firming we\u2019ve seen in the inflation numbers of late. The other focus of attention is going to be the characterization of labor markets in the first paragraph.  I think it makes sense to drop \u201cremains elevated\u201d at this meeting and to note that labor market conditions have improved and the unemployment rate has declined further.  The next sentence gives me pause, however.  We qualify our acknowledgment of labor market improvements by citing \u201ca range of labor market indicators\u201d suggesting that \u201cthere remains significant underutilization\u201d of resources.  As I noted in my comments during the economic go-round yesterday afternoon, there is always more underutilization than indicated by U-3.  The question should be whether there\u2019s more underutilization than usually occurs when U-3 equals 6.1 percent, and the answer to that question is ambiguous.  Yesterday I pointed to some research that\u2019s consistent with U-3 being a good summary statistic rather than not, but I realize there are some around the table who disagree.  Clearly, though labor market conditions are improving.  By shifting attention from unemployment to other indicators, we risk confusing the public.  We also risk being seen as cherry-picking the data to bolster a case for stimulus. The key issue we need to face in the coming months is the disparity between the sense of the pace of tightening that we have and the market\u2019s sense of that pace.  Some people have made reference to that around the table here.  I think we\u2019d prefer to see that convergence take place smoothly, and, to me, this is another reason to avoid downplaying labor market improvements by shifting attention away from the unemployment rate. The disparity between our expected funds rate path and the market\u2019s suggests to me that the last sentence in our statement, which says that \u201ceconomic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run,\u201d is having, perhaps, a greater effect than we intended.  Now, if you look at it, it\u2019s going to be a sentence that\u2019s going to be hard to walk away from, in the sense that it\u2019s hard for me to see how we\u2019d be able to explain, at any given juncture, why we\u2019re removing that sentence just then, since it\u2019s about something way out in the longer run, but maybe we can.  But an alternative means of addressing this disparity problem that I talked about between the market\u2019s path and ours would be to avoid downplaying the SEP dot plot in public.  I know it has its limitations.  I know everyone has some complaints about it.  But it\u2019s one of the best vehicles we have for communicating how we expect the funds rate to unfold, particularly the steepness of the path after takeoff.  So in our public communications, I\u2019d urge some support for the dot picture. CHAIR YELLEN.  Could I just mention that I did, in fact, point to the dot plot specifically, voluntarily [laughter], in my recent press conference, for exactly the reason you gave. If I could make one other comment, I recognize, as I said in my summary, that there are disagreements among us about whether U-3 is a sufficient statistic or not, and I did not interpret the new language in paragraph 1 as intending to take any position on that matter at all.  I don\u2019t see it that way.  It\u2019s, I think, a perfectly good sentence even if U-3 is a sufficient statistic.  Even by that metric, one could say there is significant underutilization.  But I wanted to emphasize that I don\u2019t see that sentence as opining on whether U-3 is sufficient or not", " MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B today.  There\u2019s not been a significant enough change in the outlook to warrant deviating from the path of tapering asset purchases by another $10 billion per month.  My expectation is that we\u2019ll announce in September that the program will conclude in October. I do have two concerns about the language.  First, as we discussed, we\u2019ve seen considerable improvement in the economy over time\u2014in fact, more improvement in labor market conditions than was anticipated.  And the outlook on labor markets has, if anything, improved since June.  So I\u2019m concerned about introducing the language that there\u2019s \u201csignificant underutilization of labor resources\u201d into paragraph 1. Now, we can reasonably disagree about estimates of the level of underutilization.  My concern is more about the message this new language will send.  In particular, to me, the language suggests we\u2019re more concerned about labor market developments now than we were in June or earlier in the year\u2014and perhaps even then, our estimates of the degree of underutilization increased\u2014yet the data, our forecasts, and our discussion belie that.  So I would suggest we drop the qualifier \u201csignificant\u201d and not give any characterization of the degree of underutilization, saying simply that \u201cthere remains underutilization.\u201d Omitting any qualifier provides a wide umbrella for different views on the Committee about the amount of underutilization.  I don\u2019t view that as inconsistent with the Chair\u2019s testimony.  I also believe it would set us up better for the next meeting.  We will have two employment reports before our September meeting, one coming out this Friday, as well as a new round of FOMC projections.  A qualifier on the degree of underutilization could become obsolete as early as our next meeting.  But a change in that statement language will get noticed.  In fact, our statements are a little bit like Hotel California\u2014words check in, but it\u2019s hard to get them to check out.  [Laughter]  So I think we\u2019d better take that into account and not create a future communications issue for ourselves. My second concern, which I talked about last time, is with our forward guidance on the federal funds rate.  The end of the asset purchase program is looming, and a rate increase is anticipated sometime next year.  Pretty soon, it\u2019s going to be both necessary and desirable for us to change that forward guidance that indicates the first increase will be \u201ca considerable time\u201d after the purchase program ends.  Liftoff has been moving closer, not further away.  We\u2019ve seen more rapid improvement in the economy than many anticipated, and both the Tealbook federal funds rate path and the June SEP path are steeper than market expectations.  That\u2019s true of the dealer survey.  It\u2019s true of the federal funds futures and Eurodollar futures paths.  So I think what we should be doing is to do our best to better align the public\u2019s expectations with our own view about the path, and we should do that before we get too close to the liftoff date.  My hope is that the combination of a press conference, the release of the new SEP numbers, and the probable release of normalization principles will make the September meeting a good one to revise our forward guidance.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard", " MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, I agree with Governor Fischer that we are well ahead of where we expected to be.  Last year at this time, we expected to be at 7 percent unemployment, and we expected to be done with the QE program.  Instead, we\u2019re at 6.1 percent unemployment, and the QE program has not been completed yet.  I\u2019m willing to support alternative B for today with a change to the phrase \u201csignificant underutilization of labor resources.\u201d  And I\u2019m agreeing with President Mester.  I propose that we simply eliminate the word \u201csignificant.\u201d  To me, the word \u201csignificant\u201d would apply to a situation in which we have 8 percent unemployment or 9 percent unemployment.  We\u2019ve come down to a much lower level, and, even on the other dimensions of labor market performance, things have improved.  So I think we can just say \u201cunderutilization\u201d and get the point across.  I like President Mester\u2019s characterization that we don\u2019t want to set ourselves up for difficulties in changing the language, as we have more labor reports coming and we are expecting reasonably good news, we hope, in those reports.  So you would eliminate one word.  The phrase would be \u201cthere remains underutilization of labor resources,\u201d which I think is a perfectly fine characterization of what\u2019s going on.  This would better reflect the labor market situation, in my view.  That\u2019s my only suggested change to the statement today.   Let me make a few comments on alternative A, which was more direct in noting alternative labor market indicators.  If we go in this direction in the future, I would encourage the Committee not to cite the labor force participation rate.  Some of you know that I gave a speech called \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Labor Force Participation in the United States.\u201d  That was a review of the literature on labor force participation.  My take on this is that demographic models explain nearly all of the decline in labor force participation since 2000.  Demographically-based models developed in 2006 are basically spot-on with their predictions of where labor force participation would be today.  And most of these models predict that labor force participation will continue to decline in the quarters and years ahead.  That\u2019s basically on a downward path.  Labor force participation has not historically had a significant cyclical component.  So I think that, if we would lean more on that interpretation of the labor force participation rate, we would get better unemployment forecasts.  That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing in recent years.  I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to be more accurate on what was going to happen with unemployment.  The other labor market indicators, other than labor force participation, might be reasonable\u2014persons working part time for economic reasons, for instance.  But labor force participation, I think, is a special category that is driven by factors outside of the control of monetary policy. I would also say this about other indicators of the labor market health, other than the unemployment rate:  I think we need better empirical evidence that would justify citing these particular measures in the statement as they are in alternative A, if we ever wanted to go in that direction.  I\u2019m doubtful that we can get improved empirical performance by adding one of the lesser-cited labor market indicators to variables in a VAR or a related empirical model.  In other words, the marginal contribution of adding a labor market indicator of that nature is probably small or zero.  So I think that, until we have some evidence of that nature, I would not raise those kinds of indicators to the level of putting them in the statement.  I understand that we, of course, want to talk about all information that\u2019s in front of the Committee, but to raise it to that level says that it\u2019s a variable that can really explain a lot about what\u2019s going on in the macroeconomy.  And I don\u2019t think the lesser-cited labor market indicators can do that or can meet that kind of test.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I would be opposed to removing the word \u201csignificant\u201d in paragraph 1.  I think, especially since that word appeared in your Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, it\u2019s appropriate to leave it in at this time. I do agree with some of the comments from participants around the table that we will need to revisit the words \u201cconsiderable time\u201d in the very near term and try to provide more clarity about what exactly we mean by that.  I would hope we do that in terms of economic conditions and not so much in terms of dates, but I think that, very soon, in the September\u2013October time frame, we\u2019re really going to be put in a position of having to try to answer some tough questions about that. For a long period of time, this Committee has been struggling with the employment mandate and focused on the employment mandate as really the main challenge facing us.  I\u2019m increasingly thinking that the big challenge for us is really on price stability, and the perhaps overly extended dialogue that we had leading into this round highlights some of those challenges.  Staff estimates right now are that inflation expectations are 1\u00be percent.  I think that, if you carefully read the memo that we received in June, this estimate is unduly generous to this Committee.  If you actually read the numbers behind the assessment, you could have gone with a lower number, as Mr. Wilcox mentioned earlier, in fact. We heard lots of passion yesterday about the loss of credibility associated with missing the federal funds rate target range by 10 basis points for one day.  We need to bring that same level of passion, or even more, to the prospect of missing our inflation target by 25 basis points or more over an extended period.  When we have a flat Phillips curve, that miss of 25 basis points represents lots of resource loss and lots of underutilization.  And I\u2019m concerned that FOMC participants seem comfortable with long-run misses of inflation.  Maybe I\u2019m misreading the conversation\u2014I apologize if I am.  But I am concerned that I\u2019m hearing a degree of sanguineness about having inflation underrun our target for a very long period of time. President Evans asked me if I had some good points to make, and I said I didn\u2019t, but I do have a lot of points.  [Laughter]  President Plosser, I think, raised a good point about how our behavior is likely to deviate from rules as we move forward.  One reason for that lies in the behavior of inflation.  Inflation has been so low for so long relative to target that we\u2019re starting to see these estimates of what inflation expectations are drift downward.  That really forces us to be more accommodative than we\u2019d otherwise be, given the current metrics. As we contemplate how to interpret those words \u201cconsiderable time,\u201d my own thinking about how we should be formulating the conditions governing liftoff is really in terms of the inflation mandate and the price stability mandate.  It\u2019s very hard to justify liftoff taking place when the one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation is below 2 percent.  In my mind, there\u2019s no reason for us to be lowering rates simply because unemployment has gotten too low.  That\u2019s built into Tealbook objectives\u2014that there\u2019s a loss associated with unemployment being too low.  I don\u2019t read our statutory mandate as saying that you should not have unemployment be too low.  I don\u2019t read our communications from our long-run goals statement as saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want unemployment to be too low.\u201d  So I would not be supportive of raising rates simply because unemployment has fallen too low. The other piece that\u2019s built into Tealbook objectives is a desire to keep interest rates smooth.  In fact, as the Tealbook, Book B, notes, a lot of weight is put on that.  I don\u2019t see that in our statutory mandates.  I don\u2019t see it in our long-run goals or communications.  For those reasons, I don\u2019t put weight on that in my objective. Accordingly, I would see no reason for us to be raising rates as long as the inflation outlook remained below 2 percent.  I say \u201cno reason.\u201d  There is one reason\u2014potential financial instability concerns, which I\u2019ve talked about in the past.  But I agree with Governor Fischer here.  As long as housing is not being affected by this, it\u2019s really hard for me to see how this is going to get into the broader economy.  That\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see it\u2014in housing.  Until we see it there\u2014and we\u2019re a long way from that, unfortunately\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a risk. When I think about how to reframe \u201cconsiderable time,\u201d it would be to frame it in terms of the necessary condition for liftoff being a one- to two-year-ahead outlook for inflation of 2 percent.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer", " MS. BRAINARD.  Let me start by saying I support alternative B.  In reflecting on the changes in alternative B from the June statement, obviously the new news for all of us is the accelerated pace at which slack is diminishing in the labor market.  That\u2019s really the biggest piece of data that came in well ahead of expectations.  Of course, we\u2019re also seeing signs of a healthier inflation rate and now a lower likelihood that we will not be able to reach 2 percent for a very protracted period of time.  We also don\u2019t see, I think, anything on the financial-stability side that would materially change our inclinations on monetary policy. The anomalous performance, though\u2014the poorly understood performance on GDP and GDI\u2014should give us some pause and, if nothing else, injects considerable uncertainty\u2014and uncertainty that does matter, I think importantly, for monetary policy.  I don\u2019t believe that uncertainty is likely to be greatly resolved at least until the QSS revisions, and possibly not even at that juncture, in September.  Because it\u2019s very difficult to reverse course once liftoff is initiated and because this recovery has proven unusually susceptible to false dawns, I think that, if we have the breathing space to wait for a clear pattern of signals\u2014and the inflation data suggest that we do have that luxury\u2014the prudent course is to digest that additional data before committing decisively. I will say that, on the other side of those considerations, I am troubled that market participant expectations on the date of liftoff and on the path of the federal funds rate seem both late and shallow relative even to the June SEP.  The June SEP path itself is below the July Tealbook projection for the funds rate.  And, as was said earlier, while a policy rule is not particularly binding for these sets of circumstances, I think that, nonetheless, we should be looking at a range of policy rules.  The Tealbook projections, in turn, are later and shallow than prescribed paths from a whole set of policy rules. That growing divergence between market expectations and our internal projections argues in favor of altering the description of economic conditions, as is reflected in the proposed alternative B statement.  I would hope the market would have put greater weight, actually, on the data relative to the forward guidance, based on the statement made by the Chair in her Humphrey-Hawkins testimony.  Here I\u2019m referring to the statement that \u201cif the labor market continues to improve more quickly than anticipated . . . , then increases in the federal funds rate target likely would occur sooner and be more rapid.\u201d  That does not seem to have gotten much traction.  And I would think we would want to see that sentiment, the data dependency, start to dominate the market\u2019s thinking. It\u2019s worth thinking a little bit about the tradeoff between waiting a little longer with a possibly steeper path of rates thereafter, versus moving a little sooner and thinking that we could actually see a somewhat shallower path.  If the dominant consideration is not moving prematurely in the context of considerable uncertainty about the extent of slack, then the later time of liftoff and possibly steeper path thereafter probably are preferable.  If, instead, we were particularly worried about risks to financial stability, then perhaps we would be more inclined toward the sooner, shallower path. It\u2019s helpful, as many people have done here, to discipline our discussions about this thinking forward to a sequence of signals that we would be sending over the next few meetings as more data come in\u2014especially, again, because it\u2019s going to be very difficult to reverse course once that alteration is made.  So I think we would want to tilt toward a more positive read on the elimination of slack and inflation in this statement.  In September, we\u2019ll have the new SEP numbers, which will move considerably\u2014if I hear people around the table correctly\u2014and the market will see that.  The Chair will be giving a press conference, and we\u2019ll also have the principles on exit.  Those things together will give us the potential for adjustments based on the data that we\u2019ll have in the intervening period.  Thereafter, if, in fact, we continue to see this acceleration of the elimination of slack, I do think we have to start moving away from the \u201cconsiderable time\u201d language and altering the forward guidance. With regard to the actual characterization of underutilization, I have to say I share the concerns that have been articulated that the characterization of slack as \u201csignificant underutilization\u201d does seem a bit strong in relation to the data that we\u2019ve seen.  The real concern is, how do you move off of that without sending too strong a signal.  I think Governor Tarullo has suggested two alternatives, and President Mester stated that tradeoff nicely.  Again, I would defer to the Chair, but that is something that I would give a little bit more thought to.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman"], "2014FOMC20140917meeting.txt": [" MR. POTTER.  Probably not", " MR. POTTER.  The diamond is the mean.  The line is the median.  The guys who have these very high numbers are driving up the mean relative to median", " MS. MESTER.  I guess I thought when I read Governor Tarullo and Powell\u2019s memo that they were suggesting announcing at this meeting that we had a plan to test other aspects, not necessarily doing it or being against doing it in two phases.  But we would tell the public that we   are going to be testing this operation in different phases and laying it all out there.  I don\u2019t think that would be that confusing, but maybe you would know better. But I do have a question about the size limit, the $300 billion.  As I read the memo, it seemed to suggest that you think that will bind at the end of the third quarter, which is why you chose that level.  But it only bound once, one day at the end of the second quarter.  You also have in the memo that on 95 percent of the days since the January FOMC meeting, the take-up was $55 billion to $210 billion.  My question is, why wouldn\u2019t you want to lower that limit so that you are assured that it will bind, so that you can actually test the auction.  Because if it doesn\u2019t bind at the end of the third quarter, you miss an opportunity of the test.  I guess size matters here, maybe, for this test", " MR. ENGLISH.  Well, and more broadly on the second issue, what are the tests that people around this table think would be most useful to do after October", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I generally trust the staff when it brings me recommendations about how we should proceed about things, but I find myself a bit skeptical about the need for a flurry of further testing activity here.  I am really confident in the computer code and the technical infrastructure.  Over the past 12 months, the Markets Group has demonstrated great skill and competence and capability of running a facility of this size that is envisioned by the Committee.  I don\u2019t see the auction facility as posing any\u2014and you alluded to this, Lorie\u2014novel challenges.  You have done auctions before.  You have been doing them for decades in the RP market. On changing the amount of the cap to see whether the headroom matters, I think the use of this as a tool is sort of predicated on us setting the size so the headroom generally doesn\u2019t matter.  How would headroom matter.  They\u2019d have to look at the data and figure, all right, usage on a day like today is typically $200 billion.  There is $300 billion headroom.  What are the odds of it stopping out.  How badly do I want it.  Should I put in a bid at four instead of five.  That\u2019s what we are going to find out, right.  Now, I don\u2019t think we are going to run it if when we run it people are putting in four or three rather than five, because it just weakens the effect.  If it\u2019s binding, it is just going to mean a lower RRP rate.  My sense is that if it is binding and the headroom matters, we are going to increase the cap so that it doesn\u2019t matter.  This is consistent with Bill\u2019s description of the philosophy about the cap.  Now, sure, it is going to bind on quarter-end.  Absolutely.  But people are going to look at quarter-ends and they are going to say, \u201cWell, it is going to bind today.  I\u2019d better bid two if I really want to put the money there.\u201d I don\u2019t think varying the RP rate is going to generate a lot of useful data.  Given the magnitude of fluctuations of other things that affect the demand for the usage of this facility,   essentially, I\u2019m not convinced we are going to have much statistical power to estimate some demand curve.  I mean, we are only doing this for a set of days over the rest of the year.  And I think the downside is something that Governors Tarullo and Powell were articulate about.  I think we, arguably, generated expectations of the market running ahead of our expectations, clearly over the summer, to the point at which we heard information about people building business models around it.  I think we are likely to do that again with another burst of testing activity.  I\u2019m just really skeptical about the need for this.  Maybe you can help me understand the precise information that is going to be revealed here and how useful it is going to be for our use of the facility as we go forward", " MR. ENGLISH.  Can I just follow up on what Governor Tarullo just said.  I completely agree, and we\u2019ve tried, I think, in the memos but evidently failed to be clear:  In the end, the   Committee is going to have a tradeoff, a balancing act, between, on the one hand, getting better or worse control over rates, which has some benefits and costs, and, on the other hand, having a program that\u2019s bigger or smaller and, therefore, has bigger or smaller risks and costs associated with footprint and with financial-stability risks.  I think that\u2019s exactly where we\u2019re going to end up\u2014thinking about what the parameters we are going to want to write down ultimately when we are ready to actually try to normalize.  I completely agree with the thought that this isn\u2019t, in some sense, how much do we need to have control and leave the other stuff aside.  It\u2019s going to be a balancing act. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Further comments", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a couple of words I\u2019d like to share.  I know I spoke at length at the previous meeting, but the statement has been revised and there have been a couple of further observations I would like to share.  I will try not to be repetitive. I do support the idea of publishing an updated set of principles regarding our normalization, but I can\u2019t support this version.  I continue to believe it would be a mistake to retreat from asset sales.  The statement goes further than just disavowing asset sales, though.  It singles out, somewhat oddly, agency MBS as an asset class that we don\u2019t anticipate selling.  It does so, almost in passing, without explanation in a subbullet.  I know we haven\u2019t provided any rationale for this change from our 2011 exit strategy principles in public, including in the minutes of the previous meeting.  Doing so, singling out agency MBS to hold on to, makes more glaring the conflict with the statement that immediately follows that in the principles about our interest in minimizing the effect of Federal Reserve holdings on the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.  As I noted in August, I don\u2019t see how to reconcile holding on to Fannie and Freddie securities with that or with the March 23, 2009, Treasury\u2013Federal Reserve joint statement or with our historical opposition to this type of central bank credit allocation.  I also mentioned at our previous meeting that if our holdings of agency MBS are having any effect on interest rates, they are simultaneously raising the interest rates for borrowers outside the   mortgage markets when compared with us holding an identical amount of Treasuries.  I haven\u2019t heard and I don\u2019t see a case for that kind of favoritism. I have two points to make that I haven\u2019t made before.  One is that I recognize the normal conduct of monetary policy via movements in interest rates unavoidably generates distributional effects.  I recognize that central bankers long ago accustomed themselves to those necessary side effects.  Such policy actions, however, worked by adding or draining reserves\u2014a liability of ours\u2014and they can be accomplished quite well with a portfolio consisting only of Treasury securities.  Holding assets other than Treasuries goes beyond what is required for the normal conduct of policy, so I see a fairly sharp categorical distinction between the unavoidable distributional consequences of the normal conduct of policy via interest rate movements and the distributional effects of gratuitously altering the composition of our portfolio. The second point\u2014one factor that appears to loom large in thinking about whether to sell long-term assets is that it is likely to generate losses large enough to wipe out the possibility of remittances to the Treasury at a time when we will be paying large dollar amounts to banks as interest on reserves.  Even though this is of no economic consequence, one can imagine it generating a good deal of carping by public commentators and politicians. I\u2019d point out that if we don\u2019t sell assets, we will generate substantial unrealized losses in a couple of years.  Page 45 of Book B of the Tealbook reports the staff\u2019s projections of our balance sheet and income.  At the end of last year, unrealized losses were $53 billion, just shy of our paid-in capital and surplus of $55 billion.  This did actually spawn a bit of media commentary, even though we still showed positive fair-value net worth of just under $2 billion.  The Tealbook is projecting that unrealized losses will peak at $325 billion at the end of 2016, and our capital then is likely to be around $75 billion.  At that point, it will look as if our fair-  value net worth is about negative $250 billion, and it would be pretty easy, I think, for someone to write a story portraying the Federal Reserve as effectively bankrupt.  Unrealized losses are projected to be close to $300 billion at the end of 2015, and so it is likely to get a lot of attention when these financial statements are released in early 2016.  It is a year and a half away when we are going to face this.  At that point, we are going to have to explain why it is of no consequence that we have effectively gone bankrupt while paying out large sums of money to large banks.  This strikes me as just as difficult as explaining why zero remittances are of no economic consequence.  It is not obvious to me that we would be in much better shape avoiding asset sales in order to continue making remittances to the Treasury.  The point is, we have signed up for some very adverse \u201coptics,\u201d no matter which way we go.  Zero remittances may be hard to explain, but negative fair-value net worth seems just as hard to explain.  To me, this argues for doing what we agreed is the right thing to do and selling long-term assets as we originally planned.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", "   MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.  First of all, I would like to echo Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s comments about the process and listening to everybody.  I think you were very positive in expressing in a memo some of the concerns that I had and listened to the response, and I appreciate that very much.  I also appreciate the fact that it led to some changes that were adopted in the statement. However, I would just like to say, for the record, that I remain uncomfortable with the subbullet that refers to sales of agency and mortgage-backed securities and linking those to reducing residual holdings.  The second main bullet makes clear our intention to reduce the balance sheet primarily through ending repurchases.  I just don\u2019t believe we need to communicate additional reticence over the outright sale of agency debt securities and mortgage-backed securities as part of the normalization process.  While no outright sales may be feasible, given the significant uncertainty surrounding normalization\u2014uncertainty, by the way, that was made abundantly clear in the background memos we received from the staff\u2014it seems to me imprudent and unnecessary to signal such decisions at this point.  It may transpire that adequate control of the funds rate may require us to shrink the balance sheet faster than we now anticipate.  If that were to happen, I would want all potential tools available to proceed under those circumstances.  Further, I remain uncomfortable, as President Lacker so eloquently put it, with the credit allocation policy that this bullet signals. These broad concerns about the balance sheet also lead me to prefer ending reinvestment earlier.  President Lacker just made a very good point, indicating that there are a number of changes we have made from the 2011 principles, and we have done so without much, if any, thorough explanation to the public about why they are being changed.  This suggests we should be reluctant, I think, to insert such tactical considerations in our statement.   Now, the escape clause that the Chair referred to at the end in the final bullet does leave us with our options open.  I will not withhold my assent to these principles as written.  But I continue to believe that we are once again being overly tactical in our messaging on this issue.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard", " MR. PLOSSER.  I prefaced my question", " MR. WILCOX.  That\u2019s a good question, and I don\u2019t have an answer to what the counterfactual increase would have been in the LMCI if there had been an increase of 200,000 in payroll employment", " WILLIAMS.  I have a couple of questions around the Tealbook and the forecast.  I\u2019m trying to understand a couple of issues a little bit better.  One is on fiscal impetus.  The reason I ask is, we still do have in our FOMC statement\u2014and I think we\u2019ll continue to have\u2014a sentence that says, \u201cFiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing,\u201d which I\u2019m sure is factually correct.  I did do a little bit of careful reading of the Tealbook because there\u2019s this wonderful box that goes through that, and it was very helpful.  And then if you go to the Greensheets, there\u2019s actually a line there, quarter by quarter, on federal fiscal impetus.  But I was curious about what the quarterly pattern of total fiscal impetus is, because, at least based on my calculations, we\u2019re probably down to minus a tenth or two in the second half of this year.  So my question is, is that roughly right, and is that really a major factor in thinking about holding back the economy now relative to early this year, when it clearly was", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I ask the question because, when Governor Stein was here, he offered some thoughts about how the level of the term premium could interact with the effectiveness of an LSAP program", "   MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to ask about exhibit 1, \u201cThe Foreign Economic Outlook,\u201d and the \u20ac1 trillion LSAP.  I\u2019m looking at these figures, and I\u2019m interpreting you to be saying that these are conditional.  The red dotted line is conditional on the ECB entering into further LSAPs that are sovereign debt based.  My question is, if you look at the German 10-year yield in figure 5 here, it has fallen about 100 basis points since the beginning of the year.  Some of that could be interpreted as anticipatory effects that have already occurred.  So isn\u2019t some of the LSAP effect already in the European data.  Some of the effects should be showing up in the European data over the forecast horizon even though they haven\u2019t actually done a program", " MR. FISCHER.  I don\u2019t think you can make that statement without saying that there\u2019s a probability of 45 percent that it will not fall below its longer-run level.  The ranges of uncertainty are so massive that sending strong messages about what\u2019s going to happen three years from now seems to me to be potentially misleading", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I do.  Thanks, Madam Chair.  I wanted to follow up on President Williams\u2019s comment.  I certainly agree that the issue of the estimate of longer-run   inflation expectations or the underlying rate of inflation\u2014whatever terminology you want to use\u2014is a really important one for us to engage in more as a Committee.  We talked about it a little bit last time.  It seemed as though there were those who, as President Williams suggested himself, see the evidence differently from the staff and have a different assessment of that.  I heard some participants who felt that a longer-run inflation rate of 1.75 percent was consistent with their reading of our dual-mandate objectives.  And then there were those who suggested that a long time spent below the natural rate of unemployment, as is the staff outlook, could be a risk to inflation expectations.  All of those kinds of considerations would be useful for us to talk through. I think I emphasize the counting in the SEP because I was quite surprised by it, as I was prepared to try to persuade people to have that, and they were already there.  So it looks as though it\u2019ll be your job to persuade them otherwise.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  My views have changed only modestly since the last meeting and are very close to the Tealbook and very close to everybody else around the table.  That said, on the growth side, the economy actually has slightly less forward momentum than I anticipated, and I\u2019m a little less worried that the economy will get away from us on the upside.  Earlier in the year, I thought there was some chance that everything would catch, as you had increases of 250,000 per month in payroll employment, and that all things would start cycling up.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen anymore.  On the inflation side, I don\u2019t see much change at the margin.  Maybe we\u2019re stuck a little bit more firmly below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective.   On economic growth, I\u2019d make a couple of points.  First, I wouldn\u2019t put much into the modest slowdown in payroll employment growth we saw the past couple of months.  The fact is, payroll gains were high relative to the growth pace earlier in the year.  So it shouldn\u2019t surprise us now if we\u2019re experiencing the reverse situation.  Second, I don\u2019t see many sources that would fuel a meaningful pickup in the growth rate from here.  If you think we\u2019re at 3 percent, what\u2019s the likelihood we go to 4 to 5.  I think it\u2019s pretty low.  The fact is, we\u2019ve already experienced most, if not all, of the cyclical rebound in motor vehicle sales.  The cyclical sectors of the economy are no longer depressed cyclically.  And although the housing recovery will probably continue, I think it\u2019s going to be a slog.  The sector is pretty small, so the contribution from housing can\u2019t be very great.  At the margin, the outlook for trade has worsened a little bit, given that the dollar has strengthened.  While the forecast for economic growth is showing improvement as we go forward, at the margin, the risks regarding foreign growth have actually increased a bit from geopolitical tensions and developments in Europe, Japan, China\u2014pretty broadly across the board. I asked myself the question:  Where would a pickup in the pace of economic growth come from.  I guess it would require some combination of a lower personal saving rate, higher real wages, or a faster rebound in capital spending.  But even if that were to occur, I don\u2019t think the impulse, in the aggregate, would be very large.  Of the three, a further improvement in capital spending seems to be the most likely.  The fundamentals are quite positive in that sector.  And the businesspeople I talk to seem to be less risk averse and more willing to take on new projects.  Another support for faster economic growth could be the recent weakness in the prices of oil and gas.  If energy prices were to continue to soften, this would boost real income, and that would provide some further support to aggregate demand.   On the inflation side, we flattened out in terms of core inflation, about \u00bd percentage point short of our 2 percent inflation objective.  I don\u2019t think this is a disaster, especially as long as nominal GDP growth remains north of an annual rate of 4 percent.  My anxiety about inflation is always tied back to what nominal GDP growth is, because I think that the deflation dynamics really flow through nominal GDP rather than directly through inflation.  At the same time, though, I don\u2019t see why inflation is likely to climb in the near term.  I know there\u2019s this pull from inflation expectations, but, on the other side, we have the fact that compensation trends are pretty low relative to actual inflation right now.  The impulses from abroad, from a stronger dollar, and domestically, from falling energy and food prices, are going to be more than sufficient to offset any upward pull from inflation expectations in the near term.  So I\u2019m not concerned about inflation getting away on the upside, either. In terms of risks to the outlook, there are a couple of things that I still worry about.  I\u2019m not going to say \u201cmission accomplished\u201d until we get to the point at which we actually lift off.  First, I worry a little about consumer spending growth because it does seem to be mostly based on job gains rather than real gains in compensation.  If the job gains were to slow, then does the consumption hold up.  Second, I do worry about the dollar strengthening that we\u2019ve seen, and I worry that it could intensify and prove persistent.  In fact, I think to really understand the implications, it would be useful for the Tealbook to consider a scenario in which the dollar keeps strengthening\u2014we had the questions earlier about this.  What does that do in terms of the economic growth and inflation outlook, and how much does it push back the timing of monetary policy tightening", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me first say that I think Governor Fischer is ideally positioned to drive some changes in our communication strategy.  And I think we all look forward to ideas on how to improve the SEP and the communications issues more generally. I join in what sounds like a consensus around the table that things have continued to improve, both generally and in the labor market, to which I\u2019ll turn in a moment.  Actually, in listening to everybody, people sounded a little bit more optimistic and a little bit more upside weighted than I would have characterized myself.  So I looked back at the famous SEP and found that, as a group, our expectations of risk on GDP growth are broadly balanced, with actually a few more people weighted to the downside than the upside.  I thought it was good that Vice Chairman Dudley gave a little bit of the case for caution as opposed to outright optimism. Having said that, though, I think everybody agrees that there\u2019s been considerable improvement in the labor market.  It\u2019s probably worth reminding ourselves that a lot of improvement was needed.  The hole that had been dug was close to being unprecedented, at least the speed with which that hole had been dug.  If you need a reminder, just take a look at the lower-left graph on page 2, I think it is, of the Data Sheets of the Tealbook.  You\u2019ll see there, in the monthly job creation or destruction numbers, just how much those negative numbers plummeted in the 2008\u201309 period, and that\u2019s a lot to make up.  In fact, it\u2019s only relatively   recently that we now have in absolute terms the number of jobs that we had on January 1, 2008, notwithstanding the fact that there have been six and a half years of population growth since then. Now, none of that is to say that we\u2019re going to get back there or what the actual trend is now.  As today\u2019s discussion again showed, even after the couple of years of discussion and debate, we still have disagreement on how much slack remains.  Everyone agrees that a lot has been taken up, but how much does remain no one can really say for sure.  That leads to the kind of comments on the unemployment rate and the various other labor market indicators that we seem now to have at almost every meeting. I think the latest example of data that can be read multiple ways is the rate of job openings, which, as one or two people have mentioned, has risen quite dramatically through the first half of this year to such a degree that the rate is currently near the top of its range of what is, of course, a pretty short history.  Meanwhile, quits and hiring rates have only inched up during this period, continuing their very slow trend from 2009 that leaves them materially short of pre-crisis levels.  And, after a period of edging back toward its pre-crisis position, the Beveridge curve has again shifted out a little bit to the right. As we\u2019ve discussed here in past meetings, the jump in job openings can be read as evidence of mismatch by those who believe that considerable structural damage has occurred in labor markets.  But those who believe the story still has an important cyclical element can and have read this change as a response to improving demand conditions and thus as a possible next step in a virtuous circle that will be followed by increases in hiring, which will further increase aggregate demand.  If you saw the New York Fed\u2019s instant analysis of the JOLTS report last week, you\u2019ll have noted a third explanation, one based on a kind of supply-side view that large   increases in unemployment benefit extensions may put upward pressure on wages and thereby suppress job creation.  In this view, the expiration of the emergency unemployment compensation program at the end of last year could be the source of the significant increase in job openings this year, presumably as employers see a larger pool of labor willing to work at lower wages. Now, how convincing the research on which this last hypothesis is based will prove to be remains to be seen.  The point, though, is that there are numerous plausible explanations for developments in a labor market that has been buffeted by forces arguably unprecedented in modern American economic history.  So we really can\u2019t know if the quit rate or the percentage of those who are employed part time for economic reasons will ever return to their pre-crisis levels.  I suspect that, over the next decade, a lot will be learned about labor market dynamics that had been latent and was then amplified or accelerated by the crisis and recession.  But for now, as I\u2019ve said before, we have to be pretty tentative in our conclusions about longer-run trends and more focused on pragmatic ways to determine when labor market slack is in its final stages of elimination.  I\u2019ve thought and continue to think that it\u2019s useful to exchange views among ourselves on what the best indicators for the approach of such a point are under these circumstances, when labor markets are surely becoming tight.  But the question remains, when do they get to the point at which they\u2019ve now tightened more or less completely. As many people, I think, have already suggested, the best measure is probably the evidence of significant and reasonably widespread and persistent wage gains.  While such gains are now anticipated by more employers and labor market observers, they have yet to be realized to date except for hourly production workers, and, even for those workers, the average increase in wages over the past year was only 2\u00bd percent, which is, of course, less than the sum of   inflation and productivity gains.  While sometimes noisy on a quarter-to-quarter basis, broader gauges of wages and compensation still reveal little evidence of a sustained step-up in the pace of compensation growth.  And if people are concerned about seeing earlier indicators of pressures in some sectors that might spread through the rest of the economy, there still hasn\u2019t been much change in the distribution of wage gains across industries. A second possible indicator that slack is getting closer to disappearing might be rapid changes in some of the indicators that have thus far suggested continuing slack, such as the quits and part-time-for-economic-reasons rates.  A change of this sort wouldn\u2019t be dispositive, of course, but it would raise the question of whether an inflection point might have been reached, which could then be investigated by reference to other data.  Another example of such a secondary indicator might be if we observe another significant increase in job openings without having seen an intervening noticeable pickup in hiring. Of course, with the link between general measures of inflation, on the one hand, and nominal wage growth and tighter labor markets, on the other, being a loose one, I don\u2019t mean to suggest that the long-awaited arrival of larger sustained wage gains should be a mechanical trigger for changes in monetary policy, but that\u2019s a debate for another day.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell", " MS. BRAINARD.  I just want to go back to this \u201cconsiderable time\u201d question.  It\u2019s clearly out there in the market that this language is going to go.  However, if you actually look at the SEP submissions and you look at the actual sentence, it will remain extremely accurate to the day that we lift off.  In a sense, it\u2019s not clear why that sentence would ever need to change, right.  If you think we\u2019re ending asset purchases in October and you think \u201cconsiderable time\u201d means about six months, and if you look at the SEP and it says we\u2019re going to lift off in June, I think   there\u2019s a little bit of a puzzle of how we\u2019ve allowed the markets to think that that language necessarily needs to change at all.  Right now if you look at it literally, it does say October and June, basically.  That\u2019s just a question", " MR. ENGLISH.  I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m interpreting you exactly correctly, but let\u2019s say we did change and made it \u201csome time\u201d after the asset purchase program ends instead of \u201ca considerable time.\u201d  I think that would arguably move expectations up too much.  My read of your SEP contributions was the center of the distribution is in the second quarter of next year, not necessarily June, but still six months or something like that after the end of the purchase program.  I think moving to \u201csome time\u201d would be read as carrying a lot of freight, and would move things up to just a few months after the end of the purchase program in October.  It would be March or maybe even December, and that\u2019s probably earlier than where the center of the Committee is right now", " MR. WILCOX8.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As you, I\u2019m sure, can appreciate, we\u2019ve only had the briefest of glances at the data.  The CPI came in a little weaker than we had been expecting.  The miss to one digit, as you can see on the table that is in your place, rounds to 0.2 percentage point.  To two digits, it\u2019s about 15 basis points.  We think that a very large drop in airfares accounted for somewhere between a third and a half of that.  The PCE price index doesn\u2019t pick up the CPI measure of airfares.  Instead, it uses the PPI measure of airfares, so we think that a significant portion of the forecast miss won\u2019t, in fact, translate into a lower PCE price index.  But beyond that, it does look like there were some softer readings across a fairly wide range of categories.  Yesterday we got the PPI, and the news there was just a little stronger than we had expected.  Medical care prices are relevant for the PCE index, and. as I mentioned, the airfares component of the PPI is relevant.  On balance, my guess is that we are a little to the soft side.  I expect to get a little more precise reading later on this morning, as the meeting is in progress, about how this translates. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Any questions for David", " MR. BULLARD.  We\u2019re catching up to them.  In the first paragraph, we have \u201csignificant underutilization of labor resources.\u201d  I think this should simply be \u201cunderutilization of labor resources,\u201d without the \u201csignificant\u201d qualifier; I thought that, last time.  At the next   meeting we are going to end QE, saying that there\u2019s been significant progress in labor markets.  I think it\u2019s a little bit awkward to then turn around and say there\u2019s \u201csignificant underutilization of labor resources.\u201d  So we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.  In my mind, we would use the word \u201csignificant\u201d when unemployment was at 8 percent or other indicators were otherwise extremely far from normal, but everything has come closer to normal\u2014not all the way, but closer to normal.  I think we should just say \u201cthere remains underutilization of labor resources.\u201d In the first paragraph, we also continue to say \u201cfiscal policy is restraining economic growth.\u201d  The discussion yesterday indicated that I think that\u2019s factually correct but increasingly questionable as something to put in this first paragraph.  Maybe we should think about striking that at some point.  It sounds like the staff estimates are down to 0.1 percentage point or something like that.  I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s reasonable to have that kind of an empirical finding elevated to something that the Committee puts in a policy statement. In paragraph 5, we say \u201cA highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.\u201d  I question whether we should say \u201chighly accommodative.\u201d  This is something we said when QE was at its very peak, and we were announcing QE plus a zero-interest-rate policy plus continued forward guidance.  Now we\u2019re pulling back on the QE policy.  The forward guidance is not nearly as strong as it was.  Is it really the same policy that we had when we first put this language in.  I think just \u201caccommodative stance of monetary policy\u201d remains appropriate.  And certainly, as long as the policy rate is below its neutral level, we would be saying something like that, but I question whether we can maintain the word \u201chighly\u201d if we\u2019re pulling back on other elements of our policy. In paragraph 5, I would switch \u201cconsiderable time\u201d after QE ends to \u201csome time\u201d\u2014not at this meeting, but at the October meeting\u2014to give us more optionality for what we\u2019re going to   need to do in coming meetings.  Again, I would be much more opportunistic than what I think the Committee is envisioning here.  If we get some good data, then we should go ahead and make a move.  I\u2019m not expecting to mechanically go up for 16 meetings in a row.  I do not think that is optimal policy.  I think when we have a chance to react to data, we want to take it.  When the data are not so strong, we might want to pause.  I think if we could get the Committee to behave in that manner, it would be a better policy for the U.S. economy.  So I\u2019d be willing to switch to \u201csome time\u201d in October.  President Plosser has suggested an even better change to paragraph 5, which is to eliminate the last sentence and make the entire paragraph dependent on the state of the economy.  The Committee will make a judgment about when to act.  I think a good dynamic for the Committee would be to get into a rhythm of, \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good data, our confidence has increased a little bit, we\u2019re willing to raise rates a little bit in response to that,\u201d as opposed to the very mechanical episode from 2004 to 2006.  Removing that last sentence completely would remove the calendar-based policy altogether in favor of a state-dependent policy.  That would probably be a good move for the Committee to make.  That completes my comments for today.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the general path we are on, embodied in alternative B.  I\u2019ll cut to the issues of the day here.  I was among those who did not favor the use of the word \u201csignificant\u201d regarding underutilization of labor resources at the last meeting, and, for the record, I remain in that camp.  I understand no change seems likely at this meeting, but I would like to make one observation about that language.  It doesn\u2019t have to take a significant improvement in labor market underutilization to warrant dropping the word \u201csignificant\u201d about labor market utilization.  There is a range of values of labor market indicators that qualify as \u201csignificant underutilization,\u201d and there is a range for which underutilization without the word \u201csignificant\u201d would be more appropriate, and the boundary between those two might not involve a significant change in labor market utilization.  So I think that\u2019s too high a standard for dropping the word \u201csignificant.\u201d I agree with President Mester\u2019s insights about the inflation language in paragraph 1, and I think President Kocherlakota\u2019s suggestion is constructive in that regard. I came into this meeting prepared to support removing \u201cconsiderable time,\u201d depending, of course, on what I heard from my colleagues in the discussion around the table.  I was persuaded by President Plosser at the last meeting that, on net, over the last several quarters, our forward guidance has been less data dependent than we would have expected, had we thought about the likelihood of the outcomes that we\u2019ve actually seen.  That\u2019s why I favored dropping it as soon as we could in order to preserve the flexibility that I think we\u2019re going to need as we go forward.  I do not think it would add materially to the hawkishness of the general announcement today if we were to add it, given the normalization principles announcement as well, but I\u2019d support working in the intermeeting period very hard and very creatively to craft a successor formulation to this.   While we\u2019re at it, if you look at the statement, a variety of communications have accreted.  This might be a good opportunity to clean house, go through the closets of the statement, and take out the things or reformulate things that have built up over time.  We are going to be dropping a whole paragraph on guidance about the asset purchase program.  So it is a great opportunity, I think, to take a fresh look at the whole statement. I\u2019m in the camp of wanting to avoid a mechanical path like we began in 2004.  And I tend to agree with President Bullard that, going at \u00bc percentage point per meeting, it would have been an accident if we had gotten through at exactly the right rate without changing the schedule of how many meetings we were doing per year.  Arguably, in hindsight, we got it too low, and I don\u2019t say that on the basis of housing developments, but just on the basis of the inflation rate having run at about 3 percent for four years straight.  I think that\u2019s another good reason to take a look at things and to preserve flexibility. About guidance after liftoff, I think this is going to be kind of problematic to back away from.  When we put something forward-looking in the statement, part of our checklist should be, at what meeting can you envision something happening between the two meetings that would cause you to change that.  And it\u2019s hard to picture.  I have a hard time envisioning what would cause us to drop that in between two meetings and being able to answer the question:  Why do you drop that now.  So I think we should be really careful about introducing guidance like that. On the Heisenberg principle, I think a more parsimonious theory is that we succumb to the temptation to take our point forecasts too seriously.  The unemployment rate came in within the confidence bounds we would have put around our point forecasts a year or two ago, and so maybe we just didn\u2019t think carefully about what we wanted to have happen in that instance.   A related observation I\u2019d make is that, throughout this recovery, there\u2019s been this temptation to think of real activity, and the evolution of real activity, as driven by kind of a univariate, unidimensional object\u2014to think of it as up or down or some sort of latent variable.  But we\u2019ve seen disappointment on the output side and we\u2019ve been surprised on the positive side on the labor market, and productivity obviously intermediates that.  I think we need to be careful to take into account the possibility of different outcomes on different sides of the equation. Now, last year I think we fuzzed this up in communications, and I think it\u2019s tempting to do that.  But we fuzzed it up to the extent that we added in a pickup in economic growth at times last year in our communications, particularly in the press conferences, in a way that wrapped that into labor market conditions.  And we could face this challenge if productivity continues to disappoint.  I think focusing more forcefully and more narrowly on the labor market is the right path to go down.  I think the economics point in that direction as well.  So I\u2019d urge that in our communications as we go forward.  Thank you.  Those are my comments, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer", " MR. WILCOX.  It might be relevant at this point to mention that on the basis of a little more detailed translation of this morning\u2019s CPI, our preliminary estimate is that we\u2019d have core PCE inflation running at about 1.3 percent in both Q3 and Q4.  That\u2019s down from our Tealbook estimate of 1.5 percent in Q3 and 1.4 in Q4.  So we\u2019re down 0.2 percentage point.  For what it\u2019s worth, these are pretty small modifications, but they are in the southerly direction\u2014that would be to the left on the real line [laughter] for core PCE.  For total PCE, for the moment we\u2019re at 1.2 percent and 0.8 percent in Q3 and Q4, respectively.  So those are each down 0.1 percentage point relative to our Tealbook projection", " MR. EVANS.  President Kocherlakota invoked a dictionary definition of \u201csomewhat,\u201d which I\u2019m sure is accurate, but in the Fed lexicon, it wasn\u2019t that long ago that \u201csomewhat\u201d actually translated to 50 basis points.  \u201cSlightly\u201d was 25 in the old reserve-management language for the funds rate when we were tightening in the early 1990s, and \u201csomewhat\u201d was 50", " MR.

The intonation that a reader might put on the statement in reading it could suggest that inflation has been running below the Committee\u2019s long-run objective.  That\u2019s a point of emphasis.

I\u2019m a little bit puzzled by how to read these different things.  As I understand it, the primary dealer five-year, five-year-ahead estimate of inflation hasn\u2019t really moved.  The Board briefing said it\u2019s little changed since the last FOMC meeting.  So the primary dealers, the economists, haven\u2019t changed their views.  And then when you look at the actual movement in the Board\u2019s five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation, the Board\u2019s yield-curve model suggests in parsing the data that most of the decline is actually due to reductions in risk premiums while the estimates of changes in inflation expectations account for only a few basis points\u2014again reading from the Monday morning Board briefing. So those two answers are the same.  Inflation expectations haven\u2019t changed.  But then you have chart 8, and there you\u2019re asking the primary dealers who have already self-identified that they don\u2019t think there\u2019s a change in longer-run inflation expectations, \u201cWhy do you think longer-term rates have come down.\u201d  And they say, well, it must be the A, B, or C.  Maybe there\u2019s a D, E, and F here, too.  I mean, what do I make of that.  You\u2019re asking people who themselves don\u2019t believe something what they think the market\u2019s doing, and how should we weigh evidence like that.  And how do you weigh the evidence from the yield curve model", " WILLIAMS.  That\u2019s exactly my point.  They\u2019re just guessing, in some way.  \u201cWell, the market has gone down", " MS. LOGAN.  Yes.  I think the evidence we have from the survey suggests it\u2019s a mix.  I don\u2019t know if I would put a lot of weight on the distribution", " MR. LACKER.

So that\u2019s one of the constraints.  We have to use the Federal Register.  We have to take in the comments, and we have to respond to them.  We have a project plan that\u2019s tried to look carefully at that.  I think\u2014Josh, you can correct me\u2014we\u2019ve tried to take out as much time on that project plan as possible.

How does that figure into how you would then interpret what you see", " MR. FISHER.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019ll be brief.  I\u2019d like to thank the staff for their excellent assessment of the financial-stability situation.  As we know all too well from past experiences, financial-system shocks can do long-lasting harm to achievement of our inflation and employment goals.  And adjustments to monetary policy do have the potential to reduce the probability of such shocks.  So I continue to see financial-stability analysis as vital in evaluating whether the current path of policy is appropriate. I want to make two comments on that.  One is about the linkage between our dual-mandate risks and financial stability.  I would encourage the staff to continue to integrate analysis of financial stability into the assessment of risks in the Tealbook.  The QS report, quite appropriately, focuses on vulnerabilities, but ultimately the FOMC needs to know how those vulnerabilities translate into risks to prices and employment, as I was describing.  To go even further, of course, it would be desirable, too, for us to know what monetary policy can do about those risks in the event that supervision and regulation are not adequate to control them.  This is obviously work in progress, an agenda that I know we all want to get to, but I think it will start to become more and more pressing as the economy improves. My second comment builds on something I said last time about the benefits of confidential supervisory information as an input into this kind of analysis.  I had some prepared remarks on this, but actually the point has already been made for me by Nellie\u2019s presentation.  If we look at exhibit 2, at the bottom right, I thought the discussion of fund redemptions at Pimco was very nice and very helpful to the Committee, and that built on confidential supervisory information\u2014information that is not in the QS report directly, but I think, nonetheless, could be of use to us.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will focus my remarks on the evolution of the inflation outlook and market-based measures of inflation expectations. In December of 2013, when we initiated the taper, the FOMC statement made reference to watching for evidence that inflation was moving back to target over the medium term.  In the first part of this year, there were such signs, as inflation rose more rapidly than many forecasters had expected.  These signs have proven to be transitory.  At this point, the medium-term inflation outlook is no better than it was last December.  Indeed, in December 2013, the Tealbook projected that inflation would be back to target by 2018.  The Tealbook now projects that inflation will remain below target until early in the next decade.  This more subdued inflation outlook comes even though the Tealbook\u2019s outlook for monetary policy is considerably more accommodative than it was a couple of months ago. We have a 2 percent inflation target, and that target is like any other goal.  Its credibility relies on our consistently taking clear actions to push inflation back toward that target.  I am concerned that failing to react to the ongoing subdued inflation outlook has begun to create significant downside risks to the credibility of that target.  We can see that downside risk reflected in the behavior of longer-term market-based inflation expectations.  As of last week, the five-year, five-year forward inflation breakevens\u2014measured by spreads between TIPS and nominal Treasuries\u2014fell to under 2.2 percent.  It is very low by historical standards, lower than all but 1 percent of the daily observations in the previous 10 years.  Now, as many have noted, the potential variation over time and the relative liquidity demand for TIPS and nominal Treasuries sort of reflect quality issues in the Treasury market.  It means we should interpret these data with care, and it\u2019s useful to supplement this observation about Treasury inflation breakevens by looking at the recent behavior of five-year, five-year forward inflation expectations embedded in zero coupon inflation swaps.  The current reading on that measure is also unusually low, lower than all but 3 percent of the daily observations of the previous 10 years. I focused on market-based measures of inflation expectations.  As many of you have noted, survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been considerably more stable, but I do not think we should be overly sanguine about this stability.  As a January 2014 memo on the staff inflation outlook described, survey-based measures of inflation expectations remained surprisingly stable in Japan, even as the credibility of that central bank eroded. To sum up, Madam Chair, the inflation outlook remains subdued.  I see little evidence that inflation is, indeed, trending upward over the medium term.  I am concerned that our failure to respond to the subdued inflation outlook is creating a substantial downside risk to the credibility of our inflation target.  Consistent with this concern, market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are unusually low by historical standards.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the policy prescription laid out in alternative B.  While I see scope for further improvement in labor market conditions, I agree that the cumulative improvement in labor markets so far justifies concluding the asset purchase program at this meeting, and I think the draft statement is satisfactory as written. I view the \u201cconsiderable time\u201d formulation of the forward-guidance language as consistent with my current assessment that projection of a funds rate liftoff in the third quarter of 2015 is appropriate.  Looking forward to the December statement, I anticipate wanting to keep the \u201cconsiderable time\u201d language.  However, I do not see the value of staying with the phrase \u201cconsiderable time\u201d following the end of the asset purchases in October as suggested in the staff memo.  The fixing of \u201cconsiderable time\u201d to a past date instead of the current meeting strikes me as problematic, given the intended emphasis on data dependence.  I think we should lean against the interpretation that the reference to October is intended to signal a likely change in March or the second quarter.  I think we have to drive home the point that \u201cconsiderable\u201d only means something in the context of the data and the outlook. I asked one of my colleagues to plot what we will know in data terms at each meeting next year.  In March, first-quarter tracking estimates will be firming up.  We will have January data and some key February data.  At the June meeting, we\u2019ll probably have several key May reports, some actually received during the meeting.  The second-quarter tracking estimates going into that meeting will have only April data in reality.  As I said in the economic go-round, recent developments suggest more downside risk.  If the Tealbook forecast is right or even half right, we\u2019ll be facing an ambiguous situation through much of the first half.  I don\u2019t expect to be able to make a data-grounded judgment on the path of the economy with much confidence until the third quarter.  I think we should, therefore, put in place a flexible approach.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Regarding alternative B, I agree that our open-ended asset purchases have served their purpose and we can end them today.  With regard to the forward-guidance language, I\u2019m fine with that as well.  But I am worried about the language in paragraph 2 regarding inflation, and I share the low-inflation concerns expressed by President Kocherlakota. In September I talked about why I think the risks of tightening too quickly and too aggressively far exceed those of moving too late and too cautiously.  This robust control perspective still leads me to think that we should not be tightening rates for more than a considerable time.  If we stay accommodative but the economy turns out to have more strength than we think, inflation may rise somewhat above 2 percent, but we know how to fix that.  However, if we tighten early and the economy encounters further unexpected headwinds, we have much less room to maneuver.  Our unconventional monetary policy tools are likely to be less effective after an unceremonious retreat back to the zero lower bound.  As a result, we could find ourselves in a very difficult spot.  The economy could be stuck in a bad state for a very long time, with attendant damage to its future productivity. This perspective means we should be highly attentive to downside risks, which today, especially, seem to be to our price stability goal.  We\u2019ve underrun our 2 percent inflation target ever since we announced it in January 2012, almost three years ago.  We continue to express optimism that we will fulfill our obligation, but the time by which we expect to do so keeps receding further and further into the future.  Since the September meeting, we\u2019ve encountered some further potential impediments to meeting our policy objectives.  I don\u2019t want to claim that they are major game changers.  I haven\u2019t changed my forecast very much.  The downside risks are stronger today.  I think we should avoid sounding complacent.  That means acknowledging that the risks of lower-for-longer inflation have ratcheted up a notch. I also want to mention that our discussion of long-run inflation expectations has taken on perhaps greater prominence than I\u2019m comfortable with.  I think it\u2019s somewhat unsatisfactory that our inflation forecasting models rely so heavily on long-run inflation expectations.  Our statistical models are crafted in terms of this more stable, long-run inflation expectation as far out as 10 years, but the economic theories that we tend to write down would place much more emphasis on short-term inflation expectations, things having to do with how marginal costs are expected to change over the future horizons and wage contracts and things like that.  Yet there\u2019s no good empirical traction that those models can gain for forecasting inflation.  That\u2019s why we end up with the models that we have.  It\u2019s a tough compromise, and I understand how we end up with long-run inflation expectations being there, but I think we should be uncomfortable with those models leaning so extensively on long-run expectations.  Having been below our 2 percent objective for so long should make us even more uncomfortable as the horizon is extended.  As a policymaker, I\u2019m just not as comforted by constant and unchanging survey measures of inflation expectations at the 10-year horizon. I worry that alternative B as written is overly complacent in suggesting that inflation is heading back to our objective within an acceptable period of time.  It fails to mention additional risks of low inflation.  Specifically, the last sentence in paragraph 2 worries me.  Given developments in Europe, the rest of the world, and perhaps most importantly our own recent low inflation data, the compromise wording that the Committee adopted in September now seems problematic.  This language states \u201cthat the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.\u201d  It said that in September.  While it\u2019s still possible that this is true, it now seems dated and a bit out of touch.  I think it is highly likely that inflation will underrun our 2 percent objective for at least another three years.  The best anyone has at this point is an optimistic forecast and a belief in the magical pull of long-run inflation expectations.  Indeed, with the markdown in the Tealbook, its inflation projection is still below 2 percent in 2019. I think this sentence is really only viable if it says \u201cwell below 2 percent,\u201d but that\u2019s not helpful today.  The issue is, when do we think we will return to target.  I prefer the language that served us in our statements from December 2013 to June 2014:  \u201cThe Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.\u201d  This statement seems far more consistent with today\u2019s heightened inflation risk, while the proposed alternative B sentence seems to have become overcome by events.  That\u2019s my opinion.  I prefer changing that language.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester", " MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the action in alternative B today.  The forecast for the economy is largely unchanged since the September meeting.  There has been substantial improvement in labor markets since the asset purchase program was announced in September 2012, so the conditions for ending the program have been met. I can also support the language in alternative B today.  Although some aspects of the statement still concern me, I welcome some of the changes in language.  In general, I believe the characterization of the economy in the statement should not be just a recitation of movements in the data since the previous meeting, but an indication of the Committee\u2019s view of the implications of changes in the data for the economic outlook and progress toward our goals and, therefore, for policy.  I actually thought that the draft statement language circulated before the Tealbook, Book B, got us closer to this ideal.  Nevertheless, the suggested change in the characterization of labor markets in paragraph 1 seems consistent with the improvement we\u2019ve been seeing for some time and supports ending the purchase program.  In paragraph 2, I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that near-term inflation will be held down by the drop in energy prices, but that our consensus outlook of inflation rising gradually back to target remains intact. In contrast to President Fisher, I would have preferred that we include some reference to financial market volatility in paragraph 1 along with our evaluation that overall financial market conditions remain highly supportive of economic growth.  The volatility has been front and center in the minds of the public, and I believe it would be appropriate for us to give our interpretation of what it means for the outlook.  Moreover, although we have signaled an end to the purchases, I could imagine the end of the program will still be met with some volatility, as may occur as we approach liftoff.  Giving the public some idea of how we interpreted the intermeeting volatility we have seen might help them assess our likely reaction to volatility of this type in the future. In our forward guidance on the path of interest rates, the addition of the two new sentences provides some welcome emphasis that our policy is state contingent.  I personally would still prefer that we remove the reference to \u201cconsiderable time following the end of its asset purchase program.\u201d  Leaving it in poses problems for our forward guidance at subsequent meetings, especially if the intention is to continue to use the end of the purchase program as the benchmark, even as that event recedes increasingly into the past.  This is one of the suggestions in the staff memo on forward guidance, but it would not be my preference.  On this issue, I agree with President Lockhart. I don\u2019t believe there is any economic rationale for tying liftoff to the end of the purchase program, and doing so seems to link the timing of liftoff to that particular event rather than to economic conditions.  In addition, continuing to use the end of the purchase program as our reference state would muddy our communications.  For example, suppose, for the sake of argument, liftoff is to occur next June, which we are going to characterize as a \u201cconsiderable time from the end of the purchase program.\u201d  Such guidance would technically be correct next May, but this would be a month before liftoff, and I don\u2019t think anyone would want to use that forward guidance in May.  It would be very misleading.  So we would need to change the benchmark at some point well before liftoff.   My hope is that in December we will find a way to omit the reference to the conclusion of the purchase program in our forward guidance, replace \u201cconsiderable time\u201d with a more generic \u201ca time.\u201d  And if there is concern that the public will misinterpret the change in guidance, we should include a sentence clarifying that the change in the Committee\u2019s guidance doesn\u2019t indicate a change in the Committee\u2019s policy intentions.  If that is indeed the case, we should be able to point to the December SEP for confirmation of that.  There is precedent for this, as the Committee included such a sentence in March when it replaced the threshold forward guidance with the current formulation.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the ending of the asset purchase program at this meeting.  At the last meeting, I repeated my dissent over the forward-guidance language in alternative B.  That language is now improved.  The new wording in paragraph 1 is improved, as it accurately reflects the economic progress we\u2019ve made and eliminates the \u201csignificant\u201d from the description of the degree of underutilization.  While I still don\u2019t see the need for or the desirability of clinging to this \u201cconsiderable time\u201d language, the additional language in paragraph 4 now stresses the data-dependent nature more forcefully, and I support that.  I do prefer the language in paragraph 4 of alternative C somewhat.  I would actually prefer the elimination of all references to time when we discuss our forward guidance.  It has not served us well.  It continues to create problems for us, and I think we need to strive to just eliminate it entirely.  However, I can support alternative B at this meeting as a transitional step, in my view, toward a better effort at articulating a reaction function that describes how we will respond if the data move. My view remains that our statement needs a great deal of reworking, because its effectiveness as a communication device has been diminished over time as it has become ever more complex and ever more unclear.  For example, I think our next task is paragraph 5, which needs considerable revision.  It\u2019s unclear in paragraph 5 if we\u2019re referring to the pace at which we are returning to a normal funds rate, or to what we consider to be level of the normal funds rate, or both.  As was alluded to earlier today by President Kocherlakota and yesterday by Governor Fischer, we need to start thinking about our post-liftoff policy, how we approach that, and how we want to describe it as we go forward.  I think we have a lot of work to do in that arena. I would actually prefer that we blow up the statement entirely and start all over again.  That\u2019s going to be the only way we can purge ourselves of some of the legacy language that\u2019s come to be a yoke around our necks at various times, and I would urge the subcommittee on communications to tackle this immediately.  [Laughter] From a policy perspective, I believe we are very close to our goals, and we\u2019re moving toward them at a steady, if perhaps unremarkable, pace.  Monetary policy rules that I\u2019ve used to benchmark my views on policy and those that are reported in the Tealbook do indicate a somewhat tighter stance of future policy than is implied by our current forward guidance in the statement, as President George just articulated.  I remind people that such rules fully acknowledge that inflation is running below our target.  They take that into account, yet they still suggest that policy may be more accommodative than it needs to be.  I remind everybody that, as President Williams said, even after we end the asset purchase program, we will still have a very accommodative policy by any standard. I become more nervous that, as these various policy rules suggest, we may be overly accommodative, and that we might find ourselves in the position later of having to raise rates rather aggressively in response to an improving economy.  That would prove somewhat at odds with the gradual adjustment that seems to be implied in paragraph 5.  Historically, when the FOMC has gotten \u201cbehind the curve,\u201d it\u2019s led to monetary-policy-induced recessions on occasion.  I remain somewhat concerned that our current anticipated policy rate path is steadily increasing the risk of just such an outcome. We say that we\u2019re data dependent and that we will react to better-than-expected outcomes, yet we have not shown much affinity for doing so in the past.  Indeed, as I argued back in July and as the Chair reiterated just a little while ago, the economy has performed better than we\u2019ve expected over the past year, the first quarter notwithstanding.  But we have yet to adjust policy in response to that improvement.  Finally, today we\u2019re taking a positive step in that direction, I hope. Given that the Committee has more forcefully stated that, as we go forward, we will be responsive to data in a symmetric manner, I will support alternative B at this meeting as a transitional step.  However, I look forward to seeing further improvements in December that remove all references to time in our forward guidance.  I think this would usefully serve the Committee\u2014both those who anticipate an earlier liftoff and those who anticipate that the data will drive us toward a later liftoff.  That can only be good for the Committee.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to begin, actually, by referring to something President Plosser said a minute ago when he mentioned that the \u201cconsiderable time\u201d language had not served us well and that it created problems.  I disagree with the first, but not the second, part of that statement.  I think it actually has served and did serve an important purpose at the time it was adopted, but it has caused problems, and that\u2019s in the nature of most policy decisions.  As I said yesterday, sometimes when I listen to the discussion around the table, I hear people almost saying that their preferred policy approach has only benefits and no costs, and that\u2019s just not the way policy decisions are going to be made.  That is where we are, I think, on ending the tapering today.  It\u2019s pretty clear that there\u2019s been substantial improvement in the labor market over the period of time in which we\u2019ve had it in place.  Narayana makes a very potent point, which I don\u2019t think was anticipated by those who wanted the language \u201cin a context of price stability.\u201d  I believe the people who wanted \u201cin a context of price stability\u201d were thinking that maybe there would be too much inflation from QE and thus would want to adjust it.  But as Narayana points out and as we\u2019ll have occasion to discuss a little later this morning, that gets us back to our concept of what the inflation language in the longer-run goals statement actually means. Having said that, though, I think President Lacker\u2019s point about signaling is quite important here.  To not end the QE program at this juncture, given the path we\u2019ve been on for some time and how much has relatively changed over the past six or seven weeks, would send a signal that doesn\u2019t actually reflect where the Committee is.  I think the Committee is at about the same place where we\u2019ve been over the past few meetings, and to not end it now would send a more dire signal than people here, as a whole, probably believe.  Some of the issues President Kocherlakota raises are very important, but they actually reflect difficulties or problems in our practice over the past six meetings rather than today. The one thing, Madam Chair, that I miss in the statement and hope we could find a way to include is some reference to international developments.  As I listened yesterday, I think there\u2019s a range of views on how much of a risk is posed by what\u2019s going on in Europe, Japan, China, Asia excluding China, and elsewhere, but I didn\u2019t hear any dissent from the proposition that whatever downside risks are out there, that\u2019s high on the list.  I don\u2019t think there would be an appetite for, nor would it be appropriate to include anything as strong as, the language that we had back in 2012, when we said that \u201cstrains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.\u201d  My preference would be something in paragraph 2, such as \u201cDevelopments in global markets may pose some downside risks to the economic outlook.\u201d  But I\u2019d be content with something in paragraph 1 that was pretty neutrally stated, such as \u201cUncertainty around global economic prospects has increased\u201d\u2014something that just indicates that there is a negative potential out there.  And we can avoid the use of who thinks it\u2019s increased, how much we think it\u2019s increased, or how high the risks can be\u2014but just take note of that. Finally, with respect to the forward-guidance language, as I suggested at the beginning, there are disadvantages to the approach that\u2019s being taken here, even though I was an advocate of it.  There\u2019s no question about it.  There\u2019s a certain clunkiness that comes with it, and that clunkiness will be felt, if not in December, then sometime early next year.  But I think the reason why those of us who supported it did so was not because we thought it was perfect, but because, first, we thought there were greater risks associated with, for example, removal of \u201cconsiderable\u201d today and the potential effect on markets that that would have had even if we had qualitative language in there.  Second, at least from my point of view\u2014as someone, I think, already referred to\u2014the debate over the right adjective at each succeeding FOMC meeting seemed one that would elicit mostly frustration among a lot of people.  So, again, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s perfect.  Nobody thinks it\u2019s perfect.  It\u2019s just a question of, is there a better alternative.  And I don\u2019t think there is, even though it\u2019s going to, in President Plosser\u2019s language, create some problems for us over the next few meetings.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think alternative B does a pretty good job of making clear that we see developments in the domestic economy proceeding much as we had anticipated while recognizing some risks.  The progress on employment is appropriately acknowledged both in paragraph 1 and in paragraph 3.  I do have some concerns about the movement in the market-based measures of inflation expectations, but it\u2019s very early to take too much information from that.  There, too, I think it\u2019s appropriately called out cautiously in paragraph 1, but I also want to convey that we will be carefully watching that. I see some downside risks, as I stated yesterday, of further strengthening of the dollar and weaker-than-expected growth of foreign demand, which is not currently noted.  And I recognize that putting something in there on downside risks may be too strong a signal.  But, given the uncertainty about global growth prospects, continued slack in the labor market, and the news on inflation, which is not good, I continue to favor holding our fire for a few more meetings before signaling we will initiate liftoff.  Again, because we have very limited ability to respond to risks of greater-than-expected slack and disinflationary pressures when we\u2019re at the zero lower bound, as compared with a much greater ability to tighten faster if inflation or the elimination of slack were to accelerate, I think our strategy of vigilant patience is very appropriate.  The global environment of weak demand growth and disinflationary pressures only reinforces that asymmetry. Alternative B does an admirable job of clearly communicating that strategy of vigilant patience.  I support it as written, although I would prefer some neutral reference in paragraph 1 to the increase in uncertainty surrounding global economic prospects, which I view as both factually accurate and relevant to our outlook.  The alternative, which will be to say nothing and again have the minutes be the mechanism for communicating that, has some risks, as we saw last time around. I think the approach of anchoring \u201cconsiderable time\u201d to the end of purchases this month is the best option, while acknowledging that all options have some risks.  It corresponds to my current expectations, and I believe it holds the best prospect for providing a message of continuity and clarity to the markets and provides less risk of misinterpretation and having markets respond in ways that we don\u2019t fully anticipate.  We will need to revisit this language if the pace of convergence to our inflation and employment goals changes materially, and that is very clearly stated in the two new sentences that amplify the data dependence of our stance.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I support alternative B as written.  Ending the asset purchase program is appropriate because of what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the substantial improvement in the labor market outlook.  I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to say \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d  That\u2019s a scary proposition.  But regarding what the program was designed to do, I think we\u2019ve been successful in that endeavor. My views about the likely timing of monetary policy haven\u2019t changed much.  Slightly weaker growth and lower inflation would argue for more patience, which, to my mind, takes March off the table.  But economic growth still seems likely to be strong enough to generate sufficient job gains to continue to tighten the labor market as we go through 2015.  So I see June as remaining, still, the most likely date, with some risk that the date could slip later.  With that in mind, it strikes me that alternative B as written is just about right.  That said, I think the markets will receive it as somewhat hawkish in three respects, and we should be clear about that as our going-in proposition. First, the thing that will be received as hawkish is the removal of the \u201csignificant underutilization\u201d language.  I think the surveys were split on whether that would be removed or not, and so, obviously, if you do remove it, it\u2019ll be a change that will be noted.  It\u2019s a change that didn\u2019t have to be made at this meeting, because, obviously, \u201csignificant\u201d has a vagueness to it, and we could have chosen to wait.  The fact that we\u2019re not waiting will be noted by the markets. The second aspect that I think will be noted is the fact that there\u2019s nothing in paragraph 1 or 2 that references the financial market turmoil or the downside risks to economic growth abroad.  That\u2019s probably appropriate because what I was struck by yesterday in the go-round was that people\u2019s views really hadn\u2019t changed very much about the U.S. outlook despite those two developments.  But the fact that they\u2019re not mentioned will be noted by markets. The third thing that I think is going to be noteworthy is that the new sentences at the end of paragraph 4 are essentially undercutting the commitment of the \u201cconsiderable time\u201d language.  They\u2019re basically saying, \u201cYes, you anticipate it\u2019s going to be a considerable time, but you\u2019re really saying that the economic data matter.\u201d  That, again, will be read, I think, as a little bit hawkish. This is all appropriate.  I\u2019m not arguing with that.  But the fact that market prices have moved pretty far away, I believe, from where the Committee is means that there could be a significant reaction in the fixed-income markets. Lastly, I want to talk briefly about the issue of what happens after liftoff, because I think Governor Fischer raised this yesterday.  We really need to be careful about how we discuss what we\u2019re going to do after liftoff, in terms of how fast we\u2019re going to go, because it seems to me that it really depends on two things that are highly uncertain:  one, how the economy itself evolves; and, two, how financial conditions react to tightening.  As we tighten monetary policy, financial conditions are going to respond.  If they respond very mildly, like what happened over the past year in response to the asset purchase taper, then we\u2019re probably going to have to do more.  If they respond really a large amount, like the taper tantrum, then we\u2019re going to have to do less.  I think we really don\u2019t want to lock ourselves in with markets in terms of how fast we\u2019re going to go once we actually lift off, because it depends on these two things.  And I\u2019m just totally uncertain about how these things are actually going to evolve.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I thought Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s comments about post-liftoff decisionmaking were really useful.  For my taste, I don\u2019t think we should be committing to a pace of liftoff or the sequence of interest rate moves but rather trying to communicate, as you just did, the factors that will be entering into our decisions.  I thought what you just said was very helpful.  So that\u2019s what I think we should be doing more of.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.  Well, thanks for a very good set of comments on the policy issues before us.  In terms of the statement, there were several things.  First of all, I did hear a good deal of support for alternative B as written, but, nevertheless, there were a number of suggestions, so let me turn to those. On inflation, President Evans suggested modifying the language in paragraph 2 to essentially suggest that the risk of inflation persistently running below 2 percent has not diminished or has arguably increased.  I did not hear, as we went around, a great deal of support for that, although I did hear a great deal of concern expressed about the inflation outlook.  I think a number of you share the concern that I have as well\u2014that inflation may persistently run below our objective, and, if that turns out to be the case, we may need a policy response.  It could be deferring rate increases until later than we currently expect.  We may have to recognize that in the statement in the future.  The sense I have is, we\u2019ve opened the door in the statement to telling markets we are concerned about that in two different places, particularly in paragraph 1, noting that market-based measures have gone down.  And, to me, not simply dismissing the fact that that\u2019s a meaningless development will be interpreted as a sign.  So unless I hear a flurry of support to change the characterization of inflation in paragraph 2, as President Evans suggested, I would say, why don\u2019t we consider that in the future and watch what happens with inflation developments but leave that as is. On whether to mention financial volatility, President Mester suggested that maybe what we should do in paragraph 1 is to include it and then basically say, \u201cYes, but we\u2019re not really paying attention to that, because financial conditions are still quite accommodative.\u201d  As Governor Fischer noted, there are two ways to go on this, both essentially saying the same thing.  We could mention it and dismiss it or not mention it at all, and the proposal here is, don\u2019t mention it.  I think I heard several people supportive of taking the approach the statement does of not mentioning it, but, please, if there are others who would prefer to add a sentence in paragraph 1 of the type that we had and got rid of, speak now or forever hold your peace. Finally, let\u2019s turn to the question about the global outlook.  Suggestions there came late in the round\u2014from Governors Tarullo and Brainard\u2014and most of you didn\u2019t really have a chance to react to this.  So let me put on the table the suggestion that I think both of them endorsed.  I think Governor Tarullo suggested some language in paragraph 1 that would say something like \u201cUncertainty around foreign economic prospects has increased.\u201d  Or we could just say something like \u201cThe foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more uncertain.\u201d  It would be a way of acknowledging what many of you mentioned, but, again, I\u2019d be interested in your reactions", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  One thing I would think about is, if I were sitting in one of those foreign places, would I be pleased by having this in the statement or displeased.  And I think I\u2019d be slightly displeased, frankly", " MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Since the September meeting, we\u2019ve marked down our forecast around \u00bc percentage point in the second half of this year and a little bit less after that.  So it has not been a large markdown over the intermeeting period, but a somewhat larger markdown going back earlier in the year.  And, while the uncertainties about the outlook have not increased demonstrably over the past six weeks, if you looked at our position earlier in the year\u2014before the euro economy slumped back, before the Japanese economy started running into its problems, and before property prices in China started to move down\u2014I think you could make the argument, looking over a longer period than just the intermeeting period, that, yes, our uncertainties have increased somewhat.  Then what we\u2019ve observed is the markets, as they often do, catching up to that all at once. CHAIR YELLEN.  Comments.  President Plosser", " MR. BULLARD.  Bob, I thought you said that economic models come out with roughly equal weights, and my comments are different from that.  So I\u2019m wondering what you meant by that statement", " MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So you would agree that, in the broader literature, it would be maybe more coincidental that you would come out with exactly equal weights, because these models have preferences and all kinds of assumptions in them, and then you have to figure out what the optimal weights are.  They might come out one way, or they might come out another way, but they wouldn\u2019t come out exactly equal.  Is that fair", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As someone who was deeply involved in trying to craft the earlier statement in the subcommittee on communications, I know, as does Chair Yellen, how difficult that was to get to where we ended up.  I think that, for those reasons and some other reasons, I\u2019d prefer that we not attempt changes at this time.  I\u2019m concerned that, in doing so, we might inadvertently signal a shift in policy.  Should this occur, it would be particularly disruptive at this stage of the normalization process.  I\u2019m actually not opposed to considering changes, in principle, to the statement, but I think doing so at a time when policy is more nearly under normal circumstances would be a more fruitful way to proceed.  I\u2019m just concerned that attempts to change it could lead to an unraveling of the delicate consensus and the vagueness of what we\u2019ve achieved. That said, I do have some reactions to the memo, and I\u2019ll try to share those a little bit.  I\u2019m not averse to specifying the symmetry of our objectives.  I always thought that that symmetry was implicit in what we had said.  We could even go further by stating a target range that is symmetric around 2 percent.  Again, I wouldn\u2019t have any real, serious objections to that.  In fact, the subcommittee did consider such language at one point.  I do have some trepidation as to what that might imply regarding how we might then go about discussing the symmetry of the employment mandate in a similar way, if we really wanted symmetry.  And what that might devolve into could be quite complicated and very confusing.  So I would approach that with a bit of caution. I also suggest we leave \u201cbalanced approach\u201d as is.  Trying to parse out or agree on a loss or objective function would be extremely difficult in a Committee this big.  The economic viewpoints on the Committee are very diverse at this point, and trying to get it to a common loss function or weights on the objective function could be quite difficult.  It would be like opening Pandora\u2019s box.  In particular, trying to do so in such a short time frame would be very difficult.  To approach this, we would need many careful discussions and thoughtful alternatives and approaches, because if we did it on short notice, we would undoubtedly regret it at some point down the road. I do regard the diversity of views on this Committee as a strength.  And, while I understand and appreciate that \u201cbalanced approach\u201d is a bit vague, it does indicate that the Committee weighs both nominal and real factors as an important part of its policy deliberations.  As Governor Tarullo just mentioned, both our former Chairman and our current Chair have articulated that message quite clearly.  So I think it does have some content.  All told, the language of the current document was carefully and painfully crafted.  Upsetting that balance at a time when policy is in flux would not be a very wise approach. With regard to financial stability, I oppose elevating financial conditions to the same level as our fundamental goals of maximum employment and stable prices.  I think they should be used primarily as an indicator of economic conditions that we would respond to when activities in financial markets are worrisome and when monetary policy can perhaps have a direct effect on that behavior or perhaps is precipitating that behavior.  At a minimum, different financial developments will likely entail differential monetary responses of various kinds.  Reacting to a bank panic might be one response, whereas reacting to a stock market crash or a currency crisis in some part of the world could be very different responses.  We have no systematic way of thinking about that.  How the Committee would act in such circumstances is best left to particular episodes and to the FOMC statement, which would presumably describe or explain why policy was being set, perhaps, in an unusually tight or unusually loose stance or maybe not reacting at all.  Determining appropriate monetary policy in response to financial market conditions is a more complex undertaking, and I would rather that we not get engaged in that in our statement of longer-term strategies. Finally, I don\u2019t think the material in the memo devoted to how the Committee would act in a precise way in some hypothetical examples really belongs in a statement of longer-run goals and objectives.  Those tend to be tactics, and we should avoid those.  Thus, at this juncture, I believe it would be wise to avoid upsetting the apple cart.  We should simply leave the statement as is for the time being.  Thank you, Madam Chair.   CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you very much.  I found this conversation very illuminating.  I do also view this document as somewhat constitutional.  And, as somebody who was not involved in crafting it, it is very helpful to hear about the thinking that went into it on the part of the drafters. Let me focus a bit on the third question, because I do see the statement as a relatively clear and robust explanation of how the Committee views the two individual parts of the dual mandate and possible tradeoffs between them.  However, to my mind, it does not adequately address financial stability, which I consider to be an implicit third leg of our responsibilities in this area.  I also would not want to see financial-stability risks called out as a pressing consideration in our current monetary policy deliberations, but it is important that our longer-run goals framework clearly acknowledges the reality that we do take into account, and should take into account, financial-stability risks in the formulation of monetary policy. I don\u2019t think we can be too precise or prescriptive at this juncture.  Neither the Committee\u2019s practice nor the research is sufficiently settled to clearly state, for instance, the prioritization of macroprudential tools and monetary policy in combating financial-stability risks under different circumstances or to specify the circumstances under which we might be willing to tolerate some deviation from either leg of the dual mandate.  But I do think we want to acknowledge that the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate encompasses financial stability, and that it is central to our deliberations. In my view, financial stability has been central to the Federal Reserve\u2019s mission and mandate since its inception, although it has been, for the most part, implicit and not clearly called out in the statutory language until we saw the provisions on the Federal Reserve\u2019s prudential responsibilities in Dodd-Frank.  Nonetheless, if you think about the creation of the Federal Reserve and the major changes to it over its history, they\u2019ve, in most cases, been in response to major events of financial instability. It would also be a mistake to confine the use of monetary policy to being a last resort, for a variety of reasons.  First and most obvious is because there have been instances of extreme financial stress in which monetary policy has been the tool of first resort, and we should remember that.  Moreover, we may need to rely more heavily on monetary policy relative to macroprudential tools, compared with some other central banks, for several reasons.  First of all, we operate in a highly fragmented regulatory environment and in a system in which the capital markets play a bigger role in the financial markets than they do in many other systems.  And, second, we have somewhat limited macroprudential tools relative to some other central banks. We\u2019re making huge strides in building structural resilience.  But I think we\u2019re likely to find, as we continue on in this work, that we\u2019re somewhat hampered in our macroprudential toolkit\u2014possibly on constructing time-varying tools that address time-varying sectoral risks and, certainly, on tools that address the borrower side, such as loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratios, which have been proven to be among the most powerful tools in combating the most damaging kinds of financial-stability risks.  If you think about what we are capable of commanding\u2014in contrast, for instance, to the Bank of England\u2014we have a much more fragmented regulatory structure, with a number of regulatory entities that don\u2019t view their mandate as pertaining to financial stability.  They are instead focused, for instance, on investor protections or consumer protections.  And I\u2019d say the FSOC is, so far, a highly imperfect answer to that problem. In that context, monetary policy really is the only tool that works across the financial system to address periods of very rapid growth in private credit creation, and we may not want to take that off the table.  Nonetheless, I think it\u2019s absolutely right, as many here have stated, that we want to be very modest at this juncture in terms of what we could say about how we\u2019re likely to address and view financial stability relative to the other two legs of the mandate.  I don\u2019t agree that it\u2019s one risk in a list of risks.  It is a risk for which we have more primary responsibility, and one that is endogenous, to a larger degree, with respect to the tools we have at our disposal.  So, in that sense, I think we should call it out separately.  And I like the proposal that President Kocherlakota put on the table.  It does have an appropriate degree of modestness but also identifies this as an area in which we are going to intensify our work, which is, I believe, the case. With regard to the other pieces, I don\u2019t think I can really add to the remarks that have been put on the table.  The statement, as drafted, is actually quite good\u2014very carefully crafted language on both the balance and the issue of symmetry.  I think it would be difficult for anyone who has observed the Committee\u2019s actions over the past several years not to conclude that the Committee is prepared to act to counter inflation falling persistently below the 2 percent target. With regard to the consensus forecast proposal, I wasn\u2019t part of the earlier effort.  I can see the virtues of having such a forecast.  I believe that, in the case of the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee, that process is made considerably easier by the fact that they use market expectations of rates, which means that committee doesn\u2019t actually have to agree on a monetary policy course in order to get to a consensus forecast.  That\u2019s something you should take into account in deliberations over whether this is feasible for this Committee.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Let me return to Governor Fischer for a few comments as well", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes"], "2014FOMC20141217meeting.txt": [" MR. POTTER.  It depends on the take-up in the TDF and the overnight RRP.  So because the $400 billion TDF rolled off, we should add probably $400 billion to that number.  So it\u2019s around $2.8 trillion to $2.9 trillion", "  MR. POTTER.  Yes", " MR. POTTER.  \u2014there\u2019s this big divergence recently.  And we could go back and look at the history of the fourth to seventh versus the median dot\u2014what was definitely true and striking to me is that until recently, if I took the mean of the PDF for the federal funds rate distributions, then that lined up pretty well with the market-implied path.  Sometime in late September they started to move further apart, particularly for the 2017 contract and further out", " MR. EVANS.  It\u2019s not risk-free", " MS. MESTER.  Lorie, I know you revised the memo, and I still don\u2019t fully understand why we need to extend the resolutions for the testing until January 2016.  I think it could be confusing because we are thinking about lifting off in that time period, and I\u2019m just wondering whether it might be better to do a sequence of resolutions so that we don\u2019t confuse markets about what our intention is with liftoff.  Can you explain that a little bit more for me", " WILLIAMS.  I think there is a different dynamic between different types of oil exploration and drilling.  Okay.  I think there is uncertainty around the future of oil prices, and we could see a jump back up in the next year or so.  This outlook for gradually rising inflation is supported by the continuation of well-anchored inflation expectations.  I agree with President Fisher, I believe inflation expectations have remained well anchored.  And I remain steadfast in my view that I don\u2019t agree with the Board\u2019s staff view that inflation expectations are anchored below 2 percent.  I think they are actually anchored at 2 percent, so let me explain that a little bit.  In the Survey of Professional Forecasters, long-term expectations of PCE and price inflation have been glued to 2 percent\u2014that\u2019s 2.0 percent\u2014over the past two years.  That sounds like success to me.  Although CPI long-run inflation expectations have come down a touch, analysis by my staff suggests that this is much ado about nothing. First, the drop is small.  But, more importantly, it mainly served to bring the midpoint of the distribution of expectations back down from elevated levels recorded in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  The recent decline mainly reflects lower inflation expectations among respondents whose earlier expectations were unusually high.  Some of those respondents, when asked, \u201cWhy did you have high inflation expectations.\u201d attributed their elevated responses, in part, to the uncertainty about the inflationary impact of the Fed\u2019s ballooning balance sheet.  If you think about the dynamic of inflation expectations on the CPI, basically the reason they went up, at least in part, was concerns about the Fed\u2019s policy actions.  Clearly, as President Rosengren pointed out, inflation has not risen.  These risks have not materialized.  They have actually shifted down their views of long-run inflation expectations from high to more in the middle. The decline in inflation expectations among this group implies that respondents now show much greater agreement about the likelihood of moderate inflation in the future.  Now, of course, market-based measures of expected inflation and associated risks, in particular breakeven inflation rates, have come down by more than the survey-based measures.  However, consistent with the findings noted in the Tealbook, a model developed by my staff at the San Francisco Fed attributes these declines to risk and liquidity premiums rather than expected inflation. That brings us to President Kocherlakota and his staff\u2019s memo\u2014which I thought was very thought-provoking and very insightful\u2014that basically made the point that we should not distinguish between these two components, meaning inflation expectations and the inflation risk premium.  According to the memo, we should simply react to the full inflation compensation in order to account for market participants\u2019 valuation of the risks associated with different inflation outcomes. Now, despite the theoretical elegance of his argument, and also my staff\u2019s being thrilled to be able to talk about market-based probabilities and statistically estimated probabilities during the FOMC briefing, I am unconvinced that market prices likely reflect the preferences of American households in the way that the memo lays out.  One reason is that a large share of American households doesn\u2019t actively participate in financial markets.  Indeed, the marginal investor could well be a foreign hedge fund, which would invalidate the welfare rationale for using market prices.  Certainly, part of the recent decline in breakeven rates reflects a flight to safety from abroad into nominal Treasuries.  More generally, as highlighted by the field of behavioral finance, there are a variety of reasons why sentiment and other factors and frictions not associated with marginal utility might influence market prices. Furthermore, if the real world did approximate the framework of the full participation in complete markets assumed in the Minneapolis Fed\u2019s memo, one implication of that is that our large-scale asset purchase programs would be ineffective.  Without some imperfect substitutability among assets, such purchases would have no economic effects through portfolio balance channels.  My reading of the available evidence suggests that\u2019s not the world that we live in.  For these reasons, I remain convinced that it makes sense, in theory, to consider inflation expectations as well as the risk premium associated with inflation separately.  But that\u2019s in theory.  In practice, of course, we have imperfect tools to distinguish between these signals.  Given these measurement difficulties, we should not be too cavalier about the decline in breakeven inflation and should continue to monitor and analyze it and other measures carefully.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  A two-hander\u2014President Kocherlakota", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I join the general view that has been expressed this afternoon that the steady growth of what is almost now a year\u2019s duration is likely to continue.  Like President Lacker and a few others here, I found myself looking for reasons to believe that this time, the relatively strong performance will continue, as opposed to our past pattern of a period of sustained decent growth faltering after fiscal or monetary stimulus has been removed.  Several of you have mentioned some reasons to believe that.  I will just note three quickly. One, I just alluded to the fact that, this time around, when we began tapering early this year and through the end of the LSAPs,, we didn\u2019t see the kind of stumbles that occurred earlier when either fiscal or monetary stimulus was withdrawn, and what had been a promising period of an uptick in growth was followed by a disappointing couple of quarters. Two, as Jeff also noted, beyond the continued improvement in the unemployment rate and the recent strength of monthly jobs numbers, we are now seeing more structural dynamism in labor markets.  Following on the increases in job openings, albeit with some lag, the quits rate has been edging up this year.  It is now solidly in pre-crisis territory, which is probably notable since each of the past two recessions resulted in the quits rate never quite getting back to where it had been previously.  That is some indication of an uptick in dynamism.  The hires rate isn\u2019t quite there yet, but it has also improved, on net, this year. Three, while it is hard to say where the equilibrium point for household debt is or should be, it is pretty clear that a considerable amount of deleveraging has taken place.  We are now at levels of household debt comparable with those prevailing in the early years of the past decade, before the effect of the mortgage mania had accelerated the growth of household debt.  The pace of decline in the ratio of household debt to GDP has diminished considerably in the past year or so.  It is not unreasonable to think that the change in the second derivative will portend some leveling off of this ratio in the not-too-distant future, an inference that is buttressed by the fact that the dollar amount of total household debt has risen modestly over the past year.  I should probably add that student debt accounts for a fair bit of that increase, and serious delinquency rates of student debt have risen quite a bit, now surpassing credit card debt, which was the traditional leader in this category.  This is hardly an unalloyed good. Now, as Governor Fischer and President Lockhart have already said, and I think Jay may say it as well, it is not as though we have unqualifiedly good news.  But I think that what we have seen explains and justifies the prevailing attitude today that, with continued progress for another couple of quarters, concerns about premature liftoff or the inevitable choppiness of the first rate increase will diminish enough to put a federal funds rate increase in play.  On the other hand, as Governor Fischer also pointed out, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty that remains.  On the upside of economic performance, it is possible that we would get unexpectedly high jobs numbers for the next few months, along with more concrete signs of accelerating wage increases.  I\u2019m sure that would lead some to want to consider an earlier liftoff. From my perspective, there are at least two plausible scenarios that would make me, at least, more hesitant to move in the June\u2013September timeframe that is represented by many of the dots of voters in this SEP.  One, which has already been mentioned by several people, is the external downside risk from global markets.  It is certainly reasonable to expect, as the Tealbook does, that the euro zone will improve slightly next year, and that some form of QE there will help stave off any deflationary or recession threat.  But the euro zone does lack much capacity to absorb any further shocks, whether from renewed sovereign debt problems or geopolitical turmoil or other sources.  Were things to go awry in the euro zone and China\u2019s growth to slow more than the current consensus suggests, financial markets, and market psychology more generally, might pose risks to the United States.  I know that most models suggest a limited vulnerability to external developments of this sort, but my memory, at least, of past episodes suggests that the models may be missing something, particularly in the absence of either fiscal or monetary stimulus in the United States.  I think Governor Brainard, fortunately, probably has a better perspective on this than I. The other scenario is the one that concerns me perhaps more, and that\u2019s anticipating that jobs numbers and other indicators, including unemployment, may suggest, by the first part of next year, continued moderate strengthening of labor markets, but that there also would be evidence of labor participation increasing, part-time employment diminishing, and still no real signs of wage acceleration, much less upward pressure on inflation.  The question would be what to do in those circumstances.  This returns me to a theme that I\u2019ve sounded, probably ad nauseum, over the past year or two here, which is that with all of the uncertainties in labor markets, we all have to admit that we have been surprised about something that has happened in labor markets over the past couple of years, and we are well advised to be pretty pragmatic and pretty data sensitive in thinking about and assessing what is actually going on in labor markets. There are some labor economists who are already beginning to do some work on what they find to be the changes in life-cycle labor market behavior that could conceivably be second only to the broad entry into the labor market of women over a three-decade period in changing the shape of labor market behavior.  We don\u2019t know whether that is actually occurring yet, but we do know that a lot of things that have happened in labor markets\u2014participation rates and other things\u2014haven\u2019t conformed to what might have been expected based on pre-crisis behavior.  This may be another area in which the crisis and the Great Recession have accelerated trends that were previously a little harder to detect. When we look at wages and the anticipation of wage increases, even though the NFIB is now predicting more wage increases being paid by its members\u2014we should probably note that they have been predicting that for two years now, and we haven\u2019t yet seen it realized.  As I think Presidents Kocherlakota and Rosengren have both pointed out, in some discrete analyses that their staffs did, there is some reason to believe that the performance of labor markets and wage markets in the past is not necessarily a great predictor of where we are right now.  Then Governor Fischer alluded to the Phillips-curve issue, and that the slope may indeed change or revert to where it has been.  But for a while now, the Phillips curve has been pretty flat, and we can\u2019t predict with any certainty that it will normalize, understanding that \u201cnormal\u201d may vary from time to time. Again, this all leads me to the anticipation that if we face this set of circumstances in the spring or the early summer, I think it behooves us to think carefully about whether we would be prepared to lift off, notwithstanding the fact that there will have been continued economic growth in that period.  I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be.  I actually think it\u2019s not so likely that we will have six more months of really solid job numbers and not see some changes in wage patterns and part-time unemployment, but we might, and I think we should just remain open to that. What we\u2019ve been doing in the past couple of meetings, I think, is trying to begin weaning the markets gradually off what has been something like calendar-based guidance and more toward a focus on conditions as we see them evolving in the nearer term.  I just want us to make sure that we don\u2019t replace a calendar approach for holding off rate increases with a calendar approach for starting them and instead really stick to what we all tend to mouth as the mantra\u2014that we want to be reacting to conditions, be state contingent, be conditional, whatever one\u2019s favorite phrase is\u2014and that, I continue to think, will probably serve us best over the next couple of quarters.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell", " MR. WILCOX.  Yes", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support alternative B today as offered, because it\u2019s merely a modest restatement of our current patient policy strategy without committing to a date-based future action.  That said, I expect the public to quickly embrace June 2015 as the focal point for our eventual policy liftoff, and I\u2019m uncomfortable with that assessment today as I read the economic situation.  After six years of inflation averaging 1\u00bd percent, I would prefer a course of action that maximizes our likelihood of achieving 2 percent inflation by 2017 at the latest, and we need to hit our price-stability objective in a sustainable manner, not simply as a short-term burst of transitory relative price adjustments when oil prices bounce back.  Given my assessment of the economy\u2019s fundamentals, I myself will be surprised if it becomes appropriate to begin increasing short-term policy rates before March 2016.  But things can change\u2014I recognize that. Within this context, I prefer the conditional language in paragraph 3\u02b9 of alternative A.  Its conditionality with respect to achieving our price-stability mandate is much clearer, and I believe the public would better infer that we intend to achieve our 2 percent inflation objective sooner rather than later.  At a time when the Bank of Japan and the ECB are struggling at the zero lower bound with low inflation, there\u2019s no more powerful tool available than a strong and credible public expectation of actions to achieve this better outcome.  This is an important preventive defense for ourselves.  Without such a marker, I fear that the focal point for liftoff will be too firmly date-based on June 2015, without enough data conditionality, in the event our inflation improvements stall. I did like very much some of the suggestions that President Lockhart made in terms of trying to push a little further into the future the start of our normalization. Madam Chair, yesterday you listed a number of policy caveats related to this conditionality test.  I believe my own list is well aligned with your comments.  For me to envision a June 2015 liftoff as the appropriate response to economic conditions, I would like to see a number of developments\u2014first, continued strong employment growth, associated improvements in other labor market indicators, and continued growth above potential. Second, I\u2019d want to see clear signs that wages were beginning to increase toward the range of 3 to 4 percent that I associate with neutral cost pressures.  I think this is important for reinforcing the evidence that resource gaps have been sufficiently narrowed and for establishing cost increases that would be more consistent with an underlying inflation rate of 2 percent. The third important condition would be an increase in TIPS-based inflation expectations from today\u2019s low levels.  As you and President Kocherlakota mentioned yesterday, there are serious costs when we live in a world with low inflation, a low equilibrium real rate, and monetary policy stuck at the zero lower bound.  If market measures of inflation compensation are lower today because the market participants are much more mindful of and averse to these costly low-inflation scenarios, then the FOMC should better ensure that we hit our 2 percent objective with greater confidence and more quickly. The final signal I would be looking for would be an increase in my inflation projection to 2 percent in 2017 at the latest under the contemplated post-liftoff path.  As you suggested yesterday, Madam Chair, there is a risk that core and underlying inflation measures could become persistently too low owing to relative price downdrafts outside of our control.  You mentioned that you would be monitoring for things like that.  It\u2019s not your base case, of course.  In this case, inflation\u2019s behavior would likely be inconsistent with our price-stability objective, in my opinion.  We thus may still need to reinforce our patient, data-conditional policy messages along the path in order to keep inflation up. It\u2019s certainly possible that these caveats will be overcome by mid-2015.  That\u2019s part of the conditionality test.  Still, I continue to worry that we\u2019re hoping to thread the needle and bring inflation up to 2 percent from below without ever crossing over 2 percent.  I think this hopeful scenario is fraught with risks that inflation will stall out before we get to 2 percent.  If confronted with a choice of stalling at 1\u00bd or 1\u00be percent inflation versus modestly overshooting inflation at 2\u00bc to 2\u00bd percent inflation for a time, I firmly believe that the latter is more consistent with our stated long-run strategy for monetary policy. Now, on the questions that you asked, I think your characterization of the liftoff dates is accurate\u2014almost all participants in 2015.  I don\u2019t disagree with that. In terms of the definition of \u201cpatient,\u201d my own preference is some adjustment along the lines that President Lockhart was trying to convey, so it would be longer than one to two meetings.  But I defer to your judgment on that.  I understand the importance of this, and I would not disagree with the important objectives you have for the press conference today.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I had a question.  You were implying that the dealers were putting very little probability on meetings not associated with  press conferencess.  I think, in fact, some probability is placed on meetings not associated with press conferences", " MR. POTTER.  But, no, that\u2019s the most likely", " MR. FISHER.  Remember, Bill English said yesterday that that anchoring could surprise some investors.  I understand why it\u2019s there.  Again, I refer to it as past tense pluperfect only because it\u2019s an odd juxtaposition.  Yet the attempt is to clarify it with the word \u201cpatient.\u201d  I think \u201cpatient\u201d confounds it the way it\u2019s written, but that\u2019s a minority opinion, obviously. CHAIR YELLEN.
