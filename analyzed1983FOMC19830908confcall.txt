Passage number 2.
 Forrestal, First Vice President, FederalReserve Bank of AtlantaTranscript of Federal Open Market Committee Conference Call ofSeptember 8, 1983CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd like to take advantage of this[consultation] for two reasons. One is just to get any comments orreflections that any of you might have on perceptions of what is goingon in the economy or inflation; the other is more directly in terms ofthe policy decided upon [at the last meeting]. We have gone somewhattoward the lower end of the specific range we were talking about interms of reserve pressures at the meeting. The directive clearlycontemplated less than that if there was weakness in the aggregates,particularly if it was not accompanied by signs of increased economicactivity. And I would interpret that at the moment as moving--or atleast making our errors--on the slightly easier side and not doinganything very drastic, depending upon what happens in the first partof September. If the aggregates came in low then, we would continueto move in that direction; if there were a tendency to reverse whathas happened recently, we would stop moving in that direction.Conceivably, if growth were high enough, we'd go back to where wewere. So, we're in that kind of posture at the moment of leaning alittle toward the easier side, fully in accordance with the directive.[Secretary's note: The transcript record has an ellipsis atthis point, indicating that the ensuing discussion was nottranscribed.
