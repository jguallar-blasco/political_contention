Passage number 1.
 Once MR. PARTEE. Silence is golden.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 2.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. At least promptness is worth something. Accordingly, we will proceed with the agenda. The first item of business is to approve the minutes of the last meeting. I believe they have been circulated. Are there any corrections or comments. Hearing none, we will report those as approved. Turning to foreign currency operations, Scott has been taken suddenly ill and Alan, therefore, will report on the foreign currency operations. M R .  HOLMES. I’m sorry Scott can’t be here to make this report because it’s very near and dear to his heart. It’s rather historic. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply providing an update on the agenda and reporting on the absence of Scott for a specific report. There is no indication of any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 3.
] CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much, Alan. Questions or comments. Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  This passage does not indicate any type of contention or disagreement. It is simply a polite expression of gratitude and an invitation for further discussion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 4.
 MR. PARTEE. Alan, had there not been all this intervention, do you believe that the dollar would have been substantially higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is posing a question to someone named Alan about their belief regarding the hypothetical scenario of the dollar being substantially higher if there had not been intervention. By asking this question, Mr. Partee suggests that he may hold a different belief or viewpoint on the matter.


Passage number 5.
 MR. HOLMES.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage, "MR. HOLMES," does not provide enough information or context to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. It only provides a name, therefore it is not possible to assess any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 6.
 Substantially higher, yes indeed MR. PARTEE. That is, it wasn’t supply bringing forth its own demand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply agreeing with Mr. Partee's statement.


Passage number 7.
 MR. HOLMES. The fact that we were there and willing to [intervene] probably increased the flow. But I think we would have had a substantially different exchange rate effect if we had not been intervening at all and if the Europeans had not been intervening at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a hypothetical scenario and acknowledging that their intervention may have had an impact on the exchange rate, but also considering how it might have differed if there had been no intervention from either side.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 8.
 MR. PARTEE. So speculators against the dollar might have been squeezed in the absence of this intervention, I suppose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The use of the word "suppose" indicates a potential disagreement or uncertainty regarding the statement being made.


Passage number 9.
 MR. HOLMES. Yes, they might have been squeezed more if we had not intervened.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that intervening prevented a further negative impact.


Passage number 10.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without the full passage provided, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement. Please provide more information.


Passage number 11.
 4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -2- MR. WALLICH. Alan, in terms of the possible magnitudes of these movements, you remember what happened to the United Kingdom a couple of years ago: There was a tremendous inflow into sterling and they held the rate [for a time]; eventually, after taking in $10 or $15 billion in reserves, they had to let the rate go. Do you see any possible parallel for the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking Alan if he sees any possible parallel for the United States.


Passage number 12.
 MR. HOLMES. Well, there's always a possible parallel. If we try to put a complete lid on the rate, one or two things will happen: Either we will have to acquire a lot of currencies or we will so convince the market that there is no upside risk in the dollar that the flows will stop. I'm not quite clear which would happen; it could well be a combination of the two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Holmes stating the possible outcomes if they try to control the rate.


Passage number 13.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Bob Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or statements that indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 14.
 MR. BLACK. Alan, what do you think the reaction would be in exchange markets if the aggregates should come in weak and we nudged the federal funds rate down a little.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement; it merely asks for Alan's opinion on a hypothetical scenario.


Passage number 15.
 MR. HOLMES. I think the market has been quite favorably impressed by the fact that, despite weak aggregates, the System has stayed steady in the boat as far as the funds rate is concerned. I think a change in that pattern would have a negative effect on the exchange market. How big it would be I really don't know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and uncertainty about the potential effect of a change in the pattern of the funds rate on the exchange market.


Passage number 16.
 MR. BLACK. You think they would pay more attention to the federal funds rate, though, than the behavior of the aggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black is simply expressing his opinion that the Federal Reserve should pay more attention to the federal funds rate than the behavior of the aggregates.


Passage number 17.
 MR. HOLMES. I think they would. The market is more geared to interest rates than it is to aggregates because interest rates have a real meaning for currency flows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement by Mr. Holmes expressing his belief that the market is more influenced by interest rates rather than aggregates, as interest rates have a tangible impact on currency flows.


Passage number 18.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Phil Coldwell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not provide any information or statement to indicate contention or disagreement. It only mentions "Phil Coldwell," but there is no context or content that suggests disagreement.


Passage number 19.
 MR. COLDWELL. Alan, what theory of intervention are you working under now. Do you just buy back enough to pay off [foreign currency debt], peg the rate, or bend with market forces. What sort of strategy are you working under.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for information about the strategy being implemented.


Passage number 20.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Let me tell you what strategy Alan is working under. It has been a consistent one from November 1 [of last year], which is that we would move in depth in both directions to avoid disorderliness in the market. consistently, despite people who pressure us from time to time to do something else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply explains that Alan has been consistently following a strategy since November 1 to avoid market disorderliness, even though some people occasionally try to pressure him to do something different.


Passage number 21.
 That's what we have been doing MR. PARTEE. Would you say that there would have been disorderly strength in the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact or acknowledgment of what they have been doing.


Passage number 22.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: 

Without the actual passage being provided, it is not possible to detect any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 23.
 MR. HOLMES. Yes, I think it would have been a disorderly market on the up side, which is clearly possible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Holmes, expresses their opinion that it is possible for the market to have been disorderly on the up side.


Passage number 24.
 MR. PARTEE. Well, it's a breakthrough then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Well, it's a breakthrough then" suggests agreement and acknowledgment of progress.


Passage number 25.
 4/11/79 -3- CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes, indeed. Notice what happened when the Bank of Japan raised its discount rate. The yen weakened against the powerful dollar. I'm sorry to interrupt but I wouldn't want Alan to have to defend his own posture because it's one that he has been working under in coordination with us. And this is what we have been trying to accomplish. Other questions or comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging a certain event (the Bank of Japan raising its discount rate) and stating a fact (the yen weakened against the dollar). They also mention not wanting Alan to defend his own posture because it aligns with the goals they have been working towards. Overall, the tone is cooperative and supportive.


Passage number 26.
 MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 27.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes, Nancy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 28.
 MS. TEETERS. Where do you think the dollar is going now. Do you expect it to stabilize or do you expect the upward pressures to continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. The question "Do you expect it to stabilize or do you expect the upward pressures to continue" indicates that there are different opinions or predictions regarding the future direction of the dollar.


Passage number 29.
 MR. HOLMES. Well, in the last week or so the flows slowed. There has been no new impetus to it. Part of the reason was the fact that the market got the perception that the Germans didn't want to see the dollar appreciate any more against the mark. That may be overcome, depending on what happens, and we may again get a reoccurrence of very large flows back into the dollar. But it has slowed down in the last week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the recent slowing down of flows and providing a possible reason for it.


Passage number 30.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much. We now need to ratify the transactions since the last meeting. I believe you all have the reports. Are there any comments or questions or objections. Hearing none, we will record the ratification of those transactions. Now we will turn to domestic operations. Of course, we have had great drama in this area since the last meeting. We've come as close as the nation could come to defaulting on its debt. So Peter undoubtedly will likewise have an exciting report. M R .  STERNLIGHT. I don't know if I will live up to the excitement of that billing, Mr. Chairman, although the delay in [raising] the debt ceiling certainly did have an impact on operations and on Treasury financing during the month. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The chairman mentions the drama of the nation almost defaulting on its debt, and Mr. Sternlight acknowledges the impact it had on operations and Treasury financing. However, their tones remain polite and there are no clear indications of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 31.
 1 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Peter. Questions or comments. Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 32.
 MR. WALLICH. With the new wider distribution of Treasury bills, do you feel that the dangers of inadequate collateral for RPs are substantially reduced.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question is asking for an opinion about the potential reduction in dangers of inadequate collateral for RPs, rather than presenting conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 33.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. At the moment there is certainly ample collateral around, but some of those bills will be maturing later this week and next week, so we could get back into a situation of scarce collateral.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement about the availability of collateral and the potential for scarcity in the future.


Passage number 34.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the phrase "CHAIRMAN MILLER" as it only provides a person's title or name, without indicating any conflicting or opposing views or statements.


Passage number 35.
 Nancy MS. TEETERS. was the heavy sell-off of foreign holdings for the swap operations or was it also to provide funds for that market. M R .  STERNLIGHT. Both were going on. There were swap repayments, but also foreign countries were undertaking intervention 4/17/19 -4- and, as I understand it, they had to liquidate holdings of Treasury bills to raise the dollars they needed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply presents two factors that were happening simultaneously: swap repayments and foreign countries liquidating Treasury bill holdings for the purpose of raising dollars they needed.


Passage number 36.
 MS. TEETERS. Most of the $5-1/2 billion was for the intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any disagreement or contention; it simply states that most of the $5-1/2 billion was for the intervention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 37.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. The greater part of it was for intervention, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage suggests that there was contention or disagreement as the phrase "The greater part of it" implies that there was a significant portion or a majority of individuals who were in favor of intervention, while others may have had a different opinion.


Passage number 38.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to answer the question about contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 39.
 MR. PARTEE. Peter, after these fluctuations over the last six weeks or so, how would you characterize the short-term markets-- the short-term government market and the short-term private market--in relationship to the funds rate. That is, do you think the relationship is about normal or are rates high or low relative to the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question asking for an opinion or analysis of the relationship between short-term markets and the funds rate.


Passage number 40.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. At the moment there’s a temporary bulge in dealers’ holdings of very short-term issues, particularly of Treasury bills, so I think the day-to-day financing costs are toward the high end of some range of variation. But I expect that to be transitory; those rates will probably come down in the next couple of weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply provides an opinion and expectation of the speaker regarding the temporary increase in financing costs.


Passage number 41.
 MR. PARTEE. So the government rates may be a little high relative to the funds rate, but the private rates--those on commercial paper and CDs and so forth--are low, aren’t they.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 42.
 MR. STERNLIGHT. CDs have been under some special influence because banks have been willing to pay off CDs, and they have obtained more of their financing recently from Eurodollar takedowns. The commercial paper rate seems to me to be about in a normal relationship to the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their observation about the relationship between CDs, banks, Eurodollar takedowns, and the commercial paper rate.


Passage number 43.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you all. Again we need a vote to ratify the transactions. The reports have been circulated. Are there questions, comments, or reservations. Hearing none, we will record those as approved. We will turn now to the staff report on the economic situation. Jim Kichline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a simple update on the procedures being followed in a meeting, asking for any questions or comments, and then moving on to the next agenda item.


Passage number 44.
 MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 45.
] CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Jim. Let’s take a few moments to see if there are any questions about this before we turn to Steve. Yes, Phil.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply addressing Jim and asking if there are any questions before turning to Steve.


Passage number 46.
 MR. COLDWELL. In the forecast of federal and state expenditures, Jim, would you give me a little more explanation than I have seen on the negatives and positives in the first and second quarters. Are there some offsetting jumps of sizable magnitude.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward request for further explanation.


Passage number 47.
 MR. KICHLINE. We think the developments in the state and local area reflect largely a weather effect related to a slowdown in construction expenditures and capital outlays. Employment in the state and local sector declined, or was very weak at least, in the first two months and picked up in March. So I think what is happening here is a transitory factor that will shift activity out of the first quarter and into the second. On the federal side, I must say I think 4/17/19 -5- we‘re talking about these miserable CCC payments, which tend to accelerate federal purchases in one quarter and disappear in the next and get revised away. S o ,  we are not talking about anything that is a major factor; it’s largely the sort of thing where we have higher expenditures in the first quarter and then a sharp drop in the second quarter, which is a paydown of CCC loans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the reasons behind the decline in employment in the state and local sector and provides the explanation that it is likely a weather effect related to a slowdown in construction expenditures. The mention of CCC payments on the federal side does not contradict or argue against this explanation.


Passage number 48.
 MR. COLDWELL. Just looking at your pattern, you have a positive on federal expenditures in the first quarter and a heavy negative on state and local [spending] and the reverse of that in the second quarter, with a heavy negative on the federal side and a pretty heavy positive on [state and local]. They just happen to cancel out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the pattern observed in the data without expressing any differing opinions or conflicting views.


Passage number 49.
 MR. KICHLINE. State and local is weather-related and federal reflects CCC payments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply stating a fact about how state and local payments are weather-related, while federal payments reflect CCC payments. There is no argument or opposing viewpoint presented.


Passage number 50.
 MR. ZEISEL. There was a big CCC payout in the fourth quarter--I’m sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply provides information about a potential payout in the fourth quarter.


Passage number 51.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only states the title or position of a person, Chairman Miller.


Passage number 52.
 No, go ahead Jerry MR. ZEISEL. This kind of sawtooth pattern drives us insane, but it is very common.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no evident contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "This kind of sawtooth pattern drives us insane, but it is very common" does not involve conflicting viewpoints or contradictory statements.


Passage number 53.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Mark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it is not mentioned or implied.


Passage number 54.
 MR. WILLES. Thank you. I just wanted to ask how you treated the impact of decontrol of oil prices and how that fed through to the forecast for inflation. Was it any different than you would have treated it if the same amount of increase came simply as a result of an OPEC [price] increase. Is my question clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Willes, is asking a question to clarify how the impact of decontrol of oil prices was treated in the forecast for inflation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 55.
 MR. KICHLINE. We did not treat it differently in terms of the price impact. On the real side, there are important differences. I believe I know what you are getting at. I think the question is what the percentage passthrough is and whether or not we are simply talking about shifting profits from refiners to crude oil producers, or how much do prices actually go up. And that’s a major area of conflict. I might say we have treated it roughly the same; the Administration has treated it somewhat differently and assumed that only two-thirds of the costs get passed through.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kichline, suggests that there is a conflict or disagreement over the percentage passthrough and how much prices actually increase, particularly between himself and the administration.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 56.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. We show more inflation impact than the Administration does. M R .  KICHLINE. That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "We show more inflation impact than the Administration does" suggests that there is a disagreement between the speaker and the administration regarding the impact of inflation. The response "That's right" indicates that the speaker agrees with this statement.


Passage number 57.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. I have used 0.5, which is what you’ve used. They have used much less, I believe.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states different amounts that they and someone else have used without expressing any disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 58.
 MR. KICHLINE. [They have used] 0 . 3 .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage simply provides a statement made by Mr. Kichline mentioning a certain quantity or number that has been used. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 59.
  MR. WILLES. Well, in addition to that, there is another factor and I don’t pretend to know exactly how to [take it into account]. When OPEC increases its prices, it does so without an increase in supply. In the case of decontrol there‘s at least a hope that it is going to have a supply-side effect. When one works that 4 /17 / I 9  through the system, it's not clear whether in general--though clearly energy prices will go up--the inflation rate will go up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 


Passage number 60.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes, because of the lag effect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, because the passage does not contain any conflicting ideas or opposing viewpoints. The mention of a "lag effect" simply suggests that there might be a delay in something happening, but it does not imply disagreement or contention.


Passage number 61.
 MR. KICHLINE. One of the issues involved, which is very important, particularly as we get into the ' ~ O S ,  is that we have assumed some lag in the supply-side effects. We are talking about partial decontrol in 1979--it's very limited--and it's bigger in 1980. But by the end of 1980, decontrol in domestic prices is only about 55 percent completed. So I think the longer-run effects on the supply side are quite important.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kichline is simply stating his opinion about the importance of the longer-run effects on the supply side.


Passage number 62.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Willis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, there is no passage provided to analyze for contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 63.
 MR. WINN. Jim, in the last three weeks we've been getting a little more evidence that disintermediation is starting to take place. We see it in terms of traffic in the Bank--direct purchases of [Treasury] securities--and we see it in looking at some of the institutional outflows. Parallel to that is the fact that long-term rates are starting to increase, particularly for the financing of office buildings and other such things. I get a reading that across the country for the first time [builders] are really starting to look very hard at costs and that a number of projects have suddenly been pulled back in April. Are we starting to see the bite of the policies that have been in train for some time. If that's true, then one gets a little different outlook than you projected for some of these things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is contention or disagreement. Mr. Winn presents evidence of disintermediation and increasing long-term rates, indicating a possible negative impact of current policies on the economy. This challenges the previously projected outlook and implies a difference of opinions or perspectives.


Passage number 64.
 MR. KICHLINE. Well, on the thrift institution side, for mutual savings banks the numbers available through early April indicate a substantial decline in rates of inflow. For S&Ls, the March data show inflows up a little.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply presenting two sets of data related to inflows for mutual savings banks and S&Ls. There is no contention or disagreement evident.


Passage number 65.
 MR. WINN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without any context or specific passage provided, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage involving MR. WINN.


Passage number 66.
 That's right, but the April data-- MR. KICHLINE. We have scattered reports for April and we have been picking up the same sort of thing. Our own forecast, however, is not for a sharp deceleration of inflows but rather a gradual slowing. We don't have any massive change there. I might note, though, that in the mortgage market on the financing side we have been picking up increasing reports of stringency in various parts of the country. So if one looks at the mortgage picture, it has been much tighter both in price and nonprice lending terms. On the construction side, I don't have any reliable information that I could point to regarding recent changes that may be under way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The person is providing additional information and observations related to the topic being discussed.


Passage number 67.
 MR. PARTEE. Willis, I might just say that it took a little while for this money market certificate change to take hold. There were various cut-off dates. The credit unions didn't [get] cut off until the end of the month. In one city in Alabama we let every [institution] go to the end of the month. It took a while to get all that adjusted out, but the intention--and the expectation--is to do away with that differential, which will shift some flows from the thrifts to the banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that it took some time for the money market certificate change to take effect and that there were different cut-off dates for credit unions. The intention and expectation mentioned at the end do not indicate disagreement.


Passage number 68.
 MR. WINN. I wonder if the flows are going to go into market investments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement made by Mr. Winn expressing his wonder about the direction of flows into market investments.


Passage number 69.
 4/11/19 -7 MR. PARTEE. They might because, after all, the compounding effect was cut back, so there is also a greater disadvantage compared with the market than there was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 70.
 MR. WINN. I think we are going to see more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement expressing someone's opinion or prediction, but there is no opposition or argument presented.


Passage number 71.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. We'll just go [unintelligible]. Paul.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that they will go somewhere unintelligible.


Passage number 72.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All I have is the GNP deflator in your forecast, which I think is 9.4 percent this year. What would that be in terms of consumer prices.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating the information they have (the GNP deflator) and asking for clarification on how that translates to consumer prices.


Passage number 73.
 MR. KICHLINE. We don't forecast the CPI directly; we do forecast [the deflator for1 personal consumption expenditures, which is a close approximation for the CPI. For 1979 we have them virtually the same--about 9-1/4 percent for personal consumption expenditures and the deflator.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their forecasting method and stating that the figures for personal consumption expenditures and the deflator are virtually the same for 1979.


Passage number 74.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are going to have to have a pretty low rate of price increase in the second half of the year to make 9-1/4 percent, given this first quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that in order to achieve a 9-1/4 percent rate, there will need to be a low rate of price increase in the second half of the year, considering the performance of the first quarter.


Passage number 75.
 MR. KICHLINE. Yes, by the time we get into the summer, say July or August, if we don't begin to see substantially slower rates of increase in the CPI, then this inflation forecast is clearly at risk of being too low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Instead, it presents a conditional statement about the inflation forecast based on the future rates of increase in the CPI.


Passage number 76.
 MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The question does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opinions. It is simply stating that Mr. Axilrod will make a statement, without indicating any potential disagreement or contention.


Passage number 77.
] CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Steve. Yes, Larry, we'll have a time for questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Steve, is thanking someone and confirming that there will be a time for questions. The tone seems to be cooperative and agreeable.


Passage number 78.
 MR. ROOS. I'd like to ask one clarifying question and also a question after that. Early in your statement I believe I heard you say, Steve, that the slower growth of the monetary aggregates reflects slower demand for goods and services. Then further on I understood you to say, if I understood correctly, that in an inflationary economy such as we have people tend to increase their demands or purchases of goods and services. Is there a conflict in--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Roos is simply seeking clarification on a potential contradiction in the speaker's statements.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 79.
 MR. AXILROD. There's a slight conflict, you're quite right. I said early on that the slower growth [in the monetary aggregates] we're now having is consistent with our staff projections of a slowing later on in economic activity. But then I went on to say that the slow [monetary] growth we're having was sufficient to finance this rapid expansion in nominal activity. And the rapid expansion in nominal activity mainly reflects, of course, the rate of inflation and only to a minor extent expansion in real output. Real output was low in the first quarter; it increased at only a 1-1/2 percent rate and the rate of inflation was up close to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The disagreement arises from the contrast between the slower growth in monetary aggregates and the rapid expansion in nominal activity. Mr. Axilrod initially states that the slower growth is consistent with staff projections of slowing economic activity later on. However, he then contradicts himself by saying that the slow monetary growth is sufficient to finance the rapid expansion in nominal activity, which is driven by inflation rather than real output. This disagreement creates a conflict in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 80.
 MR. ROOS. Could I just ask one further question, Mr. Chairman. What factors mitigate, in your thinking, the view that there will be a rebound in the monetary aggregates in the period ahead. What evidence would there be to justify your point of view other than wishful thinking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Roos is asking for evidence to support the view that there will be a rebound in the monetary aggregates, indicating a disagreement or doubt about this viewpoint.


Passage number 81.
 4/17/79 - 8 -  MR. AXILROD. We only have two [pieces] of evidence. One is that the most recent week's data show a slowdown in the [decline] in the outstanding amount of savings deposits at commercial banks. That decline has gone on for five months; savings deposits have been dropping very sharply since late last fall. I think that mainly [reflects] a shift of those deposits into other kinds of assets, maybe even into goods, and [that process] has slowed. Therefore, we possibly are reaching the point where the stock outstanding has been shifted and [the process] is ending. That in itself will increase rates of growth as [it is now1 subtracting [from them]. It involves taking away a negative factor. And then there have been slight indications in very recent data of some uptick in M1. But, again, President ROOS, I don't feel the least bit [confident] that I could guarantee the Committee that there's going to be a rebound in M1 growth this month, next month, or the month after that because I don't know how long this kind of demand shift is going to last. In history we have not had periods with such rapid rises of velocity as we've experienced in the [last] three quarters in a row, including this second quarter. S o  on that ground alone, one might think velocity is going to drop and money will rise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing data and expressing uncertainty about future trends.


Passage number 82.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. John Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 83.
 MR. BALLES. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I always find it difficult to disagree with Steve, particularly after such a lucid exposition as the one he has just gone through. I do have to quarrel though, Steve, with the conclusion that Larry has already addressed. What is the evidence that money will rebound. Last month, you may remember, I called attention to the fact that for the five months running through February the Bluebook forecast has proven to be considerably over the mark month by month for both M1 and M2. To add a little interest to this debate--of course, it's always easier to be a Monday morning quarterback--1 gave my own forecast in qualitative terms. And my guess was that given this consistent pattern the March figures would probably come in significantly below what you were then forecasting. And with apologies for sounding like "I told you so," your March forecast for MI was an increase of 5.7 percent and, as you know, it came in at .75 percent. I consider that significant. There was a better record on M2; the forecast then was 4.9 percent and its growth now is said to have been 3 . 6  percent in March. To try to get my arms around what seems to be the problem, I had my staff prepare a memorandum, which I have handed out here, and I would like to take just a minute, Mr. Chairman, to run through a few of the highlights. There has been this pattern now for six months in a row, October through March, of a significant overforecasting of money growth month by month. That is shown on table 1 by months for M2 and M1; those [variances] are in percentage points. The average overforecast for M1 for those six months was 5.1 percentage points and the average overforecast for M2 was 2 . 8  percentage points, as shown in table 1. Chart 1, which is on the next page, is rather revealing. These monthly errors are just bound to be big. If anybody asked me if I could do better than Steve, I'd say "no I couldn't.'' This is a darn difficult job. Usually what happens, though, is that large errors in any given month will be offset by errors in the opposite direction in the next month. AS shown on Chart 1, about half of the time or in a good part of 1975 and 1976 that is what in fact happened. But when we got near a trough in interest rates in the latter part of 1976 and 4/17/79 -9- into 1977, the errors were all on one side. The staff was underforecasting money, as shown by the black areas below the zero line. We got into a period of rising interest rates in 1978 and the errors shown in the black shaded part were pretty much random. From late 1978 moving into 1979 the errors have again been systematic; they seem to occur at or near troughs or peaks in interest rates. Therefore, Steve, I must say to you again, as I did last month, that [I question1 the forecast in the April Bluebook, which shows M1 growth coming in at 6.75 percent-this is assuming alternative B and an unchanged funds rate--in May after 3.3 percent [in April], for an average of the two months of 5.5 percent. I suspect that's going to be several points too high when we get the actual numbers. I'd say ditto on M2, where the Bluebook shows M2 growth in April at an estimated 7.5 percent rate and in May at a projected 5.2 percent, for a two-month average of 6 . 3 5  percent. I think that's going to be several points too high. Now, if that's what the Committee wants to do, if that's the outcome we're looking for, fine. But we shouldn't walk into it accidentally. I'm beginning in my own mind to make some mental adjustments in deflating these current [Bluebook] figures until I see evidence that money is in fact rebounding at current interest rate levels. I'm afraid the evidence in the last six months gives me little comfort on that [score], Steve, and therefore I suspect that we may be unintentionally, as it were, leaning too hard and getting aggregate growth that in retrospect may prove to have been our undoing. My fear of this risk is compounded by the fact that, contrary to the Board's staff, we expect at least a mild recession beginning in the second half of this year. Without throwing in any detail, I expect it will probably be the classic inventory-type recession, hopefully short and mild.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Balles disagrees with Steve's conclusion and questions the evidence for money rebounding. He also criticizes the forecasting accuracy of the Bluebook and expresses concern that the Committee may be unintentionally leaning too hard on aggregate growth.


Passage number 84.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. I think we have "Balles rule number one" now: That near troughs and peaks forecasts of money are wrong in the wrong direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a personal opinion or belief without any contradictory or opposing views mentioned.


Passage number 85.
 MR. BALLES. Well, in short, Mr. Chairman, those are my misgivings. And I say that with apologies to the staff because I know this forecasting is a tough job. But when we detect systematic errors that run on as long as these have, I for one feel that we've got to make some mental adjustments. This to me says that it would certainly be a mistake to tighten right now by raising the federal funds rate. I think we can overdo that restraint and actually bring about a recession, or exacerbate one that may be in the works in any event. I'm very leery about overdoing it on the monetary policy side. I think there are limits--and we've spoken of this from time to time, Mr. Chairman--about how much can be accomplished by monetary restraint. Therefore, without getting into details on the specifications for the current period, I have a very strong bias against tightening and possibly will make a case for a bit of easing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Balles, is expressing his own concerns and reservations about tightening monetary policy, but he does not engage in any argument or disagreement with others in the passage.


Passage number 86.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. John, thank you for those inputs. Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude to John for his contributions.


Passage number 87.
 MR. PARTEE. Well, I just want to comment on what John said. I have some sympathy with that, John. The fact is that I might admit that [what you talked about] used to be one of my inside devices for forecasting if we had extended misses in the staff projections. Incidentally, Steve doesn't really do those. In his position I used to find that if the extended misses were in one direction, it was an 4/11/79 -10- indication of a change. But what one has to examine is the reason for that. Is it that the staff is assuming there will not be a substantial change in the relationship between activity and money growth. The issue right now, I think, is whether there has been a change in the relationship that is not indicative of the future but indicative of a change in the demand function. So when you point out that the staff has misforecast over the last six months, all you’re pointing out is that there has been some kind of change in the relationship, which the staff increasingly has come to believe is a change in the demand function. S o  it doesn’t really answer--in case this has happened and I’m inclined to think it has happened to a degree at least--the aggregate [unintelligible]. You would have to be a strict monetarist to believe that there can‘t be a change in the demand function of money and, therefore, [that money] must be a forecast of the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is sympathizing with John's point and providing their own perspective on the issue. They also mention that Steve, who presumably has a different position, doesn't use the same forecasting method. However, there is no direct disagreement or clash of opinions presented in the passage.


Passage number 88.
 MR. BALLES. Well, I think your point is well taken, Chuck. I’m not a strict monetarist and I’m not a strict Keynesian either. I don’t know what that makes me--a non-monetarist and a non-Keynesian. Eclectic is one word. I used that word recently to a friend and he said: Did you say epileptic. In any event, there is a plausible case, and the staff has made it well, for a change in the demand for money. I am still somewhat skeptical that the whole outcome has in fact been because there’s been a change in the demand for money. That‘s because we looked pretty closely this past month at what has been going on in money market mutual funds--which have been rapidly accelerating--and at RPs, which have been practically flat for some months now. And the two of them together have not been accelerating. [But that‘s what1 they’d have to do, I would think, to explain the very sluggish growth in M1 and M2. I have a hunch that we may have seen both the combination of some downward shift in the demand for money and also, because we have been on a federal funds target--for pretty good reasons starting November 1, given the international crisis--the shrinking effect of that on bank reserves. [ S o  I think] the very sluggish growth in bank reserves, or in some ways even the negative growth quite recently, also explains some of the outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing their own uncertainty about their economic beliefs and mentioning different factors that could potentially explain the sluggish growth in M1 and M2.


Passage number 89.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. We’ll have Henry Wallich’s question and then start the go-around and see where we really come out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is just giving a plan of action, stating that they will start with Henry Wallich's question and then have a discussion to see where they end up. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 90.
 MR. WALLICH. I wanted to ask Steve what his reasons were for placing much confidence on the existing relationship. there is at least a possibility that that relationship has changed. It has changed, I think, for two years running and has led us to an overprediction of $30 billion in that time, if I remember. People are now looking at what they consider to be inflation of 10 to 12 percent and that is a tremendous incentive to hold down not only Ml balances but also lower-yielding savings and time deposit balances. I really think that under these conditions we have to assume that there is a change in the relationship and, therefore, I don’t see much basis for predicting a rebound. I think this shift can go on at a substantial rate f o r  a long time. If I were to look at any monetary aggregate now, it would be more nearly bank credit plus commercial paper plus finance company lending. In any event I am aware that the monetarists are divided now, with some taking the point of view that the aggregates are moving too slowly and others arguing that the relationship has changed. I‘m trying to ask Steve: What is the reason for thinking we’ll get back on track with the relationship.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, is expressing his opinion that the existing relationship between certain factors (such as inflation and M1 balances) has changed and therefore cannot be relied upon for predicting a rebound. He also mentions that there is division among monetarists, with some believing the aggregates are moving too slowly and others arguing that the relationship has changed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 91.
 As Chuck said, 4/11/19 -1l- MR. AXILROD. Well, Governor Wallich, I really don't know and I don't think anyone knows when exactly we'll get back on the relationship. AS YOU said, in the early stages of this expansion beginning around the end of '74 it took us 2-1/2 years to so-called "get back on the relationship." We have always assumed that this demand shift is not going to last as long because so much [of it] had occurred earlier and there is just that much less cash to use up. It was because of the uncertainty about the aggregates, as you point out, that I tried to stress as much as I did the kind of analysis one would go through in assessing the restrictiveness or non-restrictiveness of the present level of market rates. In that way I think one gets down to what is going to be a very judgmental factor, and that is assessing what really is the expected real return on capital. That is, if inflation expectations are accelerating, that could be offset by declining expectations in the real return of capital. One just expects to make less profit on any given investment. And that would tend, in so far as [assessing] restrictiveness, to offset the impact of accelerating inflation. S o  I really do believe under present circumstances that that kind of judgment is critical to policy, more so than a judgment--if I may put it this way without meaning it prejudicially--about a mechanical application of rules with regard to the aggregates. That's the more critical judgment now; it's essentially a judgment about the future economic outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Axilrod, is suggesting that the judgment of assessing the expected real return on capital is more critical to policy than a mechanical application of rules with regard to the aggregates. This implies a disagreement with the idea that a mechanical application of rules is the most important factor in determining policy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 92.
 MR. WALLICH. I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is agreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, says "I agree," indicating that he is in agreement with a previous statement or argument.


Passage number 93.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think it might be appropriate now to start on item six [on our agenda], which is a Committee discussion of the economic situation and policy implications. What we've been doing recently is asking for you briefly to give your views on the economy, if they involve any significant differences from the staff projection, and the monetary policy implications this might have in general terms. After our break then we'll come back and look at the details and the specifications that might go into a directive. Murray Altmann has straightened me out finally on my random walk theory and, based on his straightening me out, I think we will start with Larry today and come around clockwise from there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 94.
 MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I think we're in an almost no-win situation today. We're in a posture that was of our own making, in that we're reaping what we sowed 2 or 3 years ago by refusing to face up to the fact that by stabilizing interest rates we were permitting the aggregates to grow much too quickly. I think concerning ourselves with the subject of demand shifts is somewhat of an exercise in futility because I don't think we, in our monetary policy function, can control shifts in demand. We're not able to do that. I think the problem is on the supply side. Whereas the aggregates have grown excessively for nearly three years, we're in serious danger of repeating mistakes we've made in the past--and this is at least a near monetarist speaking. For us to jam on the brakes to permit the growth of the aggregates to drop as abruptly as they have and to continue to tolerate that is almost certainly an assurance of a recessionary result. I would just like to emphasize again that at no time did any monetarist ever suggest that there should be an abrupt pulling down of the rate of money growth from a high level to a low level. That is what is happening. I think our main decision today has to be whether we are going to expand the growth of money temporarily in order to 4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -12- ease at least the extent of the recession or whether we are going to knowingly--and if we do it knowingly, we have to accept part of the responsibility--permit monetary growth to continue to be quite low and, at least as we see it, assure the advent of a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and providing an analysis of the situation. There is no direct disagreement or contention presented in this passage.


Passage number 95.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Larry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 96.
 Bones MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, [after] listening to our own directors on Friday and [based on1 our own testing of the activity and the sentiment in our District during recent days, we are more nearly attuned to the [analysis] by the staff this morning than we've been in some time. We recognize the enormous uncertainties about prices, the aggregates, and business growth, and I find it almost useless to belabor this since we are very close to the staff's [projections] this morning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that they are in agreement with the staff's analysis and projections.


Passage number 97.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much. Jim. M R .  SMOOT. Yesterday in meeting with my own staff on this, I think I suffered an information overload. One of the alternatives that was presented to me was called "the pure ignorance theory" That is, we don't know how the economy got here and we don't know where it's going. And I must say that I felt embarrassingly comfortable with that view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It mainly consists of the speaker expressing their own thoughts and feelings about a situation.


Passage number 98.
 Nevertheless-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. That is the most honest comment we've had today .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The statement "Nevertheless-- That is the most honest comment we've had today" suggests agreement or approval. The use of "nevertheless" indicates a continuation or agreement with the previous statement, rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 99.
 MR. SMOOT. Nevertheless, I have to agree with Bones in that we can find no major area of disagreement with anything the staff has said at this point; we have minor points of difference, but nothing dramatic. If one can abstract from this horrible inflation problem, things don't appear to be out of kilter. [The economic expansion is] slowing down-I think the way we would like--and, therefore, in general terms our view would be to stay roughly where we are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It states that there are some minor points of difference, but overall there is no major area of disagreement.


Passage number 100.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much. Willis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  This passage is simply expressing gratitude and does not include any elements of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 101.
 MR. WINN. I hate to see such unanimity over there. I don't want to be a counterforce today. The inflation situation is still very bad. It seems to me that any easing would be misinterpreted and could only be counterproductive. On the [plus] side, it seems to me that the transfer mechanisms really are at work, both from the budget side and the food side. [As for] the oil side, we really don't know what that means. I have a feeling that our policies are really starting to work; they've been slow to take hold, but [monetary policy] is not a quick fix. And to be impatient at this stage would be a mistake. So I end up right in the middle--[no change].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their viewpoint and perspective on the inflation situation and the effectiveness of certain policies. There is no mention of conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 102.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Fantastic. I've never seen this happen at these FOMC meetings before. Bob, you must have some different view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. The speaker expresses surprise and excitement but does not imply any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 103.
 MR. BLACK. There has to be one in every group. I have more doubts than usual about the staff's forecast, which is really one of stagflation for eight or so quarters. I don't deny that there's a possibility that can happen, but to me the weight of past evidence suggests that we're more likely to get cumulative effects and slip into a recession [than to achieve] the kind of soft landing that the 4/17/79 -13- staff is projecting. My own feeling is that we’re probably near the end of the current expansion and fairly close to a turning point. Inflation has [contributed to1 a pretty severe attrition, I think, of real incomes and wealth positions. We see some convincing signs of this in the behavior of consumer and residential outlays. Some people take comfort in the strength that appears to be developing in the investment sector of business, but that is a lagging indicator and I don’t think we can take much comfort in that. I’m more impressed with the scattered signs that are reported throughout the Redbook of lengthening delivery times, of some anticipatory inventory building, and a strong current preference of businesses for short-term versus long-term debt. When one talks to those in the business community there is an unusual unanimity in their views. They all seem to say that things are very good now, but they are scared as the devil about the future. I suppose that translates, Steve, into a belief that the real rate of return on capital is probably dropping. So, I think we’ve arrived at the point in policy where we have to be seriously concerned about the steepness of the deceleration that is taking place in the rate of growth in the aggregates. Some slowing of the excessive growth that we experienced in 1976, 1977, and a good part of 1978 was clearly needed in an effort to have an effective anti-inflationary policy. I hoped we could bring the rate of expansion down, but at a more gradual rate of perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points a year. I thought it was the best way in which to wring inflation out of the economy and I still think so. But the deceleration that we’ve experienced since September has not been gradual. Even after allowing for ATS, NOWs, and a likely downward shift in the demand for money, in my view this has been an overly steep decline. If this is allowed to continue, I think we risk aggravating any recession that may be impending. If my feeling that a recession is close at hand has any merit at all, then at this stage I think we have to face up to the question of whether we want to risk adding to its severity by reacting to the recent inflationary figures. I have doubts about [the wisdom of taking that risk] for two reasons. In the first place, I think we probably will see some abatement in inflation as a result of the past slowing in the aggregates. Secondly, I’m not at all convinced that a severe recession would add significantly more to the reduction of inflation than a mild recession. And as a matter of political reality, if the recession is more serious than it otherwise might be, I think the political system is such that we’re likely to have the kind of fiscal policy fallout that will aggravate inflation rather than help.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage between Mr. Black, who expresses doubts about the staff's forecast and believes that a recession is more likely, and the staff who project a stagflation scenario. Mr. Black also expresses doubt about the wisdom of reacting to recent inflationary figures and believes that a severe recession may not significantly reduce inflation.


Passage number 104.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much, Bob. Nancy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing gratitude towards Bob.


Passage number 105.
 MS. TEETERS. I would like to draw the attention of the Committee to the change in our perception of what has been going on out there. Three or four months ago we were looking at a projection for the first quarter--I‘m not criticizing staff, my own perceptions have changed markedly as we’ve gotten more data--of a rate of growth in GNP of 3 percent. It’s now under 1.3 percent. We were expecting to have 3 percent growth in consumption. It‘s now negative; purchases of goods actually turned down. A whole range of estimates have come in considerably lower than we thought they were going to. The only indicator that seems to be up in real terms is employment. And I would point out to you that employment is not a leading indicator; it 4/17/19 -14- generally [comes] in fairly strong around the final point of a cyclical expansion. A l s o ,  two major reasons that we have used in the past to increase restrictiveness were an excessively rapid growth of the money supply and the need to maintain the international value of the dollar. Now both of those reasons have apparently disappeared. In fact, both of those would almost suggest that we should ease monetary policy at the present time. However, I also feel that anything we do at this point would be mainly psychological. It will have its impact six to nine months down the road and [at this point it] will primarily be for show rather than for any real impact. Finally, I‘m quite concerned that if we tighten, within two months we will have to turn around and undo it. In my view the economy is slowing down and it would be a mistake to tighten credit further. However, given the rate of inflation, I think it also would be a mistake to loosen at the present time. So I would come out for maintaining the present policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Teeters, is expressing her own changed perception and concerns about the state of the economy, but she does not present any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 106.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Nancy. Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude to Nancy, which indicates a positive interaction and agreement between them.


Passage number 107.
 MR. PARTEE. Well, I think the picture is mixed. It seemed to me possible that we could have one final surge of activity and I’ve been quite worried over the last six weeks or so that that might be developing in the business sector in business equipment and in inventories. Whether right or not, I‘ve become rather more calm about inventories in the last couple of weeks. For one, the February numbers were better; retail inventories were down. For another, there do seem to be some explanations--Jim cited quite a list--for the inventory accumulation. The Teamster’s strike, the possibility of a rubber strike, the automobile situation, and so forth may have accounted for the unusual inventory accumulation that was reflected in the Redbook and for the raw materials price figures in the first part of this year. So I‘m prepared broadly to accept the staff’s forecast except that I, of course, think that the economy is going to weaken further and we’ll have a recession toward the end of this year and [into] early next year. But let me say that for the time being the staff’s forecast looks reasonable to me. Another problem that we’re all struggling with is the aggregates and how to interpret them. It seems to me that it has almost reached the point where it may just be a matter of one’s predilection. Some people say we ought to tighten regardless of the aggregates because they’re no good anymore and other people say the aggregates are just as potent as they used to be and are terribly important. Trying to sort through all this, I’ve been looking at the various credit numbers. Bank credit, which had shown some strength, seems to have been weakening as the quarter progressed as have other credit numbers. M5, for example, has been weakening steadily. But that measure doesn’t include RPs and money market funds and things like that. One of the difficulties we have at this time when interest rates are very high--we’ve had it before--is that there’s a good deal of grossing up in credit flows. And it’s easy to double count credit flows. For example, if a money market mutual fund expands rapidly in size and buys bank CDS, you can’t count both the bank CDs in the bank sector and the money market mutual fund on the other side because that‘s double counting. That’s not really demand for credit or a credit flow. If a savings and loan or a mutual savings bank issues a money market certificate and buys a bank CD, the same is true. There 4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -15- is excessive grossing, which doesn't really have anything to do with the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and opinions on the current economic situation and their concerns about inventories and credit flows.


Passage number 108.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. They're netted out in M7 aren't they, Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple question being asked by one person to another.


Passage number 109.
 MR. PARTEE. They are, but we don't really [track that]. I've found, for example, that our Bluebook doesn't have M I .  But they are netted out in another way. That is, the f l o w  of funds accounts have a line for funds raised by nonfinancial sectors. That is like final demand in the GNP, if you will. In looking at that and relating it to GNP, I think I have found something of significance for the Committee to focus on. That number has been quite high over the last six quarters. It was lower in the earlier part of the recovery and expanded sharply in the last half of ' 7 7  and the first three quarters of '78. Going through those five quarters, for example, the numbers were 2 0 . 4 ,  1 8 . 7 ,  18.8, 18.3, and 19.1 percent. The average is a high number; it's distinctly higher than it had been before. In the fourth quarter of '78 funds raised as a percentage of GNP dropped from 1 9 . 1  to 17.6 percent. And in the first quarter of this year the estimate of our flow of funds people is that it dropped further to 1 4 . 2  percent. That's a rather marked drop--almost 5 percentage points in two quarters--carrying it well below where it was earlier in the recovery phase. And I think it is indicative of the fact that for some reason the demand for credit isn't there. It may be [because of1 interest rates, it may be nonprice terms, or it may be as Steve suggested that the expected rate of return on capital is dropping. But for some reason [that demand] isn't there. And I think it does indicate in a very real sense that in the financial sector of the economy a fading is occurring that is consistent with very slow growth if not a downturn in the economy shortly. And I believe we ought to keep that very much in mind as we talk about making these [decisions] that affect the demand for credit and make credit even more restrictive or less restrictive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of one person's observations and opinions.


Passage number 110.

The passage is simply expressing gratitude and giving acknowledgement to Chuck for something he did or said. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 111.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me make a couple of observations. I sit here listening to all this about the aggregates and it seems to me that the only reasonable conclusion is not to put much weight on the aggregates. We see relationships that go way out of the range of historical experience. We haven't any idea of the validity of the forecast [for the monetary aggregates], I'm afraid, and the combination of those two events does not make me want to linger over the aggregates. When I look at the outlook for real GNP, it does seem to me that the staff forecast of six quarters of approximately 1 percent growth in GNP per quarter is inherently improbable. I don't think that has ever happened.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing skepticism and doubt about the validity and reliability of the forecasts and the importance of the aggregates. They disagree with the idea of putting much weight on the aggregates and express skepticism about the staff's forecast for GNP growth. They believe the forecast is "inherently improbable" and that such growth has never happened before.


Passage number 112.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage, "CHAIRMAN MILLER," does not contain enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 113.
 Plus or minus 3 percent VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is precisely the difficulty. The reason they have come up with this forecast is that one doesn't know whether the 3 percent error will in fact be plus or minus. I must say in talking about projection errors that I am much more concerned about the persistent errors in the projections of the inflation rate than I am about the recent errors in the projections of the monetary aggregates. The inflation projections have been 4/17/79 -16- consistently on the low side. And I‘m not just talking about the staff’s projections; I think that has been true of most forecasters. And [inflation] clearly remains our problem. In any longer-range or indeed shorter-range perspective, the inflationary momentum has been increasing. In terms of economic stability in the future that is what is likely to give us the most problems and create the biggest recession. And the difficulty in getting out of a recession, if we succeed, is that it conveys an impression that we are not dealing with inflation. I’m afraid that is the impression that we are conveying. We talk about gradually decelerating the rate of inflation over a series of years. In fact, it has been accelerating over a series of years and hasn‘t yet shown any signs of reversing. I devoutly hope that it will in the second half of this year, but I think the staff is probably being too optimistic on what it will show in the normal course of events. I think the economy is essentially at full capacity and there is a real chance that the concern about a recession will be justified. But I also think there‘s some possibility we will have more of a boom for a longer period of time than we hope. I think it‘s clear that real interest rates are falling and the rate of inflation is up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses concern about the persistent errors in the projections of the inflation rate and believes that inflation is the main problem. They also suggest that the staff may be too optimistic in their projections. This indicates a disagreement with the staff's position on the future of inflation and the economy.


Passage number 114.
 MR. PARTEE. It depends on the expected rate of inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the answer to the question depends on the expected rate of inflation.


Passage number 115.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is right. My observation would be that the expected rate of inflation has increased somewhat in the last six months and the nominal rate of interest has not. Therefore, the real rate of interest has declined. I don’t see any reason why the profitability of investment under present conditions would be declining in Mr. Axilrod’s terms, so I think policy has probably gotten somewhat easier. We may be one month closer to a recession than we were last month and I think we are late [in tightening], but I still am of the view that some greater degree of restriction would be more appropriate than the reverse [and] more appropriate than standing still.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker is presenting their own observations and views without conflicting with any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 116.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Paul. Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 117.
 MR. WALLICH. I think we are in a very difficult situation. The real sector points down. Inflation points up. And the question is whether we can do anything about the downturn of the real sector without aggravating the inflation. I think the answer is no. It is very probable that a slowdown is ahead after four years of cyclical expansion. It would be really astonishing if we didn‘t get a cyclical peak after such a long expansion. The circumstances we observe are not those we’ve seen at other peaks. Unemployment is still relatively high. Capacity utilization isn‘t all that high. But the economy has changed. Six percent [unemployment] is now what 4 or 4-1/2 percent used to be, and 84 or 85 percent capacity utilization is probably what 87 or 88 used to be after all the obsolescence in the capital stock that changing price relationships must have caused. S o  I think we have all the makings of a cyclical peak; we don’t know whether we will descend into a recession or just a slowdown. I see no similarity, however, to 1974. There’s no comparable buildup and there’s no financial crunch. Meanwhile, inflation and inflation expectations are clearly mounting. I think something like 1/2 percent per month or every two months is being built into expectations. If I believe Art Okun, every 1 percentage point in the inflation rate costs $200 billion to remove by orthodox means, and I don‘t know of any other 4/17/79 -17- good means. I think that's greatly exaggerated, but I'd like to alert you to the very high cost, in terms of an inflation correction, we're incurring if all we're doing now is postponing that slightly. It is in any event probably inevitable. Actually, I think the choice we have is between a mild turndown now, in the second half of 1979, or a more severe one later after having suffered some more inflation. I don't think the choices are an obvious or foregone conclusion. As far as the aggregates are concerned, I don't need the aggregates at this time to tell me that the economy may be heading for a slowdown. I think the aggregates have become very weak because of what seems to be a shift in demand. I see that as plausible because the equations by which we're guided don't really encompass expectations of inflation of the kind that we now see, where expectations have moved from the 8 to 10 percent range to the 10 to 12 percent range. I think Paul is right that real interest rates have declined. In fact, they're probably no longer positive. And in a situation like the present, the only halfway plausible guide is to aim at positive real interest rates. I'm not even talking about after taxes because after tax real interest rates are very demonstrably negative except for nontaxable holders. So looking at this combination of a possibility of a downturn, or even of recession, and almost certainty continued inflation at an accelerating rate if we don't act, I come out for some tightening of monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. While the speaker expresses concerns about the downturn of the real sector and inflation, they ultimately conclude that tightening of monetary policy is needed. This suggests that there is contention or disagreement within the passage.


Passage number 118.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Henry. Phil.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing gratitude to Henry, showing appreciation rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 119.
 MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, I see no reason to prolong what you've heard from Paul Volcker and Henry Wallich. I agree with their positions. I would point out to the Committee that we've had several months now of status quo and in that several months we've had at least a 3 percentage point increase in the inflation rate. And I can see some more if we don't act.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Coldwell, agrees with the positions of Paul Volcker and Henry Wallich and believes that action needs to be taken to prevent further increase in the inflation rate.


Passage number 120.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you. Jim.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple thank you statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 121.
 MR. MCINTOSH. Mr. Chairman, if one were to array the 8 or 10 most prominent forecasts, including the Greenbook forecast, clearly the Greenbook forecast with its rather heroic estimates of plus 1 percent real growth in six quarters would come up on the optimistic end of the array. Our own view is that we are heading toward a recession later this year, and that view is shared by most other forecasts. We don't see the case for tightening at this time, particularly since it doesn't buy us anything on the price front in 1979--and perhaps much of 1980--because of the lags. We think the choice is between easing or staying pat. Historically the Federal Reserve has had a tendency to overstay its policy at peaks and troughs, and itrs our fear that we're about to repeat that performance. Therefore, we would argue in favor of a modest move in the direction of ease at this time in the interest of moderating the impact of the recession that we're [expecting].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. One viewpoint presented is that the Greenbook forecast is optimistic and that the economy is heading towards a recession, while the other viewpoint argues for easing or staying pat. The passage also mentions a fear of the Federal Reserve repeating past mistakes.


Passage number 122.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Jim. Ernie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 123.
 MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have no particular quarrel with the staff forecast. It's interesting, however, that the discussion--with just a couple of exceptions--tends to suggest that the risk is on the down side rather than the up side. It seems to me 4/11/79 -18- that the evidence is probably increasing that we have a fair amount of risk on the up side, at least for a temporary period here. Business conditions are very strong in the Southwest and labor markets are very tight. Even in that tight labor market there is heavy recruiting going on from rather distant areas. The only rationality I can see in that is that these out-of-area recruiters feel there’s a significant element in that labor market that is familiar with the jobs in aircraft factories because certainly they shouldn‘t be attempting to pull people out of our market on the grounds of any significant amount of unemployment. We’re unable to see any indications of tightness in credit, with the exception of housing. And in that particular market the tightness in credit is a function of legal ceilings on interest rates. In fact it appears increasingly that what we‘re seeing in the monetary aggregates is the old [pattern] we saw under price ceilings on commodities in WWII. We found the price ceiling on the commodity disappears when there are alternative uses for the resources that will bring higher returns. And we’ve seen [such] alternatives develop with closer and closer characteristics of money. S o  if we keep the price ceiling on, it seems possible to me that M1 as we describe it at the present time is going to disappear. Foreign investments continue to come into our area in significant volume. A natural disaster struck recently, which physically removed one bank. Other bank buildings in the area were not seriously damaged. But all the banks are operating. It is resulting in a substantial demand for currency. It did reveal, however, that a few people in the population still use the mattress. Reportedly one party brought in some $5,000 of $50 and $100 bills and said that he had decided the bank was a safer place than the mattress.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

This passage does not contain any direct conflict or disagreement. The speaker states that they have no quarrel with the staff forecast, but they offer their own perspective on the risks and conditions in the Southwest. They mention business conditions being strong and labor markets being tight, as well as their observations on credit and foreign investments. The passage does not indicate any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 124.
 MR. PARTEE. Because of the tornado, that’s true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing a fact, stating that the cause of something is indeed true.


Passage number 125.
 MR. ROOS. Was that a nonmember bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement.


Passage number 126.
 MR. BAUGHMAN. A national bank. I assume that it could be characterized as an involuntary member. Well, we immediately sent people to the area [affected by the tornado] to indicate that we were prepared to do what we could to assist. They reported that there were long lines of people drawing currency from the banks. One question I asked them was whether there were any indications that it was a run type of situation or simply a matter that in the circumstances people needed currency to continue doing whatever they were trying to do. And the report was that it was mixed. People had some questions as to whether the bank that was severely damaged--as I say, the above ground portion just disappeared--would survive. But other banks in town were accepting checks on that bank and I think that helped to reestablish confidence. Coming to policy, the recitations by Mr. Volcker and Mr. Wallich, with which Mr. Coldwell concurred, captured my feeling of the present situation more closely than other commentary. I think we should at a minimum stand with present interest rates, but indications are that those rates are dropping behind other developments in the economy and, therefore, probably should be nudged up some.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Ernie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from the speaker towards Ernie.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 128.
 John 4/11/19 -19- MR. BALLES. Just to add briefly, Mr. Chairman, to what I said before, we should not have a dilemma, especially for those of us who expect a downturn, hopefully mild, sometime this year and going into early 1980. Intuitively, one is tempted, of course, to tamp a bit harder on the credit brakes because of the recent news on inflation. Having taken a good hard look at what we might get out of that, I doubt if an increase in the funds rate would really give us any quick fix. Certainly it wouldn’t do anything that I can see in the foreseeable future to affect the things that have been especially important in [causing] the recent increase in prices--namely what has been going on in food and in oil. And if we did increase the funds rate at the moment, given the lag that I think exists between such an action and [when] it flows through to the real world, it would be some time in 1980 before that would have much of an impact. Secondly, any move toward a further slowdown in money--looking at the other side now--I‘m afraid would simply exacerbate the recession that we probably are going to see in any event. The flattening out of retail sales for the past three months in my opinion suggests, as was said earlier around this table, that much of the growth in real GNP in the first quarter, modest as it was, was in the form of inventory accumulation. And while inventories don’t appear to be out of line now, that picture, as I‘ve discovered to my sorrow many times before, can change very quickly if final sales remain weak. The recent slowdown in personal income growth and the heavy debt position of consumers suggest to me that we can‘t look to the consumer sector for any real strength over the balance of this year. The trend toward austerity-- if that’s the right word for it--or less expansion in federal, state, and local government spending doesn’t indicate that sector as a great source of strength in the year ahead. Although capital spending is now a source of strength, in my opinion it’s simply too small and too volatile to support any broad-based increase in final sales. And I expect before this year is over [such capital spending will] be swamped by inventories going the other way. So given the outlook on the real side, to tighten monetary policy further now would, I fear, seriously risk the repetition of 1974. In my view the Fed held interest rates too high, too long, and certainly exacerbated that recession. Finally, I would add that the case for tightening to support the dollar is much weaker now than it was several months ago in view of what we heard earlier in the report from the Desk. There was good reason starting last November to adopt the [policy] that we did and I have no regrets about it. Now that the dollar is strong, I think there is more freedom to consider what we ought to be doing in view of the domestic outlook. So where I come out is strongly against any tightening and with some leaning toward a little easing. That’s because of my personal view, as I said to Steve, that his estimates of monetary growth will be too high on both MI and M2 for the April-May period. That‘s too much restraint for me and I think it’s going to make the recession somewhat worse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Balles, expresses his disagreement with tightening monetary policy further and instead leans towards easing. He argues that tightening could risk exacerbating the recession and that the domestic outlook doesn't warrant tightening to support the dollar.


Passage number 129.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, John. Mark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude from one person to another.


Passage number 130.
 MR. WILLES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. When economic theory and data appear to be in such disarray, it seems to me that we ought to introduce real factors. AS exhibit A I would like to show the Committee the last shoe I was able to purchase, which cost me $559. It was made in Nebraska, which is someone else’s District, I‘m happy to say. But it’s a clear demonstration of the fact that inflation is 4/11/19 -20- a real problem and that when guidelines are imposed, quality just goes to pot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and offering evidence to support their point about inflation and quality.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 131.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, I’m glad to get facts back into this [discussion1 .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The use of the phrase "Well, I'm glad" suggests that the speaker has a different opinion or perspective from what was previously discussed. This implies the presence of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 132.
 MR. WILLES. I would simply like to say, when I see all these arguments about real interest rates coming back to haunt me, that I’m beginning to wonder why I did that. Inflation numbers in the first half have been very bad; I don‘t think that should surprise any of us. They‘ve been a little worse than we expected, I guess, but we did expect bad numbers. I think the second half is going to look better. Whereas last year I was anxious for strong and aggressive action, this year--two operations later--I’m painfully convinced that slow and steady as she goes is the appropriate policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is reflecting on their previous beliefs and expressing a change in perspective without contradicting any other viewpoints.


Passage number 133.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Mark. Bob.

Passage number 134.
 MR. MAYO. M r .  Chairman, I think the Board staff‘s forecast is a very good one though improbable. I agree with Mr. Volcker; it never happens that way. But to make it have jiggles is even more improbable. S o  let’s keep our balance on the improbability theory. Like so many others, I feel that if anything the Board staff’s forecast is too high on the real side and too low on the price side, unfortunately. But I am not saying that we are going into a significant recession. We may get awfully close to zero, though, before this calendar year is over. In the Midwest, inventories are not excessive at the moment, although I grant the point that they can turn around very fast. I think the risk is still much greater on the inflation side than on the recession side. I am getting sick and tired, though, of hearing market analysts and the press blow up the fact that we are having so much difficulty at the Federal Reserve interpreting the monetary figures and, therefore, we feel we don’t know what we’re doing. It is getting ridiculous. As a non-monetarist to start with, I’ve been having trouble interpreting the monetary figures for the last ten years and I don’t see that this is any worse. Really, I’m serious. I think the emphasis on the confusion has done us harm. We have tended to feed it and we should stop if we can, simply because our ability to be precise on the monetary aggregates--a precision that I feel was never [possible]--has been exaggerated. So I’d come out and say that we do know what is happening to the aggregates within the usual guidelines of our interpretation here. I might even go so far as to stick my neck out and say that I think monetary policy has done a good job in the last six or nine months in terms of achieving some slowing in the aggregates--not as exaggerated a slowing as the published figures on M1 show. But given the environment in which we had to work I think we have a [good] record. Having said that, I feel it would be premature to ease because of a fear of recession. It would exacerbate the inflation problem, so I would not like to see us ease. Any tightening we do should be no more than 1/8 point or so at the most. To change our basic [posture] from alternative B, or from where we are right now, would risk a very bad result. I don’t want to cut off any strength in the dollar by easing at this point. I don‘t think we need to accentuate the strength of the dollar by tightening. so at this particular juncture I’m as much in favor of standing pat as I’ve ever been. 4/17/79 -21- C H A I R "  MILLER. Thank you, Bob. Roger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Mayo and Chairman Miller seem to have similar views on the current economic situation and the appropriate course of action. They both express concern about inflation and do not think it would be wise to ease monetary policy at this time. They also agree that the precision of interpreting monetary aggregates is exaggerated and that the Federal Reserve has done a good job in slowing the aggregates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 135.
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm at the end of the table and perhaps everything has been said. I look forward to these meetings. [I was pleased1 particularly this morning to learn that we have a new industry in Nebraska and they're apparently very persuasive if they can sell that shoe for $559 to Mark Willes. As for the Board staff's Greenbook forecast, we agree generally with it, with a bit of exception to a couple of areas. ~f you look carefully at it, they have a [rebound] in GNP in the second quarter which, as far as our staff can tell, does not have any basis other than a hope that GNP will increase to a more acceptable level in quarter two of 1979. Also, we'd suggest that housing starts and consumer spending may not be quite as strong as they're projecting. Thus, we would say that their forecast is a bit on the optimistic side, but [the difference] is narrow; we feel the economy might be just a bit weaker. Turning then to the aggregates, everything has been said about the aggregates. To be sure, all of them, including bank credit, have weakened measurably [even] with all the technical explanation that Steve has given. That, taken together with at least our outlook for the economy--and I think it would be true of the Board staff's outlook--the fact is that the restraint that has been put in place by monetary policy in the past is beginning to take effect. Looking forward to 1979, the risks certainly are on the down side. A recession--hopefully a moderate one--is quite likely sometime late in 1979 or early 1980. As for inflation, there's no question that it has been accelerating over the past months, but largely as a result of factors that we cannot control with monetary policy. That is, oil, food, and other such price increases will not be affected, at least in the short run, by anything we do here today. Thus, I would prefer that we stay where we are at the moment. I think a tightening would insure a recession. I don't think that's the way out. As a result, I'd stay where we are and be prepared to move to a bit easier stance if we find that, indeed, the economy in the second quarter is coming in somewhat weaker than the staff is forecasting and if the aggregates remain weak. I'd give greater emphasis to M2 than M1 because M1 does not seem to have much value at the moment. [Unintelligible] all of the measures are weak [andl so long as M1 remains weak with the rest, it seems to me we can throw it out and probably focus on M2 and bank credit a bit more. And I'd be prepared to move to a bit easier stance if the economy does indeed continue to be weak.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Guffey disagrees with the Board staff's Greenbook forecast, specifically regarding the rebound in GNP in the second quarter and the projections for housing starts and consumer spending. He believes the forecast is too optimistic and that the economy might be weaker than projected. He also disagrees with the idea of tightening monetary policy, as he believes it could lead to a recession. Instead, he suggests staying where they are and potentially moving to a slightly easier stance if the economy weakens further.

 [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN MILLER. While we're waiting, I'll merely say that my impression prior to joining this Committee was that it was just a social gathering of folks who enjoyed getting together once a month. But this meeting almost makes me believe that you've earned your pay-- excessive though it may be. I'm talking of the Governors, of course. 4/17/19 -22- I think we're all back; Jim will be here in a moment I guess. Let me make two observations. We've done a fast computer plot on your comments and it appears that we have a perfect bell curve. The Secretary was predicting to me that we'd have a 5 to 5 vote and for the first time in history there would be no new directive. That would mean that the Desk could go on doing whatever it is doing now, [even though] nobody knows what it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The narrator is simply sharing their initial impression of the Committee and their observation of a potential vote outcome.


Passage number 138.
 However, just on the chance that we can break the 5 to 5-- MR. PARTEE. I wonder what would happen if we didn't have a [new] directive. I guess we would continue on the old directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply questioning the potential outcome if a new directive is not implemented.


Passage number 139.
 MR. BALLES. Well, if we're expressing preferences for the first go-around, Mr. Chairman, I'd have to say I lean toward the specs of alternative A as far as M1 and M2 are concerned. I would not make the federal funds range as low as is shown under alternative A; I would suggest 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent. And I would like to see some easing within that range from where we've been for most of the past two months or so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 140.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much, John. Bob Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement. It is simply a polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 141.
 MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, given my views of the economy and how I perceive monetary policy to work, strangely enough, I think all these aggregates ranges are really too low. I'd prefer for M1 a range of 5 to 9 percent--which would trigger action under a strict monetary aggregates directive if the rate came in under 6 percent--and perhaps 6 to 10 percent for M2, which would trigger action at I percent. I emphasize that strict monetary aggregates interpretation because I would not move initially. I would sit right where we are until we see something happening. If we adopted these specifications, we might well see the funds rate move down a little before the next meeting. I'm aware of the risks of that, but it does seem to me that the recent action proposed on reserve requirements might have at least some offsetting effect. Lest some of my more hawkish friends around the table think that I'm a late-hatching dove, I would hasten to add that if I'm fooled on this and the aggregates begin to grow rapidly, I would be just as quick to move the rate up a little, too. But I would sit still until we got some evidence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black is expressing his own views and preferences on monetary policy, but there is no direct opposition or contradiction with any other speaker or idea in the passage.


Passage number 142.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. You'd keep the fed funds where it is. Yes, John.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker wants to keep the "fed funds" in its current position and addresses someone named John.


Passage number 143.
 MR. BALLES. Excuse me, I forgot to add that I would prefer the monetary aggregates directive. Excuse me, Bob.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply adding information or clarifying their preference.


Passage number 144.
 4/17/79 -25 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Bob you were finished, weren‘t you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 145.
 MR. BLACK. Yes, I was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Black simply agrees with the statement or question that was posed to him.


Passage number 146.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The word "okay" is not indicative of any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral response that typically indicates agreement or approval.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 147.
 Phil MR. COLDWELL. MI. Chairman, the view of the world that you portrayed in your initial [comments] just doesn‘t happen to square with my view of what monetary policy can do nor with my belief in the desirability of public policy [moving] to restrain inflation. So I still would advocate that we put additional restraint in this package. I’d prefer ranges of 2 to 7 percent for M1 and 3 to 8 percent for M2, and a federal funds intermeeting range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. Phil Coldwell disagrees with the view presented in the initial comments and advocates for additional restraint in the package, suggesting specific ranges for M1, M2, and federal funds.


Passage number 148.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. And where would you put the funds rate now. Leave it where it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage. The speaker is simply asking where the funds rate should currently be and suggests leaving it at its current level.


Passage number 149.
 MR. COLDWELL. At 10-1/4 percent, the midpoint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is stating a fact about the interest rate being at 10-1/4 percent. There is no sign of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 150.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Bones Kimbrel.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage about "Bones Kimbrel."


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 151.
 MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, I would much prefer at this particular juncture to see [policy] cast in terms of a money market directive. I have trouble with these [Bluebook] ranges. I personally would not like to see them change, so I’d like roughly 2 to 6 percent on M1 and 4 to 8 percent O h  M2. I would very much dislike having the fed funds rate drop below 10 percent during this intermeeting period. At the same time, I‘m not very anxious to see it move up very much-- maybe a shade to 10-1/8 percent with a range of perhaps 10 to 10-1/2. I’m not a subscriber to such a narrow range, but in this environment it may flow reasonably well. So I‘d go with 10 to 10-l/2 percent with probably 10-1/8 at the moment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the statement "I personally would not like to see them change" and "I‘m not very anxious to see it move up very much" which indicate a difference in opinion or preference about the desired range for the fed funds rate.


Passage number 152.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay, thank you. Bob Mayo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 153.
 MR. MAYO. Mr. Chairman, I would stick with alternative B. I would not object, however, to a tightening of 1/8 point or so, which would bring us closer to 10-1/4 percent [on the funds rate]. I think that could give a sign of resoluteness without getting us in trouble of over-reacting. Again, I would follow it as we go along and to some extent see what the market is telling us; I would accept a 10-1/4 percent rate if the market seemed to be telling us that. Otherwise I‘d leave it where it is. I have no particular quarrel with the digits on M1 and M2, and I could buy either type of directive. A monetary aggregates directive might be a little better this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Mayo is expressing his opinion and stating that he would stick with alternative B, but would also be open to a slight tightening of 1/8 point if it didn't over-react. He states that he would follow the market's signals and accepts a 10-1/4 percent rate if the market suggests it. He also mentions that he has no particular issue with the digits on M1 and M2 and could accept either type of directive. At the end, he suggests that a monetary aggregates directive might be slightly better this time. There is no disagreement or contention expressed.


Passage number 154.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Bob. Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, presumably addressing Bob and Chuck, is expressing gratitude towards Bob.


Passage number 155.
 MR. PARTEE. Mr. Chairman, I think we really ought to be easing. It’s past time. We’ve already gotten ourselves into considerable difficulty with respect to the behavior of the real economy. And I agree that there isn’t much we can do to restrain the kind of inflation we have now other than to encourage moderate demand over the long pull. That’s really the only instrument we have available to us to affect prices. The difficulty with easing now is that the public perception is wrong. In fact, all these newspaper articles and so forth have trapped us, or at least they have trapped me. I can’t quite ease in the face of that. Also, I have a modest 4/11/19 -26- concern yet about the March employment numbers--I'd like to see another month's figures--and the possibility of an inventory hump. I think the latter is still possible, but less likely than it seemed before. So for the time being I would favor an unchanged policy but in an easing mode, one might say. And for that purpose we might as we11 have a money market directive because that certainly is what we've had all year. It doesn't make any difference what those aggregates have been. We've kept the funds rate unchanged and we ought to do it again. And if we are going to do that, it seems to me that [our decisions] ought to begin to reflect something of the longer-term strategy that you've indicated here--relating to these charts that have to do with our Humphrey-Hawkins pledge so to speak. I think 3 to I percent is too low for M1 if we intend to move back on track at all. I would make that 4 to 8 percent, as I think somebody else suggested. Well, there were a number of suggestions along that line. And I think we need to raise M2, which is going to miss the range even more. In that case, 5 to 9 percent would be a [step] on the way to that. That's within the context of the money market directive. That doesn't necessarily mean we would move, but we ought to try, to the extent that it is at all feasible, to have short-range target growth rates that are not inconsistent with moving back into the [long-run1 bands that we have specified. Otherwise we ought to decide to change the bands and so inform the Congress. So, I would raise those two specs a little but with an unchanged funds rate of 9-314 percent. I'd be happy with a range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 percent. I don't know why the range needs to go up to 10-1/2 percent; we're not going to move there, I hope, in the period to come.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and suggestions.


Passage number 156.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Chuck. Nancy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement as it is a polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 157.
 MS. TEETERS. I would counsel that we stay unchanged. My [view] is that we should probably be easing. But again I don't think we're quite to the point where we should be doing it and [worsen] inflation. I think it would be the wrong move. I have no quarrel with the specifications of alternative B and I would go for a money market directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Teeters, expresses her own viewpoint and acknowledges that although she has a different view, she does not have any issues with the alternative being discussed.


Passage number 158.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Nancy. Paul.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple expression of gratitude and does not involve any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 159.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you were very eloquent, Mr. Chairman, and I agree with a good deal of what you had to say, but overlooked was the fact that inflation has tended to get worse and that the economy is very much at capacity and ought to slow down. So I find myself very much with Mr. Coldwell in terms of the specifications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker begins by expressing agreement and admiration for the chairman's speech. However, they mention that one factor was overlooked regarding inflation getting worse and the economy being at capacity, which leads them to align themselves more with Mr. Coldwell. The tone of the passage suggests a respectful and agreeable conversation.


Passage number 160.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you. Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement simply expresses gratitude to someone named Henry. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 161.
 MR. WALLICH. I share your views, Mr. Chairman, about what monetary policy can do with respect to the real sector; I don't think we can do anything that will affect it very much very soon. But monetary policy certainly can affect expectations and prices; prices can be changed overnight because of inflation expectations and I think that's what is happening now. So I think we can do something on inflation and we should. I'd go largely with alternative C. For M1 I'd have a range of 2-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent as in "C." I see no point 4/17/79 -27- in trying to get back on track in six months. Chuck’s thought that we should change the track and notify Congress might be one thing we can do to favorably influence expectations, because for M1 to grow over six months at that‘rate of speed we’d have to have--adding 2-1/2 percentage points for ATS--it growing at 9 percent for six months. I think that would be very inflationary and very alarming to the public. Continuing with the specifications, for M2 I’d say 4 to 8 percent. I would say 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 percent [for the funds range], go to the midpoint of 10-1/2 percent and not go below that without a telephone call. If the aggregates are very weak, then we should reexamine. And I’d go with a money market conditions directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich agrees with the views expressed by the Chairman and shares his perspective on what monetary policy can and cannot do. He also expresses his preference for alternative C and provides specific ranges for M1 and M2. He also suggests considering a money market conditions directive based on the strength of the aggregates.


Passage number 162.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. A money market directive. Ernie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 163.
 MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, my preference is for the specifications of alternative C except for the funds rate range. I would [lower] that down some to, say, 10 to 10-3/4 percent, with the idea that we would move during the first week to above 10 percent and by the end of the week probably to 10-1/4 percent depending somewhat on market developments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses a preference for alternative C with a suggested adjustment to the funds rate range. However, there is no disagreement or contention mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 164.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. And which way [on the directive].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any opposing viewpoints or indicate any disagreement. It is simply asking for clarification or direction.


Passage number 165.
 MR. BAUGHMAN. With an aggregates directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 166.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Alternative C and an aggregates directive. Thank you. Roger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement regarding Alternative C and an aggregates directive.


Passage number 167.
 MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would opt for alternative B straight down the line including the funds rate range. On the funds rate I‘d remain where we are unless we see the aggregates moving outside the lower end of the ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their preference for alternative B and their opinion on keeping the funds rate where it currently is.


Passage number 168.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Did you say an aggregates directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is a simple question asking for clarification.


Passage number 169.
 MR. GUFFEY. A money market directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply refers to a money market directive without expressing any conflicting opinions or debates.


Passage number 170.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Roger. Larry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a simple expression of gratitude and a name. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 171.
 MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I would opt for alternative A, for easing. If that were done, I would urge the Chairman to explain the rationale that this is not a permanent softening of our anti-inflation emphasis--that we are really doing it temporarily to try to reduce the impact of a recession. Sometimes our tendency is not to state our reasons publicly. I think we could probably counteract a certain amount of the inflationary expectations that this signal might cause. Finally, I’d like to compliment you, sir, for your emphasis on establishing and announcing longer-range strategies and sticking with them, and abandoning our month-to-month fine-tuning over an 1/8 percentage point on the federal funds rate. That comes like a breath of fresh air. It‘s the best news I’ve heard for three years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Roos, expresses agreement and support for alternative A and compliments the chairman on his emphasis on longer-range strategies and abandoning month-to-month fine-tuning.


Passage number 172.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, thank you, I think. Mark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude for something.


Passage number 173.
 MR. WILLES. I’m afraid it comes too late, M r .  Chairman, since I’m no longer a voting member. But I like both your recitation and your specifications and I would go with those.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement and support for the recitation and specifications mentioned by the chairman.


Passage number 174.
 4/11/19 -28- CHAIRMAN MILLER. I knew I'd get you someday. Willis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a friendly statement.


Passage number 175.
 MR. WINN. I have no quarrel with alternative B. I just wonder, in view of the discussion, if there's some symbolism that could be effected without really much change in market conditions, such as a 114 point increase in the discount rate. Reserve requirements might be expanded on some other items such as on Eurodollars and other [components where we know of] problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that they have no quarrel with alternative B and simply wonders if there might be some symbolic changes that could be made without majorly affecting market conditions.


Passage number 176.
 I don't know whether this is the appropriate time-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. Those are certainly things we have to consider.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and acknowledging the need to consider certain factors but does not appear to be arguing or disagreeing with anyone.


Passage number 177.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I meant to mention those, too. I think that is correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is expressing agreement with the previous statement. The phrase "I think that is correct" further reinforces the agreement.


Passage number 178.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Willis. Jim.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude towards Willis.


Passage number 179.
 MR. MCINTOSH. Mr. Chairman, we certainly agree with your comments with respect to adopting a policy that seems to be appropriate given the lags in our forecasts. We'd opt for either "A" as proposed or for the modification suggested by John Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker agrees with the Chairman's comments and further suggests two possible options, showing willingness to consider different alternatives. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 180.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Jim. Dick.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 181.
 MR. SMOOT. I don't know whether it's a fact of whom I'm sitting between today but I find myself in amazing agreement with them on certain points. We would prefer alternative B. quibble about a 118 point increase in the federal funds rate although we don't think it's required. As far as [raising] the discount rate, that's another possibility we had considered. That might merit some consideration if the funds rate rises at all. But fundamentally, alternative B is fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges being in agreement with the others and expresses their preference for alternative B. They also mention considering raising the discount rate if the funds rate rises, but overall, they express agreement with alternative B.


Passage number 182.
 We would not CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay, thank you all. Let's see what we have. Bob did you have a range for the fed funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply a request for information from Bob.


Passage number 183.
 MR. BLACK. I neglected to say it, M r .  Chairman. I had 9-314 to 10-1/4 percent, but I could leave it unchanged without much quarrel, really.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker mentions that they had a specific percentage in mind, but they also state that they could leave it unchanged without much quarrel. This suggests that there is no contention or disagreement involved.


Passage number 184.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. What is it now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "What is it now" does not contain any form of contention or disagreement. It seems to be a neutral question without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 185.
 MR. BLACK. It's 9-314 to 10-112 percent, but I wouldn't want to use the top quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is a statement of a numerical range, with no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 186.
 MR. PARTEE. I had the same specs as you did, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating that they had the same specifications as the chairman, indicating a similarity or agreement rather than a disagreement.


Passage number 187.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. We have a very mixed bag. Paul, did you want a money market or an aggregates directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply presenting options and asking for Paul's preference.


Passage number 188.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Given] the fact that we've been operating with a money market [directive], I presume we would continue to do so almost regardless of what we say here today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is expressing a presumption based on a previous directive, so there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 189.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. We keep saying we're doing something else, but we keep going with a money market directive, don't we.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply questioning the consistency between what is being said and the actual actions being taken.


Passage number 190.
 4/11/19 -29- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that would be appropriate, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they believe something would be appropriate without any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 191.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, it’s going to be hard to make anything out of this. Five have the bottom of the fed funds range at 9-3/4 percent--1 told you it would be five to five--and one has it at 9-1/2 percent. John, you said 9-1/2 percent on the bottom side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating different opinions or predictions about the fed funds range, but there is no argument between the individuals mentioned.


Passage number 192.
 MR. BALLES. Yes sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting or opposing viewpoints. It simply states that Mr. Balles agrees with something.


Passage number 193.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Could we get you up to 9-3/4 percent. Then we’ll have six.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a statement or proposition.


Passage number 194.
 MR. BALLES. Well, I’m a reasonable guy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. The speaker states that they are a reasonable person, which implies that they are open to dialogue and may be willing to find common ground.


Passage number 195.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. On the top side we have three at 10-1/4 percent and everybody else is at 10-1/2 save Henry, who is at 10-3/4 percent. Have I misstated anyone’s views. I think Henry is the only one at 10-3/4. As modified, John, you’re 9-3/4 to 10-1/4; Bob [Black] had the same, 9-3/4 to 10-1/4. Phil and Bones had 10 to 10-1/2. Bob Mayo had the “B” range, which is the [current one of] 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent. Chuck had 9-3/4 to 10-1/4; Nancy, 9-3/4 to 10-1/2; Paul, 10 to 10-1/2; and Henry 10-1/4 to 10-3/4. That would indicate that something like 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent might fly. Let’s put that down tentatively. There are lots of 10-1/2s on the up side; we’re bracketing everybody, you see. We have nobody below [lo-1/2 percent] and only one over it. We’re going to have very little room for dissent when we‘re through here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is summarizing the different percentages suggested by various individuals and stating that there is little room for disagreement.


Passage number 196.
 MR. PARTEE. Henry’s safe.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply mentioning the possession of Henry's safe.


Passage number 197.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. We have one member for easing some and we have five for prevailing [conditions]. Now, if John Balles is a reasonable man, he’ll stick with prevailing and we’d have six for that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any explicit contention or disagreement. It simply presents a count of opinions, stating that there is one member in favor of easing conditions and five members in favor of prevailing conditions. The statement about John Balles being a reasonable man and potentially sticking with prevailing conditions does not imply disagreement or contention.


Passage number 198.
 MR. BALLES. I’m sorry, Mr. Chairman, will you say that again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 199.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. We have a range for the fed funds rate and now the question is, do we keep the present [rate] or move it up or down. You suggested we move down. Five other members of the Committee suggested the prevailing rate. And four others suggested going up, although Bones did not; he said 10-1/8 percent and that’s where we are now, more or less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that there are different opinions on whether to keep the present rate, move it up, or move it down. Five Committee members suggest keeping the prevailing rate, four suggest moving it up, and one member suggests a specific rate.


Passage number 200.
 MR. KIMBREL. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage consists of only one sentence, spoken by Mr. Kimbrel. There is no indication of contention or disagreement as the sentence does not express conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 201.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Where we are is 10 to 10-1/8 percent, so you are pretty much for the prevailing-- M R .  MAYO. I’m for prevailing also.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers agree that they are "pretty much for the prevailing."


Passage number 202.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, we have [a majority for] the prevailing rate, obviously. Now for the ranges. For M1, there’s a definite split. Let‘s put down 3 to 8 percent. We have two for 3 to I ,  one for 4 to 8, one for 5 to 9, and a couple for 2 to 7 percent. Help me with my mathematics. It looks as if we need something lower 4/11/19 -30- to catch some who are interested in that possibility and something higher to catch others.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing different options and ranges for certain rates, seeking input or suggestions from others.


Passage number 203.
 MR. PARTEE. HOW about 3 to 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. The text simply mentions a range of percentages without any conflicting opinions or opposing views being presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 204.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, we need two 3 to 8 percent ranges--3 to 8 on M1 and on M2. That’s the answer. Actually, we need 3 to 8-1/2 percent on M2. don’t we. Or 4 to 8-1/2 percent. You all wouldn’t stick with anything reasonable. You had to have all this individuality.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing frustration with the group, stating that they are unable to agree on a reasonable range for M2 and that they have too much individuality.


Passage number 205.
 MR. BLACK. We were reasonable; we just weren’t persuasive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they were reasonable but not persuasive.


Passage number 206.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Eight are calling for that directly and one is near it. Put down 4 to 8-1/2 percent. There seemed to be a majority for a money market directive, which means it’s all an exercise anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply presents different opinions or perspectives on the topic of interest rates and monetary policy.

Passage number 208.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Let me see if I can read what I have here. This is very hard. Let‘s say a fed funds range of 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent and maintain the prevailing rate, which now is 10 to 10-1/8 percent--is that correct, Peter.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information about the midpoint and the different percentages for M1, M2, and the money market directive.

How many are happy with the 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent [funds range] with the prevailing [funds rate initially]. We seemed to have 6 or 7 for that before. I don’t know what happened. Because nobody likes the whole thing, I have to know what’s wrong with it. That [funds range] seemed to have a majority. There were about 6 or 7 people who wanted that. Seven. Okay, that takes care of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply presents a question and does not provide any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 217.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Obviously, it’s the aggregates that are wrong. All right, nobody wanted any of the aggregates [ranges I cited]. Let’s go back down the list. John, what do you want for M1 on a compromise. You didn’t get your 5 to 9 percent the first time 4/17/79 -31- around. You were [not] the only one who went as high as 9, because Bob [Black] outdid you--he went to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing different percentages and allocations without engaging in any argument or dispute.

 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Oh, we got them mixed up here.

Passage number 221.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. What I have down here is that John had 5 to 9 percent. What did you really say before.

The speaker is merely pointing out that they are discussing a specific topic related to "M2 MR. BALLES" and referring to the specifications of "alternative A" on "M1 and M2."


Passage number 225.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. You had 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 percent, right.

Passage number 227.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. And you don‘t buy 3 to 8 percent. Or do you. It‘s a half percentage point each way--very precise tuning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing information about the percentage range (3 to 8 percent) and then questioning if it is possible to buy within that range. The mention of "very precise tuning" further emphasizes precision rather than disagreement.


Passage number 228.
 MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I would take the revised specs that you indicated of 3 to 8 percent on M1 and 4 to 8-1/2 percent on M2. I do it with great reluctance in view of the money market directive, however. That‘s my hang-up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There doesn't appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses reluctance about the revised specs but does not directly challenge or dispute any specific point.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement discussing the higher ranges assigned to Bob.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black simply states his willingness to negotiate on the percentage for M1 and expresses a lack of concern for M2.

 CHAIRMAN MILLER. All right. Phil Coldwell, you had 2 to 7 and 3 to 8 .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 239.
  MR. COLDWELL. Well, what I think is important to look at here is the upper part of the M1 range. Seven percent is the peak for alternative B, and if we’re going to maintain a steady directive I 4/17/79 -32- think we ought to keep some balance. I lowered [the bottom of the M1 range] to 2 percent just to give a little balance, hut I’m willing to go with a 3 to 7 percent range on M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Coldwell, is expressing his opinion and suggesting a range for the M1 range, but there is no mention of opposing opinions or conflicting viewpoints.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. One person is expressing their preference for a certain range (4 to 8), while another person believes there should be something different (brackets the path for getting back within the longer-run ranges).

 CHAIRMAN MILLER. And 3 to 8 percent didn’t do that. m. PARTEE. No. The 4 to 8 is close--6-1/2 percent is the midpoint that is specified on that chart over the six months--so even that’s a little short. It really ought to be what Bob suggested, 5 to 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that the 4 to 8 percent range mentioned is close to the specified midpoint. They also agree with Bob's suggestion of a 5 to 9 percent range.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement seems to suggest a mutual agreement or understanding between the parties involved.

Now, 4 to 8-1/2 percent on M2 seemed all right. [Let’s assume for Ml] 3 to 8 percent--that everybody went in the middle.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee simply states that they are going to try 4 to 8 percent on M1, without any opposing views or conflicting statements being presented.


Passage number 301.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Murray, we're going to take one more stab at a vote. Then we're going on to the next topic. We're going to use the same fed funds range, which is 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent and [initially] we're going to maintain the present fed funds rate of 10 to 10-1/8 percent; we're going to have M1 at 4 to 8 percent and M2 at 4 to 8-1/2 percent; and we're going to have a money market directive. Okay. Paul, you're just a constant no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information and stating a fact about Paul.


Passage number 302.

Passage number 304.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you have an April housing starts figure for me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple request for information.


Passage number 305.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. This is the water shed. The fever has broken and next month we will have a unanimous vote. Now we will go to the next subject, which is consideration of the Manager's recommendation with respect to foreign currency operations. Alan Holmes .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the fever has broken and a unanimous vote is expected next month, and then transitions to the next subject. Alan Holmes is mentioned as the author or speaker, but it does not add any contention to the passage.


Passage number 306.
 MR. HOLMES. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting viewpoints or disagreements. It is a simple statement from Mr. Holmes.


Passage number 307.
] CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much, Alan. Quite an unwinding job. was brought before the Committee previously and that is holding balances in foreign currencies. The Committee previously authorized the holding of up to $500 million in foreign currencies. But it was the desire of the Committee to have the question of whether we should hold larger amounts or none at all [studied by the staff]. Developed Now we need to have a discussion of the question that 4/17/19 -36- for your consideration was a memorandum submitted jointly by Steve Axilrod and Alan Holmes, with supporting memos from the Board‘s International Division and from the New York Bank on possible recommendations. I might ask Steve and Alan to comment on this and we will open it up for discussion. Steve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 308.
 MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I believe the two supporting memoranda provide the Committee with the various arguments in some depth--with some differing points of view--and I don’t feel it is necessary to review those arguments orally. Mr. Holmes and I have recommended raising the informal limit on balances to the neighborhood of $2 billion for the four reasons that we have outlined [in the memo]. One thing I would like to highlight is [something I’ve learned1 in the relatively brief time I have been involved in this area. It‘s a rather practical approach. And that is, if you are going to play in the game, you’ve got to have chips. Playing in the game means not only with relation to the rest of the U . S .  government but with foreign central banks. So, our holding balances [of foreign currencies] would seem to me very crucial in order to have a degree of flexibility in dealing with these groups. If the Federal Reserve is to have what I think will be a necessary input into the decisions that are made in this international game of affecting foreign exchange market operations, I believe we need to hold some balances. And I would simply stress that view, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and emphasizing the importance of holding balances in foreign currencies.


Passage number 309.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Do you have a question for Steve, before we hear from Alan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that there is an opportunity to ask a question to Steve before hearing from Alan, without indicating any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 310.
 MR. ROOS. No sir, I’ll wait.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The response "No sir, I'll wait" indicates a respectful and patient attitude, but does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 311.
 MR. HOLMES. Mr. Chairman, I don’t have very much to add. The only thing I would stress is that because we have been in the forefront of this activity for a very short period of time we were able to buy $2-3/4 billion in foreign currency. Now, that type of period may not repeat itself, yet it could. So to give us flexibility I would feel much happier if we had more than the $1/2 billion of leeway, of which we have already used half at the moment. Establishing a limit of $2 billion does not preclude us, in my view, from doing what we may eventually want to do, but I feel we have to wait for time, experience, and some testing of markets and other thinking. I believe the memos are fairly self-explanatory and I have nothing more to add.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Holmes is simply giving his opinion and expressing his desire for more flexibility in terms of the amount of foreign currency they can buy.


Passage number 312.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Fine. Thank you very much, Alan. Now, Larry, we will come back to your question or comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a polite exchange where one person acknowledges Alan for answering a question and then mentions that they will address Larry's question or comment next.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 313.
 MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I‘m concerned about one bit of verbiage where reference is made to two possible policies. One says u.S. policy is aimed at countering short-run disorderly market conditions. Then there is explicit wording in the Morton-Truman memo which says that if U.S. policy is also designed to resist exchange market movements that carry the dollar‘s value beyond levels that are deemed to be reasonable in either direction, the United States might want to be prepared to accumulate substantial holdings. My question is this: In terms of the rules of the game that we are playing, are we contemplating going beyond just reacting to disorderly conditions and actually trying to peg [the value of the dollar].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. 

This is indicated by Mr. Roos expressing concern about the verbiage and raising a question about whether the U.S. policy is going beyond just reacting to disorderly conditions and attempting to peg the value of the dollar. This suggests that there is disagreement or differing interpretations about the intentions and goals of U.S. policy.


Passage number 314.
 4/17/79 -37- MR. HOLMES. I don’t think anyone is suggesting pegging, but the whole November program was based on the thought that the dollar had gotten out of line, it had gone [down] too far. Now, that is a very rough judgment. It’s not pegging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement and explanation about the November program and the judgment on the value of the dollar.


Passage number 315.
 MR. ROOS. Whose judgment is that, Alan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roos is simply asking whose judgment is being referred to.


Passage number 316.
 MR. HOLMES. I think that was a collective judgment of the Administration, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is stating that the judgment in question was a collective decision made by the Administration, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve.


Passage number 317.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. I might mention, Larry, that at Henry‘s suggestion the staff prepared some data on a series of currencies, looking from 1973 to date at price adjusted exchange rate indices. In other words, the weighted average [exchange rates] would be adjusted by CPI indices. It might be worth sending this to the members of the Committee just for their information. It‘s very helpful. One way to look at it is that the difference between inflation rates of two countries should be taken into account in terms of where those currencies ought to be over a period of time. One could also, in my opinion, look at it in relation to the opportunity [costs of] holding those currencies in terms of interest rate differentials. That would tell you whether the rates were being maintained in relation to [their respective] purchasing power. What will you be able to buy at the end of the year--or after two years--by holding one currency over 12 months as compared to holding another currency over that 12-month period. None of these ways is perfect, but they are indications. I think what Alan and Steve and others are getting at here is that if there were a real departure from anything that could be rationalized by inflation or interest rate differentials, we might want to say, well, there is just total disorder in the market. And we’d have to do something as we did on November 1 to get it back in line. We hope that doesn’t happen again, but it can happen; basically it happens when we have failed to keep up with the situation for too long.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about using different factors, such as inflation rates and interest rate differentials, to analyze currencies.


Passage number 318.
 MR. ROOS. I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple statement made by Mr. Roos.


Passage number 319.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Next [on my list of people who want to comment] is Chuck, then Bones, Phil, and Henry. Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply lists the names of individuals who want to comment. There is no indication of contention or disagreement among them.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 320.
 MR. PARTEE. Mr. Chairman, I have real concern about the Federal Reserve holding substantial foreign currency balances. I don’t think it’s the appropriate thing for us to do. I’ve never liked the idea of U.S. institutions in general holding large foreign balances. [It means they] aren’t financing their primary activity of spending or investment or whatever it is. I think we have a swap system that is perfectly adequate; it was developed over time. I found the reasoning in both memos very strained as to what the advantages would be in terms of being able to operate without the blessing of the Bundesbank or whatever. That’s because, in fact, when we spend marks--whether we borrow and spend them or we [hold them and] just spend them--the Germans are going to have the same liquidity problem. We’re going to have the same tolerance of their sentiments as we would otherwise. Also, let me mention that we seem to get a good deal lower rate of return on these [balances], at least in the case of Germany and I guess Switzerland and [Japan]. I was interested to see that apparently my concern was shared by the framers of the Federal Reserve [Act] because both memos specify that the Federal 4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -38- Reserve Act says that it is against the law for the Federal Reserve to hold foreign currency securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee expresses concern about the Federal Reserve holding substantial foreign currency balances and argues that it is not the appropriate thing to do. He also criticizes the reasoning presented in the memos and highlights the lower rate of return on these balances.


Passage number 321.
 Then they go on to-- MR. HOLMES. Government securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "they go on to" discuss government securities.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 322.
 MR. PARTEE. The one [reference] says government securities; the other doesn’t. The other says foreign currency securities. Then [the memo1 goes on to say that we can get around the law. I don’t think that‘s an appropriate thing for the Federal Reserve to do--to find a way to get around the law. If we have a need for relatively small working balances, that‘s one thing. But if we‘re going to develop [a program for1 large amounts of foreign currency holdings, that’s another. I also noticed with interest that the memo from Messrs. Holmes and Pardee says on page 9 that a good cushion to begin with would be two or three days‘ worth of heavy intervention. That signals to me an intent here and a very possible threat of building up large balances. So I must say I oppose it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker (Mr. Partee) expresses disagreement with the idea of finding a way to get around the law and developing a program for large amounts of foreign currency holdings. Additionally, the speaker opposes the idea of building up large balances and signals a possible threat in doing so.


Passage number 323.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Could we have some clarification of the legal point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is neutral and simply asking for clarification of a legal point. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 324.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. What is the legal point. Paul is asking about the legal point of holding foreign currencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Paul, is simply asking about the legal aspect or perspective of holding foreign currencies.


Passage number 325.
 MR. HOLMES.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The passage only provides the name "MR. HOLMES" without any additional information or context to suggest any form of disagreement.


Passage number 326.
 We cannot hold foreign government liabilities VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just government, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states that we cannot hold foreign government liabilities.


Passage number 327.
 MR. HOLMES.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage "MR. HOLMES" as it is just a name or a title.


Passage number 328.
 We can hold private-- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My assumption always has been that [the authority to hold foreign government securities] was not put in the Act originally because in those days there was not much deficit financing; there weren’t many foreign government securities. What [central banks] held in those days were acceptances, deposits or some other form. Am I wrong about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The passage is simply stating the assumption and beliefs of the speaker regarding the reasons for the absence of the authority to hold foreign government securities in the Act. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 329.
 MR. HOLMES. I am not a lawyer but my impression is that the Act described what was typically held by a central bank and it has not been revised over these many years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states their impression about an act without any opposing views or arguments being presented.


Passage number 330.
 MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but you haven't provided a passage for me to analyze. Could you please provide a passage so I can determine if there is contention or disagreement?


Passage number 331.
 Well, why the prohibition on foreign government securities if it is-- MR. HOLMES. There weren’t any.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that there were no prohibitions on foreign government securities.


Passage number 332.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It just wasn’t listed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 333.
 MR. PARTEE. Did they prohibit everything that there wasn‘t anything of.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and does not involve any contradicting or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 334.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. They listed what we could hold. Is that what you’re saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification or confirmation about a list of items.


Passage number 335.
 MR. HOLMES. That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "That's right" is a simple affirmation and does not indicate any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 336.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. It’s the absence of a security that didn’t exist. It didn’t exist so it’s not on the list.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact that a particular security was absent and explains that it was not included on a list because it did not exist.


Passage number 337.
 4/11/19 -39- MR. PARTEE. Oh. so they didn't prohibit it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that something was not prohibited without any indication of opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 338.
 MR. HOLMES. It's not prohibited. It's just not listed as one of the assets that we might hold, primarily I think because none [existed] at the time the Act was written.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply explains that holding certain assets was not listed in the Act.


Passage number 339.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. That's quite different, I think. There was no expressed desire to prohibit. There were just no such securities around, so they didn't list them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is providing information and does not involve any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 340.
 MR. HOLMES. I think it's that simple.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not seem to involve any kind of contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple statement or opinion shared by Mr. Holmes.


Passage number 341.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Bones.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 342.
 MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, maybe I'm [approaching] the problem from a slightly different angle but I think it may be prudent action to acquire some of these [currencies]. My question, though, is that I'm not sure I followed Alan when he was suggesting the dimensions. The numbers you suggested were $500 million and then $2 billion. I'm not sure what you're thinking now. M R .  HOLMES. As you recall--1 think it was at the February meeting--we had been running with an informal limit of $150 million. There was nothing formal about that [limit], but it was an informal one that we had always respected at the Desk. In February I noted that we were making some progress in repaying [our swap debt] and I suggested that the Committee might want to consider [acquiring] $500 million and the Committee [approved that]. Now we're suggesting, since we have made such tremendous progress repaying swap debt and since there may be opportunities to acquire some more [foreign currency balances] in the future--heaven knows if there really will be--that $2 billion does not seem an inappropriate amount. I would note that at the peak of our swap borrowing we had risks on the other side of several times that amount.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kimbrel is simply seeking clarification on the suggested numbers and Mr. Holmes is explaining the previous limits and suggesting a higher amount based on progress made in repaying swap debt.


Passage number 343.
 MR. PARTEE. That, of course, was built up when the dollar was weak. Now we're going to build up a risk when the dollar is strong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents two different scenarios or situations (when the dollar is weak and when the dollar is strong), without expressing any disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 344.
 MR. HOLMES. That's right. We're trying to be a little more symmetrical on our asset and liability sides.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact or intention without any indication of opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 345.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Phil Coldwell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 346.
 MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, I don't resist the idea of building up a small kitty. I do have some resistance to the idea of an excessive amount in a single currency. So I think we ought to limit the amount in a single currency to a billion dollars, partly to limit potential exchange losses and partly to avoid pressures in terms of the currency status of some of these countries. Also, we ought to limit our holdings to major currencies. I'm certain that the Desk isn't going to play in or something like that, but I think we ought to have that well understood. I believe we need political and Treasury clearance and I assume that that will be done before we jump into any major stockpiling. We ought to have a slow rate of accumulation, assuming we don't have masses dumped on us, Alan. Then finally, I'm a little disturbed about what I hear in terms of intervention policy. [Under] the first of November ground rules, 4/11/79 -40- we're going to try to resist further downward movement [in the exchange rate of the dollar]. Well, now we have upward movement. Theoretically, I guess that first of November policy was established by somebody believing the dollar to be undervalued at that time. I don't know whether the dollar is valued correctly, overvalued, or undervalued now. But it seems to me that we ought to have some sort of policy that permits some rate increases along with increases in balances. We do not attempt to peg or limit changes in exchange rates. Those are my comments, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Mr. Coldwell expresses resistance to the idea of an excessive amount in a single currency, suggesting a limit of one billion dollars. He also expresses concern about potential exchange losses and pressures on the currency status of certain countries. Furthermore, he suggests limiting holdings to major currencies and emphasizes the need for political and Treasury clearance before stockpiling. Finally, he expresses disturbance about the intervention policy, questioning its effectiveness and suggesting the need for a policy that allows for rate increases.


Passage number 347.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Phil. Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: This statement is a simple expression of gratitude and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 348.
 MR. WALLICH. Well, I believe we should think very carefully about what we're doing here; $2 billion is not a large amount and can be a perfectly good means of enhancing our operations. It could be the first step into a totally different world. If we ever got to a very bullish dollar situation, which is not inconceivable, and we wanted to restrain the dollar from going up very sharply--not peg it-- [because] we would lose our trade competitiveness, we might find ourselves authorizing $5 billion a week. And after a few weeks of that we might throw in the sponge, as the British did. If that were to happen, I don't think we should do that. We still have to think about what the reactions of other central banks will be; we don't want to promote countries into reserve currency status if they don't want that. We don't want to get them in the frame of mind where they throw all the burden of intervention on us. We've already attracted to ourselves more of the burden of intervention. The New York market has increased in scope; I would guess it has become a better market because there is a strong supplier of D-mark in it and we will be attracting an increasing burden. I'd like to be sure that what we do here remains small unless we carefully consider what we should do in the other direction. If we do go in the other direction, I hope we could find some way of using SDRs and not individual foreign currencies. There are technical difficulties but we might overcome those. Meanwhile I'd convey to foreign central banks as we accumulate [these balances]--provided they agree--that we by no means intend to make a total change in our predominant use of the swaps. We don't intend first to use the reserves and then the swap lines; and we don't want to expose ourselves to their saying that when we've drawn on the swap we pay that off out of reserves that we've accumulated rather than give us the money outright as we have done sometimes [in the past]. These are some of the market strategy considerations that I think will come to [unintelligible] and we ought to lay [the ground rules] out with foreign central banks very cautiously.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any overt disagreement or contention. It primarily consists of the speaker expressing his thoughts and concerns regarding financial operations and market strategy.


Passage number 349.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Henry. Paul.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 350.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, what I have to say is more or less along the lines of what Henry was just talking about. Let me state it perhaps slightly differently. I don't see this as an issue at this point. It may be a nice issue but I assume we're not being asked now to go out and acquire a substantial amount of foreign currencies to hold more or less indefinitely. What I see as a problem here, which is a byproduct of intervention, is that when we run out of indebtedness--if that's the way to put it--if we don't hold any foreign currencies, we can't intervene on the side of the market in which we are now intervening. That may be inconvenient if we're not prepared to hold foreign currencies. I don't think intervention 4/11/19 -41 policies should be controlled by an inability to hold foreign currencies. Also, it makes sense to be symmetrical. If we’re willing to go into debt, we ought to be willing to go long on the other side. And something like $2 billion may allow us a reasonable amount of leeway around zero, but [I don‘t see that] as a permanent holding. That‘s the way I view this and on that basis I would support it. I am not ready to support a permanent massive holding at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement with Henry's point and elaborating on it by presenting their own perspective. They mention some potential issues but ultimately state their support for the proposal.


Passage number 351.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. It seems to me that what has been recommended is by no means a suggestion that we become symmetrical. When we were talking about going short we were talking about some $20 billion dollars--more than that actually [including] the Treasury and ourselves--that we would borrow and have to pay back. If we were being symmetrical, we would want to authorize a $30 billion package on the [long side].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's perspective on the recommendation and explains their reasoning.


Passage number 352.
 VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only provides the title or role of someone named Vice Chairman Volcker. It does not provide any context or statement that could indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 353.
 Between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve - - CHAIRMAN MILLER. We would have $30 billion on one side and $30 billion on the other side, a $60 billion band. No one would want to do that. I don’t have a strong feeling on this, but the question before the Committee is: Do we at least want to deal in what is less than one swap line--in a series of currencies on the long side--as a way of continuing the operation of moving in depth to counter swings in the dollar, which is very strong again today. And we‘re not trying to peg it. As I say, we have had static occasionally from our [counterparts] about pegging or whatnot, but we have not tried to do that. Alan has consistently taken the view--sometimes with a few bruises--to let [the dollar] go a little and move in as it goes up and cushion it. S o  it probably wouldn’t mean the end of the world today whether we approve this or we don’t. I think some of the things Phil said are very worthwhile. If we do this, we might well want to put a limit of a billion dollars for any currency and we certainly want to list the currencies we’re talking about [acquiring], which would be only the major currencies. At the moment we’re only talking about three currencies but we might want to add to that. I don’t know that we even need to add guilders or anything else at the moment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing the possibility of engaging in currency swaps and outlines various considerations and suggestions. They state that they do not have a strong feeling on the matter and that whether or not the proposal is approved would not be catastrophic. The speaker also acknowledges that some of the points raised by another person (Phil) are worth considering. Overall, there is a discussion and exploration of different ideas, but no outright contention or disagreement.


Passage number 354.
 MR. AXILROD. M r .  Chairman, our suggestion was that at the moment we would be contemplating three currencies. But we would assume that the possibility of the Desk holding minor amounts of other currencies would not be excluded.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The person speaking is making a suggestion and assuming that holding minor amounts of other currencies would not be excluded.


Passage number 355.
 CHAIRMAN MILLER. But it wouldn’t be the world’s mix of currencies, I take it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their understanding or assumption about the world's mix of currencies.


Passage number 356.
 MR. TRUMAN. Mr. Chairman, it would be the currencies that the Desk is now authorized to hold, i.e. the currencies of our swap partners. CHAIRMFLN MILLER. They are all listed here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Truman and Chairman Miller are in agreement about the currencies that the Desk is authorized to hold.

 CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes. That's the list. We could do anything else we want. I think the point of limiting it to a billion dollars in any one currency is a wise one.

Passage number 365.
 MR. WALLICH. We would probably, predominantly. That is the big intervention currency. I see your point of limiting risk but I think it would be better to limit risk by limiting the overall amount and then leave it to the Manager [to decide] what is useful in these relatively small amounts. I'd prefer that rather than have the Desk get to the limit of marks and say now we can make the market orderly by working in yen even though it's really the D-mark market that isn't orderly.

 CHAIRMAN MILLER. John Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I'm not able to provide an answer without any passage or context provided. Could you please provide the passage you would like me to analyze?


Passage number 370.
 MR. BALLES. On balance, without going through all the arguments, I have to join Chuck in opposing this. disadvantages outweigh the advantages. I'm really concerned about the point of departure being one which could fairly easily get us away from countering disorderly conditions and into imposing an official view of what the dollar '"ought to be worth." That's a pretty risky game and I don't think we're ready for it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no specific contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Balles agrees with Chuck's opposition to something (which is not stated), and expresses concern about the risks involved.

Passage number 374.
 MR. MAYO. I agree with John that I don’t want to see this used as a super intervention tool or--well, he didn’t say this--as a way to throw our weight around or something like that. But I think it can be quite supportive of additional flexibility in monetary policy in a broad sense. Like Phil, I think we have to be very careful in how we do it, not only with the Hill and the Treasury but also in our relations with other central banks. But that‘s why we have such a capable Manager and that’s part of his job. So I would vote for this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.

Passage number 378.
 MR. PARTEE. I just want to make one additional comment on another aspect that perhaps Committee members haven’t thought of. I have agreed to talk to the farmers who circled the building a few weeks ago and who want to borrow from the Federal Reserve at a low rate. I will tell them that we can’t use Federal Reserve credit for that purpose because it’s used to run the monetary system and all we do is invest in government securities and try to provide the right amount of reserves. A few years ago we took the same position with New York City when they wanted to borrow--that it wasn‘t a proper use of Federal Reserve credit. But we are talking about using up to $2 billion of Federal Reserve credit to support the mark or the yen, or the Swiss franc at a low rate of return.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents a statement by Mr. Holmes expressing his opinion about maintaining an appropriate rate for the dollar.

Passage number 387.

If there is a sentiment in favor holding up to $2 billion, let's come back at another meeting with the details worked out and some specific proposals. We don't need to work on that proposal if there is no sentiment for it. So tentatively, Paul, how would you vote.
