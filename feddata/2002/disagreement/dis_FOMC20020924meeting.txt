INSTANCE OF DISAGREEMENT: 0

With output coming along more or less in line and with employment growth being minimal, that gives us a productivity surprise.
By the same token there has been a rather substantial decline in the last six months in the ten-year bond rate, for example;
the ten-year indexed bond rate is down about 100 basis points.
That is, rates other than shorter-term rates have come down a lot, too.
So, we have a productivity surprise, which presumably one firm after another is looking at, and yet one way to read the decline in the expected real rate of return is that the long-run growth prospects for the economy and productivity growth have been marked down.
<START>I don’t know how to reconcile a decline in the real rate of interest with a step-up in productivity growth.<END>
I think that’s a puzzle.
I do believe that we need to be open to a rate cut in the future.
As you were talking about the possibility of an intermeeting move, it occurred to me that if we get what I’ll call an Iraq-related event, some geopolitical shock, the stock market probably is going to react to that news before we do.
And one of the issues we’re going to have to face is whether our action would be viewed as bailing out the stock market.
I think we have to be very careful about that because I just don’t like being in the business of responding to the stock market.
Thank you.
September 24, 200291 of 115CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Ferguson.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I endorse both parts of your recommendation, including the implicit part about dealing with geopolitical risks in the statement.
Let me take a minute to talk about two or three other issues.
<START>One issue that a few people raised was a concern about unbalanced growth.<END>
In that regard, Vincent picked up on a point that he and I discussed yesterday, which is that, by definition, interest-sensitive sectors move more than other sectors in response to changes in interest rates.
One of the Committee’s mistakes back in the 1970s, I think, was being too concerned about tanking the housing market and, therefore, the FOMC was slow to lean against inflation.
<START>Being concerned about stimulating the housing market should not slow us down here because housing is an interest-sensitive sector.<END>
To put the philosophical question on the table:
<START>If the choice is between unbalanced growth that gets the economy back to trend or a perfectly balanced economy that’s growing infinitely below trend for a long period of time, I know what my loss function looks like.<END>
So I would leave that one off our list of concerns.
<START>I’d also like to cover two other points that you made.<END>
One is the date of our next meeting, November 6.
I would argue that, if the data are clear, they are clear, and we will do what we should do.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, we’ll do it anyway.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Clearly, you didn’t disagree with that.
The other point is that it will be interesting to see if in fact for the first time, at least in my short period on the Committee
— though I know you’ve been looking at the economy on a daily basis for fifty years
—the next two data releases clarify the situation.
[Laughter] If they do, I will be quite shocked.
I suspect that the next time we get together we’ll have a little on one side and a little on the other.
September 24, 200292 of 115CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I hope you’re right.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Those are my comments, but I do support your recommendation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Thank you.
Governor Gramlich.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
<START>I can be very patient with those who have more patience than I have, [laughter] but I’m afraid I’ve seen enough evidence of weakness already.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Is that the end of the sentence?
President Hoenig.
MR.
HOENIG.
I support both parts of your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
<START>As I said earlier, it would be nice to see how this economy would be performing if we could lift this heavy-handed uncertainty, but at the moment that is not an option.<END>
I think that does put us in the position of having to watch the situation carefully.
And if the economy doesn’t improve or if we have a disruptive event, then we have to be prepared to move, whether in the intermeeting period or at the next meeting.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Kohn.
MR.
KOHN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I also support both aspects of your recommendation.
<START>With inflation about as low as I believe it should go and with the possibility of persistent output gaps and further declines in inflation, I would argue that the principal threat to good economic performance is subpar growth.<END>
And I certainly think our statement ought to continue to make that point.
<START>I’m not yet ready to lower rates to address my concerns without more evidence.<END>
I do give some weight to the stronger data on private spending that we’ve gotten over the intermeeting period.
<START>Especially in light of the difficulty of forecasting and the uncertainties, I’m willing to wait for added information though, like Governor Ferguson, I wonder whether it really will clarify everything or raise new uncertainties.<END>
September 24, 200293 of 115If the incoming data over the intermeeting period confirm the weaker picture portrayed in the anecdotes that we’ve heard around the table, then I think the Committee does need to give serious consideration to easing the stance of policy further.
As to whether that should be at a meeting or between meetings, I think the Committee has been well served by trying to keep actions at meetings.
I don’t think November 6 is a problem.
It’s the day after the election.
It would be a problem if it looked as if we had put off taking an action until after the election.
So I think it would be appropriate to move intermeeting, if the data suggest that that’s the right thing to do, or at the meeting if we can wait.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Jordan.
MR.
JORDAN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I concur with your recommendation because I think that the near term is dominated by uncertainties of a global nature.
For the longer term, though, all deflations or disinflationary impulses are not equal.
And deflationary pressure in the goods sector coming from extraordinary productivity gains in that sector does not call for a policy response.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Santomero.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
I support your recommendation.
In my view the key issues are the uncertainty and the inability to get traction in the recovery.
I think we will get some clarification on where the economy is, going forward.
So I think the best thing to do is to wait and see.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I support both parts of your recommendation.
I just want to make two comments.
One relates to the point you mentioned about the credibility of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee, which I think is extremely important.
I support fully your suggestion that we describe any easing move September 24, 200294 of 115as a form of insurance, because the situation could change quickly.
If we lower rates, we may find that we will have to move in the other direction very quickly as well.
We have to be prepared to do that.
So describing it as insurance or putting it in that context I think helps the credibility of this Committee.
The second point is on whether we should move before the next meeting if appropriate or at the meeting because of the election.
I think we must let the data decide.
If it’s appropriate to move, we should move.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I don’t wish to imply anything other than that.
I was being facetious when I was talking about that.
MR.
MOSKOW.
I didn’t think you did imply anything other than that, but I just
— CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Fortunately, I think we have built up a degree of credibility such that the notion that we would move for political reasons hasn’t really arisen
— other than among an inevitable number of commentators
—in a very, very long time.
And I believe that’s really to the credit of this organization.
I think our record has been really quite impressive in that respect.
MR.
MOSKOW.
Absolutely.
And we all want to keep it that way.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
You bet.
President Broaddus.
MR.
BROADDUS.
Mr. Chairman, I strongly support your recommendation.
I want to make clear that what I was talking about earlier was contingency planning
—thinking about what we would do if we hit the zero bound
—and that’s a different issue.
But with respect to the immediate situation, looking at the whole probability distribution around the forecast and not just one tail of it, I think staying with our current stance is best for now.
I would make one other comment.
<START>Ned Gramlich made the point that when you’re in the vicinity of the zero bound and you see weakness, it’s important to move in order to avoid getting September 24, 200295 of 115there, and I certainly agree with that.<END>
But what I’ve taken away from what I’ve heard in conferences and read about this topic is that in such a situation the central bank has to move very aggressively and decisively to establish credibility for our ability to undercut the deflationary impulse.
I don’t think a small move of, say, ¼ point would do that.
That, in my view, smack a bit of fine-tuning.
would So to me it’s not so much a matter of timing as of amount.
As we go forward, if we see evidence that the economy really is beginning to weaken, given our proximity to the zero bound we might want to consider a move of more than ¼ point.
I think that’s an issue that we ought to have on the table at that time.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Guynn.
MR.
GUYNN.
Mr. Chairman, I don’t think our individual views of where we are or even what is around the corner in the next few quarters are all that different this morning.
In fact, I’m probably on the less optimistic end of that range of outcomes.
As my earlier comments suggest, I’m probably still in the minority today in terms of my thinking about our policy options.
<START>I understand and certainly respect the views of others, but I have a different view of the risks and rewards of further easing at this point.<END>
Based on my understanding of where the economy is, I don’t think we’re dealing with the need for an interest rate cut at this point.
I don’t think it’s going to speed the adjustments that we’re still hoping to see made.
We’d love to see some more investment spending, but not a single businessperson I’ve talked to has suggested that a slightly lower interest rate is going to spur investment spending.
In fact, I’m struck by the telecommunications industry, which I think is a poster child for the excesses we’re trying to get worked out.
The CEO of the large Baby Bell that runs the phone company in the Southeast pointed out that they cannot possibly grow their way out of the mess they have in that industry.
The only thing that is going to bring any kind of equilibrium to the September 24, 200296 of 115industry is further contraction in the number of firms that are involved.
I think the CEO would worry that any additional easing at this point might prolong the time that it will take to get some of the marginal players out of the business.
It might even lead to additional irrational pricing in the short term, which would only exacerbate the problem of getting back to profitability and stability.
So, using that as an example, I just don’t think that a rate cut is likely to have the kind of effects we intend.
I’m not even sure that, if we could induce additional car and house purchases, it’s something we really want to do.
<START>And I’m not as convinced as others seem to be that creating an environment where people extract still more equity from their houses is all good.<END>
In summary, I have to say that, while I certainly understand and support the notion of retaining the balance of risks sentence as it is in the draft statement
—and I think the way you suggested is the best way to do it
—I believe there is still a case for some patience.
<START>I think we should trust in the resilience of the economy and its fundamental ability to work through this situation, assuming that one of those terrible geopolitical risks that you talked about doesn’t materialize.<END>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I concur.
I can be patient as well.
I must say, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, that I’ve had concerns similar to those that President Guynn just mentioned about the downside risks of moving interest rates ever lower.
But I am concerned as well about the persistent economic gaps we have, gaps from what I would consider to be a more optimal rate of economic growth, pace of employment growth, and inflationary change.
I don’t view the outcomes we’re seeing in the Greenbook baseline and the alternative simulations as optimal.
And those, I think, are sort of the best case outcomes we can hope for.
So I am concerned about that.
September 24, 200297 of 115I have to agree with Governor Ferguson about this issue of data clarification.
I’d be surprised if there were a smoking gun in any of the data over the next two or three weeks that’s going to tell us unequivocally that we should either maintain our current stance or move rates lower.
And, frankly, I have a deep preference for moving at a meeting as opposed to outside of a meeting.
But that’s something we’ll have to talk just about when the time comes.
I think that’s all I have to say.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Olson.
MR.
OLSON.
I support both parts of your recommendation.
In the brief period of time that I’ve been here, it seems that every word that is changed in the press statement that accompanies our policy announcement generates ten additional questions.
But even having said that, I think it’s very important to acknowledge the geopolitical risks today.
I think that’s particularly critical.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Parry.
MR.
PARRY.
Mr. Chairman, I support both parts of your recommendation.
<START>I’m not yet ready to lower rates, and I hope that the data we receive over the coming period will clarify the issues we have discussed, although I doubt that they will clarify the situation greatly.<END>
My hope also is that a decision can wait until the next meeting.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Bies.
MS.
BIES.
Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation.
But I guess I’m more anxious than President Parry because I am getting very concerned about the lack of momentum and robustness in the recovery despite the geopolitical situation.
I do think we need to pay close attention to what is happening as the data are released in the next few weeks.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President McTeer.
September 24, 200298 of 115MR. MCTEER.
Mr. Chairman, I thought you gave an eloquent case for easing today, and I really thought that’s what you were recommending right up until the end of your remarks.
I agree with Governor Gramlich that the time has come to go ahead and ease.
<START>I also tend to agree with Governor Ferguson in that I doubt that we’re going to learn anything very definitive by waiting a little while.<END>
And I agree with President Broaddus that when we do ease we need to do so by at least 50 basis points.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Stern.
MR.
STERN.
I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman, and I would remain open minded about whether we will need to react in the intermeeting period or not.
But I would caution against responding to what are inherently noisy data
—we’ve had a lot of experience with that
—and also against holding ourselves to a standard of previous Greenbook forecasts.
I say that because, as Bill Poole mentioned, for the most part the results this year have come out pretty much as expected if one were to put any realistic confidence interval around those forecasts.
They certainly have been largely consistent with what I expected for the year as whole when I submitted my forecasts in January and July.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Bernanke.
MR.
BERNANKE.
Mr. Chairman, I can support waiting for more information.
I’m a little uncertain and confused about the role of geopolitical concerns in the statement.
We don’t want to tie ourselves to saying that we would act only if certain geopolitical events occur.
In particular, if the sluggishness continues but the issue of Iraq is unresolved, would that preclude action?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I’m merely stipulating my view that, if the corporate governance issue and the geopolitical risks were somehow removed, several things would September 24, 200299 of 115happen.
The extraordinary pulling back by the corporate community started with the corporate governance issue, whose effect has been very evident and acknowledged by business contacts.
But even that did not fully undermine what was a relatively continuous recovery.
If business firms change their accounting practices, we get a different view of the world.
<START>If on top of that we get considerable uncertainty in the geopolitical area, we are not going to find any economic model that can conceivably capture such a development.<END>
In my view, however, it’s not something we have to know in advance.
We’ll know it when we see it.
I’m just saying that we ought to be prepared to move before the next meeting in the event that we get significantly negative numbers.
<START>I’m not suggesting that the numbers due to come out in the next week or so are necessarily going to be definitive, but I do know that, if this economy is tilting over into a decline, that will be obvious to us in the next three weeks and it will show up in a number of different areas.<END>
If it doesn’t happen that way, that will mean that the expansion is continuing, and indeed I think the possibility of a lot of momentum when the malaise is lifted is being underestimated.
I do not believe that we can effectively make a judgment that economic activity is going to be X percent below potential by the middle or the end of 2003.
I don’t believe any of our models can even remotely answer that question in a useful way.
To be sure, they will generate numbers because that’s what models are told to do.
But my experience is that such forecasts incorporate the weakest capabilities that economists possess.
Once the economy starts to move, it absorbs excess capacity very quickly;
and when it starts down, the reverse is also true.
The very unusual case is the presumption of an economy that will do nothing, which is essentially what the Greenbook is saying.
So I don’t think we can look ahead to a simple decision.
It is going to be a tough one.
September 24, 2002100 of 115MR. BERNANKE.
Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your analysis.
I’m just wondering how you’re going to get all of that in the statement!
[Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I wrote it in disappearing ink!
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
May I make a comment?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
I think there’s a little confusion about what we mean when we’re talking about the importance of geopolitical events.
It’s not as if we mean that a geopolitical event is, say, that we start bombing Iraq three or four weeks from now.
Maybe we will, and maybe we won’t.
Rather, the point is what the geopolitical environment does to the level of uncertainty and the effects of that on the real economy.
That’s a lot easier to convey in a couple of words in the statement.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
If somebody could tell me that we were going to invade Iraq tomorrow, the uncertainty would disappear.
Look, our experience with the Gulf War is that the maximum negative effects of the Gulf War occurred immediately subsequent to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
It dissolved after the first two or three months, but it was pretty fierce in the early stages.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
Are we ready to vote?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
We’re ready to vote.
Would you read the appropriate statement, Mr. Secretary?
MR.
BERNARD.
I’ll be reading from page 13 of the Bluebook:
“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
<START>To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the September 24, 2002101 of 115immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1¾ percent.” For the balance of risk sentence in the press release:<END>
<START>“Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks continue to be weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate economic weakness in the foreseeable future.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.<END>
Call the roll please.
MR.
BERNARD.
Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman McDonough YesGovernor Bernanke YesGovernor Bies YesGovernor Ferguson YesGovernor Gramlich NoPresident Jordan YesGovernor Kohn YesPresident McTeer NoGovernor Olson YesPresident Santomero YesPresident Stern YesCHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Okay.
Would you distribute the proposed language of the press statement?
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
All this silence suggests agreement.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
People haven’t read it yet!
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
They read fast.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
What we have tried to do in the statement, basically, is to capture the tone of this meeting and to relate it to the previous statement.
As you can see, it’s restructured from the August statement, but the only thing that’s new in it is the reference to geopolitical risks.
Is this okay with everybody as it stands?
Let me remind those of you who September 24, 2002102 of 115dissented that we have a new policy now regarding the disclosure of dissenting votes.
We are going to state not only who dissented but also what the reasons were for any dissent.
MR.
KOHN.
Not the reasons but what the dissenter would have preferred to do.
MR.
REINHART.
The direction of the policy they would prefer.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, of course, that’s right.
It’s the direction they would have preferred.
But I think we all agreed that discussion of those dissents by the dissenters would be inappropriate.
The reasons for any dissent would be written subsequently in the minutes of the meeting, which will come out, as you know, immediately after the next meeting.
So it would be appreciated if no one gets involved in any discussion of this because I assure you that you will be getting a horrendous number of telephone calls.
I would suggest to you that the best thing to do is not to answer them because if you get into any discussion at all you will find that these callers are very experienced journalists and they will get you to say things you had not meant to say.
I say that from bitter experience.
I decided the only safety valve I had was to marry one!
[Laughter] MS. MINEHAN.
Mr. Chairman, may I just say one word about this phrase “owing in part to the emergence of heightened geopolitical risks”?
Is this committing us to take a policy action based on something that is happening outside of the United States?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
No. MS.
MINEHAN.
If something is done in Iraq?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
No. MS.
MINEHAN.
I just worry that that is how it’s going to be interpreted.
My own sense is that there are a lot broader reasons, even beyond geopolitical risks
—and you covered some of them before
—for the considerable uncertainty that exists.
I think highlighting it this way almost September 24, 2002103 of 115puts a spin on it that says, in effect, if something happens out there we definitely will do something and if nothing happens out there we won’t.
And I don’t think that was the sense of the Committee.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Is it interpreted that way?
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
I certainly don’t interpret it that way.
MR.
PARRY.
No. As a matter of fact, I think it’s a subset of the broader statement in the first half of the sentence.
I don’t think of it that way at all.
MS.
MINEHAN.
All right.
I knew I’d be in the minority, but I’m worried about it.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
That’s all right.
<START>If in fact you are correct, then the statement is wrong.<END>
But it says “considerable uncertainty persists . . .
<START>owing in part to the emergence . . ..” It’s the uncertainty that is the critical issue, not the geopolitical risks.<END>
MS.
MINEHAN.
<START>I know you can read the sentence that way, but I guess I’d feel better if the “in part” clause had something beyond geopolitical risks or if that were just left out and the sentence stopped with the word “employment.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.<END>
I think conditions have changed enough that not to acknowledge the geopolitical events in one form or another strikes me as misrepresenting the situation.
Let me just ask a more general question.
When I accepted three speeches tomorrow in London, only one of them had a question and answer period afterwards and I had intended to answer only questions regarding corporate governance and other nonmonetary policy issues.
<START>Having heard the discussion here, it might not be a bad idea if I spent a little time on the oil price issue and its implications and a few other matters related to the outlook without specifying one way or the other how we should act.<END>
I say that because, in the event we decide to move, it September 24, 2002104 of 115wouldn’t be half bad if some of those points have been made and then a move won’t come as a particular shock.
What’s the recommendation of Committee members?
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
My view is that it’s not just not half bad, it’s essential that you do that.
I think we need to prepare the market for the possibility, not the certainty, that we may make a move.
MR.
MOSKOW.
I don’t think you should ever be restricted from talking about monetary policy after a meeting for some artificial time period that we’ve predetermined.
I think your commenting as you suggest would be good.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Does anybody else have anything to add?
Bill.
MR.
POOLE.
<START>I would just comment that there is always a risk that something you say will lead people to read between the lines and will raise more questions than you’re able to dispose of.<END>
That’s obviously a risk.
I would also say that the two dissents will prepare the market for the possibility of future action, probably in a way that’s quite clear and does not raise any other potential problems.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I agree with that.
MR.
HOENIG.
Mr. Chairman, I think you should be prepared and willing to take questions.
I think it serves a useful purpose of providing information.
Obviously someone could take what you say the wrong way, but that’s going to happen regardless.
<START>I think you’ll do more good than harm.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Does anybody else have any recommendations?
MR.
MCTEER.
I agree with Tom Hoenig.
MR.
STERN.
I agree with him, too;
more communication is better than less.
September 24, 2002105 of 115MR. OLSON.
My sense is that the less said in this press statement the fewer questions we’ll have, but you can clarify any questions in a dialogue type of environment in a way that we can’t do in a statement.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Okay, I’ll try my best.
I can’t guarantee that what I say will always come out the way I want it to.
But I’ve been around long enough that I can put more words into fewer ideas than anyone else I know!
[Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
We all agree that you have a unique talent in that regard.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Thanks a lot!
MR.
MOSKOW.
But, Mr. Chairman, you’ll be speaking in a foreign language there!
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Is there anything else on the agenda that we need to discuss?
SPEAKER (?).
Lunch!
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The next meeting is Wednesday, November 6, the day after Election Day.
If it were the day before, we’d have a problem.
