INSTANCE OF DISAGREEMENT: 0

Yes.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Small, large, and very large.
[Laughter] Did you want to say something, Ned?
MR.
GRAMLICH.
I wanted to echo what Dave said.
To reflect the properties in this model, the long-term unemployment rate has to be the NAIRU, which is 5.2 or 5.3 percent.
And if we should be lucky enough that the NAIRU is below that, we could redo this exercise.
<START>We’d get the same basic pattern, but we wouldn’t end up at the same precise rate of unemployment.<END>
However, we do have to end up at the NAIRU, even though there is statistical uncertainty about what that is.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Any further questions for Vince?
If not, let me get started.
This has been an unusually interesting meeting in the sense that we are integrating our policy discussion with the outlook for an economy that is undergoing significant structural change that will in turn determine where our policy should be in the future.
Our problem is to figure out where that will be.
In this regard, the extent to which the markets respond to what they think we think is a problem is in my view going to be an increasingly difficult issue for us to deal with as our presumed credibility continues to rise.
As a number of you have mentioned, we are at a turning point, however we wish to define it.
<START>A characteristic of turning points is that, as the economy goes from negative growth to March 19, 2002Page 86 of 117zero growth to positive growth, it is very difficult to estimate the slope of the upturn, and differing slopes imply huge differences in the performance of the economy.<END>
We are observing this interesting phenomenon where all the macro data that economists look at have turned decidedly positive.
But people in the business community, as a number of you have pointed out, think in terms of the GDP data.
don’t They look at their profit figures.
GDP is a very interesting construct.
It is the market value of consolidated output, and consumer markets and final sales markets more generally dominate that aggregate.
The average businessman is looking at his sales and his costs.
Typically, labor costs do not constitute a very large part of those costs because most of them stem from purchased materials, which reflect somebody else’s labor costs.
So the consolidated system that we look at is not the model that the average businessperson looks at.
As a result we have to reconcile, as some of you have pointed out, what is essentially a really quite negative outlook on the part of the business community and what we are seeing in the consolidated system.
I was at a Business Roundtable discussion not all that long ago and presented a GDP outlook that was not greatly different from what we’ve been discussing today.
The numbers were smaller, but the upturn was there.
My audience looked at me as though I were an alien from some peculiar planet.
The difficulty obviously is that we’re not going to get the economic performance that is implicit in our macro forecasts if indeed the view in the business community is that profits are not going to improve, that prospective rates of return on new facilities are not going to be adequate, and that pricing power is completely gone.
The reason, as we’re all acutely aware, is that consumer spending is going to be only modestly helpful at best, and the major impetus for sustaining the expansion after the inventory investment upswing peters out will have to come from business capital investment.
<START>So, translating all of this, the real danger March 19, 2002Page 87 of 117here is that we could end up with an inventory investment surge, and indeed that’s pretty much what we may be getting at this stage, and find that the surge and the overall expansion have suddenly run out of steam.<END>
We have seen this pattern before.
<START>I remember being both fascinated and disturbed in the early months of 1976 when the economy came out of the 1975 recession like a bull charging out of a stockade into the ring, and then all of a sudden the economy hit a wall.<END>
The swing had been very dramatic, but there was no impetus left, and the economy slowed down.
Indeed, as you may recall, it slowed down enough that the Carter Administration came in postulating the persistence of a recession and proposed a fiscal stimulus package because that’s what they had promised during the election campaign.
But circumstances changed, and they got laughed out of the box, if I may put it that way.
This is the type of situation that I think we are dealing with, and it’s going to be very difficult to pinpoint what is actually going on.
In one sense we have seen a dramatic acceleration in the economic adjustment process as information technology has increasingly affected the performance of the economy.
We ended up with a pattern of 50 basis point reductions in the federal funds rate when similar circumstances in the past would have called for 25 basis points.
Something happened very quickly to which we responded very sensibly in my judgment.
It’s a fascinating issue as to whether the upside ahead of us will involve the same pattern.
At the moment we don’t see it, but I must say that we didn’t see it on the downside either.
The logic of a quick economic adjustment process on the downside presumably will apply to the upside.
The argument against that is that, even though the economy has evidently gone through a period of marked increases in flexibility and resiliency, we may be facing an outlook for inflation that is much more difficult to assess.
We currently are seeing price discounting, which is going to go away because it’s essentially not cost March 19, 2002Page 88 of 117based.
<START>It is basically the consequence of downward pressure on profit margins and, given the outlook for underlying costs, that eventually is going to reverse, and we are going to get some price inflation largely because margins have to open up.<END>
And as they open up they will eventually run into the same problem they encountered previously, namely that labor costs will begin to rise.
But the initial impact in an environment in which there is great flexibility and great resiliency is that we will not get very strong inflationary pressures.
<START>As we went through the previous downside period involving a dramatic adjustment process occurring very quickly in the economy, we reacted very promptly.<END>
I don’t think we were fully aware of the possibility that we could be looking at deflation in the eye.
I think Bob Parry’s immediate reaction to the blue lines in Vince’s charts on alternative scenarios was a response to that risk.
And when I looked at those charts I had the same reaction.
Do I really want PCE inflation to go down to 0.7 percent or something like that?
I would, of course, if I were sure that’s as far down as inflation would go and that it would stay there.
But with inflation at that level we would be exposed to a significant probability of deflation, and we would not have a sense that policy was in equilibrium.
In other words, we are looking for price stability, and I think quite correctly.
And having gone through this whole period, one could argue in retrospect that we may have moved too fast on the downside.
<START>But we were facing significant risks in that period, and I think our policy moves turned out just fine.<END>
My impression at this point is that we are of necessity looking at something different.
This is a different type of economy.
This is a different type of business cycle.
We now seem to be at a reasonably good point.
We have come to that point in part by good policy judgment and in part by just plain luck, but I think it is one from which we can work.
My impression without getting into much detail is that short-term rates in general clearly are lower than we may want March 19, 2002Page 89 of 117them to be.
If the economy begins to rebound rather quickly, I think we’re going to want or like to see long-term rates move up.
Indeed if the mortgage rate goes up, we will get some restraining effects on personal consumption expenditures because a goodly part of PCE has been financed by equity extraction from the appreciation in housing values.
Moreover, if the price of oil continues to rise, I think that is also going to constrain consumer spending to some extent.
So as far as I can see, the balance of risks is no longer tilted toward weakness;
the risks clearly are about equal in both directions.
And I do think we may have a short period when doing nothing is the best policy alternative.
I would certainly suggest that we do nothing on the fed funds rate today.
But I’m by no means certain about whether we will feel the need to move it up in May.
Clearly one could argue that the pattern of adjustment in the economy has accelerated.
In this regard, I think the risks of moving in 50 basis point steps are likely to be much too high.
So we probably will have to move sooner and in smaller increments, given our incomplete knowledge about the changing overall structure of the economic system with which we are dealing.
My thought is that at least one way to get a leg up on the possibility that we may want to move in May, without moving the balance of risks to heightened inflationary pressures at this meeting, is to indicate in our press statement today that we view monetary policy as accommodative, without any further elaboration.
That, I think, would enable us to move in May, if we choose, without generating any serious reactions in the markets.
And if we decide not to move in May, that would be accepted as well.
By the time of the May meeting, I think we will have learned a good deal about what is happening to inventory investment and its impact on the economy and, of course, about trends in profits and capital investment.
I’m not saying that we’ll know the final answers, but we’ll surely know a lot more about the direction.
So my judgment is March 19, 2002Page 90 of 117that the call is a relatively easy one for this meeting, at least as I see it at this stage.
But I also believe that our decisions are going to become progressively more complex.
The one thing we’re certain about is that the world doesn’t move as smoothly as Vince has portrayed in his charts and it’s not going to look that way later.
Perhaps he should have taken the numbers off these charts!
Accordingly, I will put on the table the proposal that we keep the funds rate target unchanged at 1¾ percent and that we move the balance of risks statement to balance.
Vice Chair.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I concur with your recommendation.
<START>And I would point out that if the next move has to be up, which I think it will be, we can certainly move from a balanced balance of risks statement.<END>
There is no reason at all in my view to inhibit us from doing that.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Jordan.
MR.
JORDAN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
First, as for the 1994-95 episode, I really don’t think that holds any lessons that would help us this time because what preceded our first action then was quite different from today.
In that earlier period we had had, as I recall, some sixteen months of no change in the funds rate.
And part of the lesson then was that any change at all was huge news.
This time it has been very recently that we were taking overt actions.
Also, the last actions after September 11 are very well understood in the market as actions taken that we probably wouldn’t have taken in the absence of the events of that day.
So to some extent we can distinguish between the reversal of the post-September 11 reductions in the funds rate and whatever tightening we might do after that.
With proper statements from us to the public, I think that first part is easier to explain and to do.
Beyond that, though, I think the pace at which we move rates up may be asymmetric from the pace on the downside.
We cut rates rapidly because March 19, 2002Page 91 of 117the risk premium rose rapidly in terms of investment decisionmaking.
<START>And if the risk premium is only gradually revised downward as businesspeople gain confidence, it may be appropriate to be gradual in a tightening phase even after a very accelerated, aggressive easing phase.<END>
Having said all of that, if we hadn’t been at all constrained at this meeting by the bias toward weakness in our statement at the January meeting, I probably would be more enthusiastic about an increase right now.
But I do feel that constraint is real.
So I think we have to have no action this time, but at least set the stage for possible actions in the future.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Ferguson.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I endorse both parts of your recommendation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Parry.
MR.
PARRY.
I also endorse both parts of your recommendation.
And I think that you’ve articulated well the kinds of challenges we’re likely to face at the next meeting.
Thank you.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Poole.
MR.
POOLE.
Mr. Chairman, I support the recommendation.
I had at the top of my page of notes that this is probably the easiest decision we’re going to face for quite some time, which you pointed out as well.
I also want to reflect just a bit on what we have ahead of us.
The market is going to be asking the question
—probably after this meeting in fact
—how far and how fast rates will go up.
We obviously don’t know the answer to that.
But in trying to produce a lasting recovery, it’s going to be important not to have a “disconnect” between what the market comes to expect and what we think we are intending.
I am attracted to the idea that Jerry Jordan mentioned about trying to condition the market to the concept that we have some undoing of the insurance policy that we took out after September ll
—that that level of rates is sort of a baseline March 19, 2002Page 92 of 117to go back to.
I do think that we run the risk of getting behind if we move only in 25 basis point steps.
<START>Just counting that out, it’s clear that it could take quite a few meetings before we got back even to undoing the easing since September 11.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Oh, we could move intermeeting if necessary.
MR.
POOLE.
Well, we could.
I’m not in favor of moving between meetings unless there is some significant reason in the incoming data to do that.
At any rate, an intermeeting move would give us steps of 50 basis points, and whether they come individually in 25 basis point increments I think is much less important.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Guynn.
MR.
GUYNN.
Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
I support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Broaddus.
MR.
BROADDUS.
Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation.
I’d like to make just a quick comment, following up on what Bill Poole said about how we would be looking at this process of tightening in the next few weeks and months.
In my view it’s important that our behavior as we move in this direction is symmetric with our behavior on the downside.
We eased policy very aggressively last year.
I supported that, and I believe it was appropriate.
In fact, one can argue that those actions may have contained and restrained the recession.
We were able to do that because we had credibility;
our credibility was well established.
I think we now need to move as aggressively on the upside as necessary to maintain that credibility so that we will be well positioned in the future.
March 19, 2002Page 93 of 117Actually I think one could make a case for tightening policy today, but I agree with your recommendation.
I would say that I like very much your suggestion that we use the term “accommodative” in our statement because I believe many in the market will see that as something very close to a switch in the tilt by two notches to a tilt toward tightness, which would position us if necessary to move the rate even before the May meeting.
It’s a long intermeeting interval, and a lot could emerge in that period, and I think we ought to consider that possibility if we need to.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
Mr. Chairman, I agree with both parts of your recommendation.
I don’t think there’s any urgency to move today.
<START>I do think we can go from a balanced risk statement today to an increase in the funds rate in May without any problem at all.<END>
And I, too, like the idea of putting in the statement something about monetary policy being accommodative now.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes.
Let me clarify a point with respect to what I said to Bill Poole.
Bill, my view of 25 or 50 basis points is that I would think we’d start with moves of 25.
We may have to pick up the pace.
Indeed, that’s a judgment we can make.
It’s just that I would not start with a 50 basis point increase.
I think that would be disruptive.
MR.
POOLE.
I’m certainly inclined to go that way, too.
But I can imagine data coming in that would suggest that things are moving a whole lot faster than we anticipated and that a move of 50 basis points would be appropriate.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The burden of proof would have to be on a very extraordinary change that we really didn’t anticipate.
At least that’s the way I would look at it.
President Stern.
March 19, 2002Page 94 of 117MR. STERN.
I, too, support your recommendation, Mr. Chairman.
Let me just make one additional comment.
<START>We’ve been looking recently at what I suppose I would generously call some low inflation policy rules.<END>
<START>While recognizing that beauty is frequently in the eyes of the beholder, the implication of these rules, at least at the moment, is that there is no need to move today.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Bies.
MS.
BIES.
I support your recommendations, and I particularly like the comment about policy being accommodative.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Hoenig.
MR.
HOENIG.
Mr. Chairman, I certainly see a need to proceed as you’ve outlined today, and I would support that.
I would add, though, that I think we could continue to see some fairly strong data and perhaps some data surprises on the upside, given what we’ve experienced recently.
So I believe that having the accommodative language in the statement is very important.
And in my view the possibility of an intermeeting move of 25 basis points should be a possibility that is out there.
If the market understanding is that we’re not planning to do 50 basis points but that we may be moving sooner than at the May meeting, I think that could be very healthy for us.
I hope the press statement doesn’t foreclose that possibility.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes.
You know, we’ve been very fortunate.
We have been able to move, with very few exceptions in the last couple of years, only at meetings.
That is not our history.
We have been required to move intermeeting many times.
So it’s only if policy is extraordinarily well constructed that we move only at these arbitrarily scheduled times.
<START>We hope that will to continue to be the case, but we can’t assume that, and I suspect you may well be right.<END>
Governor Gramlich.
March 19, 2002Page 95 of 117MR. GRAMLICH.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I support your recommendation.
I’m typically easily persuadable by simulations, but I think I like the scenario that you laid out
— where we get started relatively early with smallish steps, feeling our way
—better than the black and blue choice [laughter] that Vincent gave us.
The latter might be black and blue in some different ways.
I would recall a point that Jerry Jordan made earlier, and that is that if we raise nominal rates slowly, if the real rate is rising, we’re still being pretty accommodative.
So that might be another argument for getting started on a rate increase relatively soon.
But the one point I would note about the simulations is that they lowered the cost of delay below what I would have thought, coming into the meeting.
And that’s an interesting point.
<START>I’m not sure I’m ready to believe it, but it’s worth thinking about.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President McTeer.
MR.
MCTEER.
In view of the clock, I will agree with your recommendation without further editorial comments.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Olson.
MR.
OLSON.
I support both parts of the recommendation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Santomero.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
I support your recommendations, Mr. Chairman.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
That’s it.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I think that does it.
Would you, Mr. Secretary, read an appropriate directive?
MR.
BERNARD.
The Bluebook page I’ll be reading from doesn’t have a number, but if it did, it would be page 13.
[Laughter] “The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
March 19, 2002Page 96 of 117To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1¾ percent.” And for the press statement:
<START>“Against the background of its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information currently available, the Committee believes that the risks are balanced with respect to prospects for both goals in the foreseeable future.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.<END>

Let’s distribute copies of the press release draft.
Does anybody have any comments or questions?
SPEAKER(?).
Excellent!
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
It deserves a standing ovation.
Brilliant!
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
<START>If there are no comments, I’d like to turn the floor over to Governor Ferguson who will continue our discussion on disclosure policy.<END>
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you very much.
At our last meeting we had a brief and not fully conclusive discussion on the question of disclosing dissents.
The issue on the table was not only a transparency issue, but perhaps more importantly it involved legal considerations.
<START>From the standpoint of legal advice it appeared that it might be appropriate to disclose dissents earlier March 19, 2002Page 97 of 117than we have historically.<END>
Since we discussed this last time we’ve gotten further advice in a memo from Kieran Fallon and Virgil Mattingly, which was sent to you.
Also you received another memo from me regarding a discussion among a small number of us on how to respond to both the legal issues and the philosophical issues about transparency.
Since I’ve sent you a memo about that, I’ll try to be brief.
The group of us who looked at this, which included Michael Moskow, Bob Parry, Bill Poole, Ned Gramlich, and myself, reached a couple of conclusions.
First, we propose that the Committee make one set of changes in its disclosure policy.
Second, we suggest that a number of other elements of our strategy with respect to communications remain unchanged.
The change that we propose is the one that is listed as item 2.
A in the memo that I sent to you.
That is to release the tally of the vote, the identity of the voters, and the preferences of the dissenters and to release all of that information as part of the press statement.
<START>Let me note the logic for that argument.<END>
<START>To be clear, we believe that adopting any of these options has some risks and some benefits.<END>
So there is no option that is without concern.
<START>We thought that the option of putting into the press statement the tally of the vote, including the names and the preferences of any dissenters, would get us into a position where we are no longer tolerating the element of legal risk that we face currently.<END>
That risk is that we’re waiting for someone to ask a question, in which case we would have to disclose the vote and perhaps be embarrassed that we hadn’t disclosed it earlier.
<START>At the same time, we viewed this as a moderate or middle step as opposed to some of the other things we might have done, such as trying to create mini-minutes or to release the full minutes at a point that, while not contemporaneous, be closer to the meeting.<END>
would We are, if you will, feeling our way here, since we have no easy option of returning to March 19, 2002Page 98 of 117our previous practices once we take a decision.
So I think our little group thought that the so-called 2.
<START>A option that I just outlined would be the best, recognizing that there are some risks to it.<END>
Now, we also felt that a number of things should not change.
We thought that we should not change the concept of a blackout period both before the meeting, which was not on the table, but also after the meeting.
We favored maintaining the blackout for the rest of the week after the FOMC meeting, which is through Friday.
We thought it was also important that during the intermeeting period we not disclose the contents of the meetings
—as we currently do not disclose them
—and wait for the minutes to come out.
The third element of no change is that we would hold the release of the minutes until after the subsequent meeting.
That recommendation was driven by a number of concerns, some having to do with the mechanics of trying to get the minutes done.
Others related to concerns about the fact that there is a great variety of information in the minutes, some of which may continue to be relevant and some of which may not be relevant.
Another factor, obviously, was the sense that once we’ve made a decision to go ahead with something, we can’t go back.
There is one other thing that would not be changed.
Obviously during the course of each intermeeting interval, after the blackout period and before the subsequent blackout period there’s a time when we all give speeches and have discussions, etcetera.
<START>We would at that point be free to discuss the economy or to discuss an outlook but we would still be expected to try to avoid going over the line of disclosing any actual content of or conversation that occurred at one of these meetings.<END>
So that’s where this group came out, and I hope all of you have had a chance to read the memo.
At this stage I’d like to open the discussion up for any comments, first from the other members of the group
—Presidents Parry, Poole, and Moskow, and Governor Gramlich
—to March 19, 2002Page 99 of 117make sure I have summarized our agreement.
Then I would turn to others on the Committee who may have questions or may just want to state a point of view or preference.
Shall we start with Governor Gramlich?
MR.
GRAMLICH.
Well, I would make just one point.
The group was in agreement and Roger summarized the issues well.
<START>But there was a question of whether the dissents would actually be put in the press release or would merely be available to those in the press who happened to ask our Public Affairs staff for that information.<END>
I think our committee felt it was fairer to everybody, and particularly to those who do not inquire, just to put everything right in the announcement and also to modify the way we announce the discount rate votes as well.
MR.
PARRY.
I think we came out at the right place in terms of the announcement and how it would be done.
The only issue that I thought might at some point be worth more discussion is when the blackout should end.
There’s a certain logic to having it end at the close of the day on Thursday.
Having it terminate at the end of Friday means in effect that it really ends Monday morning.
It’s no big deal.
Sometimes it’s great to have an excuse not to accept a speech assignment.
But I think there is a logic to having it end on Thursday after the release of the minutes.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
Roger’s summary was excellent.
I would just add that we had a very thorough discussion of all of the options, and I think it was a consensus that this was the best route to go.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I think that’s true.
President Poole.
MR.
POOLE.
Yes, I think we were all in agreement that if we could sustain the current procedure indefinitely, that would be great.
It works fine.
But it’s not up to us to make that March 19, 2002Page 100 of 117decision.
We are faced with a legal opinion here.
<START>And our small group was in agreement that it would be very unfortunate if this issue were forced upon us by someone else putting a FOIA request to us.<END>
So to us, announcing the vote tally is almost a “no brainer.” We need to get out in front and do this in the most satisfactory way.
Staying with the current practice is just not an option.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay, let’s open the discussion now.
I have Jerry Jordan next on my list.
MR.
JORDAN.
I would have preferred 2.B as my first option because it involves the least change and brings the least attention to the fact of a dissent.
But I can live with 2.
A, and maybe the reality is that that would be forced on us eventually.
However, I’m not really concerned about the people who are not in the press room at the time we release our statement.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Cathy Minehan is next on my list.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Well, I’m going to tilt at windmills here.
I recognize that it’s tilting at windmills, but I do want to be on the record with my concerns about this.
I have been in a lot of discussions about FOIA items.
This is an unusual one.
Usually the question is about whether or not information must be released or should be released.
This is a debate about information we already release on a routine basis.
So the debate is really around concepts of reasonable and prompt when applied to the timing of the information released.
I think Virgil and his colleague have done a nice job of explaining to us how in the context of FOIA law “reasonable and prompt” can only be defined as relatively short periods of time.
I also see the relevance of existing procedures with regard to the discount rate and other non-exempt matters.
<START>But he also noted that some delay in releasing the information might be allowed if an March 19, 2002Page 101 of 117earlier release were shown to have adverse effects on the accomplishment of the Committee’s objectives.<END>
And here’s where I have questions and concerns.
<START>Clearly, we cannot, should not, and do not refuse to disclose the vote.<END>
We already make it available.
But we, like all other central banks that vote and disclose the vote, make that information available after the passage of some time.
Why?
Well, to borrow Tom Melzer’s words when this was discussed in early 1994, it was perhaps so as not to focus attention on the minority view rather than the consensus view of the Committee.
We’re a consensual Committee, to use Alan Blinder’s terms.
We release a vote that reflects the best sense of the Committee as a unit at the time.
That is our objective at least in part.
To encourage the media and markets to spend time on the dissenters is to take away from that objective, at least in my view.
Virgil’s note argues that not disclosing the vote may serve to deprive markets of information that is useful about future policy.
I think the reality is that that’s not always the case.
The policy decisions at the next Open Market Committee meeting are not directed by the dissents at the previous meeting.
Events occur.
Things change
—sometimes relatively fast.
And people’s perspectives change as well.
In fact, I think there’s at least a chance that releasing the vote will serve to harden people’s opinions in ways that frustrate the operations of the Committee.
If we make this change, several things could happen.
Members could become increasingly unwilling to dissent, dreading the media onslaught.
And in that regard, I question whether it is feasible to constrain members from speaking about dissents, even for as short a period of time as about a week.
The second thing that could happen, on the opposite side, is that members could find the spotlight and this extra bit of attention to their liking.
They might welcome the focus on the minority, which could create real schisms in the Committee.
Of course, I’m not talking about present members!
[Laughter] March 19, 2002Page 102 of 117In sum, if we believe that our current disclosure policies serve to meet the objectives of this Committee and if we make information available in a time frame that again meets our objectives
—as do other central banks that disclose as much as we do
—I don’t see why we shouldn’t be willing to stand up for those policies.
If we get a FOIA request and are required to defend our current practices, I think we should do so.
In fact, I don’t see how we get out of this bind when the next step in this process is legislation, as has been proposed in the past, on the desirability of televising our procedures.
I don’t know how we get off this slippery slope if we go down it this far.
How do we justify not bringing the television cameras in here?
I don’t see what it is that we’re going to be talking about, with the possible exception of a limited amount of confidential material, that would be so highly confidential.
I’m not sure that anybody reading the transcripts of our meetings five years after the fact would be convinced that what we talk about at the meetings here is all that confidential.
How far are we down the slippery slope to the television cameras?
That’s my tilting at windmills.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Hoenig.
MR.
HOENIG.
I see where this proposal comes from, and I understand it.
<START>I have a bit of sympathy for what Cathy was saying in the sense that releasing the minutes earlier and delaying the disclosure of the vote until those minutes are released made a lot of sense to me.<END>
That’s because I still believe that putting the dissents in context helps.
I know your committee discussed that option;
I read the memo.
<START>I don’t know how the lawyers would interpret it if we got into an argument, but I think a case can be made for delaying the release of the vote until the minutes are available.<END>
And the delay we’ve talked about is only two weeks, which is not an unreasonable period.
But having said that, I think we are in a bind as far as releasing the vote at March 19, 2002Page 103 of 117some point.
So if we don’t want to release the minutes sooner, I don’t think we have any choice but to release the vote after the meeting.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Broaddus.
MR.
BROADDUS.
Well, I think both Cathy and Tom have made good points.
<START>These disclosure issues are always difficult, but it’s generally helpful for me to try to get back to basics and fundamentals when I think about these issues.<END>
The way I see our actions affecting the economy, both short run and long run, is basically through the combined effects of what we do on the funds rate, what we say in the statement, the tilt, and all the other information we release as it relates to expectations and the yield curve.
<START>Against that background, I think greater transparency is better than less transparency.<END>
And that includes earlier release of information in most cases.
So I’m very much in favor of where you came out.
I recognize Cathy’s point about the slippery slope.
I see that that has merit.
But I think there is some point where the slope is going to flatten out before we get to the TV cameras stage in our room here.
Maybe I’m too optimistic, but that’s the way I feel about it.
Even if we go with the recommendation you’ve made with respect to an immediate announcement of the vote, I still think it would be a good idea
—in fact this probably gives us more reason
—to bring the release of the minutes forward, as soon as possible.
It might involve some additional expense.
But in the context of all the other funds we spend on monetary policy and the private sector spends trying to figure out what we’re trying to do, it’s probably rather minor.
So I would hope that we would think about moving in that direction.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay.
President Guynn.
MR.
GUYNN.
I’m comfortable with where you came out.
With time to think about it, it doesn’t seem terribly threatening to have the vote released.
It’s far better than any of the March 19, 2002Page 104 of 117alternatives, which all seem to create another policy event of some kind.
In my view, the last thing we need is another interim statement or announcement regarding our policy decision.
I share President Broaddus’s thoughts that if we could release the minutes earlier, even if it’s a week earlier, that might be desirable.
So that’s something that I think we still ought to consider and get back to.
But I’m comfortable with where you came out.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay, thanks.
Governor Bies.
MS.
BIES.
I support the recommendation, including the fact that I think the vote should be in the announcement as opposed to just available separately.
We get electronic information nowadays, and it’s easier for everybody to see it at the same time and in the same document.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay.
I have nobody else who has asked to speak.
I assume that means that everyone else is
—I'm sorry, President Stern.
MR.
STERN.
Well, I can be very brief.
I agree with the comments that Al and Jack made.
And as far as the TV camera is concerned, I suspect the ratings would be disappointing, to say the least!
[Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.
Oh, I don’t know, it depends on our star performer here.
Are there any other comments?
No one else came to my attention.
MR.
MCTEER.
I agree with your recommendation.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay, thank you.
I think what this means is that while there are still some concerns
—and no one will soft-pedal them or ignore them
—we feel almost obliged to go down this path.
The second question on the table is that we have the opportunity to implement this plan today.
Today may actually be a perfect time because there were no dissents and, as someone said, it was probably one of our easiest decisions.
So we actually have prepared the March 19, 2002Page 105 of 117same kind of press statement we had but with the added information about the tally of the vote, thinking that perhaps this would be the way to go.
VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH.
Oh, Mayor Daley would have loved you!
Guided democracy.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I would call your attention to the last paragraph.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Is that the way it will be done for the discount rate, Roger?
MR.
FERGUSON.
Yes, we’re going to change that, as Ned mentioned.
We will conform the discount rate approach to this one.
Currently the way the press announcement of a discount rate change works is that a well-informed member of the press will ask the question about the vote and the Public Affairs staff will give the answer.
So we think we really should conform the Board’s practice on discount rate votes to this approach for reasons that Governor Bies and others have noted.
MR.
MCTEER.
What if there’s a dissent in this vote?
[Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.
As Cathy has already indicated, we’re a mature Committee, and we will not let these decisions influence our vote on policy.
Besides, the vote on the policy decision has already been taken.
Are there any questions or comments?
Hearing no objections, we will proceed down this path.
Obviously, for this meeting after “voting for” the names of all of the members will be listed;
and after “voting against” this time will be the word “none.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Let’s just say unanimous.
MR.
FERGUSON.
All right.
We’ll say unanimous.
That’s what we’re going to do.
Okay?
Thank you very much.
And thanks for your efforts on this one.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Officially we have to confirm the date of the next meeting, which is Tuesday, May 7.
Let’s proceed to luncheon or supper or whatever you want to call it.
March 19, 2002Page 106 of 117MR. KOHN.
Mr. Chairman, I’ve asked people to submit suggestions for discussion topics at the June meeting.
I’ve gotten returns from about half the Reserve Bank presidents and Board members.
I’ll take any suggestions through the end of this week if the rest of you want to submit something or if any of you want to amend your previous submission.
END OF MEETING
