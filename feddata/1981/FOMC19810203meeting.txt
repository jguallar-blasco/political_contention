I think we better get started.  In general outline, I assume we probably will end up spending all morning, at least, on the so-called technical study.  We'll see whether we complete it this morning.  I assume sometime today we will get to the economic outlook over whatever your forecast horizon is.  Assuming we get that far--and I would think we would get that far--we will have at least a preliminary discussion of the longer-range targets; I doubt that we will get to the shorter-range targets today.  And I think we can defer all the managerial reports and that kind of thing until tomorrow.  So, we will start.  We have to approve the minutes.  Do I have a motion?    SPEAKER(?).  So moved.    SPEAKER(?).  Second.    CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without objection, we will approve the minutes.  Do we have anything else we're supposed to do here at the beginning?  Well, we'll just go to the [new] monetary control procedure.  Presumably, the objective of this discussion is to arrive at some judgment as to whether or not we're generally satisfied with the technique that we adopted [in October 1979]--a technique which, in the short run, emphasizes control of nonborrowed reserves.  And we alter that in the light of what is going on in the money supply or total reserves.  It implies judgmental adjustments in terms of the multiplier; it implies some kind of federal funds rate band.  My own interpretation of that federal funds band may differ from that of others, but I don't think it has been, in and of itself, much of a constraint because every time we [reached the limit] we moved it.  On the other hand, there is some sense inherent in the technique, but maybe not openly stated, that the way the technique is run doesn't bounce reserves up and down very sharply depending upon what happened last week or even last month.  There is some sluggishness in adjustments which in itself presumably has a short-run stabilizing effect on money market interest rates even though that is not the stated objective.  But it is inherent in the way the technique has been operated.    So, we have to decide whether to continue with that general technique.  And if we don't want to continue with it, somebody has to put forward an alternative that is desirable in a rather important way, which I suppose could go the gamut of more emphasis on interest rates to more emphasis on some stricter or more mechanical reserve technique.  Assuming we want to continue generally with the present technique, there are a number of questions that arise as to what modifications might be made as a matter of emphasis, [such as] speed of the reactions on nonborrowed reserves and some important questions --which we probably could never resolve today in any event--on the discount window and discount rate management and the management of the federal funds rate band.  I hope we can come out with some coherent or incoherent--preferably coherent--conclusion on these subjects.       Let me say something as far as the conclusions of the study in a more technical area are concerned.  I believe that in any statement I make to the Congress I am going to have to review this study and pronounce some general conclusions.  The most important conclusion will be whether we want to change the technique, the question I just raised.  But on a somewhat more technical level, my understanding, subject to confirmation or change during our discussion this morning--and I may not be comprehensive in this listing--is that there is no real evidence that on a weekly or monthly basis the money supply has moved more erratically this year than before.  I think what the study shows is that it looks that way if you look at the raw figures; but by the time we get finished seasonally adjusting and revising seasonal adjustments as we did in earlier years, it's likely to look in a very short-run perspective about as stable or as unstable as it did before.  In fact, there is a very large random component in the weekly figures and a considerable one in the monthly figures.  So, I take it the study suggested that it was somewhat of an open question as to whether we had a more erratic performance in the money supply this year than in earlier years.  If you look at it in a little longer perspective, say, quarterly, then statistically we did [have more variation]; but whether that was a reflection of external events like credit controls and the sharp fluctuations in the economy or whether it had anything to do with the technique is the open question.  As the study put it, it's certainly not proven that the technique had anything to do with it.    I think all the studies suggest that there is a definite tradeoff between interest rates and money supply stability.  And the tradeoff assumes rather violent proportions in terms of interest rates, if we really want to stabilize the money supply.  The studies also suggest that the whole structure of interest rates has been affected by fluctuations in short-term rates much more than earlier, depending upon how you look at the studies.  So, when we're talking about fluctuations in short-term rates, at least in the last year, we're talking about fluctuations in the whole structure of interest rates.  We have not found much evidence of an induced cycle in the money supply when the procedures [led us to] tighten to force a decline [in the money supply] and then to ease off to force another increase.  That's an important question.  My judgment of what is said is that there's not much evidence for that.  And there isn't much evidence that short-run--by that I mean quarterly or more than quarterly--deviations in the money supply have any very pronounced effect on the economy or on inflation because they are not terribly important in that sense.  Well, those are some of the tentative conclusions I have drawn from what I have read of these studies, but they are all subject to further interpretation as we proceed.    With that much introduction, I will have Mr. Axilrod introduce the discussion more technically after welcoming Mr. Boehne and Mr. Boykin to our council this morning.  If you can survive this meeting, I suspect you will be able to survive any of the future meetings!  Mr. Axilrod.    MR. AXILROD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some of my introductory comments will repeat some of yours, but I don't think any of them will contradict.   2/2-3/81-2-    MR. SCHULTZ.  We'll watch carefully.  It may come as a surprise.    MR. AXILROD.  I'd like to organize my introductory comments around three general points.  One is the limitations in the study; second is a very brief summary of the findings, since they have been summarized over the course of 15 pages in a memo; and third is a general statement about what I, at least, would see as some of the implications of the study for our present procedure.    First, on the limitations:  It seems like a long period since the introduction of the [new] procedure in October [1979], but the period is now 15 months; and it's really very short for evaluating the procedure.  And it's particularly short because last year was a very strange year in that there were a lot of what we call exogenous factors affecting the economy that would have had impacts on the money supply and interest rates no matter what procedure the Federal Reserve was following.  That makes the problem of averaging out, so to speak, even more complicated because we had a year where interest rates, money supply, and spending were subject to exogenous shocks that make trying to find out what the procedure did to the economy or to the money supply or to interest rates very difficult.  It's very hard to separate it out.  So, given the nature of the period, the 12 months that we actually used in [our studies to evaluate] the 15 months or longer that we now actually have [used the new control procedure] is quite short.    Secondly, of course, we couldn't just observe the procedure and say:  "Well, there was a lot of money and interest rate variability."  We were forced to try to see if we could conclude that either the procedure gave rise to the variability or the variability was caused exogenously and was independent of the procedure.  We needed something to judge all that against, so we had to use models, which are nothing more or less than an average of 10 or 15 years of experience, and see how they would have worked if 1980 in some sense had had the characteristics of those 10 or 15 years over which the models were constructed.  Thus, I would really want to caution you about that.  I think that was a necessary procedure, but I want to caution you because:  (a) 1980 wasn't like the previous 10 or 15 years; (b) models do tend to be misspecified and they may not even be a correct representation of the previous 10 or 15 years; and (c) models have a disconcerting tendency to give very different results if you put in one variable and take out another or if you change the period over which the variables are estimated.  As a result of that we did try to use a number of different models, which had a number of different views of the world, in order to try to give as fair a test as possible.  But I would use all these results with caution.  Because one model works in one period surely doesn't mean it's going to work in the next.    Finally, I would say on behalf of the whole staff that we have had a limited time to evaluate so complicated a subject.  We started thinking about this sometime in September; I remember discussing it with the Chairman.  I think we started working in earnest on it sometime in October, and that really is a limited time given the very complicated procedures we were involved in.  So, some of the work is actually ongoing and is therefore subject to change as we learn more or stumble across better ways of doing things.  As a  2/2-3/81-3-2/2-3/81check on ourselves, we did try in a seminar-type setting to expose allthe work to all the people in the Federal Reserve System who wereworking on this project [for their critical evaluation]. And on twoof the crucial pieces, those by Mr. Tinsley and Mr. Lindsey, we didhave a conference with academic economists--Messrs. Brunner, Meltzer,Rashe, Pierce, Kareken, and LeRoy--to have input from that end and toexpose our work not exactly to disinterested observers but to, wewould hope, rather critical observers. And I think that our workthere survived rather well and did have some impact on their thinking.With that background, I'll try to generalize the findingseven more than they are generalized in the discussion paper. Oneprincipal finding--and again this is not a matter of logic but partlya matter of logic and partly just a matter of judgmental analysis--wasthat 1980 was a rather special year, mainly because of the creditcontrol program and also, I believe, because of the dynamics ofinflationary expectations. The latter led to very much higherinterest rates than otherwise would have developed, which I think setoff apparent sizable further efforts by the public to economize oncash as those high interest rates developed. So, I think the specialnature of the year gave us very pronounced disturbances in the marketfor goods and services, which were set off by the credit controlprogram, and pronounced disturbances on the side of money, which wereset off by the very high interest rates that developed very early inthe year. And some of these developments actually were occurring[concurrently], which tended to confuse some of the econometricmodels.Another general conclusion I would draw is that so far as wecould tell, because of these external shocks, much of the interestrate and money variation was probably not intrinsic to the proceduresbut derived from the large-scale shocks external to the FederalReserve [impinging upon] monetary policy against which the procedureswere working. That is an odd assertion. In some of the work that Mr.Tinsley did, using the model constructed over the past 10 or 15 years,he tried to see whether the results of the year fell within aconfidence interval one would expect, given the average of the past 10or 15 years. And he found that for the most part they fell at thelower end of the confidence interval or below. So, just from thatkind of simulation, it looked as if it was a rather special year.Another conclusion is that on a more technical level itseemed that our procedures performed reasonably well in the presentinstitutional environment relative to the simulated options; and Ithink that was the conclusion drawn by our academic consultants alsoin that conference we had with them. That is, we could not assertfrom what we found statistically that we would have gotten bettercontrol of money if we had just used as the criterion the monetarybase or total reserves over a period of one month and probably notover a period of three months in the present institutionalenvironment. Indeed, it did look as if control of the base or totalreserves might even have made for less control over money in thepresent institutional environment. Now, it is of some interest justto indicate why that turned out to be so; it turned out to be sobecause I think we all tended to underestimate what we call our[money] supply-side disturbances. That is, there were shifts in thedeposit mix, with more CDs, meaning a need for more required reserves.And unless [the needed reserves are] provided--if we just hit our-4-2/2-3/81total reserves or total base target and don't provide them--weimmediately would get less money supply because the reserves aren'tthere and [we would get] higher interest rates in consequence of lessmoney, given short-run money demand. And unless we have mademultiplier adjustments or have made a good guess about what themultiplier is, we would get these erratic money supply movements if wewere following total reserves or a total base target because of thesesupply-side disturbances--not demand-for-money disturbances, but the[money] supply-side disturbances. And, of course, the models we workwith don't allow for that. So, our conclusion was that it would bevery important to have judgmental multiplier adjustments if we were towork on total reserves or the total base, certainly in the presentinstitutional environment.Now, with institutional changes, it did appear that we coulddo very well with a total reserve or total base aggregate; we'd makethe obvious institutional changes that I don't think I need to detailfor all of you. Some of this will [be discussed] later. But ourevidence, again working from the model, was that we'd do better withtotal reserves in that context than the base because in the end wewould still have the institutional supply-side problem that currencyhas a 100 percent reserve requirement and deposits have a fraction ofthat reserve requirement. So, changes in the mix of currency anddeposits seem to have bigger disturbing effects in the multiplier ifone works with the base than if one works with total reserves.Another conclusion we reached--and it seemed fairly clear--is thatmore precise month-to-month control in money is likely to lead togreater interest rate volatility. Indeed, the more precise we try tomake it--that is, the more we try to hit it month-to-month instead ofletting it average out over a 2- or 3- or 4-month period--the moreinterest rate volatility there is likely to be. And this is a resultof what seems to be a rather inelastic money demand in the short run;that is, in a week or two or three or whatever time affects themonthly average, it takes one heck of a lot of interest rate change tomake people want to hold less or more money than they otherwise wantedto hold when there is a normal, and often random, flow of funds in theeconomy.Finally, as a general finding, we detected little need forprecise month-to-month money control on economic grounds. It appearedthat significant economic effects are more likely to appear afterthree months or so than before, clearly. Some work Mr. Enzler didgives us an order of magnitude of the effect [on GNP] if we were offpath for six months. It turned out, for example, that if money wasgrowing faster than target by 2 percent at an annual rate over a6-month period, we might get a higher nominal GNP of about 1/2 percentat an annual rate. So, it's after six months that there gets to be alittle but nontrivial effect; it depends on your values andpreferences. But [such a divergence for] three months is rathertrivial in terms of its effect, and much of the 6-month effect isoffset later if you undershoot later; it's not offset, of course, ifyou don't undershoot but just go back to the original level that youhad.Let me say a few words, Mr. Chairman, if I may, about theimplications. I'd first like to note the advantages of the presenttarget procedure, which is a procedure in which we use nonborrowedreserves as a day-to-day or week-to-week target but take total2/2-3/81reserves as a general guide so that adjustments are sometimes made tothe nonborrowed target because of what is happening to total reserves.This procedure can be viewed as something of a compromise because itis somewhat accommodative to deviations of money from the demand side.That is, when money demand is strong--and it could be strong forrandom reasons, as Dave Pierce's paper showed, because there's a lotof noise in the money [stock] weekly and even monthly--there is adegree of accommodation; borrowing goes up. But it is not totalaccommodation because interest rates also go up. So the procedure insome sense involves a degree of accommodation to money demand shifts.If disturbances are from the goods market, there is a degree ofoffset; it's the other side of the degree of accommodation, because ifthere's an increase in spending and an increase in money fortransactions purposes, then there's pressure against that and interestrates go up. This is not a bad thing because the economy, so far aswe could tell, last year showed evidence of both types of shocks init; indeed, since the mid-1970s there have been considerable moneydemand shocks. So, there is something to be said for a target thatcompromises between these two and gives the Committee time atsubsequent meetings to make a judgment as to how it wants to weighwhat is going on in the economy, particularly since in the 1-monthinterval it doesn't look as if anything very fatal can happen to theeconomy from that kind of compromise. In a sense, the presentprocedures are a reasonable compromise. But because the discountwindow isn't entirely open--if it were, then we'd be accommodativeentirely to all money demand [variation] whether it was a shift[relative to spending or not--I'd say the compromise is weighted toassuming that the shocks probably are mainly from the goods market.But that represents a judgment on my part.If the Committee wants more short-run precision and controlof money than it now has, there are a number of suggestions that comeout of the study. I would say that last year we did detect a littlemore slippage in the way the control procedures have been run and haveworked than one might have expected in advance. I [use as] thecriterion that what one might have expected in advance was not so muchthe 1-month slippage but the gain in precision if one goes from onemonth to three months. If you look at the control horizon, it's threemonths. And the gain in precision we got last year and actually howthe procedures worked out was less than the gain in precision onemight have expected just from averaging out a bunch of random errorsin the money to reserve relationship. That means there may besomething somewhat systematic [happening] there. And that systematicthing could have been exogenous, in that it just sort of happened thatway, or there could be things in the procedures that we could improve.Now most of the things that one would think of improving goin the direction of playing the game as if we were operating on totalreserves because, while they don't bear a close relationship in themodels, once we abstract from all the things that the models can'tabstract from--which include the reserve requirement structures andthings like that--then the relationship gets closer. The evidence wedeveloped indicates that; much of that is in Mr. Lindsey's tables.So, one way of pretending that you're a bit more on a total reservestarget is to adjust the nonborrowed path more quickly when totalreserves are strong or weak relative to path--that is, of course, withtotal reserves strong or weak properly adjusted for multiplier shiftsto the extent that we can detect them. That would be one method of2/2-3/81pretending we were tending more to follow total reserves. Anothermethod would be to employ the discount rate more actively, which insome sense is very similar to adjusting the nonborrowed path. In onecase, if total reserves are strong, you provide less nonborrowedreserves. In another case, if total reserves are strong, you raisethe discount rate and provide less incentive to borrow. So the twomethods are tantamount in a way to the same thing. In some subtlesense of policy strategy, there are differences; but in a technicalsense they're tantamount to the same thing. You are trying to controltotal reserves either by holding back on nonborrowed reserves or byholding back on borrowings or vice versa if [total reserves] are weak.Another possibility is to restructure the discount window sothat the demand for borrowing is more certain. That's a much morecontroversial question and it tends to limit in a sense the System'sflexibility if pursued very far. We discussed that at length in Mr.Keir's paper and in the summary document. I'll only mention thatthere are two extremes to consider: One is to close the windowentirely except for emergency borrowing, which would really convertthe nonborrowed path to a total reserves path; the other is to open itentirely, and that would give you a structured discount ratepossibility so that as borrowing rises, interest rates would rise andsome resistance would develop, somewhat like now, to increases inmoney above path. Of course, if we didn't have that structureddiscount rate--if there were just a flat discount rate and an openwindow--then the increase in borrowed reserves would be tantamount tononborrowed reserves. Even with a structured discount rate, I thinkthis kind of technique would make the highest discount rate the top ofthe funds rate [band]; the funds rate would never go above it and itwould elevate the discount rate as an instrument of policy to an evenmore important [position] than it could be under the present way weoperate. It's not a more important instrument of policy now but itcould be; and if the discount window were restructured, it couldbecome even more important. The variability of borrowing [demand]that we've been so suffering with and unable to predict to any greatextent this year--and the evidence of last year is that it did becomemore variable--so far as one could determine must have had to do withadministration of the window because if the window were open and therewere no problem with borrowing, presumably banks would use it. And ifit were closed, there wouldn't be any administration to worry about.So there's something in the interaction between the way the discountwindow is administered and how banks view the administration thatcauses a variability in the borrowing demand that is difficult topredict.On other matters, it was difficult to find anything thatwould say that a shift to contemporaneous reserve accounting would nothelp short-run money control, particularly if we were on any kind ofeven shadow total reserves target. On the other hand, it wasdifficult to argue that maintaining lagged reserve accounting would bea major deficiency if our horizon were something like a 3-monthperiod. I did not take a staff vote on any of these matters, but Ithink the people who worked mostly in the Lindsey-type area do prefera shift to contemporaneous reserve accounting. Finally, on theseparticular points, if you want to control a narrower aggregate likeM1-B, then it's obvious--again, if you're playing a shadow totalreserve game--that you ought to remove the reserve requirement onnonpersonal time deposits. If you want to control the broader2/2-3/81aggregates, you have a considerable problem because you don't have thelegal possibility of putting reserves on most [of the components] ofthose broader aggregates, even those that are held at banks and thriftinstitutions. So, by their nature they are going to be more difficultto control with a reserve technique than the narrower aggregates.All of these changes that one could suggest--some of them aresmall and some of them are large--structurally would lead so far as wecould tell to more short-run volatility in interest rates in thedegree that they reduce short-run accommodation to random money supplymovements. So, in a sense, if you're organizing the system to achieveprecise month-to-month control of money, we believe that would giveyou greater short-run volatility in interest rates unless you'refortunate enough to predict exactly the amount of money the markethappens to want [in a particular] month. And given the amount ofrandom noise in the money [stock], I suspect that's just purelyimpossible. However, these things would reduce the odds, I believe,on getting far off the long-run [money growth] path over a period ofthree months or so. I think they would have that constructive effect.So, even if they increased the volatility of interest rates in theshort run, which is likely, you might get a little less intermediate-run fluctuation. That's because even with more volatile short-runmovement, the trend up or down [in short-term interest rates] once youbegin deviating--once money growth begins to get stronger or weaker--would begin sooner and with less of a lag than now, possibly. So, youwould have less need for very high [rates later] because you wouldhave gotten less far off [the money growth] path over a 3-monthperiod. While it rather clearly gives you more short-run volatilityin interest rates, it seems to me quite possible that you would reducethe highs and lows and the intermediate-run fluctuations in interestrates.Finally, and on balance, Mr. Chairman, I don't think we founda clear need for overhauling our procedures radically; at least that'smy conclusion. I'd say that was particularly so because it was alsoclear that last year may have been a special year in that thedisturbances that hit the system from the economy occurred [not only]in the market for goods and services, which argues for a money supplytarget, but also to a great extent in the long-run and the short-run,that is the monthly, market for money, i.e. in money demand. And withthose kinds of disturbances, the present procedures tend to be arather reasonable compromise.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it might be helpful if we dividethe discussion up into more technical questions at the beginning andthen more policy-oriented questions after that. In the area oftechnical conclusions or questions--I didn't bring the informationwith me--it might be useful if you reviewed some of the results thatMr. Lindsey had on the expected short-run instability in the moneysupply [from the use of] the technique.MR. AXILROD. Well, Mr. Lindsey is here. If he would like tocome up to the table, he could review very briefly the evidence fromusing total reserves, the total base, nonborrowed reserves, and thenonborrowed base from several models, as well as some of the resultsthat the simulations suggested if we made some of these structuralchanges. That is mostly in Table 7 of your material, Dave?2/2-3/81MR. LINDSEY. That's right. For those of you who have thepaper, you may turn to Table 7. We did try to construct variousexperiments that pretended we were on different operating targets withdifferent reserve measures in turn and we asked ourselves: What isthe minimum amount of variability of money month-to-month and alsoquarter-to-quarter that one might expect? We used two models underthe current institutional structure: one developed some years ago bythe Board's staff and one recently developed by the staff of theFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The results appeared toindicate to us that, looking at month-to-month growth rate deviationsof money from a targeted level, about the best we could expect to dounder the current institutional structure was a month-to-month growthrate error on the order of, say, 5 to 10 percentage points under anyreserve aggregate operating target.MR. AXILROD. Plus or minus 5.MR. LINDSEY. That's plus or minus 5 to 10, in terms of astandard error, which means that one-third of the time we would evenbe outside of that band. Those results applied to the nonborrowedreserves and nonborrowed base measures; they both gave very similarresults. As a result of the supply-side problems that Mr. Axilroddiscussed earlier, the [errors using] total reserves and total basemeasures under the current institutional structure were considerablylarger than for the nonborrowed measures. So, that's the range oferror in hitting your month-to-month money target with the currentinstitutional structure. The actual misses were a bit above that forM-1A and around the upper end of that range for M-1B. Now, those didaverage out to some extent in the Board's monthly model over quarterlyperiods, as Mr. Axilrod mentioned--a bit more in fact than the actualexperience quarterly. The Board's monthly model appeared to haveerrors month-to-month that were about random, so they would tend tocancel out partially as the period under consideration lengthened.With the Board model we did look at a change in theinstitutional structure both in terms of trying to eliminate thesupply-side errors that are susceptible to regulatory changes--eliminating lagged reserve accounting, making reserve requirements ondemand deposits uniform and universal, toward which of course theMonetary Control Act will move us as it's phased in, as well asremoving reserve requirements against savings and time deposits. Andthere once again I'm summarizing Mr. Axilrod's conclusions, but I'llgive you some numerical examples. Total reserves improvedconsiderably; in fact, it became the best operating target if rigidlyadhered to over a control period, giving an error on the order of 3percentage points plus or minus two-thirds of the time. Also, as Mr.Axilrod said, that would imply very significant [interest] ratevolatility in response to unexpected shifts in money demand over thecontrol period, which in this case is a month. So, it's not clearyou'd want to control money that closely. But it would be feasibleeven, I might add, with the kinds of errors that we saw over the last15 months since October 1979. We did try an example with the kind ofgraduated [discount] rate structure in the Board model that Mr.Axilrod referred to and we did get some improvement--on the order of 2percentage points--with the nonborrowed reserves and nonborrowed basetargets. That gives you a sense of the range of variability underdifferent operating targets and different institutional structuresmonth-to-month. Looking at annual rates, even under the present2/2-3/81operating structure, it looked as though for a 3-month or quarterlyperiod the errors by and large fell into a range of 1 to 2 percentagepoints in both the San Francisco and the Board models. As Mr. Axilrodmentioned, the actual errors were somewhat larger than that becausethere wasn't as much averaging out of the monthly errors in the actualexperience as was the case with the models.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Dr. Burns used to be fond of saying thatfor a monthly period, four equals eight on the money supply. Asnearly as I can understand your results, in the present institutionalsettings, minus 10 equals plus 10.MR. AXILROD. Well, Mr. Chairman, if I can translate that, Ithink he's saying minus 10 is as likely as plus 10 if you aim at zero.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Right, if you're aiming at zero.MR. ROOS. May I ask, Steve, is short-run month-to-monthprecision really important? I believe that even the most ardentadvocates of aggregate control will freely admit that short-runprecision is almost impossible to achieve. Is this a necessary factorin deciding what we're going to do? Or if we announce and make clearthat we are going to concentrate on achievement of our longer-rangetarget, wouldn't this be it?MR. AXILROD. Well, very clearly, on economic grounds short-run precision isn't very necessary. So far as we can see, it has adisadvantage of much greater interest rate volatility. It's very hardto evaluate the implications of this greater volatility, but there arecertain kinds of thin capital structures in the various markets forsecurities and [greater volatility] does tend to increase risks rathergreatly because of that. But if I could translate your question alittle, it's clear to me that if you could hit [a target] month-to-month precisely, these interest rate variations would go away overtime. That's because as the market responded to them, then of coursethat would give you greater assurance of hitting it quarterly. Thatis, if you can hit it month-by-month, you can surely hit it quarterly.Clearly, it's more important to hit it quarterly than month-by-month.I'm trying to say the only importance of having a procedure that givesyou better assurance [of hitting the target] month-by-month is that itgives you better assurance [of hitting it] quarterly. I have afeeling--and I'm not sure how we could test this--that you have betterassurance of hitting it quarterly even if you don't have a lot ofcontrol month-by-month by aiming at it month-by-month; that would getyou where you want to go in the quarter even though you can't hit amonth-by-month target. I've gone around Robin Hood's barn a little inanswering the question, but that's how I would perceive it.MR. ROOS. But if one were skeptical of the long-term wisdomof pursuing our present policies of trying to control money and creditthrough aggregate control, one would not use the staff conclusionsthat month-to-month precision is difficult to achieve. That would notbe a basis for walking away from considering the broader advantages ordisadvantages of aggregate control.MR. AXILROD. Oh, heaven's no! And that certainly was notthe staff's conclusion.-10-2/2-3/81MR. ROOS. Yes..MR. WALLICH. Just to make sure I understand you, thequarterly precision results imply that one goes off one month or twobut in the third month one returns to track. If one stays off trackand comes back later than the third month, then there are moreperceptible effects on the real sector. Is that right?MR. AXILROD. That's right. That's what I was trying to say.Jerry Enzler's simulation showed that if growth is off 2 percent at anannual rate for two quarters, you'd have an impact of 1/2 percent atan annual rate on nominal GNP.MR. WALLICH. How do we make that need to get back within thequarter, as it were, consistent with the [great] uncertainty--the verylarge standard error within a month of plus or minus 10 percent--if wereally don't know in the first month where we are?MR. AXILROD. Well, I think the answer is in part what I wastrying to say in response to President Roos' question. To the degreethat these are random errors, you keep aiming [at the path]. Thismonth, let's say, you aim at the path and you go way over. Next monthyou keep aiming at the path and you may go way under, so in some senseyou've averaged out. There's no reason to think that the errors aregoing to be persistent on one side or the other.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Except that they seem to be, in fact.MR. AXILROD. What we found in the past year was that, infact, [the actual errors] didn't average out as well as the modelsaveraged out. So it might lead you to think that there was somethingin the way the procedures were constructed or maneuvered that producedthis result or that there was something in the economy that was morespecial [last] year. Of course, the models were confronted with thatalso; but that worked out in practice to give you these greaterdeviations. The simplest way to put it is that your average error ina month is .6, or 7.2 percent at an annual rate if you think of it asan absolute error. But if you think of it quarterly--the world isn'tthis way--but if you had plus .6 and minus .6 and plus .6 in eachmonth of a quarter, then the absolute error that quarter becauseyou're now averaging quarterly in absolute terms would work down toplus .2. With plus .6, minus .6, and plus .6, you'd be left with plus.2 [for the quarter]. According to the models, the errors aren'tdistributed in that nice way, so the improvement shouldn't be thatspectacular. But [the improvement] ought to be more like .6 to .3 orsomething instead of .6 to .2. We got an improvement of .63 to .47 orsomething like that. It wasn't quite as good as some sort of randomdistribution of the multiplier errors would suggest, and that was thereason to think that there might be something more systematic[happening] or some way to operate the procedures that would get usthere better.MR. MAYO. Steve, does it make any difference in youranalysis whether you aim at a fixed quarterly cleanup, so to speak, ora quarterly moving average?MR. AXILROD. I don't think so. What we actually did in thistest was to take each month's target and see if we were off and just-11-2/2-3/81average each intermeeting target for 3 intermeeting periods as a wayof viewing the random nature to see if, because of the random natureof the money supply multipliers, that [approach] would capture that.That is, if randomness had [produced] an upside shock in one period,it ought to end up [producing] a downside shock in the next period.We just averaged through that, so it wasn't a direct test of whatyou're asking. But I would say the answer to [your question] isprobably no. One can conceive of a world where you're trying to geton a long-run path and you just keep aiming at that level each monthto get you there, trying not to forget the past, and you're aiming at[unintelligible]. If two months from now you're supposed to be "here"and in one month you were "there," you'd still try to get "here" twomonths from now.MR. MAYO. It may give you the illusion of a little lessrigid definition of your intermediate goals, but I agree with you thatit probably wouldn't make any real difference over a period of a year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Schultz.MR. SCHULTZ. I had a couple of questions, Steve. First, Inoticed in the Bank of Canada's report to the United Kingdom that theyindicated that they didn't believe fluctuations in the money supply[for periods] of less than six months made very much difference. Isthat a judgmental [assessment] on their part or did they do somestudies? Or would it really make any difference to us?MR. AXILROD. Well, I assume they did some studies. I'm notacquainted with their model as far as what results it would give. Iassume they have done the same kinds of studies we've done on runningover or under path for given periods and determining how much effecton nominal GNP the model gives them. We used to say 6 months here;the lags seem to have gotten a little shorter, so 3 months seems alittle safer. But, again, it depends on the magnitude of effect oneis willing to tolerate. I ought to add in that respect, GovernorSchultz, that none of the models takes account of the expectationalreaction to what is going on in the money supply. The expectationsare largely derived from past price behavior or past interest ratebehavior to the extent [the models are looking at] interest rates orprice expectations. And in this modern world I think [expectationsare] an additional factor to take into account. That is, if you'rerunning off path for 2 or 3 or 4 months, what will be the reaction inmarkets to that? You may get more prompt interest rate responses.You may get different kinds of pricing decisions than the models aresuggesting.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, that leads into my second question, whichis essentially on the question of lag time. How good a handle can weget on that question, and does it make any difference at all or couldit make any difference? If you look at the question of money supplyon one hand and interest rates on the other, do you get a differentfeel for a lag time? That, of course, goes to my final question aboutwhether interest rates have induced wider cyclical changes. If youmake different assumptions about lag time, do you come to differentconclusions on that question?MR. AXILROD. We tried to examine some of the evidence onthat and Mr. Enzler, who I don't think is here at the moment, did a-12-2/2-3/81considerable amount of work in that area, both theoretically and usingthe model. You could construct a system where money demand was highlyinterest inelastic--much higher than it is, presumably--so you wouldhave a lot of interest rate fluctuation when you tried to controlthat, and where there was no response in the economy in the currentperiod but it occurred with a lag. Cycles in economic activity mightbegin to develop because you are controlling money. This is quite theopposite of what monetarists would contend. He could develop, withreasonable estimates or unreasonable estimates of interest elasticity,4- or 5-year cycles. Last year, of course, our cycle was--MR. PARTEE. Four or five years you said?MR. AXILROD. Yes, with 4- or 5-year regularity. Last yearour cycle was 3 or 4 months and that would imply a lot shorter lagsthan we discovered empirically and that are therefore embodied in ourquarterly model. And given the fact that--MR. WALLICH. Well, that was one of the things we learned:That the lags are shorter.MR. PARTEE. [Unintelligible.]MR. AXILROD. Unfortunately, there was a credit controlprogram last year and there seems to be quite a correspondence betweenthe behavior of consumer spending and the imposition of the creditcontrol program and [subsequently] the reemergence of consumerspending and the phasing out of the credit control program. It'sdifficult to ignore that evidence. So, we concluded tentatively thatthe lags haven't gotten so short in relation to money policy andinterest rate behavior as to make it likely that we're going to getconsistent 3- and 6-month cycles as a result of a policy of trying tocontrol money. I wouldn't say that that's impossible, really; but itjust didn't seem consistent with the evidence of last year, given thatthe credit control program was a very big factor in the year.MR. SCHULTZ. Does the evidence indicate that the higherinterest rates go the shorter the lag time? Do you have any empiricaldata on that? Or do you get about the same kind of problem: That thecredit controls have put you in such a situation that you can't cometo any conclusion?MR. AXILROD. Well, I wish Jerry [Enzler] were here, but Idon't think we have evidence that says the lag time is related to thelevel of interest rates. But, of course, the higher the interestrates, the more there is a current reaction, given a lag, because it'sjust multiplied; if interest rates go up 20 percent instead of 10percent, you get more effect given any lag structure right awaybecause the 20 percent is bigger. If you're going to get a 1 percenteffect right away out of 10 percent, you'd get 2 percent out of 20percent. So it's simply that you get more power right away, but it'sthe same kind of lag structure.MR. SCHULTZ. Final question. When you were looking at thediscount rate, did you look at the possibility of varying the discountrate with some relation to the capital ratios of the borrowinginstitutions?-13-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. No, we did not.MR. SCHULTZ. The reason I asked is that it is clear thatinterest rate spreads seem to have more effect at this point thaninterest rate levels. And, obviously, the larger banks tend to bedoing the biggest borrowing. And they're the ones that are moreconcerned with interest rate spreads because they can go out and buytheir money more easily. If [borrowing] had some connection withcapital ratios, wouldn't it have some interesting effects on [theamount of] borrowing? Is it worth thinking about?MR. AXILROD. Well, it's certainly worth thinking about. AsI say, we didn't consider it. The types of structures we did considerwere to try to increase rates as the amount of borrowing went up; and,depending on how you do it, that could have an effect on larger banksrelative to smaller banks. The surcharge, of course, affects mainlythe larger banks where the capital ratios are low. So, I think inpractice, particularly now, much of that is taken into account. Butwe could certainly consider it. The legality of it would be somethingI would wonder about also. But it's certainly something to beconsidered.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. I just wanted to ask a question, a point ofclarification, about this business of departures from path. I thinkwe run into semantic difficulties because some people think of thepath as a rate of increase in an aggregate and other people think ofit as observations of the desired level over time. I think it'sawfully important that we all understand how the experiment was done.Now, when Jerry introduced a departure from path--he's here now--thatwas, say, the correction in the second quarter or the third quarter orwhatever his periodicity was, was the correction such that he reducedthe growth rate as much below path as it had been above path before?What was done?MR. AXILROD. It was run two different ways. First, if youwere above path in the first quarter--your path level was here and youended up there--in the second quarter you would go back to path.You'd reduce the growth rate in the second quarter but just enough toget you back to the long-run path level. The second kind ofexperiment was that if you were above the path in the first quarter,you'd [aim] below path in the second quarter and go back to path inthe third quarter and continue on.MR. PARTEE. So that in some sense for a longer period theaverage amount of money was the same as it otherwise--MR. AXILROD. That's right. For example, if growth is over[path by] 1 percent on average for 2 quarterly periods and then goesback to path, you obviously have more money in there on average thanif you'd been on the path consistently and also more money on averagethan if you had gone under path before.MR. PARTEE. In the first case, you'd have a rather lastingeffect on the GNP.-14-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. That's right. In the second case it tends tooffset. Now, the Committee targets are more like the first casebecause they are measured QIV to QIV, so you have a QIV average levelthat you get back to. So the way the Committee has set its targets ismuch more like the case of being over and then going back to the pathinstead of going under.MR. PARTEE. So there could be some residual GNP effects inwhat our current path structure is?MR. AXILROD. Yes, if it works out that way.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ford.MR. FORD. I also want a clarification of what you did withregard to your discount rate sensitivity studies. A priori one wouldexpect to see the amount of borrowing out of line with your plan thegreater the differential between the effective rate at the window andthe effective comparable rate in the market. But the amount ofborrowing is obviously conditioned by the administration of thewindow. Did you find as we hit periods of time when the spreadwidened between the effective rate at the window and market rates--say, for CDs adjusted for reserves--more problems with the borrowingat the window or not?MR. LINDSEY. Well, I was just going to say that in theexperiment I referred to we essentially took the monthly model, whichhas borrowings as a function of the spread of the funds rate over thediscount rate and we eliminated--MR. FORD. Which discount rate, with or without thedifferential?MR. LINDSEY. Essentially without the surcharge. Is thatwhat you mean?MR. FORD. Yes. In other words, you did it against thenominal discount rate rather than the one that affects the largerbanks.MR. LINDSEY. Yes. What we essentially did was to takeaccount of the effects of the surcharge and other sources of error bysurpressing the error in that equation in the model completely. Whatwe had, then, was a perfectly known function of borrowing with respectto the spread of the funds rate over the discount rate. And what thatmeant was that it really didn't matter whether the funds rate was alittle over the discount rate or a lot over the discount rate in thatmodel simulation because we knew exactly how much borrowing would comeout of that. And then we just simulated the model accordingly. Wereally didn't address your specific question in that model run. Weaddressed another question, which was: How closely could money havebeen controlled if we had had this graduated discount rate structurethat would tend to eliminate the noise in the amount of discountwindow borrowing as a function of the funds rate/discount rate spread?MR. FORD. In other words, we don't know for sure that wewould have had less problems with the borrowing track if, for-15-2/2-3/81instance, we had [operated] the window with a penalty rate lover] thefunds rate or something like that?MR. LINDSEY. That was one we didn't explicitly look at,although we did look at the case where total reserves were simply heldfixed. And, as Mr. Axilrod mentioned, the case where you have thepenalty rate--where it is always a penalty or you just close thewindow to borrowings other than emergency borrowings--you essentiallycreate a total reserves kind of target because nonborrowed and totalmove together. So, in that sense we did examine that second case aswell.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure I understand the question.MR. AXILROD. I was going to say that I thought one of thethings you were asking, President Ford, was: Did we have more troublepredicting demand for borrowing as the market rates widened above thediscount rate? I just checked with Mr. Johnson, who did someregressions and looked at that material, and his response coincideswith my memory or lack of memory, which is that I can't recall that wedid have any more trouble with wide spreads than we did withrelatively narrow spreads. But it may be--MR. PARTEE. We, of course, had more borrowing.MR. AXILROD. We had more borrowing; trouble in predictingthe borrowing, I don't think we had.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The borrowing is not controlled by thespread; the spread is controlled by the borrowing.MR. AXILROD. Or something.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Should we go over it once again? We havelagged reserve accounting in the present institutional setting. Mr.Axilrod and Mr. Sternlight are setting the level of nonborrowedreserves. That decision sets the level of borrowing. The market rateof interest at which that borrowing takes place is determined by thebanks, but not the level of the borrowing.MR. FORD. We observed that the amount of borrowing wepredict is--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You observed that the higher theborrowing, the higher the spread. The causation is the opposite waythan you are suggesting.MR. AXILROD. What would happen when the demand for borrowingis elusive is that in the end the funds rate would turn out to bedifferent than we expected. We force the borrowing on them but thenthe funds rate might be different from what we expected, if we startfrom that point of view.MR. FORD. I guess, Paul, I have the bias of someone who hasbeen involved in it on the other side. That is, as I understand mymicro-economics, it says that the inducement to a profit-making bankto come to the window is higher the greater the spread. All I'masking is---16-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Exactly. When you look at it from thestandpoint of an individual bank, that's the way it looks. But how isthe total amount of borrowing determined? It's determined by thedifference between the reserve requirement and the amount ofnonborrowed reserves. And when all the individual banks [in some]form or guise come in to borrow and when they've borrowed enough tomeet the total reserve requirement, they stop borrowing. It looks asif it's your individual [bank's] decision, but it is not. It's oursin the aggregate.MR. PARTEE. Well, that's a static analysis, Paul. I agreewith you; it's absolutely true arithmetically. But I think whathappens is that you set into process dynamics that in fact [produce]required reserves that can do that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You do that by the fluctuations in marketrates, which are affected by the discount rate. The discount ratewill affect the level of market rates but not the spread, and thatwill set in motion the dynamics.MR. PARTEE. But my point is that if in period 2 we raise thediscount rate in order to try to close the spread, we can get a higherfunds rate pretty [quickly]. A higher funds rate will bring about--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And that would bring the money supplydown, so it brings down the--MR. PARTEE. And then you'll have a narrowing in the spread,you see, in subsequent periods.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But it's the banks individually, ofcourse, that decide how much excess reserves they want to keep.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that varies.MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, maybe I should try to be clearer.Where the demand for borrowing--the lack of knowledge of it--gets usin trouble is this: We believe, as the Chairman said, that it's therise or decline of interest rates that sets in motion forces that getyou back on your money supply path. And the theory of all this wasthat as required reserves strengthened, borrowing would have to go upbecause Mr. Sternlight isn't going to provide those additionalreserves; and with the rise in borrowing, the funds rate and [other]interest rates would have to go up, setting in motion these forces.And what throws us off sometimes is that on occasion the borrowingwill go up but interest rates won't. On occasion there's not thatkind of consistency and we get delayed; and then what further throwsus off is that the borrowing might go up and the interest rates mightgo up but not enough and we really ought to be lowering thenonborrowed path and forcing more current rate fluctuation. That'swhat we tend to mean when we say the demand for borrowing is aproblem. Sometimes banks are more willing to borrow than at othertimes and we don't get the kind of rate response we think woulddevelop in [these circumstances].MR. FORD. The bottom line of what I'm trying to get at isthis: On the basis of your research, if we did two things that havealready been discussed--one is to get to contemporaneous reserve-17-2/2-3/81accounting and second is to make the window more directly related tomarket rates--rather than the lags that we now have, would theprocedure otherwise be improved overall or not? Do we gain nothing bydoing that?MR. AXILROD. The evidence that Dave Lindsey has developedwould say that contemporaneous reserve accounting would clearlyimprove the multiplier between total reserves and money in the shortrun. I think that would clearly happen. It would mean that in thevery short run, like a week, we wouldn't be able to predict requiredreserves very well, so the funds rate might vary a bit more for anygiven nonborrowed target. So, it would have that "cost," if that's acost. But, on your other question, I was unable to convince myself--maybe others have convinced themselves and if they have, then theyshould speak up--that tying the discount rate [to market rates] wouldmake [the relationship] between reserves and money a lot morepredictable. Even if we had a penalty rate, if money got created thisweek like mad--and it might--then because Mr. Sternlight is holdingback on nonborrowed reserves, market rates would jump well above thepenalty rate. So we'd get a sharp rise in market rates and then ofcourse we'd have to reset the penalty rate above that; and unless themoney supply responded very promptly that week, we'd get anotherratcheting up of rates and that sharp rise in rates might cause themoney supply to drop rather substantially. And we'd end up chasingour tail a bit, particularly if [money] were to drop substantially[and] randomly in any event. So, I can't believe that tying thediscount rate [to market rates] would give us more predictableborrowing; but it would, I think, more predictably and probably morecertainly, force rates up faster or force them down faster. And [somemay] consider it [desirable] to have that advantage; but that's aboutthe only advantage I could come up with.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. Steve, or Dave, or whoever, on this businessabout random monthly or weekly movements of money: Is there anythingin your work that sheds light on the question of how you know when itstops being random? My casual observation here--I hear your plusesand minuses--is that it always seems that once the thing starts to go,it cumulates [in one direction]. It isn't a plus and minusrelationship.MR. AXILROD. All we could come up with is that as the timelengthens, it gets less and less random. We, too, have observed thatthe revisions seem to be consistently up or consistently down overintervals of a month or so. And we have not yet shaken the resourcesloose to finish the project of examining the sources of thoserevisions to see if there is any bias evolving as we get into a periodwhen the revisions are moving up or moving down. But I don't thinkthat relates particularly to the material that Dave Pierce worked onbecause, after all was said and done, it still looked as if there wasa substantial amount of noise, so to speak, which includedanticipating next year's seasonals in the weekly series less than themonthly, less than the quarterly, etc.MR. CORRIGAN. So, there's nothing here that really bears onhow we know whether we should consider something random or not in theshort run?-18-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. No. If it's plus or minus $3.3 billion, two-thirds of the time it's noise in a weekly series and we show a zero;we don't know whether that zero has a +$3.3 billion of noise in itoffset by a -$3.3 billion of trend.MR. LINDSEY. It is true that over time that $3.3 billionfalls. For a month, for example, the random noise in the change is$2.0 billion. So, as time progresses, the range of uncertainty aboutwhether it's random or not narrows.MR. MAYO. The $3.3 billion was weekly?MR. LINDSEY. That was weekly; and the $2.0 billion was for amonthly change.MR. BALLES. Steve, are the X-11 program and other seasonalprograms still showing about a 3-month span of time in which tosuppress these random movements so that trend shows through? That wasmy recollection, but I haven't looked at that in a long time.Mr. AXILROD. They keep perfecting those programs, PresidentBalles, and I'm not sure what that is.MS. TEETERS. Well, my impression is similar to Jerry's,because we did have these long strings of upward revisions and thenlong strings of downward revisions. I thought you implied, Steve,that the fact that we get a long string of upward revisions ordownward revisions comes from external factors. Is it possible thatthese errors in the money supply are leading indicators of economicactivity? In other words, if they are all going up, we may be seeinga sharper rise, say, in the goods sector than we had anticipated--or[conversely], a sharper fall. Is that possible?MR. AXILROD. Well, that was one feeling we had when we wereliving through it, in periods such as April and then in the summer.We had that feeling [in April] when the economy was weaker thanexpected and the revisions in the money supply between the preliminaryand the first published [number and] between the first published andthe second published [number] were showing a weakening in the moneysupply. And we had that feeling in the summer when the economy wasturning out stronger than expected that those revisions were [all]going the same way. That sounds as if there's a ghost operating twomachines--the economy and the money supply. There's not much reason,if the data we get are coming through in some sort of "unbiased" way,for those things to happen that way. I don't have any response otherthan to say that we are trying to see if that was really true and whatthe sources were. The only thing we could think of offhand was thatsome of the original data, particularly the preliminary data that wedon't publish, have a good deal of estimating in them. And if we arein a period when the money supply is dropping sharply, the estimators--either at the Reserve Banks or the [commercial] banks--put in lastweek's figure, but they should have been lowering last week's figure;so, we get that more systematic kind of bias. I don't have theevidence yet to say whether that was indeed what was happening. [Wedon't know] whether we have a coincidence or whether our instincts ofwhat was happening were not right.-19-2/2-3/81MS. TEETERS. I have a second question. The studiesdistinctly show that fluctuations in the short-term rate gottransmitted much more thoroughly to the other rates in the [financial]system, long rates as well as short rates. Did we find any evidencethat the increased fluctuations of the longer rates were interferingwith or changing investment patterns?MR. AXILROD. Well, I think the answer to that is probably"no," because of the length of lags in our big model between long-termrates and investment plans. We didn't see evidence in 1980--this iswhat I am remembering from the paper that Ed McKelvy and Larry Slifmandid--that there was much of a response in investments to the kind ofinterest rate fluctuations we were getting. Moreover, we couldn'tfind evidence that long-term rates were made higher in some sense thanthey otherwise would have been because of the uncertainties created bythe operating procedure. That is, we couldn't find much evidence thata liquidity premium was developing which would have lowered shortrates from what they otherwise would have been and raised long ratesfrom what they otherwise would have been. The latter, of course,would be a damper on investment but with some lag. So, in general, wewere not really able to investigate, except through models orjudgmentally looking at the economy, the possibility of some impact ofgreater week-to-week fluctuations in interest rates, short and long,on business planning. That's an area we just--MS. TEETERS. You are dealing with a model that was built onmuch lower variability in long-term rates, so that sort of constrainedyour conclusions.MR. AXILROD. Exactly. One could not say that there was noimpact of this kind of interest rate variability on business planning.It was rather difficult for us to detect it or to find out how tomeasure it, really.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.MR. RICE. During the period of the study, it appeared thatthe broader the monetary aggregate targeted, the less variability fromthese targets. I think that's true. Was there anything in the studythat would suggest that that would always be true--that there would beless variability in, say, M2 than in M-1A or M-1B?MR. AXILROD. My memory, looking at it another way, is thatthe monthly multiplier errors, at least in the models, were bigger onM2 than they were on M-1B but that our judgmental miss--judgmentalmeaning how we actually ran things--was less on M2 percentage-wisethan on M-1B in terms of the growth rates. I'm not sure whether Ihave answered your question exactly.MR. RICE. Well, I think that M2 deviated less from itstarget range than did M-1A and M-1B from their target ranges.MR. AXILROD. Yes, exactly. That's right.MR. RICE. That was the question I was raising--whether therewas anything in the studies that suggested that would go on in thefuture.-20-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. No, only if the past is any guide to thefuture. And on that I would say that in the future M2 gradually willhave less and less assets in it that are subject to reserverequirements because [such requirements] are being phased out atmember banks. Savings and small time deposits at member banks will nolonger be subject to reserve requirements and certainly are not now atthrift institutions and nonmember banks. So, whether that willpertain in the future or not, I'm really not certain. Nor do I knowif it would pertain if we really aimed at M2. We were aiming at M-1Bhere or at M-1A; we weren't really aiming at M2.MR. SCHULTZ. Isn't it true that there are certaincountercyclical elements in the broader aggregates because of theircomposition? That is, if the economy begins to slow down, isn't therea tendency for people to put more money into some of the assets thatare in the broader aggregates rather than in the narrow aggregates?Is there not a countercyclical movement in the broader aggregates?So, would it not basically be true that what Governor Rice has said isaccurate because of the composition of the broader aggregates?MR. AXILROD. I thought Governor Rice was raising thequestion [of what would happen if] we were aiming at the target, whichis different from what would happen to these [aggregates] over thecycle. It's quite possible, though I just don't remember. We didn'tlook at that in detail. But M2 might have a little less volatilityover the cycle than M1; one would think that would be the case becauseit has higher interest elasticity of demand and M1 is much moresensitive to income.MR. PARTEE. [Unintelligible] savings accounts.MR. SCHULTZ. Yes, I think John Paulus just did something onthat [suggesting] that the narrower aggregates were better to look atthan the broader ones because of this countercyclical effect of thebroader aggregates.MR. MORRIS. Yes, but he ignored the fact that thestatistical relationship between the broader aggregates and nominalGNP is much closer than the relationship between the narroweraggregates [and GNP]. It seems to me--MR. AXILROD. That depends on whose model and what timeperiod.MR. MORRIS. I don't think that's true. If you were to take,say, the pre-1970 data and estimate GNP in the past 10 years, there isno question that the broader the aggregate, the better estimate youwould have made, no matter what kind of model you were using.MR. AXILROD. Well, I don't want to quarrel with yourconclusion in particular. What I have been exposed to shows--and mymemory may be wrong--that you can come to virtually any conclusion youwant, with virtually any aggregate, in large part depending on how youdo it, but probably based on the premise that everything tends to goup and down with GNP. There are big differences; the broader theaggregate, the more it tends to go up and down with GNP. Sometimesyou can even find that total credit goes very well with GNP but thereis a cause and effect problem there. The world turns out very-21-2/2-3/81differently depending on what determinants you control. In this studyit was shown that the monetary base goes very well with money. Thathappened to be because we were controlling the federal funds rate.They went up and down together. If we turned the world upside downand tried to control the monetary base, it didn't look to us from thatexperiment that it went very well with money because one would be in adifferent kind of world. So, without trying to contradict youdirectly, I'd view all that with considerable caution.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.MR. RICE. Well, I have a second question.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Rice.MR. RICE. Was there anything in the study that would suggestwhat the most appropriate [width of the] target ranges would be?Would the most appropriate range be, say, 2 or 2-1/2 or 3 percentagepoints?MR. AXILROD. No, there was not.MR. BOEHNE. I'd like to switch away from the financial sideto the real sector side. I was somewhat surprised that you didn'tlend much credence to the view that these fluctuating interest rateshad some kind of destabilizing feedback effect on the real sector,especially since interest rates other than the federal funds rate didseem to go up with the same amount of volatility. That's rather acasual analysis, [based] especially on talking to people inconstruction and to some extent in autos and some other durable goods[industries] where inventory was important. I had a very definiteimpression that these fluctuating interest rates did have an impact oneconomic activity in their areas. I was wondering if your analysiswas largely econometric or if you attempted to gather any informationfrom the people who are actually in these industries.MR. AXILROD. Well, we had a very difficult time, as youmight guess, trying to distinguish between interest rate fluctuationsthat were a result of our procedures week-to-week or month-to-monthand interest rate fluctuations that reflected what was going on in theeconomy, given the System's money supply targets. As we went into theyear, most people would have expected that if interest rates rose, wewould have had a sharp drop. For a while we fiddled with the idea ofdeveloping what economists, taking the words of philosophers, havebegun to call counter-factual worlds, and pretending that we knew whatthe Committee would have done if they were on the old procedures.After two or three what I thought were abortive attempts at that, Ithought the safest thing--in fact I might say the only intelligentthing to do--was not to do that, because who knows what the Committeereally would have done in this very unique period. So, we didn't tryto construct the world based on the funds rate moving only a quarterof a point or a half point. We in no way meant to say that housingwasn't affected by the rise in rates that occurred or wasn't aided bythe decline in rates that occurred. But it looked as if the declinein rates that occurred in the second quarter was not out of keepingwith the weakness in the economy in that quarter, so that we normallywould have gotten that [decline] no matter what procedure theCommittee was [following]. The question was how fast. However, we-22-2/2-3/81could not ignore the fact that there was a credit control program thatwent off in that period. It looked as if the sharp drop in GNP wasalso caused by the credit control program [and that to an] extent therebound in the third quarter was affected by the phasing out of theprogram. So we were driven to a rather weak conclusion that theprocedures themselves may have hastened the rise in interest rates andhastened the decline in rates and, therefore, induced the drop alittle earlier and moderated the decline. That was our weakconclusion because we really expected that under any controlprocedure, given those money targets, we would have had that cycledeveloping. Maybe that isn't stated as clearly as it might be, butthat's the basis for saying that the procedures as such might have hadwhat looked like other minor effects. We didn't think that monetarypolicy did.MR. BOEHNE. Thank you.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Steve, you made the point a while ago that underthe existing institutional set-up the main thing--or maybe even theonly thing--that brings the money supply back to target, if itdeviates, is a change in interest rates. If I understand the way youview this, my guess is that you would think about that mainly as theeffect of interest rates on the level of money demanded. Do you alsothink that the changes in the level of interest rates have anysignificant effect on the supply function of money by affecting banksand other financial institutions' attitudes with regard to how muchmoney they create?MR. AXILROD. Oh, sure. It can get you into all sorts ofmultiplier problems because of the mix of deposits, if there is anyresponse of bank excess reserves--we don't think there is much--andalso questions about the demand for borrowing if you are on anonborrowed target. So, I do think that interest rates react both tothe demand for money and the supply of money functions. The inabilityof our monthly money market model, for example, to examine and toallow for variations in the supply function are what throws it veryfar off. Its ability to predict interest rates that might emerge frommoney demand/money supply interactions is, on the other hand, whatgave it a little better track record than we had judgmentally lastyear. Judgmentally last year, in some sense, we didn't have it right;we weren't able to say interest rates would go up fast enough or downfast enough. Therefore, in determining the path, we were unable toset borrowings high enough or low enough to begin with and, if webegan to get off, we didn't make adjustments fast enough. But I dobelieve it would have an effect on the supply function.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. First of all, Mr. Chairman, I would like to saythat this whole study was quite impressive--it produced some veryuseful results--especially given the time constraints that the staffhad to wrestle with, not to mention all the exogenous shocks [to] theeconomy as the year went on that they had to try to sort out. Myquestion at this point, Steve, is with respect to what I consider oneof two parts of your summary memo. You point out various options thatthe Committee might adopt if it wanted closer control over money. You-23-2/2-3/81mentioned adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path more quickly, usingthe discount rate more actively, and this rather extreme proposal withrespect to the discount window--either to close it down altogether oropen it altogether. The latter option is pretty far out, so I'd liketo concentrate on the first two. I'd ask you in your judgment whichone would be the more promising, since you have been so much involvedin having to construct these paths. That is, do you think it would bemore feasible to adjust the nonborrowed reserve path more quickly andby greater amounts, or would you recommend that we do what we thoughtwe were going to do in October of '79, which is to adjust the discountrate more actively?MR. AXILROD. Well, as a matter of tactics, I would be moreinclined to start with adjusting the nonborrowed path because you canundo that more easily if it turns out, as it may, that you've made awrong adjustment and want to undo it. When you are really rather morecertain that you want to force interest rates up or down faster thanthey are going, then it strikes me, again, as a matter of tactics thatit's "better" in some sense to use the discount rate because it is amore forthright, clear announcement to the market. But in periodswhen you are a little more uncertain, which will probably be a largeproportion of the periods, then it seems to me that adjusting thenonborrowed path, pretending you are more on total reserves, is areasonable approach for putting pressure on market rates that you maywant to undo later if it turned out to have been a wrong thing to do.MR. BALLES. Well, if I could pursue it just one more step:As you reflect on our experience since October '79, if one had theopportunity to do things all over again, so to speak, and do themdifferently, would you recommend with this benefit of hindsight thatwe might have used the discount rate more actively? Or are yourelatively satisfied with how things came out?MR. AXILROD. Well, that's a difficult question--MR. BALLES. I know.MR. AXILROD. --to respond to, President Balles, because withhindsight I might not have adopted the paths the Committee adopted.MR. BALLES. Okay, I withdraw the question.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. Well, the principal tool the Manager has to dealwith an overshoot or an undershoot of total reserves is his ability toadjust the nonborrowed path. Last summer and early fall when I raisedquestions on this issue, you apparently had found a rule of thumb thatyou would adjust the nonborrowed path by half of the deviation oftotal reserves from the path on the grounds, I assume, that it was notclear whether this [deviation] was evidence that the economy wasstronger or whether we had an increase in demand for money. So, yousplit the difference. Has the study developed some guidelines thatwould lead you to change that behavior in the future, or do you stillthink that splitting the difference is about the best we can do?MR. AXILROD. Well, we've always known from work we had donebefore with the model, and this is specifically in this study, that if-24-2/2-3/81you put yourself in a contemporaneous reserve accounting world--if youhad forgotten, it's almost impossible with lagged reserve accounting--if you were really aiming for total reserves and total reserves wererunning, say, $200 million stronger [than desired], it's notsufficient to lower nonborrowed reserves by $200 million becauseborrowing would go up. You'd have to lower nonborrowed reserves by$400 or $500 or $600 million so that the increase in borrowing isless; so if borrowing then goes up $400 million, you've got your $200million effect on total reserves. You have to do a lot more in sometechnical sense than you were suggesting that we were doing at timeslast year. All our study suggested to me was that if we want moreshort-run control, we ought to do more of whatever we were doing lastyear. Now, that doesn't say how much more. Other evidence wouldsuggest one heck of a lot more to hit that total reserve target. Ofcourse, our other evidence was that you shouldn't bother hitting thattotal reserve target because it's going to give you more disturbinginterest rate variations than are worth whatever good you do for theeconomy.MR. ROOS. But reacting more quickly in adjusting the reservepath does not eliminate the desirability, possibly, that while you aredoing that you may at the same time want to have the discount ratemove more closely [with the market] or more frequently. They are notmutually exclusive, are they?MR. AXILROD. Oh, no.MR. STERNLIGHT. They're reinforcing.MR. AXILROD. That's right; they are reinforcing.MR. ROOS. So, we could think of [using] both.MR. STERNLIGHT. But that might give you more of an impactthan you want. Both of those could work in the direction of more ratevolatility, and that is something to be weighed along with that.MR. ROOS. That's what you give up--control over ratevolatility.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Winn.MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join John incomplimenting the staff for what I thought were the right proceduresof really looking at what we have done and trying to learn somelessons from it. One of the technical developments last fall,particularly, was the development of excess reserves. Did we reallyever focus on what happened on that to throw us off in terms of--MR. AXILROD. Well, it is widespread throughout the memberbanking system. Very little of it, of course--the way we counted it,it couldn't be very much--is for nonmember banks. It seems to havedeveloped in the first week of November just before they actually hadto hold reserves under the new procedures; and it has been sustainedand actually was rising on a monthly average basis through January.So, in terms of correlations, it relates to the new Monetary ControlAct. Why it just didn't disappear after four or five weeks, we don't-25-2/2-3/81have an answer for because we can't locate it at any particular set ofbanks; it is pretty generally dispersed.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suspect that the Federal Reserve BankPresidents may be in a better position to answer that question thanMr. Axilrod.MR. WINN. Well, I tried with our banks, and some of themthat suddenly have acquired branches or tried to consolidate theirholding company operations really got fouled up in their calculations.But we didn't find a heck of a lot in our District; I've tried that.And many of them who denied that they held any excess reserves, whenthey really got into their figures found that they had them. So,sometimes it's a matter of their not knowing what they're saying.MR. AXILROD. I really think it's the switchover to the newaccounting that is somehow screwing up their own internal bookkeepingprocedures.MR. BLACK. I think that probably is a lot of it.MR. PARTEE. And that will wear down over time.MR. AXILROD. Yes, but it should have worn down by now.MR. PARTEE. Well, we haven't been on it that long.MR. BOEHNE. Some of our banks are getting into theelectronic funds disbursements--the Max or George or whatever--andfind that they have to have a lot more cash to handle that, so theyend up with excess reserves. They are still trying to adjust theirinventories of cash and figure out how much they really need; that's afactor in our area.MR. BLACK. Yes, but they know that when they go into thereserve period because that's lagged.MR. BOEHNE. They know that except that they have peopledealing with new reduced reserve requirements and a new regime. Thereare also different cash needs out there in their branching systemsbecause of [these ATMs]. I think the uncertainty just makes them morecautious; that's what we find.MR. BLACK. Well, rate volatility could be involved, too.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.MR. WINN. Paul, could I ask one more question? If we lookedat our cyclical experience in the past where the fluctuations werewider than we would have liked, do you think we could have usedvarious types of smoothing techniques, such as subsidiary targets--whether you used credit or nonborrowed reserves or any of thosethings? Of course, our experience is very short lived. But you doget some smoothing effect from that. On the other hand, that's a[unintelligible], and other problems could arise.MR. AXILROD. Well, I'm not sure exactly what you mean bysmoothing techniques, President Winn.-26-2/2-3/81MR. WINN. To try to eliminate the fluctuations. In additionto using the procedures we had, if we had had a subsidiary target withrespect to nonborrowed reserves or credit or any of those things tomodify considerably your intervention points--MR. AXILROD. Well, after the fact, we did try to see whatwould have happened to GNP if we held the money supply path constant--that is, if one wanted to eliminate the M1 fluctuation. In that workwe did that partly through the quarterly model. But an implication ofthe work Mr. Tinsley did on the monthly money market models was thatwe would have had a lot more federal funds rate fluctuation. So, weconcluded that there was no way, given what was going on in theeconomy, that we could have smoothed the money supply withoutdesmoothing--if that's a word--the federal funds rate. If you wantedto smooth the federal funds rate, it wasn't absolutely clear that onaverage you would have gotten more [money] supply fluctuations. Therewas probably a little more, but that didn't show up as strikingly.MR. WINN. You get different intervention points.MR. AXILROD. Well, yes. If you wanted to smooth the fundsrate, you would have had rather different intervention points. Youwould have had a different funds rate limit.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.MR. GRAMLEY. First, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to add mycompliments to those of Presidents Balles and Winn on the quality ofthis staff study. I think it is excellent--perhaps the best that Ihave seen in 25 years of association with the Federal Reserve.MR. SCHULTZ. My goodness! Better than under previousresearch directors?MR. GRAMLEY. A very good study indeed.MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't know!MR. AXILROD. Better than the preceding housing study?MR. PARTEE. That was a good study; nobody ever did anythingwith it.MR. GRAMLEY. I have two questions. First, back in the dayswhen policy was run with the federal funds target, staff studies hereat the Board indicated that if we switched from a fed funds target toa reserves target, there wasn't really any reason for thinking that wewould improve our precision of monetary control. There wasn'tanything in the law of economics on how financial markets operate andhow financial institutions operate that would improve the precision ofmonetary control by going to a reserve target. And I take it fromthis staff study that that conclusion still holds.MR. AXILROD. In the work that Dave did, using the models, wegot about as good a result with the funds target as we did with thenonborrowed reserves target in terms of short-run precision. However,if you assume structural changes in reserve requirements that wouldeliminate multiplier problems, I think we would get better results-27-2/2-3/81either with [nonborrowed or] total reserves on the Board's monthlymodel than we do with the funds rate just because of the eliminationof that multiplier problem. But, in general, we get roughly the sameresult with the funds rate as with nonborrowed reserves.MR. GRAMLEY. Second, I recognize that it certainly wouldhave been difficult, perhaps even impossible, to ascertain whether ornot these short-run fluctuations--week-to-week and month-to-month--inlong-term rates such as mortgage rates and so on affected adverselythe volume of investment. That empirically would have been hard topin down. But there isn't any real doubt as to the direction ofinfluence, I would think. Wouldn't you expect that to increase thecost of doing business? It would increase the riskiness of investmentand, therefore, would tend to have a negative effect.MR. AXILROD. Well, we certainly would have agreed with thatif we could have found convincing evidence that long rates were onaverage higher because of fluctuations induced in short rates--thatis, if the yield curve involved a wider spread of long rates relativeto short rates. Of course, the yield curve was downward sloping muchof the time, so in that sense the spread was narrower, and we couldn'treally find much evidence of that. So, that led us to think that theprocedure itself is not a factor making long rates higher than theywould otherwise be. There were the fluctuations, and we can't answerthe question on that. Monetary policy, of course, in the sense thatthe money targets did give that constraint [unintelligible], and thatisn't exactly what we were investigating. I would agree, of course,that the money target was relatively low, so that did give us highershort and long rates and the constraints from that. But my memory isthat we didn't find evidence that the fluctuations endemic to theprocedures were making for higher long rates relative to short rates.MR. GRAMLEY. That's not my point. My point is that at agiven level of long-term interest rates, rates are fluctuating more;so an investor cannot know what his cost will be at the time he'sgoing to finance, and that will tend to have an adverse affect. Idon't know how big, but it can't be helpful.MR. AXILROD. We did not find a way, really, of investigatingthat. I don't think there's evidence for or against that proposition.I would say the evidence does suggest that transactions costs havegone up. So, in some sense, if you go to that point, a new issue isslightly more expensive even though the whole yield curve may not showit. We did find that bid/ask spreads were higher; I don't know who isbearing that [cost] ultimately, whether it's the borrower or thelender. But there was evidence that transactions costs went up.MR. STERNLIGHT. If I could add a little to that: I don'tthink I could provide any evidence about what happened to the volumeof investment, but there were truly adaptations in the market becauseof the fluctuations in rates in terms of more variable-rate contractsor floating-rate contracts. Also, there was some tendency bycorporations, municipalities, and so on to have shorter-termborrowings.MR. PARTEE. We had a lot more hedging, too, didn't we,Peter? Didn't we see an increase in the participation in the futuresmarkets by dealers over the last year and a half?-28-2/2-3/81MR. STERNLIGHT. Very much so. How much of that was becauseof the greater rate volatility or how much was a trend in thosefutures markets because they were just recently developing would bevery hard to untangle.MR. AXILROD. Well, in the housing market there would seem tobe evidence--again it was a continuation of a past trend--of [lenders]trying to put all the risk on the borrower, which tends in effect toraise rates. When rates go down, they don't want to incur the biggercost of getting out of that higher rate commitment, so they try to[lend] at the higher rate, and that sort of thing. But whether thathad to do with our procedure or was just a response to the cyclicalvolatility of rates and the greater rate of inflation expected and thefears that that induced is somewhat open to question.MR. PARTEE. I think the rate swings--it was such a big[interest rate] cycle--must have had quite an influence on behavior inreal markets.MR. SCHULTZ. Continuing on this question just a bit more:In the Bluebook I noticed that you assumed that if short-term rateswere at current levels a year from now, the mortgage rate would behigher. Why is that? That was the one thing in that family ofinterest rates that seemed rather interesting to me. All the otherrates you assumed would be at about the same level but the mortgagerate was higher.MR. AXILROD. It's a bit higher; we assumed essentially thatthe demand for mortgages is still pretty strong given the structure ofthe--MR. SCHULTZ. I see. You just repressed demand during theperiod and it's going to get stronger and stronger. Okay.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a very short comment, Mr. Black?MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I was just going to say that thepeople with whom I have talked would bear out what Governor Gramleysuspects: That these fluctuating rates made it very difficult forthem to plan. But I think the key issue, if we are successful in thisexperiment we began back on October 6, 1979, is whether over thelonger run we really would have more fluctuation in long-term rates.My feeling is very definitely that we would have less. But I do thinkunquestionably that [the greater fluctuation] has affected businessplanning. Those are my comments.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a short comment, Mr. Balles?MR. BALLES. Two minutes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 90 seconds.MR. BALLES. Maybe I'd better keep it for after coffee.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are not going to have any coffee.MR. BALLES. I'll try to do it in 90 seconds. It seems to bea tough day here! Some of you have coffee.-29-2/2-3/81MR. SCHULTZ. All animals are equal, but pigs are more equalthan others!MR. BLACK. Some people plan ahead.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What we intend to do is break for lunch atabout one o'clock and there will be some food here for the Committeemembers and the staff.MR. BALLES. In Steve's summary of the key findings of thisstudy, one of the points he made was that should the Committee desirecloser monetary control than we had, let's say, in 1980, one of theprices that will have to be paid for that is greater interest ratevolatility. We've been doing some work, which if it continues to holdup under the test of actual experience, would offer a more hopefuloutcome. Dave Lindsey referred to the San Francisco money marketmodel; during the lunch break I'll distribute a short 4-page memo thatsummarizes some of its key findings. I'll just give a thumbnailsketch of it here. Our model in effect provides some evidence that wewould not get as much interest rate volatility as conventional moneydemand models would indicate if we were to aim at closer monetarycontrol. The reason, of course, is that the conventional models allhave money demand as being quite interest inelastic and demand forbank reserves the same way. Hence, we have to move interest ratesover a wide [range] in order to get some results. What we have doneis to plug in the behavior of banks into this model, and bank demandfor reserves is based on their own profit-maximizing actions. Inseeking to finance their loans in the least costly way they willadjust offering rates on managed liabilities; in their dealings withthe public in doing this, transaction deposits are affected. Thebottom line is that we find that the demand for money and also thedemand for bank reserves is more interest elastic than theconventional models would show.MR. PARTEE. Inelastic did you say?MR. BALLES. More interest elastic.MR. PARTEE. Elastic, yes.MR. BALLES. The proof of the pudding, of course, is in theeating. And it did happen that in 1980 this money market modelincorporating the behavior of banks gave a much better fit inpredicting both M-1A and M-1B. The word of warning, of course, is onealready given by Steve earlier: That models work in some years anddon't work in others. So, it remains to be seen whether the favorableresults we got in 1980 will hold up in 1981 and beyond. Secondly, ourfindings indicate that this special credit control program of 1980 andall the stern talk of Vice Chairman Schultz that went along with it--and maybe because of that stern talk--did have quite an impact on thebehavior of bank loans. And, in turn, that goes a long way inexplaining these volatile movements of the aggregates.Well, I think the two most important implications of ourstaff study are: (1) that closer monetary control, if we are right,would lead to noticeably less interest rate volatility than implied byconventional models; and (2) that many deviations of the monetaryaggregates from target, which are usually attributed to a shift in the-30-2/2-3/81money demand function instead can be caused by money supply shocksinduced by such factors as volatility in bank loans. The firstconclusion suggests that we shouldn't let concerns about unacceptablylarge interest rate variability prevent us from responding perhapsmore aggressively than we did in 1980 to deviations of the aggregatesfrom target. And the second point suggests that we should be lesswilling to accommodate such deviations because they often reflectmoney supply shocks and not always money demand shifts. But, as Isay, we'll distribute this at lunch time so you can read it and studyit. I hope you will find it worth taking a look at.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we ought to turn to the policyissues. There are a lot of issues that can't be covered in a study ofthis sort. Mr. Gramley points out that we get just as good control,according to all these studies, by manipulating the federal fundsrate. The operative question may be whether we are willing tomanipulate the federal funds rate in that way. I think the mainreason we went to another technique is that we probably are not. Theother point I would observe is the one that Mr. Balles was justtalking about. I don't know about his model, but there seems to be alot of evidence that there's a pretty good tradeoff here betweeninterest rates and stability in the money supply. Now, GovernorWallich has often made the point that 999 out of 1,000 people--ormaybe 999,000 out of a million--are looking at interest rates and notdeviations in the money supply when they are concerned about stabilityor instability. How we approach that problem is an interesting one.Let me just ask a question to see whether we can dispose ofsome questions or not: Should we have a debate about going to adifferent control technique? I don't know how to go to total reservesor even the monetary base under the current institutional setting.But we could do it nominally, anyway. I say I don't know how we cando it in the current institutional setting because we don't controldiscount window borrowing under any of these proposals in the shortrun. That is a question to which I will return. But, can thediscussion proceed on the basis of working within the framework of animmediate nonborrowed reserve technique with an eye on total reserves,leaving the question of emphasis open? Or do we [want to discuss]going back to federal funds or take another step toward some otherkind of aggregate? Is there anybody who wants to argue the case forany of these extremes?MR. GRAMLEY. I'd like to argue the case for going back tothe federal funds target, not because I think the Committee is likelyto agree with me or go in that direction but because I think the valueof using that technique needs to be kept in mind when we ask ourselveswhat we are doing with the present technique or how we are going toimprove it. First, we have to recognize that the way we communicateour [policy actions] to economic activity today is through movementsof interest rates. Interest rates are the cutting edge of policy. Wehave eliminated almost completely the changes in credit availabilitythat were so important in years past. And I think one could arguethat it's unconscionable for the central bank not to be concernedabout the cost of credit, the cost of money, when that is what iscommunicating its effects to the real economy.Second, I would argue that increasingly over time in recentyears we have found that instability of money demand has become a-31-2/2-3/81very, very large problem in an operating technique of this kind. I'mnot at all sure that that is going to go away. It may well be acharacteristic that's endemic in a system in which there is so muchinflation that interest rates get to a point where people are movingassets from one area of the financial markets to another and wherefinancial institutions are innovating to make this possible. We mayfind that five years from now we have problems every bit as large aswe face prospectively in 1981 in trying to interpret what is happeningto the narrow money measures.Third, as I mentioned, I think under present institutionalarrangements we can operate to control the growth of money quite asprecisely with the federal funds target procedure as we can withreserve targets. Finally, I think it is important that this techniquewe adopted does indeed communicate a lot more of the variability ininterest rates in the short-term end to the long-term end. And,although we can't measure it, it does have some adverse effects oninvestment proceedings. Even if people could hedge this interest raterisk, they are going to pay to engage in this hedging transaction.Mr. Chairman, I think you are right--and this is what we need to keepin mind--that there really is only one reason why we should haveabandoned the federal funds target procedure to go to the reservetarget. And that is because if we operate on federal funds, weexplicitly take responsibility for what is happening to interest ratesand then this becomes a very, very difficult world to live in. But weneed to keep that in mind. If that's the reason we are on this newstrategy and no other, then we can go about conditioning how we applythe new strategy in ways to take advantage of the economic aspects ofoperating on a federal funds target.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me restate perhaps somewhatdifferently a couple of points you made. As to your first pointregarding our concern about interest rates, I didn't mean to eliminatethat in saying we would eliminate the question for consideration. Wecan do that with either technique. I think you mean that you areinterested in the broad movements of interest rates when you make thatpoint, and that remains a relevant consideration whatever technique weuse. And it bears upon how hard we press on nonborrowed reserves at agiven time.The money demand shift is a valid technical point. If thatindeed is a big problem, the [unintelligible] point has been made. Ido think the last point you made is a point of some concern. Theremay be something in our present technique, merely because of theuncertainty it generates about interest rates when we don't takeresponsibility for them, that makes the market react more sharply to ashort-term change in the federal funds rate, let's say, than it wouldotherwise react. Now, I don't know what that mechanism is, but onegets a little suspicious when we sit here and communicate noconviction at all about what the short-term rate should be. The long-term market jumps more strongly in either direction than it otherwisewould because market participants are trying to figure out themselveswhere [the short-term rate] is going to go, and father isn't tellingthem. That may be an important deficiency in the present technique asit is now operated. And it may be the [main one], as I see it. Well,the money demand shift is a technical argument; [the issue is] howimportant it is, I guess. Mr. Balles was just saying the opposite.-32-2/2-3/81But this last point does bother me a bit. Does anybody else want tocomment?MR. WALLICH. If the procedure has had a defect, in my mindit has been the excessive volatility of interest rates. Given thebiases that I have, I've been more concerned about the rapid decline[in rates] in the second quarter of last year than about the way theygot up to 20 percent on two occasions. And now that I hear from Mr.Axilrod that apparently the sharp drop in the second quarter didn'thave much of an economic repercussion--that the quick revival of theeconomy was largely the work of the real sector and perhaps the creditcontrol removal, not the drop in interest rates as I had thought--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. He didn't quite say that, did he?MR. AXILROD. No.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. He just said there was no special drop ininterest rates due to the new control technique.MR. PARTEE. On variability, day-to-day and week-to-week.MR. WALLICH. Well, I think the reason rates dropped sosharply clearly was due to the new techniques. And had we stuck bythe new techniques firmly and stuck on the path, rates would havedropped a good deal more.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you are making an assumption thathe didn't make. That may be true in practice, but he is saying if wehad moved the federal funds rate as much as would have been indicated,given the decline in the money supply, we would have gotten a similarresult.MR. AXILROD. Well, also more particularly, given the declinein real GNP.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, given the decline in the real GNP.MR. AXILROD. It was not out of line with what normallyhappens.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We may not in fact have done that underthe old technique; but if we had, there wouldn't have been muchdifference I think is what he said.MR. WALLICH. Okay. Well, in that case I have to say that,in my opinion, we wouldn't have moved from 20 percent to 10 percent inthat quick succession any more than we would have moved up from 12percent or so to 20 percent. So I think what we need is moreobservation of interest rates. But I'd be more concerned about suddendrops than about the increases we have had so far. Of course, wecould have increases that would worry one. But the way I look atinterest rates, as you know, is that they are not really high aftertaxes.MR. PARTEE. In real terms.-33-2/2-3/81MR. WALLICH. [Yes]. Now, as a technique improvement, Iwould say it would be worthwhile to go to a contemporaneous reserve--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's get to that later and juststay on this other more general subject.MR. WALLICH. I would say that we should not go back to theold technique of targeting on the funds rate because I've seen us notdo enough or not act on a timely enough basis in the past. Thetechnique we have now forces our hand. I would add that we might bewell advised to publish our directive immediately under the newprocedures, but I guess that's a separate topic also.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. This is partly a question, Steve, if I could.Let's say we stayed where we are now in an operating mode, recognizingthe interest rate/money supply variability tradeoff. Could we buy anymaterially greater amount of stability in interest rates if wesignificantly widened reserve carry-forwards and permitted carry-forwards of both deficiencies and excesses, maybe even up to 5 percentor something like that, and let financial institutions put a muchgreater cushion in there to absorb some of these rate effects that wemight otherwise get?MR. AXILROD. We might. I'd have to think it through morecarefully. It's sort of like opening the discount window.MR. CORRIGAN. That's right. It has the same effect.MR. AXILROD. I suppose it could buy some week-to-weekinterest rate stability at some cost in terms of the multiplier.MR. CORRIGAN. That's what is not clear to me. Is there areal cost there?MR. AXILROD. I'd have to think it through; my instinct isthat there might be. But how big I'm not sure.MR. SCHULTZ. Could it not go either way? Could it not bedestabilizing as well as stabilizing?MR. CORRIGAN. Well, my instinct is--MR. SCHULTZ. Suppose it all went in one direction in oneweek. Does it not have the same kind of effects we might--MR. CORRIGAN. Well, if we did this kind of thing, we'd haveto have it work both ways. There would have to be some kind ofpenalty; it wouldn't be a freebie.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wonder whether we can try to stay on themore general questioning and comments on the broad approach. I thinkthis comes under a modification of existing techniques. Mr. Roos.MR. ROOS. Do you mean just on whether to go back to interestrate stabilization or---34-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --or go to something else, like thereserve base or something.MR. ROOS. I think there are several fundamental things thatwe ought to consider in charting our course. First of all, it'simportant that we recognize that we have to do something that will beconvincing, not just to those of us sitting in this room but to thebroader body politic in the world in which we live. I will start froma conviction that, right or wrong, most people who have observed whathas happened since October 1979 are far from convinced that it was asmuch of a success or as satisfactory as maybe some of us would like tothink. There is a certain degree of disillusionment that we didn'tachieve as effective control of money and credit as we announced in1979 we were going to seek. Under the present political conditions weface, to try to explain away in a convincing manner whatevershortcomings last year had is almost impossible to achieve.Secondly, I think it follows that to say we will continue aswe did in 1980 but will do the job a little better, without announcingor without agreeing upon certain changes from that procedure, will beless than convincing to the people who are watching us. Politically,if you want to put it that way, and without acting irresponsibly, Ithink we have to say that we are going to make some changes. Theworld knows that we have conducted this study. The world, or at leastthose who are interested in what we are doing, is going to be anxiousto see the results of this study and what we do about it. So, I don'tthink we can get away with either trying to say that 1980 was anunqualified success or that we drew a poor card because of certainextraneous factors. And I don't think we can get away with justsaying we are going to do what we did and do it better.Ideally, Mr. Chairman, if we could press a button, I wouldsay that we should announce that we are going to move the discountrate to a penalty rate more frequently in order to avoid the problemsthat we had in that regard last year. Ideally, we should seekcontemporaneous reserve accounting. I think we should announce--andthis may require longer-run action--that we will seek greateruniformity of reserve requirements. I think we have to bite thatbullet; we have to say that we will do that in order to achievesteadier control of credit and money. I think we are going to have tosay openly that we will permit interest rates to fluctuate morefreely. We can't have it both ways. And I happen to believe that ifwe explain [what we are doing] as effectively as you did yesterday onABC--and I would compliment you, sir, because I thought you weresuperb on that program--that we have the ability to tell people whatwe are going to do. If we told people that we were going to do this,I believe we would have less volatility in interest rates than somepeople might think.Short of achieving these ideals, I think it's absolutelyessential as a bare minimum that we change our procedures and move thediscount rate more frequently to a penalty rate and also that werestore contemporaneous reserve accounting. We have people out therewho are aware of these issues. People in the Administration--theStockmans and the Sprinkels--are going to watch us like a hawk, andwe're not going to be able to bluff our way through this. I think wehave to show that we are doing something, and try something new. Itwould be a tragedy for the Federal Reserve to move back to interest-35-2/2-3/81rate stabilization, even though it might be theoretically desirable;it will not fly in the political climate in which we're living.That's my point of view, Mr. Chairman, in a nutshell.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we'll get to these more detailedsuggestions. On the general point are there any other comments?Governor Partee and Mr. Morris next.MR. PARTEE. I would stay with our present arrangement. Icome from where Lyle comes from, really. I would like to be able tocontrol the mechanism by specifying the funds rate. And I think wecould; but the trouble is we won't. We won't because we won't changethe funds rate as much as it ought to be changed. There is aninteresting piece of work done by Peter Tinsley which says in effect,if I understand it correctly, that in getting toward our targets if wechange the funds rate 3 percentage points at the beginning of theperiod, we get about as much result as changing it 6 percent over thewhole period. Well, that's fine, except who today is going to say:"We are running a little low on the aggregates so let's drop the fundsrate 3 points today." Nobody will ever say that. And that's thewhole trouble with it; we just don't move it enough. If it weren'tfor that, I would prefer the funds rate because there is a fuzzinessto this other approach in the multiplier and in the changes of thenonborrowed targets and so forth that bothers me. Of necessity wehave to put more of this onto the staff than it is good for this bodyas a policymaking body to do; and it's because of the fuzziness andthe intricacy of the arrangements we have. But I would stay with itbecause I don't think there's anything better.As I believe Steve suggested in the summary report, given ourexperience of the last year, I would opt to be freer to change thenonborrowed path in order to offset what is happening in borrowedreserves more than we have done. That's because I rather agree withLarry that people just can't quite understand why the aggregates wereso much more volatile in the year after we changed to this experimentthat was to stabilize them than they were in the year before. I thinkthat is a practical problem we have and, indeed, it probably hascontributed to some of the economic instability. I wouldn't agreewith Henry who seems to say let's keep interest rates high or withothers who say let's keep them low. I wouldn't talk about an interestrate target in a longer-run sense, because what we do then is justsubstitute our own predilection for what the market is trying to tellus. I think that in a longer-range sense we have to have [some]volatility in interest rates; they've got to go high and they've gotto go low, and they have to do it in response to changes that we seedeveloping in the economy and in the performance of the aggregates.And when we are all done with it one might say--I'm sure most peoplearound this table would say--it's too bad rates dropped that far lastsummer. But last summer we didn't know what we now know. And that'salways the difficulty. Some might say it's too bad that they havegone as high as they have now. But we don't know. Maybe it's justright that they have gone as high as they are now. So, I would saythat we should try to be objective and not substitute our judgmentalpredilections as to what the statistics are telling us.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris. Any other suggestions on thepresent technique are in the next agenda item, not this one.-36-2/2-3/81MR. MORRIS. Well, I come out about the same way Chuck didexcept that I don't have any nostalgia for going back to controllingthe federal funds rate. I sat around this table for eleven yearswatching us always moving too little and too late. And even though1980 was not a model year of any kind, it seems to me that it wasinherently a year in which any approach to monetary policy was goingto run into serious problems. If you tell me that we are going tohave a year in which we have a one-quarter recession where the economyis declining at a 10 percent real rate, I can tell you that there isjust no way we are going to avoid interest rate volatility. So, Iview the past year as a success story only because I think it was asuccess relative to what would have happened if we had stayed with theold procedure.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think conceptually we can controlthe rate of growth in the aggregates with either a federal fundshandle or with a reserve handle of some sort. However, it's not onlythe unwillingness to move the federal funds rate that makes it animpractical way of doing it, but also that we don't know how much weought to move it. The federal funds rate that is compatible with somereasonable rate of growth in the monetary aggregates somehow definedis not a single level; it's a pattern of rates over time. And I justdespair of ever knowing that, so I think we ought to stick with moreor less our same procedures. I would like to suggest at theappropriate time a couple of modifications that I think would improvethe procedures. The problem with the [funds rate] to me is that wedon't know how high or how low it ought to be at any time; and I knownothing in past experience, either empirically or in theory, thatwould give any basis for selecting that level.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure we know how high or how lownonborrowed reserves should be; that's the problem.MR. BLACK. Well, I'm going to take care of that in the nextexercise!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. I essentially agree with Chuck Partee on thereasons for staying with nonborrowed reserves as the operating target.In practice we simply didn't or weren't willing to move the funds ratearound. The additional comments made on that same subject by FrankMorris and Bob Black I find myself in agreement with, too.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Anybody else have any comments? Bob Mayo.MR. MAYO. I would just add briefly that I took great comfortin Steve's analysis. I think all of us agree that even 15 months is aterribly short period; nevertheless, Steve told me not that this hadbeen a great success, using Frank Morris' word, but that it was not afailure. And I think we owe it to ourselves to pursue it further withwhatever refinements we can do.MS. TEETERS. I agree in that the lesson I got from the past12 months is that we couldn't pick up judgmentally when the rateshould go up or go down. There's a distinct advantage to this and, in-37-2/2-3/81 -38-contrast to Henry, I think they should go down as well as up. But ithas to be an equally up and down elevator. I think the main pointthat comes out of a great deal of this is that we really shouldn't tryto control the money supply on a rigid growth rate basis. We shouldaim for it, but the forces in the real economy are going to swing thatmoney growth rate around and we should be prepared for it and try tointerpret the misses that we make as a reflection on our projectionsand what is going on in the real economy. To try to make money growat an absolutely steady rate in a fluctuating real economy will createsuch horrendous fluctuations in interest rates that it will defeatwhat we're doing. Also, as Lyle says, we have to keep an eye on thegeneral level. We can get rates so high that they choke off economicactivity, and that's not really what we're aiming for. So, I wouldstick with the procedure, but I would put in perhaps a morefluctuating target in terms of where we want the money supply to go inlight of what we know is going on in the real world.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If no one else has any comments, I willdeclare it the consensus that we will work in the general framework ofour existing techniques. We will now discuss modifying them. I dothink there is basically a tradeoff here, if nothing else, of thedesirability of escaping responsibility for discretely moving interestrates. A number of people have said that in ten years of experiencewe didn't move very far because we don't like to do that. But [ournew procedure] has exacted a price in terms of generating moreinstability throughout the interest rate structure, which may pass.If you want to be an optimist, you say that people will learn enoughthrough the experience, and long-term rates will no longer fluctuateso much. But they certainly fluctuated in disturbing proportion tothe fluctuation in short-term rates in the past 15 months. Now, we'veonly been through two, or not even 1-1/2, interest rate cycles, Iguess, so people haven't had much chance to learn from that. Maybe asthey get through another one or two, these reactions will be less.Let's hope so.Let me turn now to modification of the technique, which hasobviously already been touched upon in a number of comments. I'minclined to reverse [the order]. Well, let's not reverse it; they'resomewhat inter-related, I guess. Let's just discuss both together:the speed of the nonborrowed reserve adjustment--another way of sayingthe speed of the total borrowing adjustment--and the handling of thediscount window or the discount rate. The latter has already beentouched upon on a number of occasions. I think there is a differencebetween moving the discount rate more frequently and moving itautomatically. I continue to be of the belief, and I have heardnothing to dissuade me, that if we are operating on the presenttechnique and tie the discount rate to market rates--whether you callit a penalty rate or whatever you call it--we would have an explosiveshort-term situation either up or down that I find impossible even tocontemplate. The present situation is awkward and is imposed upon uspartly, but not entirely, by lagged reserve accounting. When thingsare tight we don't have a penalty rate and we can't have a penaltyrate, and it looks as if we're subsidizing the banks to some extent.If I could minimize that appearance and reality, to the extent it's areality, I'd be very pleased. I don't know how to do it. We tried tofool around with the surcharge, but those are the kinds of problems Isee. That does not mean we cannot move the discount rate more2/2-3/81frequently. But then as a matter of judgment, I think we also--and itmay be good or bad--are going to get more instability in market rates.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. One thing that hasn't been studied bythe staff--and maybe it's worth studying in answer to the specificpoint that you just made--is how to avoid as big a component ofsubsidy and the criticisms, which may mount further as we get into thethrift institutions discount window situation. It seems to me that wemight consider having a surcharge--a frequency surcharge as we do now,although the timing could change--but that the size of the surchargeshould be equal to the difference between the basic discount rate and,let's say, the average of the 3-month CD rate over the previous fourweeks. We wouldn't get as big a ratcheting effect from that and banksthat come in too frequently would have their subsidy eliminated. Ithink that might be worth some study.MR. RICE. Good point.MR. SCHULTZ. I agree. It's certainly worth study.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know how you get rid of theratcheting effect but that--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think you reduce it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it depends. You reduce it to theextent you open up the time between now and when they actually have topay the penalty. But you have a pretty high--MR. FORD. Paul, I'm not sure. You've made this point anumber of times about the mechanical connection between the way the[window] works and the rest of the procedure, but given thecomplexities of the dynamics that Chuck was hinting at, I'm not sureit's that simple. It could blow up in our face; I'm not saying Iswear I know that it wouldn't--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it wouldn't blow up indefinitely.If you get rates high enough so that the money supply adjustment isforced, it then goes down the other way.MR. PARTEE. Yes, you overshoot; that's the trouble.MR. FORD. Well, whether or not you do, that's why I'minterested in what Mr. Balles was suggesting: That more and morepeople are saying that this is not so automatically volatile; thatthere is some kind of damping mechanism that may come into play tosave us. Granted, it's a policy risk to test it, given theuncertainty of the theoretical dynamics of it. On the side of arguingfor trying it, a couple of things have popped up that really bother meabout the way we operate the discount window. One is the subsidy. Ithas been mentioned that it's perceived that we are giving away moneyto the banks. Another thing about it is the difference between theway we operate our window and the [way the Home Loan Banks lend tothe] thrifts. We're all aware that Congressman St Germain isconducting a hearing the thrust of which, as I read it, is to say:"Hey, let's allow the thrifts to come in and borrow and forget aboutthis [problem of] exhausting their other [sources of funds]." In thatconnection, we've been looking at how they operate at the NCUA and how-39-2/2-3/81the Home Loan Banks operate their windows. I'm sure you know thatthey operate their windows basically by offering their members avariety of loan options based on maturity, more or less keyed to theyield curve that they have to deal with when they go out to raisemoney to fund the loans. I'm not saying that that's ideal for us, butthe fact is that as we interact, if we allow the difference betweenwhat it costs to borrow at the Fed window to be vastly different than,say, at the Home Loan Bank window, sooner or later we're going to haveto face the political realities and the heat that Congressman StGermain is generating.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Look, we have all these problems; thequestion is how to avoid them.MR. FORD. Well, the obvious thrust is to move toward theirsystem of going more toward--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They're not creating reserves when theyare lending. We just agreed to stay on this technique and I'massuming the current institutional setting involving a reluctance toborrow at the discount window [is not changed]. [As for] forcing thebanks in the aggregate to borrow, I'm just telling you the opposite ofwhat you tell me. A bank is not going to borrow [from the window]unless the market rate is above the discount rate. So, when we forcethe banking system as a whole to borrow, we can't keep the market ratebelow the discount rate because they won't individually borrow to comeup to the total we're forcing them to borrow. It's just as nightfollows day in the short run with this technique, and we can't escapeit. Now, we can change other institutional settings, but there's nouse sitting here saying we're going to force the banks to borrow andwe're going to move the discount rate above the market rate. Ifanything isn't possible, that's it.MR. FORD. No, it has to be accompanied by modifications ofthis technique that we use here; you're right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now, you can go to the other extreme andsay we don't care about banks borrowing. We just open up the discountwindow to anybody who borrows and then the discount rate will become aceiling. And we can have a penalty rate and all the rest; but we'vegot to make all the other consequent changes in our present technique.MR. PARTEE. It's tantamount to getting back to setting thefunds rate.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Right. Doing that has precisely the sameeconomic effect as getting back to controlling the federal funds rate.But now it is being done through the discount window instead ofthrough open market operations. That is, it's just going full circleand going back to where we started. Now, I'm stuck here because if weforce them to borrow, there's just not going to be a penalty rate. Ifthere's not a penalty rate, it looks as if we're subsidizing them.That's my [dilemma]; you tell me how to get out of that box.MR. MORRIS. I think what we have to do is go toward somerationing system. Given that we need to have the banks borrow Xamount of reserves, the second problem is: Which banks are going tobe borrowing X amount of reserves? And it seems to me a rationing-40-2/2-3/81system, which we open to the thrifts as well as the commercial banks,could be designed to feed in that level of reserves; at least we knowweek-after-week that it wouldn't be the same banks that would bedemanding that--MR. SCHULTZ. I suggested [basing] it on a capital ratio.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, in general terms, the stricter weare in lending through the window, presumably the lower the level isthat we would need to adjust the nonborrowing path to facilitate this.But if we go in that direction, we would get less borrowing. In thatsense, we would have less subsidy. But the market rate thenpresumably would be even higher depending upon what formula we userelative to the discount rate. But [the window] would be used muchless frequently; it wouldn't make much difference. That is one way wecan go.MR. CORRIGAN. Doesn't it follow from what Steve was sayingbefore that we also get that result if we take the position that we'reonly going to use the discount window for real emergencies?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's the extreme of that policy.MR. MORRIS. But that's not really a policy that we can livewith.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No.MR. GRAMLEY. The one thing to keep in mind about anysignificant change in the administration of the discount window or thearrangements by which banks and other institutions can come to borrowis that if we want more monetary control precision, we're much betteroff to stay where we are than to introduce a system that is going totake six months to a year to figure out.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There are a lot of traditions surroundingthe discount window; it has been more or less the same for decades anddecades. When you change something like that, you get a bigeducational problem in the short run. And then if we decide we don'tlike it after we change it, we've got a heck of a problem going intosomething different I think. These are the constraints that have leftus where we are now. That doesn't say we're in a perfect position,but it's very hard, I think, to change this in a fundamental way.MR. BALLES. Paul, I'd agree certainly with your conclusionthat, especially given lagged reserve requirements, there's nopractical way to get to a penalty rate. But having agreed with that,I'm not at all certain that we--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just put in as a footnote that, ofcourse, this only happens when borrowings are high. When the moneysupply is running low and borrowings are low, you'll get a penaltyrate.MR. BALLES. But having agreed with that, I'm not convinced,as yet at least, that we need to have as big a gap as we see presentlyor have seen in recent months between the discount rate and the fundsrate. Maybe, especially with the benefit of hindsight, we ought to-41-2/2-3/81dwell on whether it would have been feasible to close the gapsomewhat. I think that's a rather practical question because as welook back on 1980, in a technical sense, most of the misses on theaggregates came from overshoots or undershoots of borrowings that werenot quickly or fully offset in the nonborrowed reserve path. To someextent a more active discount rate policy of keeping at least closerin touch with the market might have headed off some of that. I raisethat as a question rather than a conclusion.MS. TEETERS. The last two times we raised the discount rate,it went right through to the market rates. It didn't close the gap atall. The moves were undertaken with the idea of trying to close thegap and the gap just moved ahead of us.MR. PARTEE. And the gap has been widest in the last eightweeks, John, when we've had shortfalls in the aggregates.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think this discussion could be seena little more systematically if we look first at what modifications[we could make] in the way we set the initial borrowing requirement,what modifications [to make] to the nonborrowed reserve path, and thensee what residual kind of change, if any, is needed in the operationof the discount window. The point you made is quite relevant. Weknow that there is a tradition here and it disconcerts people if wekeep changing things very frequently. We achieve some of the sameeffect through the first two alternatives. It would seem to me thatwe might give more weight in setting the initial borrowing requirementto what level of borrowing is needed or, in other words, what level ofnonborrowed reserve path is needed to achieve the intermediate targetand less emphasis to smoothing the post-meeting funds rate. I've beenas guilty as anybody else, or maybe more so. And if we are going totry to come closer to the path, then maybe we can't afford the luxuryof that kind of smoothing emphasis in setting the initial borrowingrequirement. I think that's worth talking about anyway.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's clearly a kind of tradeoff.But if you're suggesting going in the direction of more rapidreductions when we're overshooting in the nonborrowed path, we'regoing to get more borrowings in the very short run anyway and it'sgoing to increase the discrepancy between the market rate and thediscount rate, if that's important to you. Now, this discussionalready took place in part. We could also raise the discount ratemore rapidly; in the very short run it's probably not going to narrowthat discrepancy between the discount rate and market rates very much,but we would have taken two actions to get the money supply back oncourse more quickly at the expense of more interest rate volatilityand not done much with this appearance of subsidy. But that doesn'tend up saying it's wrong because--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I understand the implications of it.But I find myself in a very curious situation in that I happen toagree with Larry Roos that in the broader sense of the term thepolitics require some demonstration of a further improvement in theprocedure. Unfortunately, the only further improvement I can think ofis trying to track the money supply more closely even though itprobably means more interest rate volatility. I don't have the bottomline magical, mystical, faith that some people do that when we getthis money supply tracking very closely, for some reason interest rate-42-2/2-3/81volatility is going to be reduced. But even though I don't have that,I don't see any other way to go; the whole [prospect] of improvementseems to me to lie in that direction. We can't make a partialregression toward more emphasis on the fed funds rate without lookingfoolish. So, even though I don't like the bottom line, the dynamicsof the situation are taking us in that direction. Similarly, alongwith a more realistic initial borrowing requirement, I also wouldsupport the implied recommendation--maybe it's implicit enough inSteve's summary paper--that the nonborrowed reserve path be adjustedmore promptly and more sharply. Right now I don't know how to handleit. Do we leave this entirely to the discretion of Steve and Peter,checking with the Chairman? Or are there some parameters or someguidelines--it's very hard to conceive what they would be--that theFOMC would want to give to the Desk and the staff on the size of theadjustment of the nonborrowed reserve path? It seems to me that theseare the areas we ought to try to reach a consensus on first and thensee what's left.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they're very much interrelated. Andwe could do the opposite. We can do what you're suggesting in thenonborrowed reserves--[by moving] the borrowings more rapidly eitherat a meeting or between meetings depending upon what happens--withoutchanging the discount rate or even the discount window administration.That's an interesting question. Would we conceivably get more impacton the money supply per basis point of interest rate change because weput the banks into debt, which worries them and forces adjustments inbanks that may not be fully reflected in interest rate movements inthe market because of nonprice considerations?MR. BOEHNE. This idea that was brought up about the politicsof the situation requiring some improvement in procedure seems to mevery much a Catch-22 idea. I think we have created expectations thatare beyond what we can basically deliver in terms of the precision ofhitting money supply targets, given this idea that aiming for zero is[as likely to result] in +10 as -10. If we refine [our procedures]further, which I think we ought to do, then we just heighten thoseexpectations even more. It seems to me that we're always in that kindof jam. Therefore, I would not make changes because we think doing sois going to improve the political situation. Whatever refinement wemake, [what we can deliver] is still going to be far from theexpectations that have been created.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it would be a mistake to makechanges for the sake of making changes. We ought to make changes forthe sake of perhaps doing a better job. Almost any change we make maysuffer from the defect that people will read more into it than it'sreally worth. But it's a little dangerous to make a change becausesomebody wants us to make a change and then the change doesn't producethe result that's intended.MR. ROOS. Paul, I'd like to follow up on your analysis andTony's and ask Peter and Steve a question. What were the factors thatled to not adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path more quickly lastyear? In other words, was it a conscious policy that caused you notto move as quickly as you might move this year under this new point ofview or was it a concern about the effect on interest rates? And ifthe latter was the case, wouldn't you still have that concern in theback of your head starting next Monday?-43-2/2-3/81MR. STERNLIGHT. We had a rule of thumb, as Steve hasmentioned--I don't know how religiously we followed it--that we wouldmove the nonborrowed path by about half of the undershoot orovershoot. But that was conditioned at times by other factors. Whenthe Committee indicated in the adoption of its objectives that, say,the objective was 4 percent but it wouldn't mind if that were a littlefaster or a little slower because of where we were coming out vis-a-vis the annual targets at that point, that was the conditioning factorin whether we pressed for more or less adjustment.MR. ROOS. If, in order to eliminate the problems we had lastyear, this Committee made a broad request of you to move it a littlemore quickly than you did last year, what would that mean in terms ofwhat you would do starting next week?MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I'd have to work that out with mycolleague, Mr. Axilrod. In my own view, there is room for more ofthat kind of adjustment. Certainly one can look at some periods lastyear, like the August-September period, and say that we surely shouldhave moved the path more. I think one can come to a differentconclusion about last spring when the adjustments were on the otherside. Some regular upward adjustments of the nonborrowed path mighthave helped us restore [monetary] growth more rapidly, but that couldhave sent us into even stronger growth by the third quarter andperhaps would have been unwise in retrospect. So, it's not clear thaton all occasions more rapid adjustment would have been the answer.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suspect that during a good part of lastyear we were influenced by projections of the money supply, whichwe've now learned were totally unreliable. Each month during thatautumn period all the projections said it was going to level off thismonth.MR. AXILROD. Another factor to consider with respect to thespring is that we were literally stopped from raising the nonborrowedreserve path. Total reserves were weak because there was noborrowing; and if we had created a substantial amount of excessreserves, the funds rate would have gone close to zero. So, in somesense the lower limit of the funds rate range was a stopper there.The Committee, of course, gradually lowered that limit, but that wasan effective stopper. And when you're lowering the nonborrowed[path], one of the advantages of lowering it in a sense, is that oftenit will require a Committee meeting. That's because to lower [thenonborrowed path] means we're probably going to hit the upper limit ofthe funds rate range, and it might mean we'll get there faster andthat will require a Committee meeting to get beyond it.MR. ROOS. But you still had hovering in your mind a concernabout the effect on the fed funds rate, right? I thought I justunderstood that.MR. STERNLIGHT. I think we had an awareness [of that effect]but I don't think that necessarily stopped us from adjusting--MR. AXILROD. It's only a stopper in a sense when we hit theupper limits or the lower limits. Then you'd have to have a Committeemeeting.-44-2/2-3/81MR. PARTEE. May I make a comment, Paul, just on thisquestion? I agree with the idea that we need to adjust thenonborrowed [path]. It may be that it's not so much the size of theinitial adjustment that we make in response to an overshoot,particularly, or perhaps an undershoot, but rather that there ought tobe some concept of scheduling more and more adjustments as theduration [of the miss] extends. That is, you might start withadjusting the path for half [of the deviation], but then if itpersists for a second week you might take another bite out of it andin the third week you might take still another bite. It's a way toget a time factor into it. Now, we'd have to fool a lot with thenumbers to figure out what kind of decision rule we might have, butthat seems to me a possible way to go that I'd like to see explored.In any event, when we do this, the chances are that borrowing is goingto be bigger than it was before because there will be some lag timebefore the market begins to adjust; so as we do this, we'll have moreborrowings. I agree with you that we have to have a spread; and Iagree with Nancy that we've certainly seen, when conditions were tightat least, that every time we changed the discount rate the spread re-established itself by the funds rate going up as much [as the discountrate] and sometimes a little more. That does create the perception ofsubsidizing the [borrowing] institutions, and I guess there's no wayof avoiding that level of borrowing and that differential in rates.So the question really ought to be: Who ought to get the subsidy? Iguess if I were a thrift, I would say that I have never been permittedto get the subsidy; only the member banks have. My observation isthat it's the big member banks that get it and, therefore, I thinkthat leads one to some kind of rationing system that gives the publicperception of a high rate out there for somebody or other. And thatdoes make it possible to spread the subsidy around. Perhaps the priceof that will be a bigger differential than now exists because of theinefficiency of the market in having smaller institutions see theiropportunity. So, I like Tony's suggestion or some variant of Tony'ssuggestion as a way of spreading the subsidy around.MR. FORD. Isn't it the truth--as opposed to the perceptionin the market that the subsidy goes to big banks--that the subsidygoes to the little banks? It seems to me [true] by definition, withthe surcharge.MR. PARTEE. Well, take a look at January and let's find [outin] February and we'll see who has been borrowing and how many pay thesurcharge.MR. FORD. But the fact is that the size of the subsidy thebank gets depends on whether or not they pay the surcharge; and thesmaller the surcharge, the more the subsidy.MR. PARTEE. True.MR. FORD. The other element is that while this discussion isleading us toward credit rationing of some sort at the window, we'rereacting to a public perception which is technically not the truth--which is that the subsidy goes to the big banks. There is a subsidyfor all the banks but the biggest; the subsidy is for the ones under$500 million, item 1. The second thing is the way we administer thewindow. If I understand it, in doing the rationing now, which we may-45-2/2-3/81want to change as you say, in some sense liability managedinstitutions should not get in. Maybe I'm making this too strong--MR. PARTEE. That doesn't exactly work out that--MR. FORD. But you are sort of saying we should not have tobe aware of what they are doing to qualify. And we all have heard thehorror story about the guy who comes in and admits that he's managinghis liabilities, seeking to maximize his subsidy, and he's the one wethrow out. It's that kind of thing that I see as being--MR. PARTEE. Well, Bill, when I said rationing, I didn'tnecessarily mean a rate control system that would be based onadministration. I think we can ration by having a more elaborateprice schedule. The price schedule might be associated with durationand there might be more than just one surcharge. There might be rulesof the game. We could do what Fred suggests, except that would meantechnically that the institution whose surplus is dropping to zerowill pay the highest amount of borrowing so that--MR. SCHULTZ. We'd have to differentiate between emergencyand adjustment borrowing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The most effective thing we can do toaffect bank behavior is to kick them out of the discount window on anindividual basis; otherwise they just don't give a damn. They'll goon making all the loans they want to make.MR. PARTEE. But at any rate, we could have a price schedule.It doesn't have to be--MR. FORD. One thing I think I see--but I don't have anyresearch to prove it--is that the multibank holding companies seem tosend in their subsidiaries, many of which qualify for the biggestsubsidy of all, on a rotating basis. As a banker, from a profitmaximizing standpoint, that's the ideal thing to do if you're worriedabout your shareholders' interests. That's another aspect to[discount window] administration: these different games that peopleare definitely playing with us at the window. That frustrates me somuch about the present system that it leads me to question whether wedon't have to modify this procedure significantly in order to get awayfrom these games. The alternative is some form of rationing at thewindow that at least is more honest than the present one.MR. PARTEE. By the way, if they send bank A in to borrow,how do they get those reserves distributed around their holdingcompany system?MR. FORD. They can move anything they want. They can makethe loans or the deposits show up wherever they want.MR. PARTEE. So, they may do it through the loan portfolio.If they do it by interbank lending, [the Reserve Bank] is supposed totell them they have violated our rules.MR. FORD. Yes, but try to track that in reality when you'retalking about banks that have 30 or 40 subsidiaries and geniuses to-46-2/2-3/81manage their balance sheets, which we don't. We couldn't keep up withthat, could we?MR. SCHULTZ. You have heard about fungibility, haven't you?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The conflict I see here, again, is thatthe way to handle the perception and the reality of the subsidy in theadministration [of the window] is to make it easier to borrow with noupper limit. If we make it easy enough, the subsidy will go away.But that works against the short-term control of reserves and themoney supply. The more we work in the direction of short-term controlof the money supply, the more the discrepancy will appear. And Idon't know how to get out of this box.MR. FORD. It's a Catch-22.MR. PARTEE. We might as well accept it.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think, though, that we can reduceto some degree the size of the box, or the criticism that comes frombeing in the box, if we move to some arrangement whereby the bank thatcomes in the second or third time in too short a timeframe has to paythe--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, of course that is precisely what wedid with the surcharge. I guess we have some question whether thesurcharge doesn't become in market practice the effective rate, so itjust moves above the surcharge and makes it look even worse againstthe basic rate. What would happen if we moved the basic rate to 16percent now? I don't know whether that would have a market impact ornot apart from the psychological one. What do you say?MR. AXILROD. Yes, it would have a market effect. Well, veryfew banks are borrowing at the surcharge now.MR. MORRIS. Well, the fact that they're not paying thesurcharge means that the rationing can work because there's thisreluctance to take the surcharge even though the surcharge rate isstill way below the fed funds rate. So, I think we have this newproblem in that I at least don't believe that we're going to be ableto have for long a different lending standard for the thrifts than wedo for the commercial banks. And, therefore, I think we've got togive high priority to figuring out how to go about rationing on adifferent basis than we customarily have at the discount window.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I've been thinking that probably thebest rate for an extended credit program for the thrifts would be the3-month CD rate so that they get some earnings support but they'restill paying a market rate. If we move on the adjustment creditprogram to having a surcharge that was a lagged average of the 3-monthCD rate, then we would also have something that seemed to make moresense for the rate on the extended credit programs. It seems a littlemore rational, anyway, and less arbitrary.MR. FORD. Doesn't that get right into the same thing thatPaul was talking about: the logic of the system? Because, in effect,that's partially moving to trying to peg the rate to the market to theextent that those borrowings are a significant portion of the whole-47-2/2-3/81amount of borrowing. Once again it is attempting to go to a marketdetermined rate at the discount window and then we're back into thebox that Paul was talking about; we're trapped if we buy the currentsystem of control.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I was talking there about theextended--MR. MORRIS. But you're not, if there's a reluctance on thepart of the bank to borrow at the higher rate, which I think will bethe case.MR. PARTEE. But, Tony, if we're going to hold to the idea ofa basic discount rate of, say, around 13 percent [as it was] throughthe whole fall and the CD rate runs up to 21 percent, as it did, andwe tie the extended rate to 21 percent, we're not going to be able toget away with that. When the institution--say, one of your savingsbanks in New York--borrows because it is in such difficultcircumstances and we say we will lend to them at one point under theCD rate and that's 20 percent and the basic discount rate out there is13 percent, they're going to cry bloody murder.MR. FORD. I'll take 90--MR. PARTEE. If we have some way of showing them that somefrequent borrowers are paying 20 percent also--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're not going to solve all the problemsof the discount window and discount rate at this particular forum. Wehave to go to eat in a second, but the other two questions that justoccurred to me in terms of techniques--there may be others--are themanagement and the handling of these interest rate bands that we haveand, finally, as a number of people have mentioned, the issue ofcontemporaneous reserve accounting. Are there other issues thatshould be surfaced here?MR. CORRIGAN. I think the excess and deficiency carry-forwards are worth thinking about. It does seem to me that havingsome kind of an arrangement where we provide more flexibility therewith a penalty on deficiencies and a penalty in reverse on excesses--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we're going to be able tohandle that one today. That may be something we can look at in thefuture. I gather there is some sense--I'm not quite sure what itmeans because it runs counter to the concern about the discount window--about what would amount to forcing the banks more rapidly into moredebt when the money supply is excessive. I think there are advantagesin that approach. It's going to bring more instability in the veryshort run; it might help in the long run.MR. BOEHNE. What about this 50-50 rule about getting back onthe reserve path? Chuck made the point that there is a lot ofdelegation to the staff. This seems to me to be one area where theCommittee might be able to make it more than 50-50 or less than 50-50percent on--MR. PARTEE. Or have it scheduled.-48-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's all in that general frameworkthere.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There is one additional thing that isproposed legitimately and that's the question of whether, in theoperating procedure, the reserve path should be adjusted if M2 isgrowing significantly out of line. At one FOMC meeting we did suggestthat the Desk place more emphasis [on M2] but in practice that is notreally factored in to the way the reserve path is drawn.MR. SCHULTZ. We did the same thing with bank credit, too,early last year. That was certainly part of the thinking.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think these are--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There are two ways of doing it. Oneis to give 50 percent weight to M1 and 50 percent weight to M2, whichin effect means that we're giving a much smaller weight to thenonreserveable deposit components of M2. But it's a cleararithmetical way. Another way is simply to instruct the Desk thatwhen M2 growth rates are deviating, a qualitative [adjustment] is [tobe] made in the reserve path, leaving it to their judgment how much,but indicating that we do want a correction in the reserve path.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this is a relevant question,particularly right now when we don't know what M1 is. But let'sreturn to this subject unless somebody else wants to put something onthe agenda.MR. GRAMLEY. I want to reformulate one of these [questions],if I may. On the question of whether we should make an adjustment tothe nonborrowed reserve path in a different way than we've donebefore, I think that could be addressed most fruitfully by saying:What sorts of responses should we try to incorporate into theoperating procedures that push the money supply back toward the targetlevel when it drifts off? I say it this way because I think one canconceive of this as being done in two different ways. One is toadjust the nonborrowed reserves between meetings more; and the otheris to have the Committee focus on where we are at each meeting andwhere we want to be. And the latter will give us greater Committeeinvolvement, I think.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, there's a general question ofwhether we want to be systematic at all. If we're off course in[hitting] a target by plus or minus 10 percent, how fast can we getback, apart from the technique of how we get back there.MR. GRAMLEY. We can address this in 1 or 2 percent--MR. WALLICH. Paul, could I suggest a topic--probably not avery popular one? I suggest we consider whether we want to publishthe directive immediately.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What's the argument for that, Henry?MR. WALLICH. I'm very much impressed by the continualcriticism in the press and the market that we have changed our policy.They say the Fed has eased or the Fed has tightened and actually we've-49-2/2-3/81done nothing at all. I think we could defuse that by stating it inthe policy record right away instead of 30 days later when nobodyreads it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'll add another one: Shall we publishthe money supply figures weekly?MR. FORD. You do have the contemporaneous accounting on yourlist now?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. We have quite a few on the list; I'mnow up to H. We're not going to be able to resolve all of these,obviously, but we may get some sense on a couple of the key ones.Let's return after lunch and concentrate on this for an hour or so.MR. PARTEE. The lunch is here?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.[Lunch recess]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] there is a certain amountof duplication that is unnecessary. And I would like to delegate toPresident Solomon the task of giving us some recommendations as to howwe may maintain a detailed record for members of the Committee andotherwise without excessive duplication. If you would give usrecommendations at an appropriate time in a coming meeting, PresidentSolomon, I would appreciate it.SPEAKER(?). Amen.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Just one more blow we're going tostrike in favor of deregulation [or] simplification. Okay.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Right. Now, I don't want to take allafternoon on this subject that we are on, if we can avoid it. We haveto get to the business outlook and the long-range targets. The firsttwo subjects on my check list that we have been discussing arenonborrowed reserve adjustments and the discount window--itsadministration and the rate. I get some sense that the feeling isthat perhaps a little more rapid adjustment on the nonborrowed reserve[path] might be appropriate. I don't think we can sit here and writea formula for it today. It may be desirable or not to have a formulaat some point. The discount window and discount rate, of course, areexplicitly a responsibility of the Board of Governors in any event.But I was not encouraged by the discussion that we had this morningthat anybody has an ideal solution for getting out of the box that weare in. And it occurred to me just at lunch that this is not a newbox either. Under the old operating technique we could havemaintained a penalty rate and we never did during these periods; andthe discrepancy got extremely wide every time we had a tight moneyperiod. So, it's not exactly a new visual problem or real problem.But it is a problem.In any event, I suggest that we have had enough discussion ofthat at this point, knowing that we have to come back to thenonborrowed reserve issue anyway in connection with the explicitdecision at this meeting and subsequent meetings. And maybe we can do-50-2/2-3/81a little work on a formula. But I think there may be some dissenters;I don't know because they haven't spoken.MS. TEETERS. This would be a movement back more rapidly tothe nonborrowed [path] within the interest rate confines?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. I'll get to the interest rateconfines, but at this point it's apart from that. I must say this:The logic of this strict money supply control leads one in thisdirection. I'm a little nervous about it probably for the very reasonthat we haven't done it more rapidly in the past. We always getnervous I guess, which is why we're on this technique at all, when weare rather consciously [moving] the interest rate structure a tick.And that's what we're doing when we [adjust the nonborrowed reservepath]. But let me leave it; we'll come back to that quite explicitlyin terms of the particular decision today. We may want to saysomething about it in general terms. As things now stand, I probablywould say in my report to the Congress that this is something weprobably will be doing. But that would not be quantified.MS. TEETERS. This is a general question: Are we going topublish those studies?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My current thinking was to publishsomething like Steve's summary, which is marked preliminary, withappropriate modifications for clarity or whatever, as part of theHumphrey-Hawkins Report. I haven't made a decision about publishingthe rest of it. The rest of it may be a bit uneven. I don't knowwhether it's--MR. GRAMLEY. We're obviously going to word this to make itavailable for public use as soon as possible. There's a great deal ofinterest in it; there's a lot of good material. I think it doescredit to the staff and to the Board. I think it really goes a longway in answering many of the criticisms.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, part of my problem--I just don'tknow the answer to this--is whether the authors themselves think it isin a form that it is really ready for publication, given the speedwith which it was done and so forth.MR. AXILROD. Do you mean the summary or the rest of it?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, the rest of it. I'm not talking aboutthe summary.MR. AXILROD. Well, I would view the rest of these asvirtually final, but semi-final drafts. I would like--and I thinkalso the authors would like--one more opportunity to review themcarefully for technical problems.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Well, I suspect, without even havingread them, that given the rate of speed with which they were writtenthe authors need at least another crack at them before we would wantto distribute them.-51-2/2-3/81MS. TEETERS. But even if we did some more editing, I agreewith Lyle that this is the sort of information that should be madeavailable to the public.MR. AXILROD. Oh, yes.MR. ROOS. How would the disclosure of which of theseoptions, if any, the Committee agreed upon become public? Would thatbe in your testimony to Congress?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I think my testimony will have totouch upon all the things that we are now discussing. I don't knowwhat we would say about the discount window--maybe not much other thanthat it's a problem and that we're continuing to look at it. At thispoint I would be inclined to say that there is a question, which is inthe summary, about the speed of the nonborrowed reserve adjustment.Our tendency probably will be to lean toward faster adjustments ratherthan slower. I can make that kind of comment without being veryprecise about it. I'm judging that this reflects the Committee'ssentiment at this point.MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, on publication I should mentionone thing. The summary memo, if we put that out, has a list of thestaff studies. So, if it's put out with the list of staff studies,people will write in and ask for them.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know whether we'd want alist or not, but we'll look at that. I don't see anything the matterwith it particularly. Certainly if we're prepared to put them out,there's nothing the matter. But we can probably delay publicationanyway.MR. ROOS. Paul, after we go down the laundry list, ifthere's a certain amount of indecision on things that some of us thinkshould be reacted to more explicitly, procedurally would we expressourselves here and so be recorded? Or [are our views] not going to berecorded? We're not going to have a vote, I assume, on any of thesethings, right?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure any of these take a vote perse. My thought now is that there would be a qualitative statementabout the speed of the nonborrowed reserve [adjustment]. The discountwindow would be pointed to as a problem, but [I would say that] we'renot ready to propose anything explicit as a change. However, thereought to be a frank recognition of the fact that there are problems inthat area.The next thing I have on my list is the question of interestrate bands. I think it is fair to say, explicitly or implicitlythough maybe more implicitly, that the speed of the nonborrowedreserve reaction time--and in fact the handling of the discount windowcan be looked at it the same way--reflects some concern aboutovershooting one way or the other on interest rates and the fact thatthat is undesirable. The interest rates bands--everybody has his ownview--I don't think have been terribly important. The closest theycame to being important was last spring. Every other time we reached[the limit of the interest rate band] we changed the band. And weprobably would have changed it last spring if we had reached the limit-52-2/2-3/81more forcibly, but we teetered on the edge for a while. But I thinkthat is consistent with some implicit coloration in our minds of notwanting to overshoot on interest rates too much; that is a factor inhow these other things are set. [Steve], this interest rate bandquestion isn't one on which you made any particular proposal pro orcon in your summary, is it?MR. AXILROD. No, only indirectly. At the end we suggestedthat to the degree the Committee thinks the federal funds rate targethas any validity, it means narrower bands. Of course, I ought to saythat all the model work [assumes] unconstrained interest rates. Withunconstrained interest rates, as President Balles mentioned, theirmodel gives a little less interest rate volatility than ours does.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it seems to me that the reallyoperative question here, since I don't view these bands that we havehad as having constrained anything much, is whether anybody wants tohave narrower ones and actually have them be constraining. I supposeit means--MS. TEETERS. Well, I was certainly opposed to raising themand then taking them off this last round. Sure, we have moved them upbut we haven't moved them down to the bottom number; nevertheless, wehaven't hesitated to take the top off. I think it's well known thatwe could have gotten the same degree of restraint without having to goto 21-1/2 percent interest rates. So, I'd be more interested inseeing that the bands stick rather than that they become elastic.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not quite sure how we would havegotten the same degree of restraint. It may have been excessive, butit wouldn't have been the same I don't think at that [unintelligible].MS. TEETERS. No. [Unintelligible] it was excessive at21-1/2 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's a little different from saying--MR. GRAMLEY. I think the fact that the Committee has to gettogether once we run into the upper or lower end of the range is auseful procedure, even if the Committee decides ultimately to raise orlower [the band]. It requires careful thought and another round ofdecisions, and that's the sort of thought [process on] interest ratesthat I think is important. The Committee ought not absolve itself ofresponsibility for what is happening in the credit markets. Though Ithink probably lowering the ranges would not be a good idea in termsof public--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say lower. Do you mean narrowing therange?MR. GRAMLEY. Narrowing the range, I'm sorry. I wouldn'twant to lower interest rates at this time, as a matter of fact. Idon't think narrowing the range is a good idea, but I wouldn't want towiden the range because I do think that Committee review is a usefulfunction.MR. SCHULTZ. I think it's a particularly useful function attimes of extremes. It seems to me that most of the time the band-53-2/2-3/81doesn't make much difference. We don't pay too much attention to it.It's easily changed. But there are times when it ought to bring forthsome very serious discussion. Last spring it did bring forth someserious discussion on whether we should allow [the rate] to go lower.We probably ought to have had those discussions earlier. And in thelast month or two it has been of some importance to think about thelevel of interest rates. It seems to me that most of the time itmakes more sense to have the emphasis on the money supply, but thereare times when the interest rates get to be well worth consideringbecause they have a tendency to go to these extremes.MR. WALLICH. I think the main disadvantage of the band isthat it gives some people a justification for saying that we're reallytargeting on interest rates. Since I don't believe that that's thecase, I think that's a wrong criticism. But I think the usefulness ofthe band exceeds the advantage of defusing their criticism. If onewere to defuse it, there would be some other criticism.MR. PARTEE. Well, we could take care of that, though. Wecould have in the directive a standard phrase that says the Managerwill inform the Chairman if it appears that the cumulative movement infederal funds since the time of the meeting is likely to exceed 300basis points, at which time the Chairman will decide whether or not tocall a meeting. That way we would never have a stated band thatpeople would look at. What we would have is a plus or minus 300 basispoints from where the funds rate started. So maybe we could improveour public posture.MR. WALLICH. Well, that's an interesting suggestion.MR. ROOS. If I may, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to go on recordas favoring total elimination of the interest rate bands. From theconversation throughout this morning and in the studies and commentsthat have been made and things that are thought--although who knowswhat things are thought--I think there is an implicit awareness ofexplicit and implied interest rate constraints. I believe that actsin a contrary manner to achieving our aggregate targets. If we'reinterested in consulting frequently on interest rates, I guess weshould also be interested in consulting if the money supply seems tobe functioning in an unpredicted manner. I think there's a very basiccontradiction in trying to control interest rates explicitly orimplicitly and achieving our monetary target objectives. And I wouldexpress myself as favoring the total elimination of any specificationregarding interest rates.MS. TEETERS. Well, I find that hard to accept. We'regetting to the point where we're transmitting very volatile [short-term] interest rates into the long-term market. Even though wehaven't been able to detect it in the past 15 months, that has to besomething that is going to disturb all sorts of things over a longer-term period. I think we're just abrogating our responsibility if wesay we're not going to pay any attention at all to the interest rates.MR. WALLICH. Well, Nancy, I agree with that. But at thesame time I recognize that the main volatility that carries into long-term interest rates comes from inflation and not from our proceduresbecause it is very implausible that we should be changing our policy-54-2/2-3/81 -55-from month-to-month even though that gets written up in various marketcomments.MS. TEETERS. We had the inflation before we changed ourprocedure and it wasn't showing up to that degree in the long-termrates.MR. WALLICH. It hasn't been so bad either.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If we were to move to adopt newrecommendations immediately, then I think Chuck's formulation wouldmake more sense.MR. WALLICH. Yes.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm not sure, but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the trouble with Governor Partee'ssuggestion--it's good if you want to achieve the result that you wantto achieve--is that other people may have a real concern about [thelevel]. If they are more concerned about a rise of 300 basis pointsfrom 21 percent than they are from 15 percent, you have a problem.MR. PARTEE. Then we'd have to say 200 basis points. Thatwould be something to do.MS. TEETERS. I don't think so.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, that kind of defeats the--MR. GRAMLEY. I'm not quite sure how plus or minus 300 basispoints from the current level differs from the range of 600 basispoints around the current level.MR. PARTEE. We simply avoid saying what the range will be.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But we haven't always been in the middleof these ranges. Both in the spring [of last year] and just recentlywe've been around the upper end of the range that we set.MR. PARTEE. We'd have to put it in the center.MR. BALLES. I'd like to say, Mr. Chairman, that I amintrigued by Governor Partee's suggestion. I hope it will get someserious consideration. I would not be in favor of dropping the rangealtogether, and that would be a way of getting out of the appearanceof having a range. I think it would give us a great deal offlexibility and we could make the decision meeting-by-meeting as towhether the [checkpoint] should be 300 or 200 or 400 basis points.MR. FORD. From one meeting to the next? May I ask for aclarification? Are you saying that whenever we have a meeting, westate the monetary aggregate targets and then always have a proviso tothe Desk that the Manager will tell Paul any time we're going to move300 basis points plus or minus from where the funds rate was when weleft the meeting? And that would call for consultation on the subjectof whether we would want to let the rates go?2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.MR. PARTEE. And then we could change the 300 to a differentnumber if we wanted.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you change it, then I think you'llreally be detracting from the basis--MR. PARTEE. I have in mind having a standard of 300 basispoints. But in an exceptional case, such as Nancy referred to whenrates are at a very high level, we might want to constrain them.MR. FORD. Since we meet on average every 5 to 6 weeks--I'mjust trying to remember the history of the market [rate movements]--that would have triggered a discussion on couple of occasions, right?MR. GRAMLEY. It seems to me, however, that the market isgoing to interpret your suggestion in a very different way. If thefed funds rate on the day of the Committee meeting is 17.42 percentand we say 300 basis points on either side, the newspapers would saythat they have figured out that the Fed's range is 14.42 to 20.42percent. It makes a lot more sense to say it's 14 to 20 percent. Ithink that's what they're going to do. Then if we start playing gamesand say we're going to narrow the range down to 200 basis points oneither side because we don't want rates to go up too far, they'resurely going to say we are playing the rates instead of the moneysupply.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't know how important all ofthis is.SPEAKER(?). Is it important?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think it could be. We could varyon it. What scale are you on here?MR. PARTEE. My basic position is that I think we ought towiden the range.MR. SCHULTZ. My position is that we ought to stay away froma mechanical approach. That's what gives us the most trouble. If wedon't retain some elements of judgment in what we do, I think we're introuble.MR. BALLES. I agree.MR. SCHULTZ. I'd just hate to get hung up on any of thesemechanistic kinds of solutions. I don't think any of them work.MR. BOEHNE. I agree with that. There clearly is aninconsistency in trying to control money and interest rates. But itseems to me it is the job of this Committee to resolve theinconsistency. And I think we ought to have ranges. Chuck's idea isan interesting variation, but I would favor maintaining a range. Ifit has to be raised or lowered, it seems to me that's what this groupgets paid to do, whether it's by a mechanism or---56-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I would suggest that when we writethis report it should say that on balance the Committee wants toretain interest rate bands. I would emphasize in the reporting thatthese bands have not really been constraining, but in a number ofinstances during the past year they have served as occasions for theCommittee to consider what it wanted to do. And the report shouldnote that virtually every time this happened, the range has beenchanged. I think it has been changed every time.MS. TEETERS. Not the bottom of the range.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, did we ever have a consultation andnot change it? I don't think so. On that bottom, I don't read thatexperience quite the way you do. We flirted with a conflict, but wenever really had it. Just about the time when we would have had tohave a meeting, interest rates began going up. We may have had ameeting and not changed it but I don't know when.MR. PARTEE. The fed funds rate is a constraint. I certainlyapprove of your saying this in public, but I think we need torecognize that it's a constraint.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know what you're sayingbecause I disagree with you in terms of these bands. We've changedthem every time we've come [to the limit of the band]. Now, I thinkit is a constraint implicitly in our behavior in terms of rapidity ofmovement. But I just flatly disagree with you that these outsidelimits have been a constraint. I just observed that when we met andsaid we had a problem [with respect to the interest rate constraint],the constraint has been changed.MR. ROOS. Paul, when we discussed before the problems ofadjusting our reserve paths more quickly, it was specifically saidthat one of the costs--to those who view it as a cost--is widerfluctuations in interest rates. So, maybe we can convince ourselveswithin this room that interest rates aren't a factor, but I think theylurk in the back of Peter's mind and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now, wait a minute. They do lurk in thebackground, and I don't deny that in terms of rapidity of[adjustments]. All I am saying is that these bands themselves--Iought to be in as good a position to know as anybody--have notconstrained [our actions].VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, they do at 8 and 20 or 8 and 21percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know what would have happened.What happened when we ran into 21 percent? We removed [the limit].MR. RICE. Well, at some point we might not.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's why they're there. At somepoint we might not.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. On the down side wasn't 8 percent aconstraint?-57-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's debatable on the down side.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'd have to agree with you anyway,but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The closest we came certainly was on thedown side.MR. GRAMLEY. Instead of lurking in the background, they havelurked in the foreground.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We were right on the edge. That's theclearest case when it could have been a [constraint].MR. BALLES. May I ask, Mr. Chairman, whether you'reinferring that in your view we could get along without a range then?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, frankly, I think it's a good idea. Iwould even question whether we should have removed it every time wedid. But we did.MR. FORD. Well, if I may comment on Governor Partee'sstatement that the range ought to be widened: It seems to me that ifwe're going to issue a report on changes in monetary policy for thenext year compared to last year, and if one of the things we're goingto say is that we are going to move faster against movements off thepath on reserves, there has to be a logical symmetry in that we haveto say something that is consistent with that on the other side.Either widen the band or make a stronger statement that we will adjustright away.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Again, I think the constraint has beenmore an implicit one in that we have not wanted to move too fast inthe short run. And that is true whether we had a lot of room withinthe bands or we didn't.MR. PARTEE. Yes, in that sense it has been a constraint,because we knew that a rapid adjustment in nonborrowed reserve pathswould affect the funds rate.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that is true without question; butI'd say that is true whether or not we're near or away from the--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I think there is consensus thatwe all want a meaningful discussion when--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we don't all.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. With a few exceptions. Well, I saida consensus. I think it's a minor question as to whether to word itin the traditional way or to word it as in Chuck's approach.MR. PARTEE. Yes it's minor; I think there's a little changein emphasis.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think there is a real difference.It would happen rarely, but there would have been a difference lastspring and summer and right now when in a sense a lot of people would-58-2/2-3/81want it asymmetrical. Your presumption is that it would be moresymmetrical. I detect that we do not have unanimity but a consensus.[The next topic is] contemporaneous reserve accounting.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, may I make a statement on that?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You may.MR. BLACK. It seems to me that all these points we've beenmaking have a good deal of merit under the lagged reserve accountingsystem. Anything we can do to make the volume of borrowing morepredictable within reason is certainly to be desired. I think it'simportant that we adjust our nonborrowed reserve target more promptly,as we agreed, to offset unexpected changes in borrowing. And I wouldsay we have to be prepared to use a pretty wide federal funds raterange. But all of these things certainly seem to me still to engageus in the very difficult practice of trying to produce a demand curveand trying to say something about what the nature of that demand curvefor money really is. And I don't think we are going to be able to dothat very successfully. So to me the only real solution out of ourdilemma, if we really want to control the aggregates, is to movetoward contemporaneous reserve requirements. There is a way I thinkthat can be done--and this is just a tentative thought--that would bepalatable to our constituents. That would be to make the period aboutone month but still require them to report their deposits daily. Thatwould reduce some of the burden of shifting from the lagged[accounting], which is certainly easier for them to handle. And itwould also make it easier for us to control the total supply ofreserves because then our deviation in the volume of borrowing couldbe offset more easily, particularly if it occurred in the first partof the period. So, I think that's really something we ought to movetoward.MR. SCHULTZ. I don't understand.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure I can think this through.Let me ask Mr. Axilrod and it will give me time anyway. If welengthen the reserve averaging period--let's say it went from a weekto a month--and said it was contemporaneous, it seems to me we wouldend up at the end of the period just where we are now.MR. AXILROD. Well, I was trying to think that through. Ithink that would require yet another one of our studies of thesevarious proposals.MR. BLACK. Just accept it on faith, Mr. Chairman!MR. AXILROD. I do think it results in the problem ofdelaying reaction into the third or fourth week [with the banksthinking] maybe the Fed will come and save them finally. But I wouldhave to think through whether that is not reproducing, in effect, atwo-week lag or something like that. We would just have to analyzethat carefully.MR. BLACK. Well, I think it makes it possible to hit a totalreserves target. And if we're going to control the aggregates, Ithink we have to be able to do it. We really can't do it as well as Iwould like under lagged reserve requirements, although I think we can-59-2/2-3/81do better than we have been doing. And I say this as somebody who wasinvolved in introducing lagged reserve requirements; I have a bias infavor of keeping them. But I think we now have a situation where wecan give the banks something that's almost as palatable and not have abad public relations effect and at the same time improve our control.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I must say my concern about this is notany public relations effect or difficulties with the banks. We canmake the banks do what they have to do. My concern is that the logicis probably to do this, but the logic may not be very strong. And wemay in a sense be promising [too much]. People will say we made agreat change and it may be that not much is different after we've madethe change except that we've complicated our own life a little as wellas the banks' lives. And we could get an adverse reaction becausenothing much has changed. That's the only thing that really bothersme about this.MR. BLACK. Well, there are a couple of positive things. Oneis that I think we've tended to hide behind lagged reserve accountingsometimes and used that as an excuse for not really pursuing ouraggregate targets very actively. I'd like to eliminate that littletemptation, which I think we all share. The second thing is that ifwe did this, we'd get the monetarists off our back on that particularissue and maybe they could then make some positive contribution towardimproving the control mechanism.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but I think that's--SPEAKER(?). That'll be the day!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wish I thought it worked that way.MR. PARTEE. How about 100 percent reserves?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ford.MR. FORD. Well, you're right to be concerned about theproblem it creates for the banks--especially for a large branch banksystem--because I was involved [as a banker] in researching this whenit was discussed as a possibility by the Fed some time ago. We haveto give them warning if we are going to do this.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I think we have to assume that we willhave to give them substantial warning if we do this.MR. FORD. I know that. But having said that, if we givethem warning, there's no question that the banks can gear up toprovide [the data]. As to the theoretical arguments on things likethe discount window and so on, there is disagreement among thetheoreticians as to how much goes toward getting us out of the boxthat you and I were discussing earlier. But there's no question aboutthe direction. To some extent it does get us out of the box. Somepeople say a lot; some people say a little. Therefore, given myconcern about the absurdities of the discount window operations withthrifts thrown in and everything else that is happening in that area,I feel it's only logically consistent. I am a strong advocate ofmoving, with proper notice to the banks, toward contemporaneous-60-2/2-3/81reserve accounting but not overselling it, though, because I thinkyou're right that if we oversell it, it could hurt us.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The logic is in that direction; it's justa question of how much. It may be fairly trivial. That's my concern.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Will you feel a need to move thatquickly, in view of the fact that we're still trying to iron out thereporting problems and the inconsistencies?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I assume if this is done, it's goingto have to go out as a proposed regulation for comment. Now, BobBlack raised another question, which is a relevant question. If we'regoing to make this change, should we consider any other change in thereserve period or the carryover, and put it all out at the same time?If we're going to do that, it's going to take a couple of months toprepare the regulation, I suppose, because we would have to debatethese other issues too.MR. FORD. Yes. And a complication might arise if we're nowallowing some of them to report quarterly. Could that complicate it?MR. BLACK. Yes, it does.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the assumption would be that wewould just go on contemporaneous reserve accounting for the biggerbanks.MR. FORD. Okay.SPEAKER(?). Sure.MR. CORRIGAN. It has been asked whether we're thinking aboutbigger banks and contemporaneous reserves literally or with a one-daylag.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A one-day lag.MR. CORRIGAN. The one-day lag.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Are we going to have more revisionsor more errors as a result of this move?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we will have errors with that, whichis a complication for us. We have estimates of errors on requiredreserves, which we don't have very much of now. But as soon as we goon contemporaneous reserve accounting, we're going to have lots oferrors in our own estimates of required reserves.SPEAKER(?). Right.MS. TEETERS. Is this going to cause major operating problemsat the Reserve Banks?MR. MORRIS. Yes.MR. CORRIGAN. Yes.-61-2/2-3/81MR. FORD. Yes. We need time just like the commercial banks.MR. MORRIS. A lot.MR. BALLES. There's a long lead time.MR. CORRIGAN(?). And a lot of programming.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's what Milton Friedman calls"bureaucratic difficulties."MR. BALLES. That's because he doesn't know the facts oflife.MR. GRAMLEY. Milton Friedman would argue that we shouldimpose the least cost on the private sector, too, except in this case.MR. BLACK. It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that if we didthis, we wouldn't have to go through the process of trying to estimatewhat the demand for money looks like, what it's shaped like, and allthose things. We would make our best estimate of the reserves ittakes to give us the [desired] growth in the aggregates. And whathappens is that the demand for money, whatever the shape [of thecurve] is, will determine the level of the federal funds rate.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that implies that there's noslippage either in our estimates or in the linkage. And we just hadthis plus or minus 10 percent a month slippage.MR. BLACK. No, I'm not ruling that out; I recognize thatthere are slippages. But I think we'd come very close to hitting atotal reserves target, particularly on a monthly basis. And I don'tmean a flat, identical percentage increase each month. I think wewould have to adjust that total reserves figure for the non-monetaryliabilities and what they used up or released in the way of reserves.We'd have to construct the target path very much as we do now. But wewouldn't have the problem of the banks being able to borrow and[raise] the reserve targets.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Sure we would. They can still borrow.MR. BLACK. Well, they wouldn't [raise it] all that far,though, because--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's an expression of faith on yourpart. How do you know?MR. BLACK. Well, I think they could [raise it] to someextent. But just the lengthening--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this is the whole argument. Whatdifference does it really make? The logic goes in your direction, butI don't know why you think it's quantitatively important. Banks don'tdetermine the money supply; an individual bank doesn't. It sits thereand sees what deposits it has today and it will come up with thosereserves tomorrow. Under CRR what we would be doing is that we wouldmake them come up with those reserves tomorrow, or at least in the-62-2/2-3/81present week, instead of two weeks later. But why do you assume fromthat a vast difference in bank behavior?MR. BLACK. Well, the point that you frequently make is thatthe banks are going to get the total reserves that they need that arebased on deposits two weeks earlier. And in this case, if a bank ishell bent to make loans because it has loan demand, it's going to goahead and probably borrow some at the window. But we can offset thatduring the period because we can cut the nonborrowed reserve part ofthat. And that's going to set in motion a process regarding bankcredit that is going to reduce required reserves during that period.There's no way we can reduce them under lagged reserves.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, the increase in borrowing will set inprocess a motion, but we can get that same increase in borrowing if wehave the intestinal fortitude to do it. I think at the present themain thing that would change, frankly, is that the market would bemaking more of these judgments about what the level of borrowing wasbecause we wouldn't have the information fast enough to do it. So--MR. WALLICH. Well, doesn't the borrowing begin two weeksearlier under this system so that the adjustment comes faster?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, all things equal.MR. AXILROD. Well, one week earlier.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One week earlier.MR. AXILROD. It's one week because of the way we operate.That is, we don't wait. If deposits are running high and borrowinghas to be high for that four- or five-week period, we immediately putthat in. So, it's only if it happens the very next week instead ofwaiting two weeks when the required reserves are technically higher[that we] wait until the deposits are higher in that week. So theeffective lag is really cut down from two weeks to one week by the waywe operate.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it all goes in that direction. Butit's just a question of magnitude.MR. BLACK. Yes, I know. It's a matter of degree. And Ithink we can operate under lagged reserves; I never would haveadvocated that originally if I hadn't thought so. But I believe wecan do it a good deal better under contemporaneous; and I think thelonger period gives banks a chance to do some arbitrage over time thatmight iron out some of the interest rate fluctuations that are ofconcern to a lot of us around the table.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, why did we change in the firstplace? Didn't we originally--MR. BLACK. It was a bank relations move, basically, Tony.We conjured up a lot of reasons.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Now you no longer feel the need toaccommodate the banks?-63-2/2-3/81MR. BLACK. Not to the same extent. We were also operatingon a net borrowed reserve target, too. And we could hit that moreprecisely [with lagged reserves]. It didn't have the same meaning, tobe sure, because required reserves had been determined on the basis ofdeposits two weeks earlier. But it was easier to hit it. But thebasic reason was that it was very difficult, as Bill Ford said awhileago, particularly for the large banks with branch systems to know whattheir required reserves were even by the end of the period. So theyestimated. And it's still--MR. FORD. But the Fed did this in the late '60s, right?MR. BLACK. It was done for bank relations purposes mainly.MR. FORD. Yes, but now it should be a lot easier to go backto it technically because more of the banks are moving toward being online with their branches in terms of their EDP operations. So itshould be a lot less painful if we reinstate it now than it would havebeen with the same--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I don't really understand. Ican understand those of you who want to impose these extra burdens onthe banks because you think it's a major improvement to [monetarycontrol] but [not] those of you who think it's a very minor one. Idon't quite understand why we're so concerned about not increasing theburden on the banks in other areas but in this area it's okay. We'regoing to get very minor monetary policy--MR. SCHULTZ. There are some of us who do feel that way,Tony.MR. WALLICH. Well, it's a dilemma. We can say that we'vegot all the instruments now to achieve the degree of money controlthat we really want, say, over three months, so why improve thetechniques? But I think this is a speeding up. It may reduceinterest rate variability because certainly in the absence of anaction by the Desk it seems to have been econometrically demonstratedthat there is more instability of interest rates when we're up againstfixed reserve requirements than when we're up against requirementsthat we can modify slightly during the week in question. If thatcontinues to hold--and I don't know if that's still the view--then Ithink there is quite a payoff.MR. SCHULTZ. I'm not sure I understood. You were saying weget less interest rate variability with contemporaneous reserves?MR. WALLICH. [Yes, under] contemporaneous because, in thelagged case, there's a given amount of reserves that the bankingsystem must get if the Fed doesn't supply them. Then the excessreserves have to be worked down to zero, in effect, and carryovers arecreated. Whereas if the banks are able by reducing their reservableliabilities to reduce the amount of reserves required--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think that brings lower interestrates, Henry. An individual bank can't reduce its reservableliabilities. It can do something on the assets side that reduces someother bank's reservable liabilities. But that would be accompanied bymore pressure on the market.-64-2/2-3/81MR. GRAMLEY. What Henry is saying, I think, is that for anygiven degree of precision of monetary control, we will have lessvariability of interest rates. Or, for any degree of variability ofinterest rates, we get more precision of monetary control. In otherwords, what is going to happen to the demand for reserves is thatunder present circumstances the demand for reserves has elasticitywhich depends only on the elasticity of demand for excess reserves.What this is going to do is to introduce into the overall demand forreserves an elasticity which comes from the demand for money. Sooverall demand for reserves will be a little more elastic with respectto interest rates than it was before.MR. BALLES. Right.MR. PARTEE. What we get is a quicker change in interestrates and, therefore, it doesn't have to be as large. It's a specialcase of the general case that has been well postulated in[unintelligible].MR. AXILROD. There is an offset to that, I think. That's inthe intermediate run, as I was trying to say earlier. We might get alittle less variability because the process might start a bit sooner.In the very first week banks extinguish some deposits instead ofborrowing all the money so there is a little less interest rate[effect] than if we had to wait until the second week or the thirdweek. But in the very short run we might get more up and down jigglesbecause by our mechanism now we sort of eliminate those by estimatingthe demand for borrowing and spreading it over the weeks [of thereserve adjustment period]; so we're accommodative to the up and downjiggles in deposits. We will know those up and down jiggles indeposits under contemporaneous reserves and thus we're likely to getmore up and down jiggles of the funds rate with contemporaneousreserve accounting, I believe.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Anybody want to--MR. SCHULTZ. And there are some who believe that thoseswings would be rather extreme.MR. CORRIGAN. That's right.MR. AXILROD. Well, they may be.MR. BALLES. Is there anybody around the table who remembershow things worked prior to 1968 with regard to the jiggles?MR. GRAMLEY. We were setting fed funds rates then and[experienced] no problems.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. When we're setting the federal funds rate,it won't make any difference. That's right.MR. CORRIGAN. Part of the problem in terms of pre-1968, too,is just the amount of churning in the banking system then as opposedto now. The Fed-wire didn't even work prior to the---65-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. Well, I think we were essentially on a varietyof targets, but the way to describe them all was "the tone and feel ofthe market."MR. CORRIGAN. No, I mean just the turnover of financialassets in the [banking] system.MR. AXILROD. Yes, and we'd smooth that out. It was lessjiggling in some sense because the Desk was tending to offset thejiggling.MR. FORD. As I recall the theoretical discussion--some ofthe staff members may be able to enlighten me on this--one of thefactors that keeps us from getting a big payoff for going to CRA isthe difference in reserve requirements among different size banks.Isn't it right that that is another source? And with the new law,that tends to smooth those differences. Maybe that, too, would helpreduce the noise that comes with moving to CRA.MR. BLACK. I don't think there's any doubt about that.MR. FORD. Isn't that right in terms of the theoreticalarguments? Yes, but why doesn't CRA give an immediate linkage?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that would make a difference. But Ithink the biggest single source of slippage is going to remain thediscount window. Nothing in going to CRA says that they can't borrow.MR. BLACK. But we can squeeze them by cutting thenonborrowed reserves.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Sure we can.MR. BLACK. Do you think we can't really do that now?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.MR. BLACK. We've got to let them have the total reservesthey need to meet their requirements.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but we squeeze them by making themborrow more. And that has been the limitation on our operations now.We didn't want to go very fast. Now we can go faster within the weekbut I--MR. BLACK. There's nothing in this procedure that wouldpreclude putting in a range on the federal funds rate if we did notwant to offset the borrowings that the banks would have the option ofentering into. We would not have to do that fully. I'm just sayingthat we could do it virtually 100 percent over a monthly period if wewanted to. Now, that might involve more volatility in interest ratesthan a lot of people would like to see. But at least the mechanism isbetter because we don't have to fool around with trying to estimatethe demand for money, which I just don't think we're ever going to beable to do. The appetite in the short run for money is justunpredictable in my judgment. And to me the necessity of doing that--coming up with a federal funds rate that would tell us what theborrowing is going to be--is a key part of the present processes. And-66-2/2-3/81we've been notably unsuccessful in that. I think we can improve it,but I don't think we can ever be terribly successful with it.MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I think I should add--because itcomes out of President Black's comments--that we have a heck of a timepredicting the demand for money. But we have [difficulty]--and thatwas one of the results of the research--predicting the supply factorsthat are affecting what money is going to be, such as deposit mix,demand for borrowing, and things like that, given interest rates andGNP and money. Contemporaneous reserve accounting might strengthenthat linkage but there are a lot of other factors that would argue forpermitting the borrowing to do some of the work, which would tend tooffset the misestimates on deposit mix and things like that. So, Iwouldn't think that going to contemporaneous reserve accounting wouldautomatically mean we're going to be better off because we can chaseborrowing up and down. A certain amount of borrowing seems necessaryto offset our own multiplier misses, so to speak.MR. ROOS. But doesn't your--MR. BLACK. I agree with that, Mr. Chairman; I didn't mean tosuggest otherwise. And I didn't mean to suggest that a one-monthperiod was absolutely right because we haven't had a study on that.But under the present procedures, we have to estimate a demand and asupply function for money to operate, if I understand correctly.Under CRR, all we have to do is estimate the supply. We haveeliminated the most difficult estimating problem. But far be it forme to say that the estimating problem would not still be difficult. Ithink it would be, but I think it would be more manageable. It takesa lot for me to eat crow on this because I was involved, as some ofyou may remember, in this [move to] lagged reserve accounting. And Inow think we probably were wrong on it. But it was done to makethings easier for the banks, basically.MR. WALLICH. Is the reason we don't have to estimate thedemand function that the volume of the money can adjust during theperiod?MR. BLACK. That's right. We figure out what volume ofreserves we think it would take to get the growth in the money supplywe want and put out that volume of reserves. There are things thatcan offset it, as we all know. Borrowing can go up and we'd have tooffset that; or we could have an unexpected change in the level offloat and we'd have to offset that. I don't mean to suggest that wecan hit it with perfect precision. But if we do [go to CRR], it seemsto me that the demand for money basically determines the level of thefederal funds rate. I recognize, as I said earlier, that some mightwant to put a constraint on that. But we could certainly--MR. PARTEE. We've just been talking about that.MR. BLACK. Yes. Not everybody wants to do that; I'm justsaying that some want to put a constraint on it. But we could dothat, which means that we would not pursue the supply of reserves asactively as, say, Larry Roos would like or as I would like. We wouldat least tip our hat toward what this procedure was doing in the wayof creating volatility in the federal funds rate. We would diminishthe ardor of our pursuit for a while in deference to what it was doing-67-2/2-3/81to interest rates. I think that's perfectly compatible and a personcan argue for that. As I admitted to Lyle a while ago, I think theselarge gyrations we've had in interest rates have been very upsettingto businessmen who are trying to plan, and I would like to see thosegyrations eliminated. The best way to eliminate them is to do whatwe've said we wanted to do: Get the aggregates down to a lower rateof growth so that we get rid of some of the inflation. I think thatwill do more to remove volatility in long-term rates than anythingelse. That's something I can't prove empirically but it certainlyseemed to be true in 1960-64 when we did have a relatively low rate ofgrowth in the aggregates.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just ask about the extremes. I'llask [for you views] symmetrically, but I have to start with oneextreme first. Who feels very strongly that they would like to go tocontemporaneous reserve accounting? [Secretary's note: Messrs.Black, Ford, Roos and Winn raised their hands.]MR. BALLES. And the next question is who is not at leaststrongly--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's have the other extreme now.Who feels strongly that we should not? [Secretary's note: Mr.Gramley raised his hand.]MR. GRAMLEY. On the basis of cost to banks alone.MR. SCHULTZ. Very strongly or just strongly?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The same amount of strength that I askedon the other side.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'll join Lyle.MR. CORRIGAN. I think I will too.[MR. BOYKIN. I will also.]VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm on the margin between moderatelyand strongly opposed.MR. SCHULTZ. Yes, I'm with Tony. If he's going to raise hishand--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Wait a minute. We may be--MR. BLACK. I hope none of you will tell [Irv] Auerbach how Ivoted!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have listened to the discussion,including the point that Bob Black made that if it turned out that wehad an excessive amount, however defined, of instability in thefederal funds rates from day-to-day that we might want to change ourtechniques and constrain that more directly. Now let me ask: Givenall the discussion, who would favor going in this direction enough towant to make the change? That includes the people who want verystrongly to do it.-68-2/2-3/81SPEAKER(?). When?SPEAKER(?). With an announcement?MR. FORD. We assume this is with time for everybody to gettheir acts together?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, with adequate time and all the rest.SPEAKER(?). I don't understand this.MR. WINN. I don't know what we're voting on.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Considering the disadvantages and how youappraise them, you are voting--whether you feel strongly or weakly--on whether on balance you'd make the decision to go [to CRR].MR. PARTEE. In due course.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, on balance, if we did something withdeficiencies and so forth, I'd go.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but you just voted in the oppositebecause it says--MR. CORRIGAN. No, no. Just [on changing] the laggedreserves regime itself. But I think if we did some adjustments--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, all right, just on [changing] laggedreserves then. Put your hands up once more. I just want to get somesense of how many. [Secretary's note: Messrs. Balles, Black, Boehne,Ford, Guffey, Morris, Partee, Roos, Wallich, and Winn raised theirhands.] Okay, let me ask the opposite; it should be all the rest. Onbalance, who would not go, either strongly or weakly?MR. PARTEE. Isn't somebody going to be undecided?MS. TEETERS. Yes. Actually, I'm just indifferent. We'veargued we will proceed with--SPEAKER(?). It puts you in the perfect position.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, all right; you're permitted to beindifferent.SPEAKER(?). Can we vote for indifference?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have a majority who would like to gofor it. The next question would be--MR. BOEHNE. When?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And how? And would you raise all thesequestions about the reserve averaging period and the--MR. AXILROD. The Board has already announced it is thinkingtentatively about doing it by September of this year.-69-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I know.MR. PARTEE. Yes, in principle.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand.MR. PARTEE. But, certainly, the carry-forward and carry-backwould have to be a part of all that.MR. CORRIGAN. If we got into operating that way, we reallywould need to look at the whole ball of wax.MR. GRAMLEY. What do we gain in terms of what you want formonetary control? That's why we're doing this.MR. PARTEE. Yes.MR. GRAMLEY. If we go ahead and lag it all over the placewith carry-forward and carry-back, the whole purpose of consideringreserve requirements--MR. PARTEE. Yes, absolutely. We'd have to weigh the pinch-points. I'm not arguing that we would do so much carry-forward.MR. CORRIGAN. No.MR. PARTEE. But it would do away with the whole effect.MR. CORRIGAN. No, it just provides another safety barrier.MR. PARTEE. But we are going to have to study the questionto see whether they are pinch-points.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You did a memorandum on this a year ago,didn't you?MR. AXILROD. We've had several on this subject of carry-forwards and carry-backs.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm trying to remember. Do we have anystudy in the various studies on contemporaneous reserve accountingthat brought these together?MR. AXILROD. Do you mean the carry-forward and carry-back?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The carry-forward, carry-back, and thechange in the reserve averaging period.MR. AXILROD(?). Mr. Lindsey?MR. LINDSEY. We considered all those issues, except forlengthening the reserve averaging period, in a memo that went to theFOMC about nine months ago.MR. AXILROD. But we could put all this together again, andwe certainly would, prior to further discussion by the Board. Thatwould be the intention, I assume.-70-2/2-3/81MS. TEETERS. Steve, if we lengthen the carry-forward/carry-back, doesn't that increase your difficulty of estimating reserves atany one point? Doesn't your estimating procedure get more distorted?MR. AXILROD. We have never been able to convince ourselveson that. It's a fine point as to whether widening those offsets theadvantages of going to contemporaneous accounting, if you think theadvantage is better control of the money supply in the short run. CRRdoes tend to make our multiplier a little less loose, clearly.MR. SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to argue for not doingeverything at once. It seems to me that it makes a lot of sense tomove more rapidly on nonborrowed reserves. I thought I heardpractically everybody say they wanted to do that.MR. WALLICH(?). Not me.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I said practically everybody. I couldhave said everybody who counted, but I was trying to be nice!MR. WALLICH. I'm wounded!MR. SCHULTZ. If we throw all these other changes in thereall at one time, I'm not sure that we're going to know what the heckis doing what.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The posture we are in now, if I recall itaccurately, is that we have said we don't want to do this right awaybecause of the Monetary Control Act. And, if we ever do it, we willgive the banks a lot of notice and all the rest. We are seriouslycontemplating it but we haven't made up our mind.MR. AXILROD. That's right. [The announcement of the Board'stentative posture] had a slightly positive cast rather than a negativecast in it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Among other things, this is a Boardof Governors decision. But I'm just trying to figure out how we canadvance the ball or kick the ball back in terms of what we say inconnection with the Humphrey-Hawkins report. We can put a morepositive cast on it and say an appropriate regulation is being drawnup, which the Board would have to agree to subsequently. We can saywe are considering these other things and we plan to publish a[proposed] regulation but it's short of an absolute decision. We canput a much more positive cast on it, but we can't say we absolutelyhave decided on it anyway if we're going to put it out for publiccomment.MR. PARTEE. We will have to publish a [proposed] regulation.MS. TEETERS. But there was a flavor [in our announcement]that we wouldn't consider it until September.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would assume that if we began right nowto consider it, we'd have to consider some of these other matters andcouldn't do it short of six months anyway.MR. BLACK. Yes, that's what I had---71-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But we have to get comment [from] thebanks and give them time to get prepared.MR. BLACK. I think Governor Schultz has come up with asensible suggestion for most of us. Going with what he said is all wecan do for a while anyway. We could not switch to this any time soon.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, just to pick a round number, I thinkwe're not talking about [making a decision] before six months.MR. BLACK. No. But in the meantime, I would favor doingwhat he suggested as an interim step. And if things turn out better,then maybe we don't need to do it. I have long had a bias in favor oflagged reserve accounting, but--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What are you going to tell yourcritics next year if you're going to take care--MR. BLACK. This would be lowering requirements.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We on the Board will discuss this againstthis background [discussion]. One possible outcome is, in effect,announcing that we are going to publish a regulation for comment andconsideration.MR. ROOS. May I make one observation? In countering whatFred said, I don't think this is a matter of our throwing everythingat them at once. If you recall--and maybe I'm hung up on this--thePresident, the present Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Stockman, andothers coming into this Administration specifically suggested that wefree interest rates and that we go to contemporaneous reserveaccounting. In other words, they [listed] a number of the things weare talking about. Now, we certainly are independent of them. If, asa result of this effort today, when the Chairman goes up to CapitolHill all we do is say that we are going to try to adjust ournonborrowed reserves a little more quickly, it will be awfully obviousto people who are aware of the several things that were suggested thatwe really haven't moved on any of them very emphatically. So, I thinkwe're going to catch more flak if we merely do that one thing than bein any possible danger of being accused of throwing too much at themat once, if that makes any difference. In the minds of the financialpress, or portions of it at least, as well as the incomingAdministration, there are rather specific views that the two or threeor four changes that we are discussing today are necessary for the Fedto conduct monetary policy in a brave new manner. And I think theomission will be as obvious as throwing in too much. This is justsaid in a friendly way to give the opposite point of view.SPEAKER(?). If it works.MR. SCHULTZ. I would remind you of the recent interview thatNewsweek had with Bill Martin in which he ended up saying that hedoesn't know much about monetary policy but he knows a lot more aboutit than most other people and he spends most of his time trying tocombat simplistic solutions. And it seems to me that there are anawful lot of simplistic solutions being offered. I'm not convincedthat those who are criticizing what we are doing know more about itthan we do around this table.-72-2/2-3/81MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I may move to item E.MR. BALLES. Could I say just one fast word? When the Boarddoes consider this matter, I hope it will give serious considerationto Bob's proposal. Among other things, it certainly would eliminatethe frantic settlement dates that we would have under a one-weekreserve period. That would greatly diminish the burden on both theReserve Banks and the reporting banks, if we could get what are saidto be the advantages of CRA. I view them as being moderatelypromising. But to do it on the one-month basis rather than an everyweek basis I think has an awful lot of merit. It certainly deservesmore consideration in my view.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the only thing that strikes me aboutthat offhand, without having thought it through, is that all theadjustments get delayed until the end of the month, and there would bea tremendous crunch at the end of the month. That would be worse.But we'll look at it.MR. PARTEE. I think the Committee has had some experiencewith this.MR. BLACK. But they have a one-month long lag.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Next on my list is: Which target do weemphasize? We have a particular problem--and I don't know how far wecan carry this outside of the specific decision we have to make abouttargets this year--when, for institutional reasons, we don't have asgood a handle on what M1 is doing as we might like. Who would like toaddress themselves to this subject of which target? I suppose wecould say the general question is: How many targets do we announce?MR. MORRIS. I've become increasingly disenchanted with M1[in its various forms] as a monetary policy target, starting back inthe fall of 1978 when for six months it was giving us misleadingguideposts to monetary policy. It seems to me that what we're tryingto control with monetary policy is nominal GNP and that, therefore, weought to use as our target something that is more closely related tonominal GNP. I think the broader aggregates are more closely related.So, I'm in favor of getting away from M1 because of its short-terminstability--because the noise factor is so much louder in M1 than inthe other aggregates. And I think the fact that we have this NOWaccount problem this year provides us with an ideal opportunity forchucking M1.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand everything you're saying.M1, very recently anyway, has [not] been very closely correlated withnominal GNP. But how do you answer the fellow who says: "That'sfine, but we can't control M2"?MR. MORRIS. Well, sitting around this table today, we haveheard discussions to the effect that we really don't control M1 withreserves--that we control it with interest rates. If that's the case,it seems to me that we can control M2 or M3 as well with interestrates. I am not persuaded that the broader aggregates are lesscontrollable, in fact, than the narrow ones.-73-2/2-3/81MR. WALLICH. They're mostly controllable by controlling theeconomy.MR. MORRIS. Well, so is M1 fundamentally.MR. WALLICH. You know there is the result--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With M1 I think--MR. WALLICH. I would have thought M1 had some independentimpact.MS. TEETERS. But even if we aimed for M2, our controlmechanism lever is still M1. It has to be.MR. MORRIS. Why?MS. TEETERS. Well, if M2 overshoots the only thing we can dois lower M1.MR. ROOS. Haven't there been studies that have shown there isa much closer relationship between the narrower aggregates and nominalGNP than the broader aggregates? May I ask that question of my friendon my right?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Axilrod now tells us that one canproduce a study to show anything, I guess.MR. AXILROD. I think Mr. Davis has.MR. MORRIS. The fact is that I asked my staff to give me achart of M3 velocity compared to M1 velocity.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, just to clarify this: If you justlook at the simple relationship with no lags, it is clear that M2 hasa much closer relationship. I think everybody would agree with thatrecently. But you're saying that if one makes a complicated enoughequation with lags and so forth and interest rates, yes--MR. AXILROD. Well, with regard to a predictable relationbetween money and GNP, the velocity of M2 has shown very little changein the last couple of years. But [the problem] gets very hard whenone puts oneself in another world of controlling [M2]. Then, what arethe relationships? In the present world in which we live, theinterest rates that are available on the instruments in M2 move veryeasily with the market. They have been designed that way. When youstart controlling M2 and market interest rates go up, the [depository]institutions raise their interest rates; In my mind--and I may bewrong--if we really actively control M2, I fear that we'll get muchmore interest rate volatility out of that than one might think. Whenyou are looking at a world where we weren't trying to do that, M2 sortof goes along with the more moderate movements in interest ratesrelative to GNP that we were having. So I think it's much morecomplicated than just looking at the past history of theserelationships. I'm probably not being clear, but--MR. MORRIS. Well, I think I understand what you're saying.Nonetheless, the image in the public mind and in the mind of the-74-2/2-3/81Congress of what monetary policy did in the last year, for example, isclosely identified with the tremendously erratic jags in M1. We gotsome undulations in the broader aggregates, but we didn't get anythinglike that kind of movement. To stick with a target that has as muchnoise as M1 does is not a very rewarding exercise.MR. AXILROD. May I just make one final point, Frank? Idon't want to bore the Committee, but what I'm trying to say is thatM2 in 1980 didn't vary quite as much as M1 did. But [what would havehappened] if we had been trying to keep M2 from doing what it wasdoing? Then we would have had, I think, even more interest ratevariability because the market would have had an easier job working tooffset [our actions] because the [depository] institutions couldchange the interest rates on the deposits in that aggregate. If wehad worked policy your way, that might have generated a lot moreinterest rate variability and, for all I know, a lot more moneyvariability. The reason is that to reduce M2 growth sufficiently wewould have been putting most of our pressure on demand depositsbecause institutions would have been raising their interest rates toget more of the other deposits [in M2].MR. MORRIS. Well, I would be more inclined on the broaderaggregates to use M3 than M2.MR. AXILROD. Well, for either one, I think that's the issuethat it tends to bring up.MR. PARTEE. I wouldn't want to do anything too shockingabout this, Frank, until I understood more about the Britishexperience. They have had something like a 22 percent increase in M3,about twice their guideline. But M1 rose 6 percent last year, whichis much more consistent with what was happening in the economy.MR. SCHULTZ. Yes, but I'm not sure you can make thatcomparison, because they had--what do they call it--the corset?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, they had some other things and I justdon't know--SPEAKER(?). Well, they haven't been [unintelligible]overshooting.MR. PARTEE. Yes. But it's very possible that there might bea tendency for people to move out of long markets and into shortmarkets for both borrowing and holding financial assets. It wouldhave the effect, within the context of a particular increase in totalcredit, of being more in the form of M3. It could be the corset oranything else that would occur. And that would be totallyuncontrollable by us. I think the only way we could control it, asSteve says, is by reducing the growth of narrow money to the pointthat we got interest rates high enough to have to turn them off toshort markets as well.MS. TEETERS. Steve, didn't you have an experience when youwere trying out the different control measures that as you moved thecontrol from one of the instruments to the other, in effect, what it-75-2/2-3/81did was to move the variability to the instruments that wereuncontrolled?MR. AXILROD. Yes.MS. TEETERS. So, we are not getting rid of the variabilityby changing our target; we're just moving it to some other instrument.MR. AXILROD. That's what led me to try to put controlling M2in those terms because that might be shifting whatever variability wehad in M2 somewhere else, so to speak. It would be in demand[deposits] then, with possibly even more variability in M1 and, as aresult, even more variability in interest rates than we are observing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Didn't I see somebody speculating on theBritish experience that they might have had slower growth in M3 ifinterest rates were lower?MR. TRUMAN. Well, the thought there is what was referred toas "a perverse elasticity." The work that we've done on that suggeststhat there is not. That was something that was looked at as we wereredefining the aggregates to see whether there was a sufficientlyperverse elasticity. It's possible that there is some, but that hasnot been found yet.MR. GRAMLEY. It seems to me, as a minimum, that we need toask the staff to take out the components of M2 that are not in M-1Band subject them to some analysis of their cyclical pattern. Whatdoes it look like? How sensitive are those components to rates ofinterest and so on? There are some things that go in oppositedirections.MR. WALLICH. I think we did that once before and we foundthat the non-M1 components in M2 did not contribute anything to therelationship of M1 and income.MR. PARTEE. That's right. [Unintelligible] we did in thatcommittee you'll remember. And there was no improvement incontrollability by moving from M1 to M2.MR. SCHULTZ. When was this?MR. PARTEE. Oh, a year or two years ago maybe.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we heard Frank expressing one pointof view on one side. Are there those who are 180 degrees away and saywe ought to forget about M2 and M3 and bank credit and so forth?MR. CORRIGAN. Do we know anything more, Steve, about whereNOW account money is coming from?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's get into that later.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I don't know. Was Frank arguing that?I'm not sure I understood. Were you arguing that we ought to targeton M2 and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Or M3.-76-2/2-3/81MR. SCHULTZ. --M2 or M3 and that we ought to replace thesingle variable of M-1B that we're targeting on with another singlevariable? And are you going to the extent of saying that we justpublish that one? If so, I can agree with you partly. I think theKaufman idea that we need to look at much broader [aggregates] andthat we need to look at credit makes some sense. But there are allkinds of problems in that. It seems to me that we can't do very muchbetter than to target on the M-1B that we're using now and look at theother aggregates, including bank credit, as judgmental factors.MR. MORRIS. I think 1981 is going to be a year when none ofus is going to have the faintest idea what M1 really means.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll get back to that in a minute.MR. PARTEE. I understood Frank to say he wants to target onM2 or M3.MR. MORRIS. Or M3.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just in terms of a more general sense ofthe meeting, if I detect it correctly, the view is that we will remainrather eclectic on this as a matter of principle but that some M1measure continues to have a particularly heavy bearing as an operatingmatter. We may modify that in the light of the particular decision wehave to make now. M1 is particularly [distorted]. But as a generalprinciple--though we had one on one side and one on the other side--Iassume everybody else is in the middle, which is the view I justattempted to express.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. At previous meetings, I had takenFrank's position. But I've been thinking it through and I believeit's a little dangerous to target on M2 or some other broad version of[money]. I think people will still be looking at the M1 components ofthe M2 number. And we're still going to have to be open to muchcriticism. Also, I'm impressed by Steve's earlier point: It is acumbersome variable to target because we can only operate on part ofit. So, my instinct would be to go ahead and target the same Ms thatwe did last year and adjust the targets for the NOW accounts. We'd bepublishing only the raw data and then periodically we would make a--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll get into the specifics of what wewill do [with the targets for this] year in a minute. You wanted tosay something, Bob?MR. MAYO. Yes, I just wanted to say that I think one of thebrightest things this Committee ever did was to start the targetingprocedure not only with ranges but with a family of targets. And thisis absolutely the worst time in the ten years I've been here toabandon that and to seek, as some people on the Committee want to do,a single aggregate that is better than the others. They are onlymarginally better or marginally worse. [I don't care] if someonewants to say that it's cowardly to seek refuge in a family ofaggregates with disparate movements and admit that we are feeling ourway in this; I think that is the honest approach.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think you are citing a generalopinion. It's clear enough, subject to any change we have to make-77-2/2-3/81this specific time because of the confusion about M1. But we'll getto that later.MR. BALLES. Particularly in 1981 it would be pretty risky tobear down on just one aggregate. But could we perhaps considersimplifying the family? I'm not sure, for example, whether as we gointo 1981 it will still be necessary to track M-1A. We know there aregoing to be some very massive shifts out of it because there alreadyhave been at least some. It's going to look really weird to set up atarget abstracting from changes, given what may show up in reality.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's go to that when we look at 1981. Ithink it's a relevant question. Anything else on the generalprinciple? We are remaining eclectic. A question arose in the courseof these studies; it doesn't need to be systematized, but somebody maywant to say something about it. The staff detected, as a matter ofempirical research, that the targets that the Committee set tended tomove one-third of the way back toward where they were supposed to beper month. Am I expressing that correctly?MR. AXILROD. I think that's right.SPEAKER(?). For the long term?MR. AXILROD. Back to the midpoints of the long-term ranges.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think this was consciously thoughtout or very explicitly thought out. I may be overstating this, butdid I understand that the staff judgment that emerged, considering theimplications for interest rates and all the rest, was that that didnot seem, for better or worse, an unsensible way of doing it?MR. AXILROD. That's right. Looking at the monthly moneymarket model simulations, that was kind of a tradeoff. If you triedto get back faster than that, the assurance of hitting your long-runtarget wasn't all that much greater [and that needed to be weighedagainst] the probable increase in money market rate volatility.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't really think this requiresany decision because we can always make it at any particular meeting,as we have in the past. But I thought it was interesting to conveythis sense of what presumably we had been doing subconsciously. Idon't know if anybody wants to raise a question about it orsystematize it or whatever.MR. BLACK. Isn't there some conflict between that andadjusting the nonborrowed reserve target to a larger extent andperhaps more frequently?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON(?). No.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know. What do you say tothat, Mr. Axilrod?MR. AXILROD. I'd say that the first thing had to do with theCommittee's targeting procedure. The second had to do with thesuccess of hitting it, which wasn't all that great.-78-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And they weren't too closely related?MR. AXILROD. The Committee targeted fine, but the aggregatesdidn't behave quite as targeted. If they had, we probably would havehad more interest rate volatility.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just to rationalize those two things, Mr.Black, what we have to be saying is that it may have been logical toset the target to move a third of the way back. But we didn't changethe nonborrowed reserve [path] fast enough to support the actualnumerical target that we had set.MR. BLACK. Yes, I see the distinction. I was somewhatconfused on this.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's rather natural that we would endup trying to get a three-month correction, isn't it, simply because ofthe way we look at these, which is to see where we come in at the endof that quarter and then to try to get back on path?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that's why we did it, yes.MR. AXILROD. Yes, there were some times when it might havebeen six months, but it was--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we have to sit here anddecide we're going to have a fixed policy or that it should bedifferent. But apparently this was systematic enough in ourunconsciousness so that it could be commented on, if anybody wants tocomment on it.MR. CORRIGAN. One of the things that bothered me about thatwas this: The report made the argument that we didn't, through ouractions, build in a cyclical pattern of money [growth]. That is, thethings that we did didn't create their own cycle. I just had sometrouble rationalizing that three-month lag, [given] the very lowinterest elasticity of money demand in the short run, with theconclusion that the practice itself didn't help to generate the cycle.If we only adjust--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the thing that bothers me the most,as just a simple observation of last year, is whether we weregenerating a cycle. That is the question we're now raising. And whenI don't probe too hard, the staff tells me that we weren't. But Idon't know whether I feel comfortable with that.SPEAKER(?). I don't.MR. CORRIGAN. Again, those two things, the one-third typereaction coupled with the very low short-run interest elasticity ofmoney demand, seem to me to reinforce the casual observation thatmaybe we were creating--creating is too strong a word--contributing tothat cycle of money growth itself.MR. FORD. Well, what's the alternative policy?MR. AXILROD. We ran [the model] a variety of ways. If yourun it holding money growth constant so there's no cycle, you tend to-79-2/2-3/81get some cycles in interest rates. That's possible. But if you tendto hold interest rates constant, you might get some movement in moneygrowth related to GNP. But we didn't succeed in getting cycles inboth, if my memory serves me.MR. CORRIGAN. Let me ask the question differently. I onlysaw the summary; I'm not sure what you drew the conclusion from. Isthat where you were going?MR. AXILROD. Which [conclusion]?MR. CORRIGAN. The conclusion that our own techniques didn'tin some sense create or contribute to the cycle of money.MR. AXILROD. [There was a] sharp drop in money in the secondquarter; the models would have projected a higher amount of money inthat quarter--much more money--even with the weakness in GNP. So weinterpreted the sharp drop in money, even at the interest rates thatdeveloped, as reflecting a sharp drop in money demand at that point.We weren't creating the money demand; that was the public's reactionto what interest rates [were doing]. The San Francisco interpretationputs much less stress on the sharp drop in money demand and wouldstress instead that there was a temporary deviation in money supply insome sense because everyone was paying off loans. And viewing loansas a supply, the amount of money dropped. They wouldn't tend tointerpret it as money demand. But again, there was an exogenousfactor, that credit control program, unrelated to our operatingprocedures. The big variations were coming out of that. And that'sessentially the basis for saying that.MR. CORRIGAN. Let me ask the question differently, then. Inany of that material, was there an effort made to estimate the lagbetween, say, a change in the nonborrowed path and its ultimate impacton money? [Was there any analysis of] how long that process takes?MR. AXILROD. I'm not sure. I did ask the question: If weheld the nonborrowed path, however constructed, and put in more money,however that comes about, which gets more borrowing, would we ever getback to the path? I don't know whether you're asking that question.MR. CORRIGAN. No, it's a slightly different one.MR. AXILROD. The answer to that is: No, we don't get backto path. We would have to lower the nonborrowed path.MR. CORRIGAN. That's the question I'm asking.MR. PARTEE. The question has to do with the lags. Thequestion is: What is the lag structure from a change in monetarypolicy to the effect on observed money supply? I think that's whatJerry is interested in.MR. CORRIGAN. Yes.MR. AXILROD. Well, again, that has to be answered somewhatindirectly. Working through the money market model, which hasexplicit interest elasticities and demand for money and lags, if youwant to hit that total reserves badly enough in a one-month period,-80-2/2-3/81and you're running a couple of hundred million ahead on totalreserves, meaning you're running ahead on money by whatever themultiple is--10 or something like that--then you've got to lower thenonborrowed reserves a heck of a lot more than $200 million if youwant to get on path that week. I've forgotten the exact numbers thatI got out of this; I got them a year ago October when we started thisand kept getting them lately. That month you've got to lower them,say, $1 billion, because you get an offset in borrowing of $800million or something like that, even under contemporaneous reserveaccounting. So you generate massive interest rate pressures. Now, wedon't have evidence that if you generate those massive interest ratepressures, you're going to start cycling money. Our evidence ispretty clear that you'll get interest rate cycles or interest rate upand down movements, but not money cycles.MR. CORRIGAN. That's where I get stuck. I don't see how youcan get the up and down interest rate movements without in turngetting an up and down movement in money, because the interest ratespresumably are what cause the--MR. AXILROD. Well, that's a technical question. The lagsare, on average, six or seven or eight months at the longest and [mostof the effect is] done in about three or four months. You have tostart comparing the effects of this month's drop in interest ratesgiven that [sort of lag]. It takes most of its effect three or fourmonths from now.MR. CORRIGAN. I'll have to look at that paper.MR. PARTEE. My [memory] is that it could be four, but maybea little more vigorously--MR. CORRIGAN. My instinct, though, is that the way weoperate could very well produce those results.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, one of the things that continues toconcern me a bit about this is this simple relationship, and maybe Mr.Ford can enlighten us about it, that we're attempting to control theeconomy through bank service charge practices. Corporations hold alarge percentage of the money supply; their required balances arerelated to their activity in the prevailing interest rate[environment] with an indeterminate lag of several months. We push upinterest rates; the banks all send out notices to the corporationsthat they can keep lower balances next month. Interest rates go down,so the money supply declines. And because interest rates have gonedown the banks send out notices to their customers that they now haveto keep higher balances.MR. FORD. There is that perverse dynamics. Are you askingwhether, as the interest rate cycle evolves, bankers change thebalance requirements? Is that the question? Sure they do.MR. PARTEE. How fast do they do that?MR. ROOS. No faster than they have to.MR. FORD. Oh, heavens. That varies so much from bank tobank.-81-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The saving grace here is probably that thebank practices vary in this respect enough so that it doesn't have anycyclical movement to it.MR. FORD. For a long time, the Fed did a survey of lending[practices] and it supposedly covered that. When you read the resultsof those surveys and talk to corporate lending officers and listen tothe policies dictated to them by their senior managements, there's avast [unintelligible]. You learn nothing from the survey. What youhave to do, actually, is an audit of collected balances--not just whatthe bank says the corporate customer has to have but what it actuallyis getting out of the corporate customer. I think it would show, asPaul suggested, that when things get tight the bankers try to comedown on them harder. But as for how much they do, I've never seen anygood evidence for all the banks. I know how it works in two or threebanks that I'm familiar with, but not all of them.MS. TEETERS. Steve, actually, we were trying to get back onthe path in two specific instances. One was the drop in April; andthen we were moving back up to the path over a three-month period.The other one was the ratchet up in July--or August, I guess. We werereacting mainly to two almost discrete occurrences. Did that in anyway affect the rate at which we tried to get back? It's not as if wecontinuously drifted off in one direction or the other. We just tooksome tremendous ups and downs that we were trying to correct.MR. AXILROD. Yes. Well, it affected our deviation, I think.That is, we were so far off a couple of times that it made our averagedeviation bigger than it otherwise would have been. I don't rememberexactly how the Committee targeted in those periods; I don't rememberwhether the goal in that period was to get back fast--MS. TEETERS. As I remember it, you gave us the option ofgetting back in three months or getting back in six months.MR. AXILROD. That's right. And I just don't remember how itcame out. But the misses there certainly affected our averageabsolute deviation. The year was very much affected by those twooccurrences. Another year may not be. We might end up looking a lotbetter in another year because of that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Henry has raised a question of publishingthe directive, which was not on my agenda. But do you want to makeyour case, Henry?MR. WALLICH. Well, we're under challenge to prove that we'resticking by our guns. It seems perfectly obvious to us that we are.We announce our targets a year ahead; we meet only every five or sixweeks and we then publish a record so anybody who wants to informhimself can see clearly that we haven't changed our targets.Nevertheless, if you read the market reports--I try to read as many asI can and the most troublesome that I know of is Eric Heineman's ofMorgan Stanley--they continually say that the Fed once more has givenup on inflation. Three months later he finally discovers that the Fedseems to have decided that they will fight inflation after all. Thatsewage flows into the--SPEAKER(?). Remember, we can't go back to---82-2/2-3/81MR. WALLICH. How do we prove that we haven't changed ourmind?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do you think he'd write a differentnewsletter if we did publish [the directive immediately]?MR. WALLICH. I think somewhat different, yes. For one thinghe always uses existing material, including our policy record and thediscount rate proceedings in full detail. He reprints them to fillabout half of his letter. And he's not the only one who for need ofsomething to write says that the Fed doesn't know what it is doing, ordoesn't know what it wants and changes policy almost continuously. Ithink we could do something to defuse that. I recognize that the costof this is quite considerable. For one thing, we might get much moreof an immediate reaction from the Congress, for instance, to anythingthat looks like a rise in interest rates. For another, it's only onthis technique--if we don't emphasize interest rates--that we canpublish immediately. Under the old technique, with [emphasis on] thefederal funds rate, we would have tipped off the market on what wewere going to do over a month and the market possibly would have takenit to the next stage. That danger still exists with a [federal fundsrate] band if they see the band is not now 12 to 18 percent but 11 to17 percent. They might say the midpoint has moved and so the fundsrate is going to move and they might do that right away. So, I see aconsiderable cost, but I still think it's worth considering, and Ilean toward doing it.MS. TEETERS. Even on the funds rate, Henry, they found [whatour new rate was] by noon on Wednesday [after the meeting] anyway.MR. WALLICH. Some [did].MR. PARTEE. Henry, the last time we published, we had adirective that specified a funds rate range of 15 to 20 percent, Ithink. And when we did that, I've forgotten just exactly where theactual funds rate was but it was right close to 20 percent.MR. STERNLIGHT. It was about 19-1/2 percent.MR. PARTEE. Now, what do you suppose would have been theeffect (a) on Eric Heineman and (b) on the market if that afternoon wehad published in the Committee's directive a funds rate range that has5 points of downward room in it but no upward room at all? I thinkyou'd get the same story from Heineman in spades. And I think themarket would have assumed--I'd say it's like shooting fish in abarrel--that the funds rate wouldn't go over 20 percent and it couldonly go down. That would have had an effect on all the variables.Whether it would have been good or bad, I don't know. But publicationof that particular directive would have had an effect.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I wish to reinforce that. The marketparticipants whom I respect the most are saying that it's important tomaintain uncertainty in the minds of the market participants to themaximum degree possible. They say that the Fed move to a 6-point bandcreated a healthy tone in that market. I agree with Chuck that thereare times when we'd be publishing a fed funds range that would reducethat uncertainty, and I think that would tend to produce unfortunate-83-2/2-3/81results in the markets. In a certain sense it would focus moreattention also on the fed funds rate band if we published immediately.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Certainly, once we began doing that, wecouldn't stop. And if we ever wanted to put something in thedirective such as some qualified statements about if this happenssomething else might happen later on--as we did last month, though noton the federal funds band--MR. PARTEE. I just think there are times--I've seen themperiodically--when we want to put a constraint on [interest ratemovements]. And if we had to announce that constraint right away, Ithink it would hurt.MR. MORRIS. Also, when we have conference call meetings andraise the rate, presumably we would have to announce that immediately,too, which is--MR. ROOS. Well, just so that Governor Wallich isn't left todrift alone, I agree fully with what he says. I think there is muchunnecessary volatility in the financial markets as a result of someperceived signal from the Fed that it is going to do something that itindeed isn't going to do. The more we tell them and the more we playour cards openly, the better everybody will be able to adjust to whatwe're trying to do. So, I would endorse what you said, which may haveeliminated the last vestige of success for it, Henry!SPEAKER(?). [Unintelligible] chance of success.MR. WALLICH. Well, look at what other central banks do.SPEAKER(?). He said "Roosfully."MR. WALLICH. We are very much on the defensive. We operate,as it were, trying not to show our hand. The Bundesbank, which is avery strong central bank, calls a press conference every time they'vedone something worth talking about. They explain very clearly whatthey are doing.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. [Unintelligible].MR. WALLICH. Well, it has worked well for many, many years.And I don't think it has to do with their present problem. They'renot afraid of their government and they're not afraid of theirlegislature. And they do inform the market.MR. PARTEE. How could that be?MR. WALLICH. Well, I guess they are an independent centralbank.MR. FORD. I don't really understand the notion thatuncertainty is desirable. I always thought when we were discussingvolatility in long-term rates before that we said uncertaintycompounds volatility; it is an economic cost. It has to be eitherthat uncertainty is bad or it's good. I think it's bad.-84-2/2-3/81VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Uncertainty in markets' behavior isabsolutely a sine qua non. Take the foreign exchange markets. If youdon't have people betting on both sides, you're going to have[in]stability in markets or movement in one direction. Now, if you'regoing to have a government controlled market, fine. It seems to methat that is not what you're talking about.MR. WALLICH. Well, there's a difference between uncertaintyand ignorance. You want to give the most information, but it willstill leave the distant future uncertain.MR. PARTEE. Yes, but you do have to have two-way markets.Without differences of opinion, you will have no markets. I thinkthat's what Tony was referring to.MR. WALLICH. Yes, but these might both be well-informedopinions. They could still end up being different.MR. BLACK. Henry, if we had contemporaneous reserveaccounting and no limit on the federal funds rate, I'd be with you 100percent.MR. PARTEE. Yes, I think that makes a big difference. Totell with no constraint on federal funds rates--MR. BLACK. [With no such constraint,] we really wouldn't betelling the market anything. They would know as much as we know; wewouldn't know which way rates--short-term rates anyway--were going togo on that basis.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I detect no upsurge toward a majority forthis opinion. The last question I have here is a similar one, whichwe certainly don't have to resolve here. It's not the responsibilityof the Committee, but I wonder where opinions stand on publishing themoney supply data. I got a letter from Senator Garn and SenatorProxmire the other day raising the question of whether we shouldn'tstop publishing weekly figures.MR. MAYO. We can't do it under the Freedom on InformationAct, can we? Period.MR. MORRIS. We can if we switch to M2 and M3 because [wedon't have weekly data].MR. PETERSEN. We can stop publishing the data; we could notresist a specific Freedom of Information Act request for the data ifthey are compiled and used. But there is no requirement to publishthem.MR. SCHULTZ. And in fact we'd get [requests].MR. MAYO. Well, that's dancing on the head of a pin. Ifit's there, it's there.MR. PARTEE. There would be a delay, though.MR. FORD. Well, maybe for a time we don't have to compilethe data for the public.-85-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And presumably we could ask Congress tochange the law if they thought seriously about it.MR. FORD. That's what you're asking? Is that what they'reasking us? Do we want the Act changed?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, they didn't specifically ask that. Iforget whether they made any reference to it or not. They made somereference to the fact that they understood there might be a questionunder the Freedom of Information Act. I think that is the way theyworded it. I don't think they volunteered to change [the Act], butthey didn't say they wouldn't.MR. MAYO. Send them back [a request] to change the Act.MR. MORRIS. That would be one of the advantages of switchingto the broader aggregates where we don't have weekly data.MS. TEETERS. But they'd still request them.MR. MORRIS. We don't have it.SPEAKER(?). It would cut down the reporting [burden].MS. TEETERS. But we can't stop collecting it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It has occurred to me--though I'm notready to propose this yet--that we may have legitimate grounds for notpublishing seasonally adjusted figures because the seasonal adjustmentfactor is so bad. We would tell the public that we don't trust it andwe're not going to--MR. GRAMLEY. We cannot create one internally without alsomaking it available under the Freedom of Information Act.MR. PARTEE. Let's do away with it since it's no good.MR. GRAMLEY. Well, that's fine. But then we probably willhave to go to Frank's procedure of targeting on M2 because we won'thave anything that is a weekly number.MR. PARTEE. How about successive estimates of the monthlyseasonally adjusted numbers?MR. MAYO. That's the bureaucracy at work. Our alternativethen is to publish a new set of figures on our evaluation of noise.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I won't prolong this any further.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In the staff material I think thereare some good comments on that. They point out that if we publish theraw data, without the seasonal adjustment, everybody is going to bemaking their own seasonal adjustments. And then they're going to bewatching other things to get a clue as to what Fed policy is and willpay more attention to the fed funds rate.Kichline.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is no question about that. Mr.-86-2/2-3/81MESSRS. KICHLINE, ZEISEL, and TRUMAN. [Statements--seeAppendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Thank you for your happy comments. Ithink we ought to discuss the outlook, probably for most of the restof the time we have [left today] anyway. In that process, you willrecall that you recently provided some [individual] forecasts, whichpresumably will have to be summarized for the Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony. Not all the assumptions were the same on the monetaryside. I forget: What have we done in previous years about gettingcommonality in the assumptions if not the forecasts?MR. KICHLINE. We did not [have uniform assumptions]. You'reasking in terms of this exercise?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. We didn't [specify] any assumptionsI don't think. Did we ask people when making their forecasts to usethe same assumption or not?MR. KICHLINE. We specified the midpoint of the ranges. Onthis one we asked that the forecast be accompanied by a statement asto what the assumptions were. So, the assumptions did vary.MR. SCHULTZ. We have given [Congress] a Board forecast inthe past.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We gave them a forecast that [generallyencompassed] the views of the [individual] Committee members. But Ican't remember whether we asked everybody to make a forecast on thebasis of the same monetary and fiscal assumptions.MR. PRELL. Last time was the first time that the entire FOMCparticipated. We asked for forecasts on two bases: in terms offiscal policy assumptions and with the basic money stock assumption weultimately [adopted]--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So everybody presumably had the same moneysupply assumption?MR. PRELL. Presumably.MR. SCHULTZ. Not this year.SPEAKER(?). It was different this year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, in these preliminary forecasts [theassumptions] were different anyway. I just don't know what the rightprocedure is here. It's logical for everybody to use the sameassumption. But if somebody violently disagrees with the assumption,it seems a little artificial to force that person to use it.MR. PRELL. Well, in terms of the basic thrust of theHumphrey-Hawkins exercise, the assumption might relate somehow to whatwe thought the Administration economists were going to do with fiscalpolicy, which leads one to various indeterminate states at this time.But there's nothing we can do that is going to be clean-cut in termsof the overall purpose of the [exercise].-87-2/2-3/81MR. WALLICH. Well, it seems logical that one should make asgood a judgment as one can. And that really implies also as good ajudgment as one can of the policy outcome, not the policy intentions.The forecast here in the Greenbook is severely constrained by what maywell be an unrealistic outlook. And we have a chance here to be asrealistic as we can.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's the dilemma, and I'm notquite sure how--MR. PARTEE. Well, not for reporting under Humphrey-Hawkins.You certainly don't want to be all that realistic, do you?MR. WALLICH. I try to be realistic.MR. PARTEE. Really?MS. TEETERS. Conversely, the Greenbook may be [biased] byunrealistic assumptions on money.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, all I would say at this point isthat we have a considerable amount of time before we have to publishthis, and we haven't even decided what we're deciding. Maybe we candefer that question until after the meeting tomorrow and then ask ifanybody wants to redo their forecast; perhaps we can at least narrowthe range of assumptions from what we have.MR. KICHLINE. I would note that the forecasts in theHumphrey-Hawkins report would naturally be related to a range on themonetary aggregates. So there is room within a range concept toaccommodate, I would think, a large number of the members of theCommittee.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suppose that's a reasonable compromise:To ask people to make assumptions that are at least within the rangeof what the Committee is talking about.SPEAKER(?). Especially if you're going to be called--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have a summary here of all yourforecasts, which could be distributed after the meeting for whateveruse it may be. But we will not consider this a final forecast untilwe complete our work. Who wants to talk about the outlook? Mr.Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. I agree with the staff forecast in general. Butit does seem to me, as one goes about talking to people, that thereare some real disparities in peoples' outlooks and I think that hassome implications. For example, a majority of businessmen even in theThird District, which has been an area of slow growth, are really muchmore optimistic than this forecast. [That includes those in] hightechnology, energy development, business services and that kind ofthing. On the other hand, if you talk to businessmen who are doingvery, very, poorly--those in auto and auto-related industries, smallbusinessmen who have to finance inventories, and thrift institutions--[it is quite different]. While we have been used to regionaldisparities, it seems to me that the disparities among business typesare much sharper and much stronger than in previous recessions. And I-88-2/2-3/81think the true picture of the economy is quite different. If we havethis outlook of slow speed ahead, on average, I think we are going tohave a minority of businesses that are really going to be pushed tothe wall, even though on average it looks as though we're just goingslow speed ahead.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that is a relevant comment, thatwe have a two-tier economy or something. Half of it you can't keepdown and the other half is in depression. I don't know what to doabout it. It makes it more difficult [for us] for the very reasonsyou suggest.MR. RICE. It's consistent with low, slow growth.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it may be consistent with low growthoverall, but the pressures, financial or otherwise, [are concentrated]on the half that isn't doing anything--even now.SPEAKER(?). [Unintelligible] the stock market.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else wants to comment? You're allspeechless!MR. SCHULTZ. What were those permits figures, Jerry?MR. ZEISEL. They were down 24 percent. Do you have thatnumber?MR. PARTEE. Is that all?MR. KICHLINE. They were down 24 percent in January; this isbased on the first two weeks of data and it's a sample. There is agood deal of disparity between single-family and multifamily. As youmay know, the multifamily starts have been exceptionally strongrecently but in January permits for multifamilies declined 39 percentand for singles 14 percent. So it's quite weak.MS. TEETERS. Permits are at what--around 900,000?MR. ZEISEL. 940,000.MR. KICHLINE. 940,000 compares to 1.2 million in December.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, looking at this array of numbers here, Isee that I am very much on the high side in terms of [the forecasts].MR. PARTEE. The Minneapolis Bank is--MR. CORRIGAN. The Northwest is getting to me, I guess! Myprojection is on the high side and may be the highest in terms of realGNP. I'd like to have a nice, scientific, neat explanation as to howI arrived at that conclusion, but I don't. Basically, a lot of what Ihave put into my own forecast does reflect quite strong growth in thesecond half of the year, keyed to the assumption that there will be amajor spending cut that has a strong and positive psychological effectcoupled with the tax [cut] programs.-89-2/2-3/81MR. SCHULTZ. We understood rational expectations in the--MR. CORRIGAN. That's not rational; that's irrational, Ithink. But that's the catalyst in terms of the forecast as I have putit together here. Obviously, with the kind of forecast I have, theweight of risk is on the down side. And we do have many of thesevulnerabilities in the financial system and not just in the thrifts inmy mind. I'm still not sure where we're going to be on oil prices.What is your [estimate] of the average oil price for 1981, Ted?MR. TRUMAN. The average is $38.MR. CORRIGAN. That's the annual figure?MR. TRUMAN. Right. Most of it we get, as I said, in thefirst part of the year. So, we will be essentially at that point bymidyear.MR. CORRIGAN. Anyway, we have all those risks that we'vetalked about before. The other side of the coin is that, whether it'shousing or autos or just about anything you can think of, there's atremendous residual of underlying demand, if we can ever get the rightconditions in place where the right kind of demand can flourish ratherthan be surpressed and frustrated as a lot of it is now. But in anutshell, basically the driving force behind why my numbers are on thehigh side is my assumption about fiscal policy and the way that'sgoing to affect the psychology in the short run.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. Our forecast for the year as a whole is not somuch different, but it's different in shape. That is, we're morepessimistic for the first half. Sitting here a year ago, we had allthis financial restraint in place and we were wondering when we weregoing to see some response. When we did get a response, we got apretty big one. I don't think it's going to be that big this year; Ithink we're close to another peak in economic activity, with a shallowrecession coming in the first half. That's what I would look for.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters.MS. TEETERS. When I looked over the staff forecast, whatreally struck me most was how sensitive it was to the inflation rate.Given the monetary assumptions that we adopted in July, we alreadyhave the velocity to a point that if there's any increase in inflationover what the staff is forecasting, real growth could shoot down tothe point where it is negative all year long. It seems to me that ifthere is any risk in this forecast, it is that we'll get moreinflation and a comparable decrease in real growth. So, we could havea year-long recession based on the types of assumptions we're making.That would indicate to me that instead of trying to lower the monetarytarget ranges, which we just barely got within [last] year, that we'dbe well advised to stay with the ones we had this past year and try tocome in at the center of them rather than to lower them progressivelyand run what I think is an increasing risk of missing them on the topside. My forecast--I'm obviously the bottom one among the governors--is that we're going to have less real growth and somewhat moreinflation. And [my view is] that we probably won't have higher-90-2/2-3/81interest rates either or we'll miss our monetary targets for the restof the year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. Well, I guess differences of opinion make stockmarkets, horse races, and forecasts. I lean toward the side of beinga little more optimistic than the Board staff, showing a bit more realGNP growth and a bit less inflation for the year. But [thedifferences] are certainly within the normal range of judgmentalthings that have to go into these forecasts. I was mainly interestedin asking Jim what he would consider the greatest point ofvulnerability in this forecast. Do you share my misgivings about anyforecast now in view of the ongoing uncertainties about the newAdministration's economic program and what it might do both on thespending side and the tax side? Is this forecast of yours, forexample, very sensitive to significant changes in the tax rates or[government] spending levels? I don't know myself how to do a solidforecast in view of those uncertainties.MR. KICHLINE. Well, we've done a number of simulations andexperimented with the impact of alternative fiscal policy assumptions,assuming the same rate of growth of M1. In general, [much hinges on]whether you take an approach that incorporates the three stages of theKemp/Roth bill, which we have not assumed--we've only taken the firstone. If you assume that expenditure control [presents] a bit moredifficultly to the Administration and they don't meet the targets thatwe have assumed in the forecast, the result is somewhat more realgrowth, but not a great deal more, in part because of this intractableinflation problem. If you hold the same money growth path, interestrates get kicked higher and some other expenditures get squeezed out.Of all the experiments--and I think one can argue about the interestrate pattern--we get somewhat more real growth, but what we're talkingabout is a plus or minus 1 percent at an annual rate, so it's not abig difference. I would say that one of the areas in this forecastthat is clearly very uncertain is the fiscal side; one can very muchargue about the expenditure cuts that we have in the forecast or aboutwhat will happen to defense spending, the size of the tax cut, etc.And it does matter. But given where the economy is and with the levelof interest rates that we have, our own analysis suggests thatpotential demands in the private sector are very strong but are beingrestrained. If you dump in a more expansive fiscal policy and you gethigher interest rates, that squeezes out some private funds. Thatdoes not kick up the economy to significantly higher real rates ofgrowth.MR. BALLES. The one thing that I find rather scary is thepossibility that the tax reduction will come well in advance of theexpenditure cuts, if the cuts come at all. On that matter, the veryfirst chart in the final set of charts that you presented showsfederal borrowing relative to GNP. Could I just ask whether theassumptions underlying the lower half of that chart assume tax cutsand expenditure cuts or what? And does it include the off-budgetitems?MR. KICHLINE. That includes Treasury borrowing, which wouldinclude financing the unified budget as well as the off-budget items.It does not include federally sponsored borrowing; it's just the-91-2/2-3/81unified and off-budget items. It's consistent with what we have builtinto the forecast. In 1982 we would be running with a deficit ofabout $80 billion on the unified budget; you'd have to add about $20to $23 or $24 billion for off-budget items. For Treasury borrowingthat's in the area of financing more than $100 billion in 1982. Butthat does imply significant expenditure restraint.MR. SCHULTZ. I noticed that Dr. Burns in his testimony tothe Budget Committee added in several other things; he added in theguaranteed borrowing of those agencies that are federally sponsored.Could you have somebody give us a breakdown on that as to what goesinto those categories and what your estimates are? I noticed hisestimate was around $141 billion.MR. KICHLINE. You're talking about right now?MR. SCHULTZ. No, no. I didn't mean right now.MR. KICHLINE. Well, the one difficulty in this area is thatthere are obviously many ways to calculate federal borrowingrequirements and what the impact will be on markets. One can throw inthe federally sponsored agencies--for example the Home Loan Banks, theFederal Land Banks, and Banks for Cooperatives. In our flow-of-fundsaccounting here we view those as financial intermediaries. We can gothrough this and give you alternative calculations. We can get thesize of the borrowing lower or much higher. If you throw in thefinancial intermediaries for the credit side of the budget, you getvery large numbers.MR. MAYO. Especially if you put in the guarantees, which areobviously in our private sector.MR. KICHLINE. Oh, yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roos.MR. ROOS. We basically came out with more optimistic resultspractically all across the board. We are in the outlier category insome instances, but I think our deviations were essentially based onthe 5-1/2 percent M-1B assumption used, rather than a lower monetarygrowth assumption apparently used by the staff and most of ourcolleagues. So, if we look more out of line than usual, it's becauseof that, and after tomorrow's meeting we will try to adjust itaccordingly.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You did have a little higher, but notterribly high, M-1B assumption compared to the staff. You have a lowprice number. Does that mean that your [forecast] suggests that therestraint that has already been exerted plus [restraint for] anotherfew months produces lower prices?MR. ROOS. This is essentially the product of our model.This is what it spewed out and I'm merely parroting to some extent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In your model, prices ought to begin goingdown some in terms of their rate of increase.-92-2/2-3/81MR. ROOS. Yes sir, even at a 5-1/2 percent M-1B growth ratewe would see that rate of reduction because that [rate of] growthwould be a significant reduction from the 6-1/2 to 7 percent growthrate of this year. In fact--I guess we'll discuss this tomorrow--wethink that a more abrupt reduction from the rate of aggregate growththat occurred during 1980 could bring much more severe shocks to thereal economy. Even on that basis of 5-1/2 percent we are moreoptimistic in terms of the price level reduction.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who is next?MR. WALLICH. Well, I made my projection on the expectationof some overshoot of M1, whichever we choose, because while a shift inthe demand function is perhaps probable, it may not be so large and itcertainly is not assured. Even so, I think it will imply veryconsiderable restraint. We wouldn't overshoot unless interest rateswere pressing us very hard, so I arrive at a rather adverse conclusionon the real GNP. On inflation, traditionally we have undershot ourprobabilities. So, given that during the year some bad things surelyare going to happen--more food problems, more oil problems--and nogood things, one has to expect not a further rise in the CPI butprobably a rise in the deflator. On unemployment, although it's avery unhappy projection to make, I think unless unemployment is high,price increases aren't going to slow and wage increases aren't goingto slow. We have no magic way of getting from a low growth of themoney supply to lower wages and lower prices, except via low capacityutilization and high unemployment; and, of course, that in turn isachieved by high interest rates. These all are very unpleasant thingsto contemplate and that's why I decided I'd put them down. I think Iam among some of the excluded outliers here.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You prefer to have a lower target andovershoot or a higher target? What is the implication?MR. WALLICH. I would rather have the lower target and atleast have a chance of making the right effort. But I would remindthe Committee that we probably will have base drift. I don't knowwhat we're going to base the range for 1981 on, presumably on thefourth quarter of 1980. If so, I have the impression that thatincludes for all but M-1A base drift of about 2-1/2 percentage points.Now, that's a very substantial step-up. Maybe I've done my numberswrong, but I think we have to add that to the level of the aggregatesas stated over the year in order to see what they really would be ifwe had started a year ago--that is, at the end of 1979.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.MR. GRAMLEY. I don't have any basic disagreement with thestaff projection. But if you look at what is likely to happen overthe course of the four quarters this year and to fiscal policy in thelatter half of the year, it seems to me that we face the realpossibility that aggregate demand in the latter half of the year willbe considerably stronger than the staff anticipates, at least innominal terms. And that will put considerably more pressure on pricesand considerably more pressure on interest rates. I say that becauseif you look at the staff projection of the high employment surplus ordeficit, it switches from a $19 billion surplus in the first andsecond quarters to a $22 billion deficit in the third and a $14-93-2/2-3/81billion deficit in the fourth. In other words, virtually all of theeffect of that fiscal policy on the tax side goes in immediately butthe effect of the budget restraint is much delayed. Of course, whatwill be happening at that point is that no one will really knowwhether these intentions on the expenditure side are in fact beingrealized if the tax cut goes through. So, I could be one of thoseoutliers at this table on the price side. I think we're going to belooking at a GNP deflator that has not shown any signs of decelerationduring the course of 1981 and a CPI which might well be acceleratingagain as a consequence of the effects of both rising interest ratesand some pickup in economic activity. At some point during the courseof 1981, we're going to have to ask ourselves how long we can stickwith a policy posture that is simply not doing any good whatsoever inbringing down the underlying rate of inflation because the fact of thematter is that what we have done so far has done no good at all. I'mnot saying we ought to quit, but I think we as a Committee are goingto be facing a very, very grim set of economic statistics with no realhope that the underlying inflation rate is going to improve.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say it has done no good at all. Areyou excluding the possibility that [our policy] prevented it fromgetting higher?MR. GRAMLEY. No, I would certainly agree with that. It hasprevented the underlying inflation from accelerating. It would besomewhat higher today--not much, but somewhat. It moves glacially,not in large amounts. And if we like, we can take credit five yearsfrom now for preventing the underlying inflation rate from having goneup to 15 percent instead of 12-1/2 percent. But if the unemploymentrate at that point is 10 percent or more, I'm not sure how long we canpersist.MS. TEETERS. How do we know five years from now?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are there any more optimistic comments?Mr. Winn.MR. WINN. The forecast falls out from our model and I thinkthe question we need to ask is: How good are the assumptions? One ofthem, as I understand it, is that you have assumed that there is noreal change in the international situation. I'm not sure that's afair assumption, although I'm not predicting as Henry is that it'sgoing to fall apart on us. But that's one assumption. Second, Ithink we've overlooked a rather basic change, which Ed Boehne referredto, and that is the change in psychology that has occurred in the lastmonth, which may turn out to be false expectations. I would mentionthe fact that advertising sales are really quite high. The televisionchains report that they have sold out for the first quarter, which isreally a rather surprising development given the pessimism in certainareas. That has been a pretty good leading indicator in the past; itmay not prove to be this time. But if you talk to business peoplewhom you would expect to be distressed and depressed, they're fairlyoptimistic. Whether this is based on the psychology of a change ingovernment and what is going to come out of that, and if it doesn'tquite work out that way we will get disappointment in reaction, Idon't know. But the first half of the year could turn out to be a lotstronger than any of us expects. Automobile sales could be stimulatedby the [higher] energy costs rather than depressed, for example. So,-94-2/2-3/81I think one could make a case for a somewhat stronger outcome than themodel.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You know, we have a certain bashfulnesstoday.SPEAKER(?). We're weary.MR. SCHULTZ. Humility has set in.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. When you give the Humphrey-Hawkinstestimony, do you have to say anything about what we expect the publicsector borrowing requirement or the unified budget deficit to be infiscal 1981-82? Do you explain that as one of your assumptions?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, not very rigidly anyway.MS. TEETERS. But you're likely to be asked.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The Reagan Administration so far istalking about a $29 billion unified budget deficit for fiscal year1982.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But that's all based upon a much moreoptimistic business outlook.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Exactly. They have 3-1/2 percentgrowth in real GNP. I think you are going to get yourself into a verystrange situation there because one has to make some really heroicassumptions to get [the deficit] down [to that level]. In fact, Ithink real GNP growth at 4 to 4-1/2 percent is needed to get that andone has to assume that inflation is down substantially.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think the general problemwill be one of estimating the budget; it just falls out. But we don'thave to make a forecast for 1982. If we accepted the staff forecast,we're certainly going to have a difference between our forecast andthe Administration's.MR. PARTEE. You don't think they'll project an $80 billiondeficit?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think they'll project whatever wehave for 1982 in the forecast we just heard.MR. PARTEE. It's $81 billion.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I'm thinking of the GNP. Do you havea comment on the outlook beyond that?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No, our view is not that different.I'd say it's a little on the gloomier side. But I would agree withLyle that we're unlikely to get any improvement in the rate ofinflation unless we see some unexpected developments in fiscal policy,to a degree that I don't think is realistic.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. By unexpected developments you mean what?No tax cut?-95-2/2-3/81VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No, I'm not talking about thereceipts side; I'm talking about the spending side. I'm sure we'llhave a tax cut. But I can't conceive that even by fiscal 1982 we willhave the kind of spending cuts that will change expectations andinterest rates [unintelligible] of the nominal GNP that our monetarypolicy [unintelligible]. So, I don't see anything but a long slideahead. On the other hand, it may very well be that after another yearor so of this, the Administration will accomplish a little[unintelligible]. I think the fallout of all this, in terms of arecommendation for the targets, is that the amount of flak we wouldget if we didn't go ahead with a 1/2 point reduction [in the M1ranges] would be enormous; and we live in a [unintelligible] typeworld. None of us knows exactly what the results of this would be, soI don't think we have any real alternative, even though I think Lyleis right that we're not going to be able to show, at least in the nexttwelve months or so, any reduction in the rate of inflation.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, the critical thing here is that it isabsolutely clear that monetary policy [alone] just can't do this job.If we don't hold on to the monetary aggregates, inflation gets worse;if we do hold on to them, all we do is put all the pressure on certainsectors of the economy. And [the result is] a very difficult economicsituation unless the government gets out of the way and lets creditdemands come down some. These people who are going around saying thatmonetary policy can do the entire job of getting inflation down arejust terribly destructive. I don't know how in the world we can getthat point over; monetary policy [alone] just won't do it.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I know, but you saw the House BankingCommittee study. It said that the Federal Reserve was entirely toblame for inflation and that the Treasury deficit had no impact.MR. SCHULTZ. I don't understand that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else? Does anybody else want tocomment on the outlook and the dilemmas for monetary policy? Mr.Ford.MR. FORD. I'll make a very brief comment. We're moreoptimistic than your staff because we are more optimistic about theresults of your preaching. By the end of the year we're not outlierson any of these measures that have been tabulated here. But we are onthe lower end [of the range of forecasts] for both unemployment andinflation because we think there is a chance with the newAdministration coming in that we will avert a recession during thefirst half of the year, contrary to the staff forecast. That assumesthat the Fed does its job on the monetary aggregates and further thateventually there is a change in spending and tax policy on stream thatwill have some favorable effects on the economy in real terms. And wethink that by the end of the year the economy won't be booming butwill be going along reasonably well, below the long-term growth pathbut in a positive vein generating growth of about 3 percent on averagein the last two quarters with a reasonable unemployment rate and alower level of inflation than we have right now. That [assumes] thatwe do what we say we're going to do on the aggregates and that peopletake seriously the need to reduce spending to keep the deficit undercontrol. And we are assuming that they will.-96-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Mayo.MR. MAYO. Coming from what with due humility we consider tobe the lousiest performing District--economically speaking we have arecession--what surprises me is that we don't have more differencewith the staff forecast for the national economy. Actually we areright in the center of the range here, which I guess I can attributeto our native optimism that somehow some of this is going to work outall right or, to put it the worst way, that our bad performance thisyear in the Chicago District will somehow be offset by Jerry's greatefforts in the great Northwest, Bill's down in the Southeast, andJohn's in California. We are just going to have to muddle through onthis. I think it's too early to come to Lyle's conclusion that wehaven't really accomplished anything. We have set in place a lot ofthings and, although I'm usually the one who is more despairing ofwhat the Reagan Administration is going to be able to do in the nextyear, I find that some of the comments here today are just toopessimistic for me. If his initial effort looks too small, I thinkthe President is going to have to get into entitlements and he'llfigure that he has three years to reelection and will swallow somesort of change in the indexing provisions now. It's the only way out.Unfortunately, our very vigorous new Budget Director got off on thewrong foot by starting off with proposed big cuts in foreign aid and,bang, he ran right against the new Secretary of State. I submit thathe picked the wrong horse to start his campaign. I think it wouldhave been better if he had started on the domestic side, even thoughthere is always a tendency for a Budget Director to start on foreignaid because it has no voting constituency. Anyway, I think he can getsome spending down; I hope by as much as the staff forecast shows. Iwould say that is fairly optimistic on spending cuts.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Heartfelt comments from an old BudgetDirector!MR. PARTEE. A safe thing to work on, Bob, [in] the deficitis the [debt] servicing [cost]. That could be cut.MR. MAYO. You mean interest rates.MR. PARTEE. Yes.MR. MAYO. Sure, it's only $100 billion! It's up to what--16or 17 percent of the [total budget].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. John Balles.MR. BALLES. Well, I'll just provide a quick littleinteresting piece of perspective here. My staff checked some recentlypublished forecasts by a number of major nationally known outfits suchas Wharton, Evans, Michigan, UCLA, Townsend-Greenspan, DRI, and Chase.I was surprised to find out--maybe you guys already knew it--that ourGreenbook forecast is at the pessimistic end of the scale. That isnot to say that it's wrong, but it does show the lowest real GNP andthe highest inflation.MR. KICHLINE. We have taken a look at that. We don't havecalculated medians for all of those services. I do have the numbersfor four of them. Let me just pick DRI, which I think exemplifies the-97-2/2-3/81problem. It's especially true for 1982. DRI has 13.7 percent nominalGNP growth for 1982. They have real GNP of nearly 4 percent--it's 3.9percent--and the staff has a little under 1 percent. They believethat to be consistent with bill rates that are lower in 1982 than theyare today. I think 13-3/4 percent nominal GNP growth doesn't veryeasily go with 3-3/4 percent money growth and declining bill rates.So, I think the nub of the problem in many of these outside forecastsis that at least implicitly, if not explicitly, different monetaryassumptions lie behind them.MR. SCHULTZ. I would just note that I happen to get BurtCox's forecast for Merrill Lynch economics. I am very much afraidthat the Secretary of the Treasury may be looking at that one becauseit's much more optimistic than yours. And I think therein lies partof the problem.MR. KICHLINE. Well, I have that one. That's a veryinteresting one because it has a 1982 forecast of 13 percent fornominal GNP growth and the interest rates in that Merrill Lynchforecast go down from 14 percent in the current quarter to 6-1/2percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. To 6-1/2 percent?MR. KICHLINE. Yes, to 6-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter of1982.MR. PARTEE. What is that nominal GNP?MR. KICHLINE. Nominal GNP is 13 percent, real GNP I believeis 6.1 percent, and the GNP deflator is 6-1/2 percent.MR. WALLICH. I believe they raised the interest rate levellately.MR. KICHLINE. Well, this was done this week. I don't knowwhat their forecast is.MR. SCHULTZ. That's the problem with this stuff floatingaround: It doesn't bear much relation to reality.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody else have a comment? If not,we are not going to get very far into these long-range targetstonight. It's clear that we have a difficult decision, as always, buta philosophic choice tonight, if I interpret the comments I have heardcorrectly. We are looking at a gloomy business forecast; one view isthat it's constrained by money so we could unconstrain the forecast byincreasing money. The other view is that we should go ahead withmonetary restraint on the basis that the forecast is really going toturn out better or that we need it anyway in terms of the ultimateneed to eliminate inflation. It's a little hard for me to see that wecan adopt the "give up" alternative, if I may term it that, atprecisely this stage in our economic evolution. I try not to beoverly optimistic, and I don't know if I'm being overly optimistic,but I personally think that the Administration is probably going totry harder on the spending side than most of the comments around thistable suggest. What actually is going to be accomplished, I don'tknow. I don't have any number and I don't have any precise-98-2/2-3/81information of this sort. The kind of number that the staff put infor 1982 must be on the order, anyway, of what they are thinking. Andthey are aiming for considerably more than that I am sure by 1983. Ialso sense that they are going to try to get a vote on a big spendingpackage before they do anything on taxes or do it in the same vote insome maneuver. Whether that can be done, who knows? But there is acertain amount of sentiment in the Congress to do something. And ifthis can be maneuvered in a way so that everybody doesn't have to voteone by one on each particular program--if they find some way ofpackaging it so that when it comes to a vote in the Congress as awhole everybody can vote in favor of expenditure restraint and notagainst a particular program--there may be some possibility [ofpassage]. Whether that can be done or not, I don't know. I alsosuspect that, if anything, the tax reduction will come later than thestaff has assumed. I don't think it's going to come any sooner. Butthat all remains to be seen.When I look at our targeting exercise for the next year andrealize that I have to explain it, I will tell you that I am introuble for more reasons than the difficulty of making up a target. Ican barely understand what we are doing in terms of the adjustmentsthat have to be made to last year's [M1] figure in one way or another!I thought it might be useful in the little time we have left [thisevening] to go over the problems as I perceive them so that hopefullywe can talk on more or less consistent grounds tomorrow. That may bemore than I can hope for because I keep getting confused by this everytime I go through it myself. Let's look at something like thenumbers--and I'm just basically worried about the M1 numbers--on page6 [of the Bluebook]. I am sure that Mr. Axilrod will be listeningcarefully to me and will tell me that I am confused by the time I getfinished. For either of the M1 numbers the Bluebook shows the targetranges for '80 and the tentative target ranges for '81 that we hadadopted in July before we knew they were off course or internallyinconsistent. There are some alternative target ranges for '81, whichpresumably are on the same basis as those tentative target ranges.Then it shows as a memo the actual growth in '80, which I don't thinkconforms to any of those targets. As a taking off point, so to speak,it seems to me that we have to think about this in one of two ways.And I just boggle at both as I think about explaining this when I gobefore the [Congressional] committees. One is that we could think ofadjusted ranges for '80 that we presume economically are the same asthose targets that are listed here. These are the shadow cones, so tospeak, that we had. In that case, we would be taking off--it's thesame target presumably, and the same economic substance--[from apoint] consistent with the actual results. That is something like2-1/2 to 5 percent for M-1A and 4-1/2 to 7 percent for M-1B. Is thatroughly right, Mr. Axilrod?MR. AXILROD. That's right. Yes, [it's an adjustment of]about 1-1/4 points for M-1A and .5 or .6 for M-1B.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you think of that assumption in yourhead and you know what change in the target is appropriate--whetheryou want a reduction or unchanged or whatever--you make the assumptionthat the relationship between M-1A and M-1B was the same as last year.That's just a base point for starting. It is not going to be thesame. But just to keep straight in your mind what you are talkingabout, I think you would have those targets in mind that I just gave-99-2/2-3/81orally and then you would talk about a target that was unchanged or[up or down] 1/2 or 1 point or whatever you thought [appropriate] fromthere, on the assumption that the relationship between M-1A and M-1Bwas the same as it was last year.Alternatively, if you wanted to talk in terms of targets likewe had last year, then I think you ought to mentally adjust that memoof the actual growth figure and add to M-1A this unexpected transferout of M-1A. You get something like 6-1/4 percent, which is what itsays in the footnote. For M-1B you have something like 6-3/4 percent.Those numbers are then consistent more or less with the targets on theleft hand side of the page. Now, in fact, what we are going to havethis year, of course, is something quite different from any of these.It's not only going to be different but, because of what went on inJanuary, it is quite clear that in a sense it is going to have a bigdogleg in it. We had a big decline in M-1A in January and thatprobably is proceeding to some extent in February and then will returnto some normal [pattern], while M-1B is going to have a dogleg to theright. I'm just looking at the charts on [subsequent pages], whereM-1B is going to be exaggerated in January and February and thenresume, presumably, some kind of normal growth. Those doglegs botherme a little because if we just show a cone without the dogleg, itimmediately shows figures that are way off the cone and just addsanother element of confusion. I would suggest--I don't know whetherwe can conform to it or not--that we have to make clear what we aretalking about in terms of citing whatever targets we think areappropriate. I'd suggest in the first instance that we forget aboutthe impact of NOW accounts and the institutional change this year justso that hopefully we can keep the communications among ourselvesstraight. I played with the idea in my mind that that should be thetarget we give them, saying that we are not going to give them atarget adjusted for NOW accounts until the January-February businessstraightens itself out, after which we will give them [an adjusted]one, beginning maybe from February just so we avoid this doglegproblem. But, really, one idea is as bad as another. I don't thinkthere is a good way of doing this. In any event, we will have to tellthem that the cone or channel or whatever we have that tracks theactual figures as reported over the course of the year will be subjectto change as the year progresses--maybe every three months or so--aswe evaluate what the actual NOW account impact is.MR. ROOS. Is it feasible to ask the staff to take this tableon page 6 and run off a little supplementary table we can use based onwhatever we are going to talk about tomorrow?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe you could put it down both ways, ifthat's possible, Steve. Just put down the targets the way you havethem but with the figure you cite [in the Bluebook] as the adjustedfigure for last year. Then do it the other way with the ranges forlast year adjusted retrospectively, with the actual results last year.I was going to suggest that there is a third way to do it, but thethird way is very similar to the adjusted actual figure, I guess.Steve's adjusted actual figure still assumes that there is some modesttrend shift between M-1A and M-1B that is going to persist forevermore or less; but it's a very vague estimate, which is part of thedifficulty. I think it might be helpful to put those figures downthose two ways.-100-2/2-3/81I'll make one more comment: Either way we adjust this, theM1 figures come out very close to the top of the range. And we couldthink of taking off from the top of the range instead of from theactual number, if you wanted to. There's not much difference; in asense one could call it base drift or not; it's not a drift outsidethe cone that we had. We can't quite do that with M2, I don't think,because M2, which doesn't have all these other problems, ended up 3/4of a percentage point above the cone. Presumably we have to call thatbase drift, I suppose, or whatever you want. But we can't blur itbecause they are not virtually the same numbers.MR. WALLICH. Isn't base drift from the midpoint and not fromthe edge?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think that's purely semantic. Ifyou think of it from the midpoint, we have base drift under anydefinition. If we don't admit that it's base drift because growth waswithin the cone, we don't have it. It depends; different people havedifferent views of these cones. Some people say the midpoint is theright target and any deviation is [measured from] the midpoint. Otherpeople say that [the cone itself provides] the elasticity one allowsoneself to adjust through the year and we shouldn't consider ourselvesoff course if we're within the cone. I don't think one way is rightand one wrong. It all depends upon how one looks at it.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think monetary policy is going tobe restrictive as hell. Without making the problem any worse foryourself, even though I realize you are only talking about a quarterpoint in the case of the two aggregates--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not really suggesting it for M2;there's virtually no difference because they are so close to--MR. PARTEE. You get this problem--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We just make a different estimate of thetarget when we make it identical.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You're creating a precedent, and itinvolves accepting the base drift. What I'm afraid of is that theprojections on interest rate levels may be right. If we are going tobe talking about interest rates levels as high as are projected here,or current levels, and then we make [our range] somewhat tighter, wemay find that we can't stay the course any longer.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not necessarily arguing for oneor the other. I suggest this as a possible method of presentation, ifwe want to take it. It does create a precedent; some people may thinkthe precedent is good and some people may think it's bad. I thinkwe'd better quit for the evening at any rate. If we could have adifferent piece of paper, it might facilitate [our discussion].MR. AXILROD. Just make that table for M-1A and M-1B?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I think that's all.MR. AXILROD. It's very simple.-101-2/2-3/81 -102-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [We will resume at] 9:30 tomorrow morning.[Meeting recessed]2/2-3/81Session held on February 3, 1981CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can come to order and turn to the long-range targets. Mr. Axilrod has prepared a little table in accordancewith the instructions yesterday, which I hope is as "crystal clear"[as] he described it. It is a difficult thing to keep in mind. It'sconceptually simple but somehow--MR. AXILROD. It's the table, which should be in front ofyou, entitled "Long-run Targets on Alternative Bases." Probably thebest thing to do is for me to go through it stage by stage. The panelon the left-hand side says "Abstracting from shifts to ATS/NOWaccounts." That gives the target ranges for 1980 for M-1A and M-1Bthat the Committee adopted in February of last year and reaffirmed inJuly. There is a 1/2 point differential [between the ranges for M-1Aand M-1B]. The best way to conceive of it is that it reflects somehigher trend growth in M-1B relative to M-1A and some small residualamount of shifting [to ATS/NOW accounts] we expected to occur at thattime in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania; we were unable to[isolate the separate effects of those two developments]. That's howthat 1/2 point differential gets in there. The second panel says"Reflecting shifts to ATS/NOW accounts in 1980." That means theshifts that occurred beyond whatever little residual we thought wasleft--[beyond] that 1/2 point. As you can see, we divided thoseshifts up, assuming two-thirds came from demand deposits and one-thirdcame from savings and other time accounts. That would have loweredthe M-1A target to 2-1/4 to 4-3/4 percent and would have raised the M-1B target to 4-1/2 to 7 percent if the Committee had known in advancewhat those shifts would be and had stated its target that way.Now, it is those ranges to which it is more proper to comparethe actual growth in M-1A and M-1B for the year. As you can see, thatwas 5 percent and 7-1/4 percent, [respectively], roughly 1/4 pointabove the tops of those ranges. Shifting back to the first panel, theadjusted numbers, one can look at that in another way. One could say:If I want to compare the behavior of M-1A and M-1B to their ranges, Ican either adjust the ranges or I can adjust M-1A and M-1B. In thefirst panel you can see that if you take the actual growth in M-1A of5 percent and add 1-1/4 points to it to represent the demand depositsthat were shifted out into ATS and NOW accounts, you get 6-1/4percent; and if you take the actual growth of M-1B of 7-1/4 percentand subtract from it the 1/2 percentage point that represents the NOWaccounts and ATS accounts that came in from savings deposits, you getan M-1B growth of 6-3/4 percent. In both cases, you can see thatgrowth is 1/4 point above the top of the range. You can view theranges and the growth rates in two different ways; [either way growthis] 1/4 point above.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I may just inject here, all of this isbased upon the assumption that Steve mentioned of a two-thirds/one-third shift. Unfortunately, I think that's a rather weak assumption.We don't have much direct evidence during this period. That isinherent moving forward from this point as well as looking backwards,and it's a ballpark figure. That's all one can say about it.MR. MAYO. But the two-thirds, Paul, is implicit both in therange and in the growth figures, is it not?-103-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The same assumption is used for both. Youcan see that either way you look at it, growth in 1980 came out 1/4percentage point above [the ranges]. It's just a different way oflooking at the 1/4 point.MR. AXILROD. If we used one-half and one-half [instead oftwo-thirds and one-third], both the ranges and growth rates would beadjusted by those relevant amounts.MR. PARTEE. Steve, the actual growth figures were 5 and7-1/4 percent last year. Those are the only ones the public hasavailable?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is correct.MR. AXILROD. That's right. I'm not sure if the Chairmandidn't say in some testimony recently--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the published figures are the 5 and7-1/4 percent. In testimony we gave the public those ranges shown inthe right-hand column--that top part. We've never given them theadjusted figure, although it's a mirror image, I think.MR. AXILROD. Now, focusing for a second on the left-handpanel, line 1 there says "Target ranges for 1981 with a 1/2 pointreduction." That simply is going down 1/2 point from the targetranges for 1980. Carrying on the 1/2 point differential by this timereflects whatever we felt was going on in 1980 and continues in 1981.Line 2 is a 1 point reduction, simply going down 1 point. Then thenext line says "Expected adjustment to target ranges to reflect actualshifts to NOW accounts in 1981." Of course, that reflects ourexpectation of the actual shifts at this moment. Our estimate is thatM-1A would go down 7-1/2 percentage points more to reflect the demanddeposits going into NOW accounts and that M-1B would go up 2-1/2points more to reflect the savings deposits or other assets going intoNOW accounts. That's on the present thought that there will be asharp slowing in growth of these accounts beginning pretty muchimmediately and that the shift instead of being four-fifths fromdemand deposits and one-fifth from savings works its way down to two-thirds and one-third. That averages out to about three-fourths, giventhe extent of the shift that occurred earlier in the year, though thatcould, of course, vary. In any event, with that assumption, to getthe adjusted ranges to reflect the actual shifts to ATS and NOWaccounts, you have to take that 7-1/2 points off of the M-1A range,which gives you minus 4-1/2 percent to minus 2 percent. And you haveto add the 2-1/2 points to the M-1B range, which gives you 6 to 8-1/2percent.Shifting over to the second panel and focusing on that"Expected adjusted line," the reason the minus 7-1/2 percent becomesminus 6-1/4 percent and the plus 2-1/2 percent becomes plus 2 percentis that we are carrying forward in the second panel the actual extentof shift that occurred in 1980. That is, if the Committee specifiedits target for M-lA as down 1/2 point from the adjusted range to 1-3/4to 4-1/4 percent and its target for M-1B as down 1/2 point from theadjusted range to 4 to 6-1/2 percent, then it is carrying forward inthose ranges the shifts that occurred in 1980--not the 1/2 pointdifferential between M-1A and M-1B but what turned out ultimately to2/2-3/81be a 2-1/4 point differential. That is being carried forward as if itwere going to occur in 1981. Therefore, the expected adjustment youhave to make is less. In the case of M-1A it's less than 7-1/2percent; it's 6-1/4 percent. In the case of M-1B it's 2 percent. Ofcourse, if you add those in, as you can see in the bottom lines, youget exactly the same numbers in the right-hand panel and the left-handpanel.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's all crystal clear!MR. AXILROD. I'm sure the public will very easily graspthis!MR. SCHULTZ. I think it is clear.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you may now understand why I havedoubts that anybody can explain this. I have great confidence in myability to explain, but...!MR. MAYO. But the $64 question, Paul, is: How are we goingto state our ranges and what will be published?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. That's the question I wantto raise here now. I suggested tentatively yesterday that we may notwant to indicate the bottom line here. I don't know whether it's agood idea; maybe we should. Of course the bottom line is the same,whichever way we [describe it]. If we do state the bottom line, it'sgoing to have to be stated in an exceedingly tentative fashion; wewill have to say that we are prepared to change this every quarter orwhatever, depending simply on an analysis of what is going on. One ofthe difficulties we have is just that the shifts are so big. We havea reasonable appraisal of where this money is coming from at themoment in January. But the actual growth rates are very sensitive tothe assumptions one makes. We do think it's in the ballpark of 75 to80 percent or a little more [from demand deposits]. We will have alittle finer judgment when we get some more thrift institution surveydata. But when we are not having big shifts, it is exceedingly hardto tell what fraction is coming from where because it doesn't distortthe other figures enough to permit a fine judgment. The inherentproblem is that when things are shifting, one can measure it. Whenthings are in a more steady state and people are building up NOWaccount balances, let's say, they are not actually shifting fromdemand deposits; they are just holding a NOW account. The NOW accountgoes up and we don't know whether it's going up because people areholding more transactions balances of the traditional type or whetherit is because there is very little difference--or none in the case ofcommercial banks--in the interest rate, and thus money they mightotherwise have put in a savings account ends up in a NOW account.It's just very difficult to judge; it's a bit of a shot in the dark asto what the adjustments last year imply about what that proportion is.There's just no way to cross-check it, really, I don't think.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There's also a problem that when it'sa big adjustment, even the skeptics recognize that these screwynumbers are a result of the adjustment. But when it is a very minoradjustment, then the skeptics are going to say we are trying to fudgethe figures on the growth [of the aggregates].-105-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. We have the question ofwhether we want to give people those figures on the bottom. In onesense, this is a substantive problem but not a presentational problem.They are the same both ways, although there is a psychological problemin that they look distorted. The other question in trying to explainhow the devil we got there or not even giving those bottom numbers atall is: Should we think in terms of giving them the kind of ranges onthe left-hand side or the right-hand side of this table? It dependsupon where your starting point is. What little foundation has beenlaid is that the public has no actual figures other than 5 percent and7-1/4 percent. They have been exposed a little to the idea that thosetargets last year were mutually inconsistent and should have beenrevised, as shown on the top row [of this table]. Just proceeding onthat basis, I think the presentational problem we have is that theactual 1/2 percentage point reduction in the M-1B range happens to bethe same as the range that they are familiar with for last year. Whenyou look at it at first blush--and maybe it's fifth blush--it looks asif we haven't changed the range, although we are insisting that wehave lowered it. Economically, we have lowered it; but we may have ahelluva time convincing people that we have lowered it when we citethe figures. On the other hand, if we use the other figure, then wehave to say that this is a range that is consistent with an actualfigure that we never gave you. It is [consistent with] an adjustedactual figure, which we are now going to give you--the growth in M-1Blast year was not 7-1/4 percent but 6-3/4 percent--and we will have togo through all that rigmarole. More importantly perhaps at thisstage, I don't think it makes any difference which way we look at itand present it in the end, so long as we are straight in ourconversations today when somebody is citing a range whether they areworking from the right-hand or the left-hand side of this table.MS. TEETERS. I think we would be better off using the right-hand side. Those numbers, the 5 percent and 7-1/4 percent, are inexistence and in the public domain.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the great advantage of using thatside of the table.MS. TEETERS. It seems to me that we would be better offtrying to explain the change in the range than we would trying toadjust the existing numbers.MR. GRAMLEY. I wonder if it wouldn't be helpful also, toreduce the confusion as much as possible, to focus exclusively on M-1Bas the number for narrow money and to think about dropping M-1Aaltogether.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Eventually I think we want to do that. Iwould assume that we would do it next year if we don't do it thisyear. In my mind, the problem with doing it this year is that becausewe are getting switches that expand M-1B artificially in a sense, ithelps in terms of perspective if we also give the M-1A range, whichshows a decline. If [critics] keep saying we haven't reduced therange, we tell them to look at the whole [picture, showing both M-1Band M-1A] and it's obvious that we have. That's the one advantage ofkeeping both of them.-106-2/2-3/81MR. MAYO. Well, Paul, one of the interesting mathematicaloutcomes of Steve's table is that the average of M-1A and M-1B is thesame; whether one takes the target ranges adjusted or unadjusted, itcomes out to 4 to 4-1/8 percent. Now, whether that helps you any orjust confuses the issue--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Which one are you looking at?MR. MAYO. I'm looking at the right-hand figures exclusively.I'm looking at the 1/2 point reduction, which says 1-3/4 to 4-1/4percent for M-1A and 4 to 6-1/2 percent for M-1B.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But they're not the same.MR. MAYO. If you take the midpoint of those two ranges, it's4 percent. If you do the same thing with the adjusted figures on thenext to the last line in the table, the arithmetic mean is 4-1/8percent. I don't know whether we can use that to advantage inexplaining that basically this is merely a switch within the M1concept, [regardless of] what is M-1A and M-1B; I think it's ratherinteresting that it comes out to that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It comes out close, as I guess you said,not quite the same. It would come out the same if the shift were50/50.MR. MAYO. That's right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We cannot say that the shift was not 50/50last year, because we just don't know. If it was 50/50, it justlowered the one range by as much as it raised the other.MR. MAYO. While it sounds like a statistical gimmick toexplain it that way, it does indicate the basic transference betweenthe two to explain the adjusted versus the unadjusted ranges.MR. CORRIGAN. Steve, in terms of the estimate, 50/50 soundsas though it might in fact be closer to what is happening.MR. AXILROD. Well, we don't have any evidence that that'swhat is happening.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you talking about what happened lastyear or now? There is pretty strong evidence that right now the shiftis at least three-fourths. But our assumption is that that's verymuch a transitional thing during the first stages of this.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, that's one of the things I wanted to askabout. I don't know to what extent it's representative, but at leastin the Ninth District virtually all of it is coming from ATS accounts.MR. AXILROD. These are net shifts, so [a shift from an ATSto a NOW account] doesn't affect this. Both ATS and NOW accounts arein other checkable deposits, so that doesn't lead to an increase inother checkable deposits.MR. CORRIGAN. My question is: What happens to the originalsavings account, the second leg of the existing ATS account? At the-107-2/2-3/81precise moment in time that the switch is effected, the balance has tobe in the demand deposit part of the ATS account, but that's only atthat precise moment. The day before or the hour before it was in asavings deposit.MR. PARTEE. Which is counted as other checking.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, that's what I'm wondering.MR. AXILROD. Yes, sure. If it was an ATS account and we gotthe data from a bank that was reporting accurately, we added [it to]other checkable deposits.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, the shift from an ATS accountshouldn't affect this, if everything is being reported correctly.MR. CORRIGAN. Okay, I guess that's my question. And you areas comfortable as you can be [about that]?MR. AXILROD. It's clear, I suppose, once there are a lot ofNOW accounts, that to whatever extent people made use of a savingsaccount before they are going to put their savings in a NOW accountfor a while instead. So, eventually, we assume that this will be amuch more complicated animal to evaluate; it's going to move not justas a transaction account but as something that's a mix between atransaction and a savings account.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the real trouble, I think. Oncethe NOW account has been created, it will inherently have somecharacteristics of a savings account and not the old style transactionaccount.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, the average balance says that.MS. TEETERS. Will we ever know for sure what the shiftswere?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No. Nothing is for sure.MS. TEETERS. Well, we won't have any information on this.MR. AXILROD. We asked the banks early in January and we hadasked them at one point last year--I forget exactly when. The resultslast year were not inconsistent with the two-thirds/one-thirdproportions that we had derived from past experience. But it couldn'tbe proved one way or the other.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can ask a bank where the shift comesfrom. We may not get an accurate answer, but at least we can ask it.MR. FORD. They don't know.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In some cases they think they know, butthe answers are pretty much all over the lot. It is at least aconcrete question to ask them. Once the shift has taken place and weask them why their NOW accounts have gone up, they don't know what themotivation of the customer is.-108-2/2-3/81MR. FORD. Even those banks that try to monitor it only havepartial information about where the money going in [came from]. Iwould say you are very right to be concerned about our vulnerabilityfor surprises on the M-1B range adjusted, whichever one we choose. Wehave done in depth what you are suggesting with some S&Ls and somebanks. We asked them what they expect. The very limited feedback Iget is essentially that the S&Ls are just delighted by how all theirprojections are being overrun; they are not sure how much of it iscoming out of [banks]. On their own internal accounts they can tracksome of the switches from one account to another, but on the netinflow of funds to NOWs they don't know exactly.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We had people from the National Savingsand Loan Association in here the other day and they had done some kindof a survey. This is the smallest part; most of the shifting is inthe commercial banks. But for what it is worth, they said theirsurvey showed 60 percent was coming out of their own accounts, whichmeant basically savings accounts; 40 percent was coming fromelsewhere. They couldn't identify where "elsewhere" was, but theyassumed it was mostly from commercial bank checking accounts. Butthat's one survey of the S&Ls. Now, the banks have given us thesurveys that you people made and had tabulated, weighted probablyincorrectly. That showed more than 80 percent of it, in this firstblush, coming out of their own checking accounts. So, these figuresreflect some casual weighting together of the relatively small thriftsand the relatively big commercial banks at over 80 percent. For thethrifts I don't know whether to assume 50/50 and then come up withsomething like 80 percent for the combined total for these weeks. Butthey expect, as Steve said, that this will decline when we get overthe initial shift.MR. FORD. This assumes what--that $13 or $16 billion out of$40 billion for the whole year is already behind us?MR. AXILROD. Yes, that's the monthly average [for January].Effectively, it's $20 billion going in from then, so it's almost half.MR. FORD. Looking at the numbers, my feeling is that theassumption that in one month we already have half of the full year'sshift is where we are most vulnerable.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. That is why I think we have toretain the right to change these [ranges]. Let me say that we notonly have survey data now, for what it's worth, but that these shiftsare so big that it does not appear that we can explain a large part ofthe shift by an exceptional decline in savings accounts. Savingsaccounts have been declining pretty fast, but they were decliningpretty fast in December. And money market funds are going up veryrapidly now. So, if you make some allowance for how much is going outof savings deposits into money market funds, there isn't all that biga residual left to explain what is going into NOW accounts. Thattends to confirm that most of it came out of checking accounts on thefirst blush.MR. MAYO. Well, Paul, the fascination of this arithmeticthat I was just doing is that basically averaging the two--M-1A and M-1B--neutralizes the transfer evaluation problem. All one is doing inthat way is just isolating what smaller part of this may have come-109-2/2-3/81from M2 into one of the M1s. It seems to me that perhaps part of thedefense we could use when people say our figures are no good on thesetransfers is that it really doesn't matter if one looks at M-1A andM-1B together.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It literally does not matter if you couldmake an assumption that it is coming half and half; you would getmathematical precision in that answer. But it does throw it off assoon as you depart from that assumption.MR. MAYO. Well, now wait a minute. I don't think the halfand half has much to do with what I'm saying. I am only saying thatwe are neutralizing; it doesn't matter whether it's half and half ortwo-thirds or three-fourths. This averaging says how much is comingfrom M2 or somewhere outside of the M1 concept.MR. PARTEE. Well, the averaging gives a nice low figure.That's all one can say.MR. AXILROD. I'm not sure I follow your averaging.MR. MAYO. Well, I don't want to take time here.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, in fact, we are never going to knowin the end how much came out of M2 and M1.MR. MAYO. The more we can make the transfer issue asubsidiary issue, the less trouble we are going to get into on that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The other way of handling it is the wayGovernor Teeters suggested last time: Add savings deposits. Thetrouble with that is that it's quite evident right now that savingsdeposits are declining very rapidly for entirely extraneous reasons,so that doesn't give any satisfactory answer.MR. GRAMLEY. The reasons aren't entirely extraneous. If weput on monetary restraint--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, extraneous to these shifts here. Ithink all we have to do at the moment for purposes of our discussionnow--we have presentational problems--is decide whether we want totalk off the right side of the sheet or the left side of the sheet.MR. ROOS. The left side is easier because those are thefigures we have used in the past. It seems to me we have to recognizethat there will be a period of adjustment. I feel more comfortableusing the left side, not that I don't think we could adjust to eitherone. But in your testimony last year, for example, you talked about 4to 6-1/2 percent for M-1B; and our Bluebooks and our actions last yearwere all based on the figures as shown in the left column. I'm just alittle more comfortable with them, but we can use either one if westick with it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The really important thing is that we keepin mind in our comments which one we are talking about. We can talkabout both of them, I guess, and decide the presentational issuesafterwards. Let me just say one other thing, which I didn't sayyesterday. The President is going to make a speech on Thursday; he's-110-2/2-3/81going to present a State of the Union Message or some kind of longmessage outlining his economic program on the 18th. I think that isthe current schedule. It's always possible that that is going toslip. At the moment my testimony is scheduled for the 19th. Thatprobably will be delayed for that reason and, with the agreement ofthe [Congressional] committees, we will submit the report after thestatutory deadline so that we have a chance to write the report in thelight of what the President says. I don't mean delay very long. Itwould be, say, Tuesday of the following week instead of Friday the20th of the previous week. It is more likely than not that the wholeschedule will be shoved back by several days in the light of thePresident's schedule, although I can't be certain of it. There is asubstantive problem, to the extent it's relevant, that conceivablyknowing what the President has to say might shade our own judgmentshere. I only say this because I don't know that we have to beabsolutely conclusive today. I'd like to come as close to it aspossible and make at the very least a tentative judgment; but we canreconfirm it between now and whatever date [the report is made]. Whatis today's date? Today is the third, so we're talking almost threeweeks before we actually report. We may or may not want to make useof that [interval].MS. TEETERS. We may also want to shift [the ranges] in July,which we haven't done for the past two years, because we will have abetter idea of how much of the program is going to pass Congress. Theshape of the program may be very different from what has been proposedthis month.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, we may be able to take some accountof that, but we won't know how Congress will react. We won't know alot of things, so there will be some continuing uncertainties. Theonly other thing I would say as a preliminary point--in terms ofpsychology, imagery, and substance in the light of what we have saidin the past--is that I don't see how we can avoid some reduction insome or all of these targets, properly interpreted. I'm not sayingjust what the arithmetic is going to look like, but--MR. PARTEE. We are going to have to move M2 up, Paul.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let us discuss it now at this point.Who would like to comment?MR. WALLICH. We'll have some base drift anyway over twoyears that at least offsets or more than offsets the reduction--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let us proceed. Who would like tocomment? Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. I'd like to suggest, Paul, if we do go aheadwith M-1A and M-1B guidelines for 1981, that we state the guidelinesabstracting from shifts in NOW accounts. In other words, I'deliminate this bottom section because, with all due respect to thequality of our staff, I don't think they can possibly come close inestimating the shifts. The prima facie case is the fact that theywere off by $13 billion in the first week. And the idea that we aregoing to see half of the total annual adjustment to NOW accounts inone month goes against the grain of all prior experience. I justdon't believe it.-111-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think there is any doubt that thestaff or anybody's staff or any member is incapable of making areliable judgment at this point on how big these shifts are going tobe. The only issue is whether to give a figure and say we are goingto revise it freely or not to give a figure at all. But I fullyaccept what you say about the impossibility of [accurate estimates].MR. MORRIS. The problem with giving a figure is that that iswhat the press and the market will be taking as our target. And tothe extent that we deviate from it, they are going to say that we areagain not meeting our guidelines. It puts us in a very vulnerableposition to establish guidelines on the basis of estimates that couldhave a margin of error of plus or minus 100 percent or maybe more.MS. TEETERS. That is the advantage of keeping M-1A. If wehave to raise the M-1B range later, it will show up as a reduction inthe M-1A range, so we could show our--MR. MORRIS. Not necessarily. Right now, with the ceilingsthe same on demand deposits and NOW accounts, it seems to me that itwould be in the interest of any banker to say to a customer: "Look,if you want a NOW account, fine; but let's please close your savingsaccount because there is no point in having two accounts." Maybeshifts out of savings haven't been so great in the first week, butthat doesn't mean that they can't be great later on.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Of course, what really bothers me is notonly that we cannot estimate this shift now but that we won't be ableto estimate it very accurately after the year is over. Do you want tocomment on the substance of where the target--whether shadow orotherwise--should be?MR. MORRIS. Well, no. I think the important thing is thatwhatever targets we establish be ex NOW accounts.MR. SCHULTZ. Do you think that's easier, Frank? If we putour targets [that way], when the money supply figures come out theyare going to be different from our targets. The average person in thepublic doesn't understand all of these things. And anybody who doestry to look at the money supply figures--though I guess that's not theaverage public to start with--will see that we publish target rangesand then the numbers that come out are outside of these ranges. Isn'tit better--MR. MORRIS. That's why my position is that we should have noM1 targets but simply have targets for the larger aggregates.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just so that the discussion can proceed,let's try to resolve how we present the targets after we decide whatthey should be, recognizing that there is an issue there. Yourposition is that we shouldn't have an M1 target at all.MR. MORRIS. Right.MR. PARTEE. I just can't agree with that.112-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you are going to have plenty of timeto say whether you agree or not. What M2--or M3--target would youlike to have, Mr. Morris?MR. MORRIS. I would take the lower ones, alternative II.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You'd actually raise them from thisyear's?MR. MORRIS. Well, I would rather not raise them from thisyear's; I'd like to have the staff explain to me why we apparentlymust do that. Obviously, I'd prefer to have a somewhat lower range.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's have a staff exegesis of that point.MR. AXILROD. I don't think it's a matter of "must," butessentially it's because last year growth in M2 was almost 1percentage point above the target of 6 to 9 percent. We don't havemuch evidence of significance in the past two years that velocity ofM2 rises or falls much. What seems to be developing is that, becauseof institutional changes, we now have assets in M2 on which the ratesoffered by institutions vary with market rates. So, the spreadsbetween the active part of those assets and market rates don't open upto the extent they used to and we don't get large shifts in and out ofthose deposits to the extent we used to. Therefore, it doesn't seemunreasonable to think that we wouldn't get much change in the velocityof M2 this year. In fact, we have assumed about a 1 percentage pointincrease in velocity because we have a GNP projection of 9-1/2 percentfor the year and alternative I assumes an M2 growth of about 8-1/2percent. So, in our projection of what is consistent with M-1A and M-1B we are allowing for about a 1 percentage point increase in thevelocity of M2. Another factor to consider, of course, if you look atit from the credit side and not from the side of the public's demandfor assets, is that M2 except for the large CDs that are in M3 isessentially institutional credit. And given our estimates of theamount of mortgages and consumer loans and so forth that have to befinanced at banks, we think banks are going to have to bid for acertain amount of funds to meet those demands and to maintain theirplace in the market. So, those are the factors that get us to thisestimate, which is higher than the Committee's tentative range adoptedin July. I would say also that at midyear we were assuming that M2growth was going to be high in the Committee's range for 1980 or even[above it]. We never expected it to be down toward the midpoint ofthat 6 to 9 percent range for 1980. Those are essentially thereasons.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just as a little aside on the precisionwith which these figures are calculated and the weight put on smalldeviations from the target range: M2 got benchmarked 0.3 of apercentage point higher based upon a one-day observation on call dataof RPs for nonmember banks in March.MR. AXILROD. I thought it was only one or two tenths.MR. MORRIS. Well, after that explanation, Mr. Chairman, Ithink I would stay with the tentative guidelines for M2 and M3 weestablished last year.-113-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You mean 6 to 9 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2percent, in other words?MR. MORRIS. I mean 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M2 and 6-1/2to 9-1/2 percent for M3.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Wait a minute. You are going from thesedown to where?MR. MORRIS. Steve says that he would expect [M2] to becoming in at the upper end of the range, but that our GNP projectionis compatible with 8-1/2 percent on M2. If you want to make that 9percent, that would be all right with me. We can make it 6 to 9percent for M2 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent for M3. If there's ever ayear when we ought to have a tight monetary guideline, it's this year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. Who else? Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think your comment a while agoprovided a good backdrop for the statement of these guidelines. Wehave to show some lowering in the ranges. Trying to get at how muchthat ought to be is a very difficult question. It's helpful if we goback and look at what we got in 1979 and 1980. I'm not sure I havethe right figures on this, because I'm not sure exactly what the NOWaccount adjustment should have been for 1979. But as best we canestimate--Steve, you can correct me if this is wrong--it looks as ifM-1B was running about 6.5 percent in 1979, abstracting from NOWs andthat sort of thing, and came out at about 6.8 percent in 1980.Comparable figures for M-1A would have been 6-1/2 percent--althoughI'm not quite certain of that one--for 1979 and 6-1/4 percent for1980. On M2, we don't have that adjustment problem; M2 grew 9 percentin 1979 and 9.8 percent in 1980. So, in general, we could say thatthere was a small deceleration in M-1A and there was a smallacceleration in M-1B probably.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I may just interrupt you, Bob: On whatpage in the Bluebook are these past annual figures?MR. BLACK. They are not in there.MR. AXILROD. It's page 5, but we don't have the adjustedfigure for M-1A in there.MR. BLACK. What we did--and I'm not sure we are right--wasto construct that, but the latest information we had was that about 45percent was assumed to have come [from] savings. I wouldn't put toomuch stock in the figures I got; the main point I am trying to make isthat there has been either no deceleration or comparatively little.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's an interesting point. I wasjust wondering, Steve: Do you have any rough figures?MR. AXILROD. I don't have them with me but I can get them.I'll get them and report.MR. BLACK. I don't think that changes my point, but I wouldlike to know those figures and would welcome having them. Anyway,there hasn't been a whole lot [of deceleration], so I would opt for-114-2/2-3/81alternative II. One could argue that that's too much deceleration,but another point--the matter of base drift, which I think our criticsare going to raise on this--is that lowering the range by 1 point in asense compensates in large part for that upward drift in the base forboth M-1A and M-1B since the ranges in alternative II would encompassa 1/2 percentage point downdrift in our [tentative] '81 targets, usingthe midpoint of the fourth quarter of last year as the base. Forexample, if we came out right at the midpoint of the target I'msuggesting, it would involve actual growth of M-1B from the fourthquarter of 1980 figure of about 3.2 percent, which would be within therange of 3 to 5-1/2 percent. But to a large extent it's to get rid ofthat base drift that we advocate this. I don't think we could reallysay that we want to raise the rate of growth expressed from thatmidpoint. That just doesn't make any sense. We are up here somewhereand we can't say: Well, the targets start down here. But in choosinghow much we want them to come down, I think we have to consider that.So far as what we publish for the public, that is adevilishly difficult question. I reached a point that is somewhat ofa compromise of what Larry Roos said in that I think in choosing ourtargets we have to abstract from the NOW accounts. But in expressingthese targets, I can visualize all the close Fed observers out theresetting up megaphones in charts like those in the lower tier of theones in the Bluebook and putting in the figures as they come in. Andunless we give them those ranges at the bottom, with all the caveatsthat ought to go with them, they are going to have problems fittingthe figures into anything like this. I think we ought to say onefurther thing, which relates to something I believe you were trying toget at as we closed yesterday: That we think this is loaded heavilyon the front end. That is, we expect to have excessive growth in M-1Bearly and then to see it come back within the target, we hope;similarly, we expect very weak growth [in M-1A] in the first part ofthe year and we are going to be outside our range but hope to be in[by year-end]. I don't know of an easy way to do it. It's going tobe awfully confusing. But on balance that seems to me the best way todo it; I think it is what Nancy was advocating.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just get clear where you are. Ifyou were working from the left-hand side of the sheet handed out thismorning, you are talking about 3 to 5-1/2 percent for M-1B?MR. BLACK. That's right, yes sir.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have 2-1/2 to 5 percent for M-1A.What about M2 and M3?MR. BLACK. I would just accept the ranges that the staff hasworked out as compatible, as indicated in alternative II.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You are not unhappy about going higher?MR. BLACK. No, I don't really have any insight that wouldlead me to suspect their figures. I'd rather trust theirs than ours.If it were not for the base drift, I would opt for alternative I. Ithink that would be sufficient deceleration. It's not implausible toargue [for a deceleration] since we overshot. In a sense, we can'tget away from that and we shouldn't slow it down too fast. But I dothink people are going to raise that matter of base drift; and unless-115-2/2-3/81we can say we somehow considered it, I think we are going to have someproblems on that from the public. This seems to me an easier way ofdoing it because the only kind of growth rates that are going to makesense to a layman are the growth rates from where we ended up. That'sabout all I believe any layman is going to understand. Tomorrow, I'mnot going to understand!MR. PARTEE. May I ask Jim a question about this? The wholebusiness is just so unclear to me. If President Black'srecommendation were accepted by the Committee, would that be a tightermonetary growth target than you assumed in the Greenbook? He's optingfor the 1 point [reduction]--that is, alternative II, with M2 and M3the way they are specified here. Would that be tighter than yourassumption in the Greenbook?MR. KICHLINE. We would perceive it to be tighter; we vieweither M-1A or M-1B to be more closely related to developments in theeconomy than M2. So, as I understand it, [Mr. Black's recommendation]would be a 1 point reduction on ranges for the narrower aggregates,which is 1/2 point tighter than we had assumed.MR. PARTEE. So you keyed in on alternative I, in effect. Isthat right?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They keyed to the midpoint of that. Idon't know whether it implies necessarily--MR. KICHLINE. It's 8-1/2 percent on M2.MS. TEETERS. What would this do to your nominal GNP growth?MR. KICHLINE. Well, it would be down a little. I must saythat I would treat all of this with a great deal of caution.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else? Governor Wallich.MR. WALLICH. Bob Black to some extent has made my speech forme because I, too, think that the seeming severity of these targets issomewhat modified by the base drift. Now, the base drift could befigured from the midpoint. Then it would have been, I think, 1-1/2points for M-1A and M-1B; I was wrong yesterday in saying it was 2-1/2points because I didn't take into account the revised numbers in thefootnote. On M2 I think it's 2-1/4 points, if you start from the edgeof the band, assuming that we allow ourselves leeway at least up tothe edge of the band. There's still a little leeway, 1/4 point, onM-1A and M-1B, and 1 percent on M2. So what we do in the way ofpulling down under either alternative I or II we undo by this basedrift. It's true that this is money that went into the economy in1980 and it isn't going to go in hereafter. But Chuck Parteeyesterday made the point that getting back on track really meansrunning below track for a while if we have been above track. So thePartee integral, as it were--money under that curve--is stabilized.By the same principle, I think we have to look at the overshoot. I amsomewhat encouraged by reading that on our new money demand functionthese projections really involve an upward shift of the curve, eventhough they involve an expectation of a downward shift on the oldcurve. In other words, we would have a fair reason to expect thatshift for M-1A and M-1B. I'm not happy with M2, and I would suggest-116-2/2-3/81pulling that down. It's true that we really can't control it verywell; maybe controlling the economy is the only way of controlling M2.But I fear that it's going to be our one reliable guide if M-1A and M-1B behave peculiarly because of the adjustments; and there is thepossible acceleration of growth in M-1B as savings accounts aretransferred into it. The levels of M2 proposed here under eitheralternative I or II allow for fairly good growth of nominal GNP, sothat actually looks to me like a fairly comfortable target; if webelieve that there's some tendency for V2 to rise, it's excessive.To come down to choices: First, in stating the numbers, Iwould leave out the recent shifts--they're too uncertain--and modifythe numbers later; second, I would go to alternative II; third, inalternative II, I would modify M2 a little and take it to 6 to 9percent instead of 6-3/4 to 9-3/4 percent and I would pull M3 downaccordingly. But I haven't really thought M3 out, and I'm quiteflexible on that. Thank you.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not quite sure what you are sayingabout the targets we should state for M1.MR. WALLICH. I meant to say the left side of the sheetwithout the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without the bottom row?MR. WALLICH. Yes, without the bottom because that then givesus comparability. I understand what Nancy says: The figures thepublic knows about are those on the right-hand side. We will have tosupply continuous translations of the visible figures into the targetfigures.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The discussion that istaking place around this table this morning suggests that there'senough confusion, and we should not confuse the public further by yourtestimony late in February. With that premise, it seems fairly clearto me that we have no choice, as you stated earlier this morning, butto publish growth ranges for the year 1981 that are lower than what wehad in 1980, even though we didn't achieve them. Thus, I would optfor alternative I, the straight 1/2 percentage point reduction in theM-1A and M-1B ranges from the published ranges of 1980 without thebottom line that's on the left-hand side. With respect to M2 and M3,I'm inclined just to adopt ranges that are 1/2 percentage point belowwhat we established for 1980 as well, with a caveat or an explanationwhen you testify that at the time of the required July testimony youwill reveal all of these shifts, believing that most of the shifts inNOWs will have taken place by that time. You would describe then whathappened in 1980 and 1981 but with the assurance that we're movingtoward a bit more restraint in 1981 than we had in 1980.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I basically agree with what RogerGuffey has suggested: the 1/2 point reduction on the M1 ranges. Wemight consider a somewhat different approach on M2 and M3, however.It seems to me that you could say to the [Congressional] committee-117-2/2-3/81that, given the uncertainty with regard to the new instruments and thestructural and transitional shifts, we want to widen the range. Wecould widen it symmetrically and make it 5 to 10 percent instead of 6to 9 percent. Or, if we feel there would be too much criticism of thewidened range, then I would say that we are keeping it at 6 to 9percent but we will have a clearer fix on it in July. Therefore, weare putting the committee on notice that we can't assess the effect ofthese structural shifts and these new financial instruments completelyand that in July the numbers may be different and the targets for therest of the year may be different.MR. PARTEE. But those shifts wouldn't do much to M2, wouldthey?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm not talking about the NOWaccounts here. I'm talking about the developing financialinstruments--the money market funds or six-month money marketcertificates.MR. PARTEE. Oh, I see.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It seems to me that even though onecan borrow against a six-month money market certificate, at least atCitibank, some of the components of M2 such as that, which are growingfast, are much closer to investments than to money in the transactionssense. Now, I know one can write a check on a money market fund but,even so, the people I see and speak with are considering these thingsand the rates paid on them to be much closer to Treasury bills, forexample, than to passbook savings. So, we're getting into a new areawith this kind of instrument and it seems to me we can argue eitherfor a broader range for this year or for temporarily keeping the samerange and then reporting on it in July.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Schultz.MR. SCHULTZ. Well, abstracting from the Partee integral andthe Wallich differential and given my lack of confidence in theforecast and estimates of velocity and inflation, I have a veryunscientific proposal. I think we ought to lower the M-1A and M-1Branges by 1/2 percentage point from the ranges of last year and keepM2 and M3 where they were last year. It seems to me that we knew inthe middle of last year that the relationships between the M1s and M2and M3 were not right. We probably should have changed those rangesin July, and I don't think we're going to catch a lot of flak by notchanging them now. I do think that most people still look at M1,particularly M-1B now, so I feel it's important to lower that by 1/2percentage point. But it seems to me that, given the uncertainties,that's about the best we can do.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What would you do about the bottom row?MR. SCHULTZ. Bank credit?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No.MR. SCHULTZ. Oh, you mean how to present it?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.-118-2/2-3/81MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I agree with Nancy that it's easier totalk in terms of the actual money supply data than to try to [adjust]the money supply figures as they're coming out week-by-week [in orderto] abstract from [the shifts] every week. I think it's easier to tryto explain it one time rather than every week, and that's what we'dhave to do. So, it seems to me better to go ahead and make thechanges in the target ranges and try to explain it and do it one time.To have to go through that process each week when the figures come outwould be much more confusing than to try to tinker with the targets.Either way is lousy, but the one is lousier than the other.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Fred assumes that he can survive[without] impeachment! The [Congressional] committee--MR. SCHULTZ. Well, sometimes Chairmen are expendable.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. There is a two-part process to this targetbusiness. One is the setting of the targets and the other is thehitting of the targets. Today, setting the targets is uppermost inour minds but, as the year goes on, hitting them becomes important. Ithink the realities of the economy, given what we see for nominal GNPand the outlook for fiscal policy, are such that we'd be very lucky tohit even the upper end of alternative I, let alone the midpoint, oreven [the upper end of] alternative II. Even with a reasonableeffort, we'd be lucky to hit the upper end of alternative I. But Ifavor alternative I and I would key on M-1B. I think that's what mostpeople look at, and I would emphasize the 1/2 percentage pointreduction there. I would make the other Ms compatible with that, andI think that means that we do have to raise the M2 and M3 ranges. Asfar as the presentation, I would drop the bottom half of the chart;the top half is confusing enough.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, nearly all of the economicforecasts indicate little or no growth for this year. Our ownforecast, of course, indicates almost no growth, at 0.1 percent for1981. I would prefer to see the targets set at a level that wouldpermit some real growth during the year. But we appear to becommitted to this 1/2 percentage point reduction in the target ranges.I hope we're not committed to a 1/2 point reduction every yearhereafter, but we do seem to be so committed this year. It seems tome that any pulling back from that would be interpreted as backing outof our commitment to monetary restraint. So, I would go along withwhat almost everyone has recommended so far--alternative I. I wouldtake the target ranges specified under alternative I for M-1A and M-1Bas well as for M2 and M3. I take it that the ranges suggested for M2and M3 are those thought most consistent with the 1/2 percentage pointreduction of the M-1A and M-1B ranges.I'd just like to add something else. I would normally notwant to take political considerations into account, but it seems to meto be an especially bad time to risk any kind of politicalconfrontation. The Administration is seeking some real economicgrowth. While it calls for a policy of monetary restraint, it alsoemphasizes the need for a steady monetary policy. The word "steady"-119-2/2-3/81appears in all of their pronouncements about monetary policy. Itseems to me that increasing monetary restraint at this time is not asteady monetary policy. So, any increased restraint beyond what wehave previously committed ourselves to--for example, [going] to a 1percentage point reduction--I'm sure would be seen as not very steady.So, the ranges that have been proposed under alternative I would bethe most restrictive, consistent with any possible growth at all.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What would you do about the bottom row?MR. RICE. I would throw that out. I wouldn't try to explainthat.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roos.MR. ROOS. Yes sir, Mr. Chairman. I'll be brief but pleasedon't interpret my brevity as an inability to go through much of whathas already been said. I would opt for alternative I. I believe weare committed to a policy of steady restraint with a gradual reductionin the rate of money growth in order to have an impact ultimately onreducing the core rate of inflation. Intellectually, especiallyrecognizing that a rather overly expansive growth of money might haveoccurred last year--we were a bit above the top of our M-1B range--tojam that down too abruptly could have serious effects on the realeconomy. I think a 1/2 percentage point reduction in the M-1B rangeand a commensurate reduction in the ranges for the other aggregates isin order. It maintains consistency with what we announced last year.I agree with what someone else said that the real key is our abilityto achieve our targets. I don't think our problem in the past fewyears has been one of setting incorrect targets; it has essentiallybeen our inability to achieve those targets. We talked about thatyesterday, and I expressed my reservations. In sum, I would opt foralternative I, omitting the bottom portion of it.MR. SCHULTZ. I'm not sure I understand. What would you dowith M2 and M3?MR. ROOS. I would go with alternative I.MR. SCHULTZ. All the way down the line?MR. ROOS. All the way down the line, recognizing that in ourpeculiar way of looking at things we will concentrate on M-1B. But Icertainly would not be unhappy with [that].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Mayo.MR. MAYO. My first fascination, Mr. Chairman, was with theM-1A and M-1B ranges of alternative II on the grounds that it helpedget over any problems you might have in testifying with regard to basedrift. The longer I thought about that, the more I came to theconclusion that the base drift isn't significant enough, at least inthinking it through myself, to cause you that much trouble. As apractical matter, I think we're better off with alternative I afterall. It retains the promise of a 1/2 percentage point [reduction] andI think we might be risking more economic stagnation with a 1percentage point promise. I find it congenial to go right down theline on alternative I. I don't think we need to worry about the M2-120-2/2-3/81problem. The 7 to 10 percent looks higher; it is higher than our old6 to 9 percent, again because of the farther drift that we have fromthe aggregates that we can control. I would have a very minorqualification if the Committee were to accept alternative II for anyreason, and that is that I'd get rid of those quarter points. We'reboxing ourselves in too closely using quarter points; it's better tohave either 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 or 7 to 10 percent than to try to split itinto quarters. I think that's foolish precision. So, I would comedown with alternative I.I wish I could agree with Fred Schultz that we could explainthis once and not have to go over it every week. But as long as wehave weekly money supply figures, I'm resigned to our fate of havingto explain this every week. We're going to have to be prepared to usepublicly both sets of figures; we should decide on the emphasis,though, right off the bat and then gear it each time to remind peoplewho only look at these for 20 minutes on a Friday afternoon orwhenever they pick up their papers. They will say: "Oh yes, Iremember something about that." And then they will come back the nextweek and have forgotten all about it and we will have to say the samething over again. I think we will have to do that. Even though itmay seem to add confusion, I think it actually will add someclarification in the public mind.MR. BLACK. Bob, do you mean that each week you would publisha figure abstracting from NOW accounts?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we can do that.MR. MAYO. I don't think we would do that, but we shouldindicate our caveat every week--the principle that's involved here.MR. ROOS. Would it be feasible, Mr. Chairman, in view of theproblem we will have in the next few months, to use that as a hook tosuspend temporarily the publication of the weekly figures? Is thereany sense in that?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's not raise that subject rightnow. You're saying, Mr. Mayo, don't give these bottom row targets?MR. MAYO. I don't think we need to go to the extent ofgiving the precise figures, but we should give some qualitative caveatevery week when we publish the data as to what they mean.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, on the presentational part, Ithink we have to try to get as much emphasis focused on the right-handpart of that table as we can. I agree very much with Governor Schultzon that point. On the substance, I come out for alternative Ibasically, partly because I'm not too concerned about this base drifteither. After we get through, no one will be able to tell what it is.Also, I think alternative II really runs a risk of wrenching the[economy] too hard. I am a little concerned about the larger numberson the ranges for the broader aggregates. I just wonder whether wecouldn't look at M2 and M3 as 7 to 9 and 7 to 10 percent. That is alittle narrower on M2, but I'm not sure that's all bad if Steve isright about the things that are happening there. I'm most concerned-121-2/2-3/81about bank credit because, given what is happening in the economy andgiven that so many of our big firms are continuing to lose money andall the rest, there is going to be a lot of lending activity in banks[this] year. So, I would not be allergic to putting bank credit at 7to 10 percent either. In sum, I would have the M1 ranges as theyappear in alternative I; I'd take a chance on 7 to 9 percent on M2 and7 to 10 percent on M3 and bank credit.As for the presentational part, if I were you I might even bewilling to go a bit further and come fairly close to committing togoing back [to Congress] as early as April to try to explain what hashappened and what these numbers might mean. If you do that, this ideathat Bob Mayo had earlier might have some merit in the [period of]transition. That would be to try to use an average of the right-handcolumn for M-1A and M-1B--not as a firm target, but as a talkingpoint. You could then say without a great deal of difficulty incommunication that basically we're shooting for the average of M-1A anM-1B to grow within a 3 to 5 percent range during this period in whichthe transitional problem is the greatest. The 3 to 5 percent average,I think, does encompass the range of possibilities that we're thinkingof in terms of the shift. And they are convenient numbers becauseeven the upper end falls below the numbers that everybody has beenlooking at in terms of actual growth in the narrow aggregates for thepast year. I don't know how it would work out in precise terms, but Ifor one would not be allergic to trying to use that handle as a way toget over the worst part of this transition, leaving open as I said thepossibility of going back up there as early as April.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters.MS. TEETERS. I'm not really enthusiastic about lowering theranges at all. We've been concentrating on page 6, but if you turn topage 7 it shows that the implied interest rates are extremely high.If we had to publish our projections of interest rates, we might havea different attitude toward this. Even with a 1/2 percentage pointreduction, the economic outlook is extraordinarily bad. We've usedevery gimmick we could to get [the economy] not to decline, includingshifts in demand for money and higher rates of velocity. All sorts ofthings could go wrong, and there's no room for any slippage at thispoint in that projection. But I see I'm all alone in not wanting tolower the ranges, so I could go along with taking them down the 1/2percentage point. I would strongly support Governor Rice in sayingthat I don't see anything in this system that says we have to take theranges down year after year. There is a certain amount of moneygrowth that is necessary in this economy. If we keep this up, we'regoing to get to zero [money growth] and we're going to have five yearsof total stagnation if we commit ourselves to that course. So, Iwould support alternative I as stated in the Bluebook. If my memoryserves me right, last year we didn't like the ranges on M2 and M3 thatwere said by the staff to be consistent with our range on M1, so welowered them. And we missed them. I think the best judgment as towhat are the most consistent numbers is that being provided by ourstaff. Even though [lower ranges for M2 and M3] look cosmeticallynice, we could be sitting here a year from now with the same result:That we had cosmeticly nice looking ranges and then missed them by theamount that the staff said we were going to miss. So, I stronglysuggest that we take alternative I as specified.-122-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is that what we did last year?MS. TEETERS. Yes. What we did was to take the M-1A and M-1Bchoice but we didn't like the looks of [the associated] M2 and M3ranges, so we lowered them. And then we missed them. We didn't takethe staff's judgment as to what was the proper relationship betweenthe M1 ranges and those for M2 and M3.MR. AXILROD. I don't remember what happened a year ago onthat. That may be the case. It certainly was the case in July thatwe were saying [M2 and M3 growth] would be a little higher than theCommittee expected. I don't remember [the circumstances last]January.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Did we miss M2 by more than we missedthe narrower aggregate?MS. TEETERS. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.SPEAKER(?). What was the [miss] again?MS. TEETERS. We got 9.8 percent on a 6 to 9 percent rangefor M2 and 10 percent on a 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent range for M3.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll improvise. [Unintelligible] if thefigures are any good to start with.MS. TEETERS. I would also say that we ought to concentrateon the right-hand side of the page, as I said earlier. We have atremendous public relations problem. There are an awful lot of peoplewith sharp pencils out there; the more we tell them what we know andexplain to them where our uncertainties are, I think the better ourcredibility is.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you saying announce the bottom line?MS. TEETERS. Announce the bottom line. And I'd tell themjust how uncertain we are about that bottom line. We could even putthe calculations all on one side and show them where we made theassumptions and what the changes are.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to pick up on thethought that Ed Boehne laid out: That we ought to focus very, verycarefully not just on the original perceptions that the public has ofwhether or not we've lowered our targets and your problems--and you'regoing to have plenty explaining this to the Banking Committees--butalso on the perception of policy as the year develops. If we think wefaced a credibility problem in 1980, we have seen nothing yet. It'sgoing to be potentially 10 times as large in 1981. Consider, if youwill, what will happen if we publish a range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent forM-1B. The first month of the year we had growth of 16 percent. Itwas 16 percent the first month! Furthermore, our expectation is thatif we hit the midpoint of that range, the fourth quarter-over-fourthquarter increase will be 6-3/4 percent. If Ed Boehne is right--and I-123-2/2-3/81strongly agree with him--we're much more likely to end up at the upperend than the lower end of that range. So the public is going to lookmonth after month after month at an M-1B number that is growing, letus say, at 8 to 8-1/2 percent on average, while the upper end of thetarget range is 6 percent. I just don't think that's viable. Thesame argument in reverse is true with regard to M-1A.So, if we're going to put out ranges, we really have to gofor the bottom line. We have to tell the public these ranges areenormously uncertain but are our best guess of what we think actuallywill happen this year. This isn't just a matter of public perception.It is, as you indicated, a fact that we are going to be terriblyuncertain ourselves as to what these numbers mean. And how the heckwe can conduct monetary policy sensibly with monetary aggregates, whenthe monetary aggregates are just literally off the wall, I do notknow. But it seems to me that Frank Morris has a good suggestion. Asa minimum, we should put principal emphasis on the monetary aggregatethat is least disturbed by these transitional phenomena that we'redealing with, which would be M2. I don't think we can drop M-lA andM-1B. I wouldn't go that far; I think we have to have some narrowmoney figures. But I would go for using M2, announced as ourprincipal target. I think we ought to go with the staff range forthat on page 6, and I would go for alternative I rather thanalternative II. Looking at history, we find that broad money aspresently defined in M2 has a rate of increase that tends to be 3-1/2to 3-3/4 percent on average above the narrow money numbers. So Ithink we can justify that upward movement in the range for thatreason. Additionally, when we're going into a period in which theattractiveness to the public of one element of M2--NOW accounts--isincreased, that is going to attract some funds from elsewhere into M2,so we can justify it on that grounds, too. So, I would go with an M2range of 7 to 10 percent, using that as the principal one, and usingthe ranges for M-1A and M-1B in alternative I with a statement at thebottom of the page instead of in the middle of the page. And I woulduse the left-hand side rather than the right.MR. SCHULTZ. How we are going to get a consensus out ofthis, I don't have the faintest idea.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.MR. BALLES. Well, like almost everyone else who has spokenhere, as far as the takeoff point I certainly would use the actualgrowth rates for M-1A and M-1B that we achieved in 1980 and not try tocorrect for base drift. With respect to M-1A and M-1B, alternative Iis what I would support. It does give credence to that very importantperception problem that you've mentioned: We at least have in mind,abstracting from shifts, a 1/2 point reduction on those two ranges. Ishare Jerry Corrigan's misgivings about the M2 and M3 ranges being alittle on the high side under that alternative I. As I look back on atable here showing the differences month-by-month and cumulativelybetween M-1B and M2 for last year, it turns out that there was a 3percentage point spread, bottom line, net. It did fluctuate over theyear; it bulged in the spring and since August the difference hasvaried between 2 and 3 percentage points. I'd be prepared to begenerous, based on last year's experience, and allow M2 to grow by 3points more than M-1B. Adding 3 points to the M-1B alternative Irange would bring that to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent versus the figures-124-2/2-3/81shown under alternative I for M2 of 7 to 10 percent. I'd be fairlystrongly inclined to reduce that a bit. It would have one advantage,among other things, of adding some credence to our gradual slowdown inthe sense that if we specify a range of 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent ascompared to the actual growth of 9.8 percent last year, at least theupper end of our range would be a touch under what we actuallyachieved in 1980. For much the same reason, I would reduce the M3range by 1/2 point from the 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent shown underalternative I.In terms of how to display the actual results versus theresults we would announce, abstracting from [shifts], I think thefirst point is absolutely viable--that we do have something comparableto last year. As for how we get a translation device [for explaining]what is actually going on versus these ranges, abstracting fromchanges, it seems to me that some possibilities have been offered.I'm not prepared to recommend this yet without some more staff studyand some comment on feasibility by Steve, but in the Bluebook thereare two very interesting charts following page 9, which simply givethe ranges abstracting from changes and those including changes.Based on my conviction that a picture is worth a thousand words, I'msimply suggesting the possibility as we go down the road month-by-month of showing those kinds of charts to the public as a means ofexplaining how to get from our announced ranges to the actual reportednumbers. I'd put the actual reported numbers in the context of thesort of chart device that is used in Charts 1 and 2 following page 9of the Bluebook.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. I'm reminded that many years ago, after adifficult staff presentation, Bill Martin sometimes would say to theCommittee: You better watch out or you may catch statisticitis! I'dsay we've caught it. We have it in spades today. I really don't knowhow it will all work out. I don't want to direct myself to thepresentational question because we're all over the lot and I reallythink what to do is your choice, Paul. I do think we ought to keep inmind two points. One is that we have said, and it will be expected,that we want to make some further progress in reducing growth in themonetary aggregates. Now, if you look at our progress, it hasn't beenvery rapid. And I see no great reason to expect that it will be rapidthis year either. So, to follow up on our promise, I think what weought to provide is minimal progress in reducing our expected growthrates.The second point that I think is terribly important is onethat Ed Boehne made. And that is that we are going to be judged byhow we're doing relative to the targets that we've put out. As theyear goes on, there will be more and more emphasis on how we're doingand less and less emphasis on how we picked the targets in the firstplace. So, I'm inclined to go pretty much with Fred Schultz. I thinkwe ought to declare that in the interest of making further progress weare going to reduce the growth ranges 1/2 point. Then we would haveto say that there are lots of adjustments because of all thesecomplications that are occurring, so we are going to have to tell youwhat a 1/2 point is. And the 1/2 point reduction ought to berestricted to the M-1A and M-1B categories. Jerry's idea, or I guessit was Bob's, of averaging the two to give a sense that we haven't-125-2/2-3/81really given away the ballgame on this is probably a useful concept toemploy. On M2 and M3, I really do think we have to raise our rangessome. We can't go along with 1/2 point reductions there. The reasonis simply that the relationship between the narrow aggregate and thebroader aggregates is going to be determined by interest raterelationships among other things and there will be higher interestrates than ever were contemplated when we first specified thisrelationship a year ago. I would go halfway and make it 6-1/2 to9-1/2 percent on M2 and 7 to 10 percent on M3. And I agree withJerry: I don't see any reason to risk being low on bank credit;nobody pays that much attention to it. So, I'd make that 7 to 10percent also because it's reasonable to think that it might be aboutthe same as M3, which is the broadest of the institutional aggregateswe have. But the main point is that we ought to declare that we arereducing our objectives. And we ought to do it in a way that gives usmaximum opportunity not to go outside the ranges as the year goes on.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Declare that we're reducing them but notreduce them?MR. PARTEE. Yes. Well, who was that guy who said we oughtto back the troop ships into Vietnam and declare we won, and leave?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ford.MR. FORD. I would come out as follows, which is basicallywhere Fred Schultz came out: First of all, I'd speak in terms of theunadjusted targets without all the [unintelligible] and I'd declarethat we are going to make a further reduction in the targeted growthrates for both M-1A and M-1B as under alternative I. I frankly am notfully convinced that the rest of the adjustments in [alternative I]that the staff suggested tentatively would have to be made are reallyvalid. On the face of it, they make it appear that we're notundertaking a reduction. And given all the questions about it, Ithink Nancy's point [is valid] that we would be running the risk ofrunning the economy into the wall. I would make the oppositeassumption looking at page 7, because I don't understand how the staffcomes up with a reduction in the inflation rate and an increase inevery interest rate, including the mortgage rate, as we go through thefour quarters of the year. Going from the present high level of realinterest rates, that means that real rates get even higher. That'swhy I think we have to take account of Nancy's concern, but not on thebasis of the table on page 7. I'd be more inclined to think we mighthave better luck than that. If we actually do reduce the inflationrate, by the fourth quarter I think the rates on page 7 would be lowerthan in the first quarter rather than higher based on the notion thatinterest rates reflect inflation. So, to make me feel a little lessworried about crashing the economy into the wall, I'd go with whatGovernor Schultz said about M2 and M3 and use 6 to 9 percent and 6-1/2to 9-1/2 percent.Finally, with regard to the explanation, you obviously haveto go with however you feel most comfortable rationalizing it. Iwould consider one other alternative for explaining just how crucialthis estimating procedure is and that would be a very simple form ofsensitivity analysis. I would run it something like this: I'd saythat in the first month of the year we had something like a $15 to $20billion shift into NOWs. Our best guess--and I would call it that--is-126-2/2-3/81that this [total] will double over the rest of the year. We could beoff by a factor of over 100 percent in the growth of NOW accounts veryeasily. In other words, instead of going to $40 billion, they couldgo to $60 billion or even to $80 billion. That would mean that you,the public, and you, the Congress, will be seeing horrible M-1Bnumbers that could scare the heck out of you but not reflect a realchange in what we're trying to do. I'd put it that way and then takethe best idea that I think has come up around the table--the idea thatPresidents Mayo and Corrigan mentioned--that if something horriblelike that were to happen, people would recognize that it would bring abig drop in M-1A and a big pop in M-1B and that we'd still on averagebe tightening. If I had to explain it tomorrow, that's the way I'd doit. But you have to do what you're comfortable with because you'rethe one who's going to be under the gun.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Winn.MR. WINN. Well, you have quite an expository problem. Theonly advantage I see is that now instead of targets [unintelligible]the Shadow Committee [unintelligible]. I think continuity inexposition requires that we keep our numbers in line with last year asa starting point. The only thing we can do honestly is to promiseadjustments and information as it develops. I think we have to givethem, for instance, what the adjusted range would be at the moment inorder to compare it with the figures as they are published becausethat's what people are going to judge them by. And I think we have tobe on record as recognizing that these targets are on the old basis--Idon't see any way we can avoid that--and then promise that asadjustments and information develop you will be back to indicate whatthat means. To me the difference between alternatives I and II isreally not as important as is the recognition that we still are facedwith the problem of trying to reduce the ranges. I find alternative Iacceptable. Because of the continuity and exposition problem, I'dreduce the M2 and M3 ranges at this point. We might have to go backand change that, however, as things unfold. So, I'd be inclined tostart with alternative I [for M-1A and M-1B], with 6 to 9 percent and6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2 and M3. For bank credit we probably haveto raise the range a little in light of market developments.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin, you're left.MR. BOYKIN. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Earlier in the meetingGovernor Partee expressed some confusion. This being my firstmeeting, I hope you'll appreciate the dilemma I find myself in! Ifhe's confused--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You'll get more confused as you go on!Governor Partee has been around here for a while.MR. BOYKIN. I have some sympathy for alternative II, muchalong the lines expressed earlier by those who were opting for that.However, I also think alternative I would be the better position totake, particularly given the uncertainties about what really is goingon. It does indicate our willingness to continue the effort forrestraint. So, I would be satisfied with alternative I and I wouldprobably be willing to take the ranges the way the staff has proposedthem all the way through. I also would stay to the left side of the-127-2/2-3/81table and I would associate myself with Willis Winn's comments on howto try to explain it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, this morning we have a little coffeeand orange juice.SPEAKER(?). Hear, hear!SPEAKER(?). We need it!SPEAKER(?). We're going to need more than that!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How about a little scotch this morning?MR. SCHULTZ. You better provide something to sniff now!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's conceivable to me, since we're notyet at the short-term targets, that the meeting may continue afterlunch a bit.SPEAKER(?). Are we going to eat here?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No.[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where are our absentees?SPEAKER(?). They're going to a shadow meeting of theCommittee!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will accept the injunction to aconsiderable degree that the presentational problem is going to haveto be decided by the Chairman when he testifies. I don't thinkthere's any readily soluble way. The more I think about it, the moreI think we have to give the public some indication initially, howevertentatively, of the way the real numbers might or might not come out,just to give some flavor. The fact that they are way off--the jog atthe beginning of the year--I am worried about. It makes the chartssuch as those in the Bluebook look not very good because we're so faroff [target] right off the bat. Maybe we can defer being even halfwaydecisive about it, but I think we've got to give [the public] someindication. That is my current conclusion on that. I certainly thinkwe have to show some reduction in the ranges, as I said at thebeginning. But I guess I do look at these targets differently thansome of you, or maybe all of you, look at them.I think we accomplished two things this morning. In thedecision we will give some flavor of the general direction in which wewant to go [in setting the ranges in the future]; and that has to bedown, consistent with everything we've been saying. But maybe moreimportantly in terms of how we come out in the remainder of the year,once having stated the ranges, they become something of a disciplineon us. I'm not one who thinks that we have the capability ofnecessarily reaching all these targets all the time, not only on amonth-to-month basis but even by year-end. You know, there's nothingmagic about the final quarter of a year. We cite these targets andtend to look at them fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. Last year we-128-2/2-3/81happened to have had a high fourth quarter. If we looked at anaverage for the year as a whole, we came out within the target ranges;but since the focus is on the fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter period,they look a little high. It is quite possible, the way the figuresare going now, that if one looked at it from the fourth quarter of '79to the first quarter of '81, we would look comfortably within thetargets that we set. Well, maybe not comfortably, but within anyway.It depends upon what happens for the next two months. So, I think wecan exaggerate our control and the importance of being precise withthe ranges. But I don't think there's any question that there is adiscipline. That discipline operates, in my opinion, when we're inthe vicinity of the upper end of the target range; the rest of thetarget range doesn't make much difference.The way I observe what I've seen going on here for the lastcouple of days--I hope not completely unfairly--is that we werepresented with a gloomy economic forecast by some standards. I couldimagine a considerably more gloomy one, in fact. The staff doesn'thave a real recession in this forecast but I don't think we coulddiscount having something that would be called a real recession.That's not the only forecast one could have; one could obviously havea more ebullient one too. There is a general question, which I guessis the most important question, of how serious we are about dealingwith inflation. I got a little feeling, as I listened to theconversation, that we're like everybody else in the world on that:Everybody likes to get rid of inflation but when one comes up toactions that might actually do something about inflation, implicitlyor explicitly, one says: "Well, inflation isn't that bad compared tothe alternatives." We see the risks of the alternative of a soureconomy and an outright recession this year. So, maybe there's alittle tendency to shrink back on what we say we want to do on theinflation side. I don't want to shrink back very far; that is mygeneral bias for all the reasons we have stated in our rhetoric butdon't always carry through on. The history of these things in thepast, as we all keep telling ourselves, is that when we come to thecrunch, we back off. In a general sense the question here is whetherwe should back off.In terms of the general setting that we have, my own guesswould be--and I suppose it can't be anymore than a guess--that almostany range we set that shows a reduction will be readily accepted bythe Congress and the Administration and everybody else because we'vesaid we're going to do that. Everybody has [understood] this littlelesson that we've got to reduce the ranges in order to deal withinflation, and we're not going to run into a lot of flak in the shortrun about anything we're talking about or what has been set before us.I obviously can't be sure of that, but that would be my assumption.The only question I might get is: Why did you tentatively reduce theranges only by 1/2 percentage point? I have not yet gotten thequestion: Why did you reduce them at all? I'm not saying that thesepeople have thought this all through; I'm not suggesting that at all.But that is the common impression.Now, in fact, what we're going to be doing is fighting theupper side of the range; talk about the midpoints and the lower end ofthe range may not be very relevant. But I'm not sure that fightingthe upper end of the range isn't right where we should be if we'regoing to have a sour business outlook. People are going to be-129-2/2-3/81complaining about Federal Reserve policy. It is not the worstposition in the world to be in to say: Look, our only risk is thatwe're exceeding our range, not that we're down at the midpoint orbelow. If we're in the low part of a range or at the midpoint of therange and the economy is sour, we're sure to have everybody telling usthat we have to ease up because we're not even exceeding our ownranges and the economy is awful. So, I do think there is an elementof internal discipline and external explanation in assuming that therelevant part of the range will be the upper part of the range and notthe midpoint or, certainly, the lower part of the range. The lowerpart of the range in my conception of the world is something we'daccept if some of these relationships go off; our instinctive judgmentis that we wouldn't want to be all that easy in an ordinary sensedespite the fact that the [monetary growth] figures were coming inlow, given what is going on in the economy and what is going on ininterest rates or whatever. We have a safety valve so we can saywe're not below our range. But we will only be down there if [theeconomy is performing] in a "satisfactory" way. So, the crucialnumber here is the upper part of the range, and the forecast is basedupon the midpoint. I don't sit here and assume, frankly, that we'regoing to be at the midpoint if the economy is going to be as bad asthe staff has projected, much less if the economy is worse thanprojected. Indeed, if the economy is better than they projected,which implies a whale of a lot of pressure on interest rates, we'llprobably also be at the upper part of the range. So, that's therelevant number we're talking about, not the rest of the range, unlesssomething unexpected comes along and these numbers for someinstitutional or other reason happen to come in low when interestrates are declining and everything is going along more or lessswimmingly.We have a great preponderance of opinion for alternative Iand for looking at it from the viewpoint of the left-hand side of thesheet that was given us, leaving aside the question of how it'sactually presented. That gives us an upper end of the range of 5-1/2or 6 percent, depending upon which one we look at, compared to anactual outcome last year of 6-1/4 or 6-3/4 percent. It's a reductionof something like 1/2 or 3/4 percentage point, depending upon whichone we look at. I guess that's where we are. I would, if anything,make it lower than that rather than higher, again based upon theassumption that we're going to be flirting with the high ends of theranges and not the low ends. I am somewhat comforted, on balance, butI don't know whether I'm more comforted than discomforted by the factthat we won't be able to tell with much precision where we are anyway,so far as the M1 figures are concerned. That does make M2 or M3potentially more important, as a number of people have said. Let meassume that the staff forecast is more or less right about therelationship [between M1 and the broader aggregates], although there'sbound to be a good deal of uncertainty about that; the amount ofconfidence one puts on that estimate is not enormous. But let meassume that's the reasonable assumption as to the consistency betweenthe two. If I convert that into my own feeling that the more relevantissue is being at the upper end of the range rather than at themidpoint, that in itself makes me willing to go toward a tighterstated range in order to make sure that it is disciplining enough. Wehave the presentational problem of whether to raise one or both ofthose ranges. It's a purely psychological problem regarding what thatdoes in terms of the imagery we are portraying at the moment. The-130-2/2-3/81 -131-staff's best guess on M2 is that 8-1/2 percent is consistent with themidpoint of M1 in some sense. But at least with 8-1/2 percent you'resaying that's your best guess consistent with the nominal GNPforecast, which is more relevant.MR. AXILROD. Well, if you look specifically at the flow-of-funds data, it might come out to something like 8.8 percent. We'vesqueezed it down to 8-1/2 percent rather than up to 9 percent.MR. PARTEE. So, it's really close to 9 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But it's consistent with the GNP forecast;that's more important than the M1 forecast in that respect.MR. WALLICH. And the base drift in this is 2-1/4 points?MR. AXILROD. On the M1s it's 2-1/2 points; on M2 I don'tknow the base drift. We don't really have that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't even know what the definition ofbase drift is. It depends upon whether you thought you were reallyaiming at the midpoint of the previous year and there's an error inthat. Anyway, for the reasons I suggested, I would go below the 7 to10 percent and 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent [shown under alternative I].I'm not sure we want to go above where we were last year, but for thepsychological or presentational reasons I don't like going as high asstated there. But I have no great compunction about announcing thatwe expect to be at the high end of the range--that we would bedisturbed about being over the range but not at all disturbed aboutbeing at the high end of it--and that the low end of the range is onlyto take care of totally unexpected developments that might for somereason reduce the attractiveness of money market funds or whatever.We could get a development in the thrift industry such that they don'tbecome more eager competitors for money market certificates, so that[lower end] was expressed for a variety of other contingencies thatconceivably could develop. We have a pretty mixed view on this, Ithink. The Committee is pretty well split down the middle in theinitial comments between a 7 to 10 percent group and those who prefersomething less than that. There is a slight majority--seven--for lessthan 7 to 10 percent, just using the M2 number.The only other comment I would make is that we will beannouncing these targets a few days after the Administration isannouncing its program. I don't know what that's going to be. Iassume it's going to include Kemp-Roth for three years. I'm not atall sure it's going to include--my guess is it is not--a beginningdate of January 1, 1981. I think it will be some time after that.And I do think they are probably going to have a bigger expenditurereduction number in the proposed program than conventional wisdom hasassumed--conventional wisdom now and perhaps conventional wisdom afterthey announce it--is at all possible. But I suspect they are going tohave a very big number in there and put a lot of emphasis on theimportance of the changes they are trying to make in the structure ofthe budget and, therefore, in the American economy. The question ishow our money supply numbers will play in connection with that tune--whether it will sound like we're doing business as usual or supportingthe program or whatever. I don't know quite how that will play, butit is a psychological question.2/2-3/81I guess what I am saying is that if it's the greatpredominance of opinion that we go substantively, however presented,for what is alternative I in the Bluebook, I would suggest that wereduce the M2 and M3 numbers to some extent. The presentation wouldsuggest that we would be near the upper end of the ranges. That iswhat I would propose. Presentationally, I think we have to give atleast a tentative view and try to avoid getting it written inindelible ink in any way; I'd give a penciled-in tone for how theactual number may look. You know, we're going to have to report whatthe actual numbers are; and I think we have to give a target at somepoint relevant to the actual numbers rather than say that we cansomehow adjust the actual numbers when we don't have a good enoughhandle to adjust them on a week-by-week basis. By the same token, wedon't have a good enough handle to adjust the target on a week-to-weekbasis either. But I think that can be a little vaguer concept than anumber we actually have to publish every week in print. Sooner orlater we will be forced into giving a target that allows for theshift. My main reluctance about doing that at all decisively rightnow is that there's such a jog in the actual pattern of the numbersthat come out right away. But I would, as I feel now, do it that way.I've been playing around with just how we might present thisand give some sense of continuity. There is a possibility. Theproblem is impossible, I hasten to say, because we really have threesets of numbers. We have numbers based upon what we were estimatinglast year, where we are now, and with further shifts [this] year. Togive some sense of continuity in terms of the M1 numbers anyway, I waswondering whether we could take the cone we had last year, which isthe conventional way to express these things, and adjust it for whatactually happened to the numbers. That means that the actual figureis very close to the cone for the fourth quarter. We could take thetop of that cone and extend it by whatever percentage we have decidedon here. It would be extended in the case of M-1B by 6-1/2 percent--we'd have to go off the right-hand side of the sheet--and by 4-1/4percent for M-1A, if [alternative I] is the decision we make. Then wewould extend the bottom part of the cone by the same percentage and wewould have created a channel which is consistent with the 4 to 6-1/2percent target or the 1-3/4 percent to 4-1/4 percent target. But thecone would coincide with the channel by the fourth quarter. Thus wewould have established a channel in which to operate with exactly thesame upper end of the line as the cone. But the bottom end of thechannel starts from last year's target rather than where we are at themoment. It's the same information; it's just presented in a differentway so that we can link the one target to the next. I don't knowwhether one would call that base drift or not. It creates the samechannel we had last year.MR. SCHULTZ. Everybody who understands that raise theirhand!MR. WALLICH. That means basing [unintelligible] base drift.You're basing it on last year's targets and linking it up with lastyear's terminal points of the cone?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's what you do, yes.-132-2/2-3/81MR. WALLICH. Yes. If you draw a channel for last year and anew channel for this year, that will not be a straight line. Therewill be an angle where they join.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is true. One of the difficultieswith this portrayal is that there is an angle where they join. Theangle is so small it is not perceptible to the naked eye. I don'tknow that it's worth lingering over this; it's a presentationalmatter. If we literally attached it to the cones with the currentestimates that we're using, the actual is 1/4 percentage point abovethe cone. If we did it this way and we wanted to get in the channel,our effective target from the actual is 1/4 percentage point lowerthan the target itself would suggest.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON(?). But how do you explain ittechnically in words? It's a simple-looking cone I can see, but howdo you put words around it?MR. SCHULTZ ET. AL. He just did.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not sure it's a good idea. Onecan go that far and it's fairly simple. I think I can explain thatmuch very, very easily. What gives me pause is that then I'd have tosay: "But that new channel I just gave you isn't the right channelbecause now we're going to get more shifts into NOW accounts." That'sthe real problem. This much can be explained simply.MS. TEETERS. It sounds in fact more like 6-1/2 than 6-1/4percent. Is that what you're saying?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Yes], if we literally did what I justdescribed and did it from the cone instead of the actual and took thepresent estimates of the cone--we could change them--but if weaccepted that one-third/two-thirds split instead of a 50/50 split. Ifwe took a 50/50 split, it comes out that the actual is just about onthe cone; if you take the one-third/two-thirds split, it is not. So,it would imply that we're going to make that up during the year and itwould reduce the ranges effectively by 1/4 of a percentage point.MS. TEETERS. You mean it will reduce the target by 1/4percentage point?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. It would reduce the upperend of the target by 1/4 percentage point.MR. PARTEE. Yes, it doesn't reduce the lower end.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's because the implication is that wewould come back within the channel.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, if I understand what you're saying,it's what we originally thought about presenting to this Committee anddecided it was so complicated we couldn't explain it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, you took off on the midpoint, I think.This is a little different.MR. BLACK. No, I'm not talking about what I said here.-133-2/2-3/81 -134-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh.MR. BLACK. What we originally thought we would do in the wayof presenting charts is what you said, I think. I have some sympathyfor it, but we decided we couldn't explain it to the Committee. Butmaybe we can explain it to the public. The public could--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, there's nothing very hard aboutexplaining it to the Committee if it wasn't for that last step. Andwhat may make it impossible is that when you get finished with theexplanation, you have to say this isn't the right channel anyway.That's really the problem; but any presentation has that problem.That's what makes the whole presentation impossible.MR. PARTEE. Maybe you could go into the second stage with ashaded area added.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. We would have to putanother shaded area on here. That's exactly what--MR. MORRIS. At least we could do it for M2 and M3, Paul.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, with M2 and M3 I don't think we cando it because they're too far out of the target.MR. BLACK. What you have is a kinked two-year megaphone.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is it exactly. Right.SPEAKER(?). But you can't do it, I don't think.MR. CORRIGAN. With a dogleg.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER Well, that's a problem, too. But that is apresentational problem. If we presented it this way, we might end updeciding--this would have to be a decision--that we'd be willing tohave a 1/4 point lower implied target for the M1s if we drew lastyear's cone with the one-third/two-thirds distribution. Am I rightthat if we do it 50/50, we're right on the cone?MR. AXILROD. That's what I was just figuring out. Yes, itcomes out that the rates of growth are exactly equal to the upper endsof the ranges.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, without worrying about thepresentation--anybody can have second thoughts--the substance, howeverit's presented, is that the majority opinion at least was that weshould be 1/2 percentage point lower on the M-1A and M-1B ranges.Let's just look at that part of it first. Just what I would say, I'mnot quite sure. But my opinion is that we're going to be near theupper end of whatever range we pick. That is, as I said, much morelikely than anything else. In thinking about the ranges myself, Idon't consider that a problem. I don't consider that a miss in anysense of the word and I assume that's what we're talking about. I'mnot saying we couldn't be at the lower end if things evolved in adifferent way than the economic forecast suggests, with much lowerinterest rates or whatever other permutations and combinations mightdevelop in the real world. I am simply saying that we would be2/2-3/81satisfied to be around the upper end of the ranges with an economicforecast of the kind presented. Let me just confine myself to M-1Aand M-1B. As I say, my concern is that that's too easy, not that it'stoo tight. Do we have a consensus on that?MR. PARTEE. Do you want a show of hands or something?MR. WALLICH. I am troubled by M-1A and M-1B and moretroubled by M2. It's not that I want to speak up now, but incombination it becomes very, very troublesome.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we'll approach this by partialdifferentials or something. I take it that people are willing to livewith that 1/2 point reduction on the M-1A and M-1B ranges, withreservations depending about how we come out on the other parts andhow it all fits together. We recognize that in the end it might bepresented as on the right-hand side of that piece of paper, butsomeplace it's going to be presented both ways, I'm sure. I don'tknow whether we have to deliberate over the difference between M2 andM3. Let's assume that whatever we say for one applies to the other.There I would feel even more strongly that we're more likely to beflirting with the upper end than anyplace else and that the higher weput the upper end, the higher in fact we might be, given the kinds ofproblems that we foresee. How many do we have for 6 to 9 percent,which is precisely where it was last year? I better just take a pollof Committee members. Six. Who do we have for 7 to 10 percent? Wemust have a couple in the middle. Well, I would encourage a moment ofdiscussion by somebody other than me--somebody who wants to bepersuasive one way or the other.MR. SCHULTZ. I would like to be persuasive on staying wherewe were last year. It seems to me, given all of the uncertainties,that we might as well get hung for a sheep as a goat here. This 1/2percentage point doesn't seem to me to make that much difference, andif we go up from last year, I think we're going to get a lot ofcriticism. We will say: "Well, we're going to go down 1/2 point onM-1A and M-1B." And they are going to say: "Aha! But you're goingup on M2 and M3." I just don't think it's that crucial; we arelooking at a whole family [of aggregates], which I think is important.If we get outside the range on M2 and M3, that does exert someadditional discipline. Most people continue to [focus] on M-1B, and Ithink that is the more crucial number; I don't think we help ourselvesvery much by going to, say, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2 rather than 6to 9 percent. We would lose a lot in the presentation. I do thinkthat the perceptions are crucial at this particular point in time,just as I think the perceptions of budget-cutting are crucial in thefiscal area. So, I would make an argument for 6 to 9 percent on M2and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M3, understanding that we're not onlygoing to be at the upper end but that the relationships may be suchthat it's very difficult to stay below that upper end. I still thinkwe're better off that way.MR. PARTEE. The thing is that we were over [our M2 range by]quite a bit this past year--by 0.8 percentage point if the figure isright--and we're going to be over this year because, after all, we dohave within that aggregate two pretty dynamic competitive instruments:the money market funds and the money market certificates. And theMMCs have some potential for further development as a market tool. I-135-2/2-3/81might also say that we're in the hands of the DIDC because it couldchange rate relationships. Then who knows what might occur? I ratheragree with you that it may not be worthwhile to confuse things. Onthe other hand, I think this is the one time when we can say: "Look,we have the relationships wrong between these aggregates growth rates;we had them wrong last year. We can't set each growth rateindependently because they have complicated relationships with eachother. Recognizing that and recognizing the close correspondencebetween M2 and GNP, and seeing that people are thinking in terms of a9-1/2 or 10 percent increase in nominal GNP this year, we think webetter have a range that would encompass what might occur. That's whywe have a higher range." But I'm sympathetic with your point of viewthat a 1/2 point difference isn't much.MR. SCHULTZ. And I'm sympathetic with your view, too.MS. TEETERS. I'd take up on Ed's point. After all, we'renot only setting ranges for perception. A year from now we have tofigure out where we came in, and we ought to set something that wehave some chance of achieving. In a presentation of foreign targetsabout two or three weeks ago, I noticed that the French did very wellbut they had an 11 percent target. I think it's better to be honestand to say, as Chuck is saying, that we misspecified these. Then wewould have some chance to make it rather than put out a number that istoo low, knowing that we're not going to make it.MR. WALLICH. Well, 6 to 9 percent in a longer-term contextis quite rich because we overshot the upper edge of the band by 0.8percentage point, as someone said. That means we overshot themidpoint by 2-1/4 percentage points. That makes 11-1/4 percent theupper end, in effect, of the 6 to 9 percent. That's more than thenominal GNP growth that the Board staff projects. I grant you thatanything can happen to M2. But there is going to be a temptation torely on that very heavily because of the uncertainties surrounding the[narrower] aggregates. It seems to me that this is just giving theeconomy what it wants, like demand feeding. A more scholarly person,Bob Black, said it was the real bills doctrine: We just supply themoney that the nominal growth of GNP demands. We ought to have somerestraint built into this.MR. GRAMLEY. May I take up on that point? The staffforecast with the 7 to 10 percent range for M2 is for an increase innominal GNP of 9.6 percent and a decline in real GNP of .8 percent.Now, I think it's a question of whether we want to aim as our centralpoint for -0.8 percent, or essentially -1.8 percent, for real GNPgrowth in 1981. Both of those imply restraint. The question is notwhether we have restraint but how much. I too think, as Nancy said,that inevitably we're going to be leaning more on M2 as the year goeson to guide ourselves and to explain to the public what we're doingbecause M2 is the one aggregate that's going to be most robust underthe kinds of institutional changes we're looking at. If we can getaway with the presentational problem initially, I think we should goup to 7 to 10 percent as a more meaningful number for M2 if we lowerthe narrow aggregate ranges 1/2 point. We'll regret it later on if wedon't.MR. WALLICH. But 7 to 10 percent really means 9 to 12percent or a little more than that.-136-2/2-3/81MR. PARTEE. No, because we've already had the rest of it,Henry. You assumed in your discussion that we properly specified it ayear [ago] and there's no reason to think we properly specified it.We know it has a very close velocity correspondence to nominal GNP,and it tracked it pretty well last year. It will track it againpretty well this year.MR. MORRIS. But the staff's forecast assumes the 8-1/2percent midpoint. It seems to me, along with the Chairman'ssuggestion, that the 9 percent ceiling would certainly be--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The 9 percent encompasses the staffforecast.MS. TEETERS. Just barely, by 0.2.MR. PARTEE. By 0.2.MR. GRAMLEY. But that is assuming essentially no rise invelocity. We could have a decline in M2 velocity for the year becauseof what is happening to the MMCs and the money market mutual funds--the increased attractiveness of this particular aggregate relative tomarket securities because of NOW accounts. There are all sorts ofreasons for thinking that might happen.MS. TEETERS. Tony is trying to suggest that we widen therange.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. As I suggested, I would widen therange by a point on each side, if we feel we can get away with it, inorder to look neutral. If not, then I would have to come out for the6 to 9 percent.MR. PARTEE. Well, I think 5 to 10 percent is too wide.Maybe we can take 6 to 10 percent, but 5 points is an awfully widemargin. And we don't really expect to be below 6 percent, not withthe possible accounts in that [aggregate].VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My experience with that Congressionalcommittee is that Fred Schultz is 100 percent right. What they'regoing to say is: "Look, you've lowered it a half point here andyou've raised it a half point there; if you average them together, youhaven't really done anything."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the problem.MS. TEETERS. But we've known since last July that thespecification was wrong. If we have to change all these otherspecifications as drastically as we do, we better get this one right.Otherwise, we'll come up next year and say that we specified M2 wrongfor two years running and now we're going to confuse the waters by re-specifying M2 in its proper relationship.MR. CORRIGAN. I'm not entirely clear on this point that itis fundamentally misspecified. I think the numbers that John Balleswas ticking off before work at least a little in that direction. Now,it's probably true to say, given everything in M2 and the fact thathalf of it is positively related to interest rates and the other half-137-2/2-3/81is negatively related to interest rates, that it should be morestable. If anything, as I said before--although I really don't thinkit's necessary to do it--that might suggest that the band can benarrower and that we can more reasonably assume that it will come outsomewhere near what the staff forecast implies. But I'm not entirelypersuaded that it is structurally that far off the mark.MR. GRAMLEY. If you take the past 10 years, the averageannual growth rate of narrow money is 6 percent; the average annualgrowth rate of M2 is 9-3/4 percent.MR. WALLICH. Well, if we misspecified last time, why notadjust both?MR. CORRIGAN. But we've already corrected for it; we did allthese redefinitions and things. We built a lot of that right back in.If you looked at it as you went along, you wouldn't find that.MR. GRAMLEY. Not every year, no. It's awfully hard to arguethat this year we ought to see a substantially narrower range ofgrowth between M2 and the adjusted M1s.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, if this NOW estimate that the staff ismaking here is right, maybe that's true. But if the NOW estimate is alot higher than that--i.e. more comes from savings-type instruments,as Frank Morris suggests--then I think it works the other way.MR. PARTEE. It won't reduce M2.MR. CORRIGAN. No, but it will narrow the spread between--MR. PARTEE. Yes, it will raise M-1B.MR. CORRIGAN. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, what we do about this depends uponwhat emphasis we put on the fact that we expect to be in the upperpart of the range. One way of approaching that, I suppose, is tonarrow the range instead of widening it.SPEAKER(?). Or not have a bottom.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, or not have a bottom and just putdown a number. We could say we don't want to see it exceed thus andso. But we could narrow it; I hate to have narrower ranges but Idon't think we're going to hit the bottom of this one anyway.MS. TEETERS. That's what we thought last year at this time,too.MR. MAYO. Paul, does the President's program, whichostensibly is going to put money back in the hands of consumers whoare going to save it, give more credence to the continuation of a 10percent figure?MR. PARTEE. Yes, he said half or more will be saved.-138-2/2-3/81MR. GRAMLEY. He said half to two-thirds will be saved.We've got to accommodate that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You know, I hadn't thought of that. Idon't know whether we have any rationale that this great increase insavings is going to push up--MR. MAYO. He's going to have a program by the time you go up[to testify]. Do you agree with it or don't you agree with it? Idon't know.MR. MORRIS. It will be soaked up by the increased deficit.MR. PARTEE. It has one chance in 100 of being true.MR. MAYO. I'm afraid you're right, Frank.MR. SCHULTZ. Then it gets us in the awful box of indicatingthat the FOMC agrees with that kind of number. We have some hard dataon it now. A recent survey that was taken indicated that 26 percentof the people said they would save.MS. TEETERS. They did that one time on a refund, too, andevery bit of it was spent.MR. PARTEE. Are they going to save anything?MR. WALLICH. Will we know?MR. SCHULTZ. Even that is a low number.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you took this decade's relationship of3 percent [as the differential between M1 and M2] and we're setting anupper limit of 5-1/2 percent for M-1B, M2 comes out at 8-1/2 percent,which is within the 6 to 9 percent range. I would not suggest a 6 to9 percent range if we thought M2 growth was going to end up at 7-1/2percent because that is in all likelihood considerably too low. Myproblem is that I want this range to be a constraint on the up side.MS. TEETERS. But the staff forecast is so close to 9 percentalready that it means we're going to start constraining almostimmediately.MR. PARTEE. Well, if you think there's a really bigadvantage--I don't think there is--I'm prepared to vote for 6 to 9percent and assume we'll exceed it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, before we get there, let me ask aquestion. If you had to guess, as a technical matter, between M2 andM3 which is more likely to be exceeded?MR. AXILROD. I do not have a good guess on that. In the olddays, one would have said the broader aggregate. But now institutionscan compete actively in either aggregate. We have money market fundsin M2 as well as M3. And we have money market certificates in M2.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The difference is basically negotiable CDsand Eurodollars, [which are in M3], right?-139-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. That's right. And in both aggregates there are[instruments] that institutions can offer aggressively or lessaggressively depending on conditions. Equally likely would be myanswer; I can't tell which.MR. PARTEE. Equally likely.MR. SCHULTZ. Or equally unlikely.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do you think you're splitting--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they're already split. It's just aquestion of how much they are split. The staff has M3 1/2 percentagepoint higher. I don't know whether it's worth it, but we cancompromise the position by moving one down more than the other.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Then we would be forced to saysomething about what we expect to happen because of large CDs.MR. CORRIGAN. I think there is an argument--it's not a verystrong one--for saying that M3 might be the stronger, simply becausethe prospects for a fair amount of term business borrowing are prettystrong. When you look at the auto industry and the steel industry andso forth, there's a lot of term big business lending going on. Ithink banks are more likely to try to fund that with CDs. That iscompatible with some risk that M3 and bank credit could be toward thehigh side, as I suggested earlier.MS. TEETERS. Actually, we exceeded M2 by more than M3. Wecould put them both the same.MR. CORRIGAN. Well, last year we did.MR. GRAMLEY. If we get a tax cut for business and it'sretroactive to the first of the year, it's going to provide businesseswith funds to finance their capital investment, and the mix ofborrowing will shift toward government.MR. CORRIGAN. If they stay with the idea of accelerateddepreciation--I don't know if they will or not--the numbers I've seenon cash flow on that in the first year, even if it's retroactive, arepretty small because of the nature of the tax change. It's not thesame as a change in income tax rates in terms of the cash flow effect.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it will turn on the amount of banklending, but I'm a little hesitant to predict whether that's going tobe exceptionally big or small.MR. SCHULTZ. It depends on what kind of budget cuts we get.If the market looks at the budget cuts favorably, we could get asituation in which corporations would be able to come to the capitalmarkets to a greater degree. And, boy, they would do it! They'rereally sitting at the ready there.VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Going back to something that Fredsuggested earlier, we could have 6 to 9 percent now but say that giventhe institutional changes it might very well be that in July we wouldwant to revise that on the up side.-140-2/2-3/81MS. TEETERS. We're not notable for changing things in July.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Maybe we should change that; maybe weshould be a little more changeable in July.MS. TEETERS. Chances are that the only way to change in Julyis up and we'll go through the same argument about how awful it looks.MR. PARTEE. At this time of high inflation.MS. TEETERS. Don't forget, we're going to have a first-quarter CPI number that's possibly going to scoop the markets rightout of their minds again. I think we're going to find it impossibleto raise our targets after we've had, say, a 16-1/2 percent increasein the CPI in the first quarter.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think any of us would bearguing this so strongly if we didn't all have a feeling that we willbe focusing on this much more--that this is somewhat of a precursor tothe kinds of debates we're going to be having at all the meetings.MR. PARTEE. Let me be a little picky about this. We couldhave 6 to 9 percent now and then, assuming the tax cut takes effectabout midyear--and as a matter of fact the staff has a higher personalsaving rate for the second half than for the first half--we could thensay that because we have had the tax cut we want to make a littleallowance for that and we're going to raise the M2 range when we lookat it in July. It might be--MR. SCHULTZ. We assume that it's going into savings.MR. GRAMLEY. The easiest time to do it is right now inexpectation of that tax cut and to do it accompanied by a reduction inthe narrow money ranges.MR. MAYO. I think Lyle's right on that.MR. PARTEE. Because we're surely not going to be cuttingnarrow money.MR. GRAMLEY. I think Mr. Mayo's argument is an excellentone. It's a really good excuse. It's the best one, or the only one,I can think of. It's a stroke of genius. We have a tax cut comingalong and it's expected to add to savings; and we've made allowancefor it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any port in a storm!MR. GRAMLEY. Certainly that's not inflationary, is it? Moresavings? We're all for it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, my problem is this: I think 10percent is too high. It's higher than we had last year, and I assumewe're going to be near the top. Now, one can say 9-1/2 percent is anice number, and in some ways it is a nice number. Is it worth it fora 1/2 percentage point to present a higher target than last year?That's my problem.-141-2/2-3/81MR. GUFFEY. The answer is no.MR. MAYO. The answer is yes.MS. TEETERS. But we have all these excuses for changing themnow, given the relationships.MR. SCHULTZ. Let's save them all up and use them later.MR. GRAMLEY. M2 has not received much focus.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, that's right; but I think it willreceive more and more after this.MR. GRAMLEY. Over time it will. But I think we can sneak inan increase in the M2 range now if we lean on the savings argument.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're talking not only about M2 but alsoM3. And in the popular view, we would be raising two out of the threetargets.MR. SCHULTZ. I don't think we can do that.MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I don't know whether it's helpfulbut, in answer to Governor Teeters's question, we looked back at lastyear. The Committee essentially took what the staff had down for M2and M3. It wasn't until midyear that the staff said thespecifications were off.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just because it's interesting, do you havethose numbers that Mr. Black was asking about earlier? This is reallyM1, but it's interesting. What page are those on in the Bluebook?MR. AXILROD. Yes, they are on page 5. I can read thenumbers as we have them adjusted for the so-called shifts. For M-1Afor 1978, we have 7.8; for 1979, 6.5; and for 1980, 6.2. For M-1B, wehave 8.0 for 1978; 6.9 for 1979; and 6.7 for 1980. Essentially for1979 that reflects the shifts to ATS accounts and for 1978 some roughand ready adjustment for a sense of differences in trend of those two.MR. MAYO. Wait a minute. I didn't follow why you adjusted1978.MR. AXILROD. Well, it's a bit obscure as to whether oneshould or shouldn't, so I wouldn't make too much of that.MR. MAYO. Okay.MR. AXILROD. It's much more clear in '79 and '80.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We didn't make much progress last year onthose numbers. We redistributed the progress that appears in theunadjusted numbers. That doesn't change--MR. PARTEE. It's really better. I'd like--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's pretty close. The weightedaverage is a little better on the adjusted, about 0.1 better. Well,-142-2/2-3/81we have to make up our minds. We can try the 9-1/2 percent number. Ithink the real question is whether it's worth going to 9-1/2 percent,which in some ways looks better; but it is going to show an increasein two out of the three targets.MR. PARTEE. How about leaving M3 at 9-1/2 percent? Have M2and M3 the same at 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 or 7 and 10 percent, but leave themthe same on the grounds that we just don't know how they--MR. SCHULTZ. I thought you just mentioned that S&Ls aregoing to be selling CDs up to $100,000.MR. PARTEE. They can certainly try unless there is a set ofquestions about the solvency of the insurance corporations.MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, did you say two out of three of thenumbers would be higher?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we go up [on M2 and M3]. I'm assumingat this point that we do with M3 anything we do with M2. When I saytwo out of three, I'm assuming both the M1 ranges are essentially onerange. We could call it two out of four or two out of three. Well,how many like 9-1/2 percent?MR. GRAMLEY. Better than what?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Better than 9 percent.MR. MORRIS. This is for what--M2?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For M2 and the equivalent number for M3.MS. TEETERS. Better than 9 percent, not preferable to 10percent?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Better than 9; that's right.MR. RICE. But not better than 10.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand. Not better than 10 percentin some people's view. How does that leave me? How many prefer 9?Seven and one. Well, the 9s clearly have it. That only leaves mewith the question of whether we can attract more support by fiddlingaround here somehow. Let's assume we have 9 percent for M2, but notdo exactly the equivalent, which I was implicitly assuming, for M3.Let me try 6 to 9 percent for M2 and 7 to 10 percent for M3.MR. GRAMLEY. There really isn't a lot of usefulness inhaving an M3 target that's higher than M2.MR. SCHULTZ. Yes, I think that's right.MR. GRAMLEY. If the staff forecast is half right, over thenext year the growth of business loans is going to be held downseverely by the lack of inventory investment. That's in theapproximate sense the most important thing that affects businessloans. Without the business loans, the banks aren't going to borrow-143-2/2-3/81unless there's a very big difference between the prime rate and marketrates, and that's not very likely.MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, for purposes of impacting theeconomy, is it important that we specify an M3 range?MS. TEETERS. In a sense, basically that's a vote for a 1/2point reduction in M1 and a full percentage point reduction in M2; andif we do the cones we get another 1/4 point off on M1. So, if you'regoing to vote for 9 percent, you might as well take a full percentagepoint off the M1 range. That's essentially what we are going to haveto do in order to keep within the target for M2 because our onlyleverage is to push down on the M1s in order to retard M2.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think that's right.MS. TEETERS. How are you going to get 1/2 point off M2?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it depends on whether you're lookingat the midpoint or not. I'm not looking at the midpoint, frankly.MR. PARTEE. No, Nancy means: It went up 9.8 percent lastyear, so why will it go up only 8.8 percent this year?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now we're talking about moving the M2figure from 6-3/4 percent, where it was on this adjusted basis?MR. AXILROD. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --to 5-1/2 percent presumably if we're atthe top; it's down 1-1/4 percentage points.MS. TEETERS. That would be moving it down. That's a fullpercentage point. We're going from 6-3/4 to 6 percent--that's a 3/4point reduction in M1--on the left side.SPEAKER(?). What is nominal GNP?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. About the same as M2, about 9.9 percent.MR. SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, I don't think we will accomplishanything by tinkering with M3, by differing that relationship 1/2percentage point.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not going to attract anybody else?MR. SCHULTZ. I don't think it holds together intellectuallyat all. If we fight the battle on the 6 to 9 percent, the 6-1/2 to9-1/2 that means [unintelligible]. I don't know why that shouldplease anybody particularly.MS. TEETERS. Well, it doesn't hold together intellectuallynow. If we're going to take a percentage point off M2, then the 1/2point down on M1 isn't consistent.MR. SCHULTZ. I don't read it that way.-144-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're implying more accuracy in the staffforecast than I think they can bear. Well, I think we ought to reviewthis anyway. It's very likely that we might want to have a review ifanything I consider really important happens that we don't know aboutat this point. We'd do that some time before February 19th, but Ithink we ought to have a tentative vote, which could be a final vote.If I interpret this correctly, we are voting on what is essentiallyalternative I for the M1s, presented however I deem appropriate at thetime it's presented. And consistent with those changes, 6 to 9percent on M2 and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M3. On bank credit, Mr.Corrigan reflected some suspicion; I don't think it's too importantwhether we move that up 1/2 point or not. I don't know whether thatmakes anybody happier or sadder. Is there any feeling about that one?MR. AXILROD. I ought to point out that that's the one rangethat was hit last year.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we might as well leave it then.MR. SCHULTZ. I disagree with Mr. Corrigan's argument. Myheavens, the likelihood is that the great need in the economy will beto reliquify. And any opportunity [corporations] get to go to thecredit markets and get out of the banks, they're going to try to take,even at interest rates that are somewhat higher than they have beenhistorically. So, I would feel comfortable about that bank creditnumber, Jerry.MR. CORRIGAN. I'm not uncomfortable with it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, the proposal is to leave the M2, M3,and bank credit ranges the same as last year and reduce the M1 rangesby 1/2 percentage point, with a definite explanation in thepresentation that we expect to be near the top ends of the ranges onthe M2 and M3 numbers. It would be encompassed in the explanationthat those ranges are biased or asymmetrical.MS. TEETERS. Why don't we do like the British do and justsay we're going to exceed it?MR. TRUMAN. They didn't say that in advance.MR. GUFFEY. Does that statement imply that we'll be lookingfor the midpoint on M-1A and M-1B and the upper end on M2 [and M3] orthe upper end of the range on all four of them?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, in fact, we're probably going to benear the upper end of the range on the narrow aggregates, too, but I'mnot sure I would state that quite so clearly.MR. GRAMLEY. It seems to me that you could state your pointon M2 a little differently and say that if in fact we get asignificant volume of savings coming out of the tax reduction, it maywell be that M2 would go up.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd be willing to say that, too, butthere's a difference in my mind. I think, in fact, that we probablywill be near the upper ends of the ranges on the M1s. But theirrelationship with GNP is likely to be more erratic than the M2-145-2/2-3/81relationship, and I would just point that out. M2 does track [GNP]more certainly; the velocity of M2 is probably a less uncertain animalthan the velocity of M1, and that would be the excuse for making thestatement. I would not exclude the possibility, certainly, that we'dbe near the upper ends of the ranges on the M1s.MR. GUFFEY. For the [Congressional] committee's perceptionor the public's perception we would be still looking at the midpointsof M-1A and M-1B, although we may know around this table that it's nottoo [likely].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would want to put some emphasis on thefact that if we were near the upper end, that would be in no sense afailure on M1. There's a difference between it being in no sense atall a failure if growth is at the upper end of the range and, in thecase of M2, having an expectation that growth is a little more likelyto be at the upper end of the range. That is the distinction I wouldmake. Is that proposition clear? If no one has any furthermodifications to suggest, we might as well vote. The vote is subjectto possible reconsideration.MR. ALTMANN.Chairman VolckerGovernor GramleyPresident GuffeyPresident Morristo have any guideline for M1.YesYesYesYes, with a proviso that I doCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It will be noted.MR. MORRIS. I will accept the guidelines for M2, M3, andbank credit.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're not going to dissent from thedecision?MR. MORRIS. No, can't we just have a footnote?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would prefer to put it clearly in therecord that some people accepted it in general, but didn't like theidea of a guideline [for M1].MR. BLACK. The Act requires it.MR. ROOS. The record would state that others preferred totarget the M1s and forget about M2?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Altmann will reflect all these views.MR. ALTMANN.Governor Partee YesGovernor Rice YesPresident Roos YesGovernor Schultz YesVice Chairman Solomon YesGovernor Teeters Yes, if I get a proviso in theopposite direction that I think the M2 range is unrealistic.not want-146-2/2-3/81MR. PARTEE. You would prefer a higher upper limit for M2?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, there is no problem in reflectingthose views in the record, but they won't be associated withindividual names that way.MR. ALTMANN.Governor Wallich NoPresident Winn YesThe vote is eleven for, one against.MR. SCHULTZ. I want you to know that if the Mafia comesafter me, I want you on my side!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're going to turn to the short-termdecision, and we'd better turn to the exchange markets and do thatpart of our job. I don't know whether we can get these preliminariesout of the way before lunch. It looks as if we will indeed run afterlunch unless you want a very late lunch. We might be able to finishby 2:00 p.m.; I can't see us finishing before that. Would you rathereat or try to finish by 2:00 p.m.?UNANIMOUSLY. Eat.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand what the relative prioritiesin this group are! Mr. Pardee.MR. PARDEE. I will try to be brief. [Statement--seeAppendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Comments or questions?MS. TEETERS. Is this the first time the Germans haveintervened in the dollar market?MR. PARDEE. They've been intervening in bits and pieces allalong when the rate moved sharply. But they have made a decision thatthey will act vigorously both in the exchange market and the moneymarket to counter the selling pressures, and I think the market hassensed that. But we'll see how their follow-through is.MR. BOEHNE. Have the Germans exported as much of theirunemployment as they can, as they used to?MR. PARDEE. No, I'm afraid this time most of theunemployment has [not] been exported. They didn't bring many peopleback. These are Germans who are unemployed now.MR. SCHULTZ. I thought Ezra Solomon had the best comment Iheard about that when he was talking about Switzerland. He said thegreat advantage the Swiss have is that when they run their economyinto a brick wall they have a foreign employee in the front seat.MR. PARDEE. The attitude of the Germans is that they cansend the women back into the kitchen.MR. TRUMAN. They probably still have about 2 million foreignworkers in Germany, the more permanent ones.-147-2/2-3/81MR. MAYO. Two million foreign workers still?MR. TRUMAN. Around that or somewhat less than that. Thepeak in these numbers that I have here was 2-1/2 million in '73.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comments?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, normally I would be suggestingthat we at least raise the authorization because we only have $300million left and it's a turbulent market. But I think somediscussions are needed with the new team at the Treasury to get theirviews. I'm not quite sure of the legalities of this. If we have thatdiscussion and they are sympathetic to our raising it, can that bedone by a telephone call?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's only an informal limit, butpresumably we would need a telephone call. It would take theCommittee's concurrence, but we haven't had a formal vote on this, ifI recall correctly. We'll get into this in a minute. Let me just seeif there are any other general comments or questions.MR. WALLICH. There seems to be a market view that the dollarcan't fall and that that's why it's safe to take advantage of highinterest rates. Do you see that continuing at these levels?MR. PARDEE. I don't know. The dollar dropped almost 2percent today and almost 1 percent in 45 minutes; I think we may losethat feeling very quickly. But, as I say, there has been thiseuphoria and a very strong feeling that everything the Germans weredoing was wrong and everything we were doing was right. Theseattitudes can change very quickly.MR. WALLICH. Yes, they can change very quickly.MR. PARDEE. It's a very, very psychological market we'redealing with right now. It's very reminiscent of some of the thingsthat we've seen ourselves when the dollar was weak.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The CPI in Germany went up what--afull 1 percentage point last month? I think the wholesale index wentup 1.4 percentage point.MR. PARDEE. It was 1.4. They're getting the vicious circleelement.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The official forecast on the rate ofinflation is simply that it's going to go up to about 4-1/2 percent,but the markets don't particularly believe it.MR. WALLICH. I've heard 6 percent, but not officially.MR. PARDEE. Inside the Bundesbank they're talking about a 6percent rate, but the official [forecast] is 4.5 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other general questions or comments?Well, we are within $300 million of [our informal] limit. I would beinclined to take a holding action and say--. Is that limit $1-1/2billion or $2-1/2 billion?-148-2/2-3/81MR. ALTMANN. $2-1/2 billion.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd stick another quarter billion dollarsin there just to give us a little operating leeway. I don't know inany definitive way how the new Administration will feel about theTreasury's participation in this, but they haven't [expressed] anyobjection to what we have been doing. They are informed, and theyhaven't wanted to change it, presumably, at this stage. Whether theywill or not, I don't know. But they haven't yet and it may be usefulwhile we're meeting today to add another $250 million leeway. Let mepropose that. Do I take silence as acquiescence?MR. PARTEE. Well, it seems hard to resist it when the rateis 2.15 and I didn't vote against it when it was 1.90. I didn't likeit at 1.90, but I really do think we are going to be a product of avicious circle here, too, if we don't watch out.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We or the Germans?MR. PARTEE. "We" because we will find that the rate justwon't go back down.MR. WALLICH. Well, it's more of a Thatcher syndrome in thatwe seem to be getting impatient that it isn't going down by thevirtuous circle that we ought to be getting. But we are getting a 10percent reappreciation of the dollar and I wonder what is going tohappen to our exports here. If you're indifferent, I would havethought maybe a half billion dollars would be a better expression.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I said $250 million simply because,without going very far, [we ought to] let the Treasury consider it atsome point.MR. PARTEE. We have $300 million leeway, is that right?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have $300 million now, so that's--MR. PARTEE. So what we're really talking about is about ahalf billion dollars in operating leeway.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It seems to me a reasonable operatingleeway, that's all. If there are no objections, I will take that asan increase in the informal limit of a minimal size simply to provideoperating leeway for the time being.MS. TEETERS. Could I ask another question? Do the Germanshave plenty of dollars to intervene with?MR. PARDEE. Oh, yes. They have all those reserves they'veamassed over the years. And they've been picking up dollars fromSAMA. Every time SAMA wants marks, they go directly and--MS. TEETERS. SAMA?MR. SCHULTZ. Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority.MR. PARDEE. We've had the odd situation in which bothcentral banks were increasing their reserves at the same time over the-149-2/2-3/81last few months. The Germans are very worried about the 30 billionmark current account deficit they expect for this year and how much ofthat they might finance out of their reserves. But they've beenamassing reserves, as I say, until today when they really hit themarket very heavily.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Does it show up as a reduction intheir domestic money supply when they intervene to support the DM?MR. PARDEE. Today's operation, yes. But they're doing somany other operations with the money supply that it's hard to say whatthe net effect would be.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you have any other recommendations?MR. PARDEE. I have no other recommendations now that we'reclear on this one.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have to ratify the transactions.MR. WALLICH. Let me just mention something in response toTony's comment. I got a call from the Bundesbank in which they wantedto stress that they had not changed their policy relating to theprovision of liquidity that you might have in mind as the counterpartto the intervention. It had to do with the ending of an earlierliquidity scheme of larger size; it was not to be understood as achange in their policy.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do I have a motion?SPEAKER(?). So moved.SPEAKER(?). Second.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. We'll go to Mr.Sternlight who is going to have a short report before 1:00 p.m.MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Before I forget, maybe we ought to ratifythe transactions right now.SPEAKER(?). So moved.SPEAKER(?). Second.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection, they are ratified. Arewe going to have a lot of questions on this? Who knows? Let's spendfive minutes and see whether we can dispose of comments or questionsin that time. Who has a comment or question?MR. SCHULTZ. With that kind of entrance, you may get by withnone at all!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it was an interesting period. Idon't mean to shut off discussion. Is everybody satisfied? Well, wewill come back from lunch and have Mr. Axilrod present the short-rangetargets. I wonder if we can get back here by, let's say, 1:40 p.m.-150-2/2-3/81[Lunch break]MR. GRAMLEY. I have a poem [about] what could easily make itall wrong:Let's rely on the broader definitionsWhile eyeballing the level of ratesAnd pray that the economy does not sufferThe worst of all possible fates.MR. SCHULTZ. What I don't understand is why you read that tothose of us who are here. You should have read it to the ones whoweren't here. Punish them!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have carefully observed, as I saidearlier, everybody's arrival time. Mr. Schultz was not among theearly ones! We've already made the decision, but I wanted to notethat this is Bob Mayo's last meeting and he has rendered valuedservice through the years and we're [unintelligible].MR. MAYO. The highlight of my career at this table wassummarized by Mr. Gramley in his inadvertent remark this morning thatI had made a remark that was that of a genius. And I'll go home withthat thought!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand that you're going to be hereat the time of our next meeting--if not at the meeting, in thesurrounding area--and we will duly note the occasion. Mr. Axilrod.MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just to make sure we're clear. All thesenumbers you're talking about are not real numbers. They're numbersthat exist in your head.MR. AXILROD. Well, they have a certain reality in that--MR. SCHULTZ. Insofar as your head does!MR. AXILROD. I won't give you my wife's comments on that!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But they are adjusted numbers, as best onecan adjust them from the estimates we have of the shift. The actualnumbers will look different from this.MR. AXILROD. That's right. The actual numbers are chartedand are given in parentheses in the detailed tables on page 10 of theBluebook.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But the actual numbers themselves restupon particular assumptions about shifts.MR. AXILROD. That's right, assumptions about the amount ofshifts and the percentage of shifts. The assumptions are that inFebruary the amount of shift will be something on the order of $1-1/2billion and in March about $750 million and that the percentage out ofdemand deposits is something like 70 or 75 percent.151-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're obviously now in a difficult periodwhere assessments have to be made about the amount of shifting totrack these figures at all, so far as M1 is concerned. But apart fromthat difficulty I suppose the question that is raised is one oftactics. That is, are we relatively satisfied for a while with ashortfall from the target that was just established in the interest ofa better possibility of hitting that target for the year as a whole inwhatever contour [emerges] in connection with tax cutting programs orwhatever. As with the economic projection, there is also, I wouldthink, some consideration of the fact that in the last two quarters weovershot by a significant margin. And any undershoot from the annualtarget has to be assessed not only in the light of what we want to donext year but in the light of the overshoot in the most recent period.MS. TEETERS. Which one of these alternatives is built intothe economic forecast?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the economic forecast doesn't reston these quarterly figures that we have.MR. KICHLINE. No, it doesn't. There just are no significantdifferences in the first quarter that really matter. Our forecast isbuilt on the four-quarter path for the year.MR. PARTEE. I think "C" would make a difference. I don'tsee much difference between "A" and "B," but "C" would implysignificantly higher interest rates in the short run.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I wonder a bit. Nobody knows about theinterest rate forecast associated with any of these numbers. Thereseems to be some tendency for interest rates to decline during theperiod when money supply growth on balance has been negative.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm surprised at the difference inthe fed funds range between alternative "B" and alternative "C."There is only a 1-point difference, given a rather substantialdifference in the target.MR. AXILROD. Those are differences in [end] points. I thinkwithin the ranges we'd expect it to end somewhat differently. Wedidn't really center these exactly; that is, in "A" the funds rate isalready at 17 or 17-1/2 percent and could go down a bit from there,although we are a little skeptical about that. In "B" it looks to usas if it could go up a bit, and in "C" we think it could go up muchmore toward the top of that range. So, those are just notional andthey weren't precisely centered.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, in accordance with our earlierdiscussion, I think we should have a little discussion of what thesetargets mean for where we're setting the operational nonborrowedreserve target--or looked at the other way around, the immediatefigure on borrowings and in the light of any movement in these numbershow we might react. With all that preliminary, would someone like tosay something?VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Are we going to get the initialborrowing assumptions that are compatible with these threealternatives?-152-2/2-3/81 -153-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's talk about the alternativesfirst and then talk about the borrowing assumption.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My initial feeling would be somethingbetween "B" and "C." I think that to some extent we should accept theshortfall, but I don't think we now have to accept it completely. Myguess is that we would have a better chance of keeping interest ratesroughly constrained and not going any higher if we had somethingbetween "B" and "C." I think we are showing enough restraint, andthat would give us a little safety margin for later in the year.MR. GRAMLEY. If I understand correctly what is in theBluebook on page 14, both "B" and "C" could likely result in someupward pressure on interest rates, though "C" more so than "B." And Idon't see why we would want to adopt an alternative at this point thatwould result in upward pressure on interest rates, given theanticipation that the monthly pattern of economic activity will beweakening in the course of the first quarter.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The only problem with that is that I don'tbelieve that forecast; I have reservations.MR. GRAMLEY. I'm not certain about it, but it's close to myown prior view of where the economy is going to go in the firstquarter.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The interest rate forecast is derived fromsome quarterly forecast, isn't it?MR. KICHLINE. It's a quarterly-average forecast.MR. AXILROD. In essence what we're saying is that we'll havea very substantial velocity [increase] in the first quarter on averageand that it looks as if that would require pressure on rates.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand that, but it seems to me thatwhatever velocity increase we're going to get we've already gotten, soto speak, if we look at monthly figures.MR. AXILROD. Well, the only answer to that--it may not beconvincing--is that there's a lot of money that was in effect takenout of the economy in December, so there's some sense that you have toput that back on a month-by-month basis. But [what is put back]doesn't give us very much on a quarterly average, or as much as itseems, because so much had been taken out in December.MR. KICHLINE. In response to Governor Teeters's question,the explicit path built into the forecast is 3 percent for the firstquarter, which is very close to "A" or "B." But in terms of economiceffects, since we are constraining the forecast to 4-1/4 percent overthe whole year, if it's lower in the first quarter we assume that willbe made up later on so that we don't get substantial economic effectsfor the year in total.MR. PARTEE. Why is it, Steve, that the aggregate targets areso [disparate]? Ordinarily when we look at alternatives "A," "B," and"C," we see something close to an equal distance between them. And in2/2-3/81this case the difference between "B" and "C" seems extraordinary,particularly in view of the interest rate ranges.MR. AXILROD. That's because what I did with alternative C,Governor Partee, is to say that this is what the Committee adoptedlast time from December-to-March, a 4-1/4 percent rate for M-1A.MR. PARTEE. Oh, I see.MR. AXILROD. It's an option that says: Forget about theDecember shortfall and then just go ahead with that target. The basefell rather radically. What alternative C in essence does is toforget about that sharp drop in the base. The other two, in effect,make up for the drop in the base, though not entirely because they'rebased on the midquarter. But they get you back to the midpoint of thelonger-run range you adopted. Alternative C was just taking literallythe percentage increase, forgetting about the December shortfall andasking: Where does that leave you?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Last time we did say 4-1/4 percent or lessbasically.MR. AXILROD. Yes.MR. GUFFEY. There's another explanation there, Steve, inthat alternative B relates to alternative II, which had the lowerranges. We did not adopt those ranges. So you're talking aboutsomething between "A" and "C," but not "B" as consistent with what weadopted on the long run.MR. AXILROD. Well, alternative A gets to the midpoint of theranges you've adopted. We constructed alternative B to be at themidpoint of a tighter [set of ranges], and alternative C had therationale that I mentioned. But the Committee's decision todaydoesn't have to be based on those rationales, of course; it could bebased on an idea that you might want to be short or not.MR. GUFFEY. In response to Governor Partee, though, "A,""B," and "C" are not consistent numbers. "B" relates to alternativeII, the tighter one.MR. AXILROD. They had divergent rationales. They weren'tdone in the usual way where here's a midpoint--MR. GUFFEY. Yes, right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody else have a suggestion here?Mr. Boehne.MR. BOEHNE. I find "C" too restrictive for my taste, giventhe implications for higher interest rates. I'd like to drag my heelssome, though, in terms of getting back to the path alternative Aimplies. So, that puts me in the neighborhood of "B." But I agreewith Steve in that I don't think the Ms mean very much in this period.They have some marginal value. So, I would have a federal funds rangeof 15 to 20 percent in the directive, start the period about where thefunds rate is now, and if it looked as though the funds rate would-154-2/2-3/81have to go outside a 16 to 19 percent effective range, then I'd have aconsultation.MS. TEETERS. But one of the problems we have here is thatthose six months are when we're going to get the most fiscalrestraint; we will be getting the full impact of the windfall [fromlower prices on] oil plus the sharp increase in social security taxes.If the tax cut comes through, it would seem to me that we'd want ourrestraint more in the second half of the year than in the first halfwhen the economy is already headed down. I find the upper limits ofthese ranges very unacceptable anyway. But given what we know isgoing on, it seems to me that we should be somewhat looser during thefirst half than we are in the second. That would lead me toalternative A with a lower funds rate range, maybe 13 to 18 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else?MR. PARTEE. I think I'd go for "B" just as it is.MR. SCHULTZ I think I would, too. But my feeling is that ifwe do "B," a funds rate range of 14 to 20 percent rather than 15 to 21percent is going to be more--MR. MAYO. I agree with that.MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't really have any way of judgingthat, Fred. After all, we are going to be providing reserves on aschedule for the market. It seems pretty close to an even positionright now; that is, we have a hint that there may be a decline but wedon't have much evidence. It could be reversed and in the meantimeprices are going to go up faster, so nominal GNP could be prettystrong. I think there's about as much chance that the aggregates willcome in stronger than our path as that they will come in weaker, soessentially it would be a fairly neutral option. With the funds rateat 17-1/2 percent now, one could argue for 15 to 20 percent, as Eddid. I wouldn't constrain it, though, with a telephone call becausewe're only talking about a 2-1/2 percentage point move one way or theother from where we now are.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Winn.MR. WINN. In this wonderful world of exposition that we'refaced with, are you troubled by the imaginary targets that we'resetting out and then an imaginary short-term target that's above theranges that we prescribed? That seems to me to become a difficultproblem.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I worry about it literally.MR. WINN. That's why I'd like to come in at least between"B" and "C." I'd put a restraint on the funds rate being over 20percent instead of--MS. TEETERS. We're well below target at the present time.We're well outside of the range.-155-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say we're well outside of the range.Where are you measuring it from? We were too high in the fourthquarter; we now look a little low only because December was low.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. January is showing good growth.MS. TEETERS. Depending upon your assumption about theshifts.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.MR. CORRIGAN. I am comfortable with "B" or somethingslightly less than "B." But I have one question to Mr. Axilrod. Whenyou construct the nonborrowed reserve path, you effectively will haveto do that off the numbers in parentheses in Table 10, right?MR. AXILROD. That's right.MR. CORRIGAN. So, no matter what we pick in terms of a path,the pressures on the funds rate that we will see or not see in thisinterval may be more directly a function of the accuracy of theseestimates than anything else.MR. AXILROD. Well, when the estimates turn out to be wrong,as they did of course after December, some of the degree of errorought to be compensated for by multiplier adjustments so to speak.That is, if there is a lot more money coming from savings accountsinto NOW accounts, which have higher reserve requirements, we shouldbe adjusting the path for that so that we don't get inadvertenttightening and vice-versa.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we have any alternative butto rely upon whatever estimates and changing estimates the staff maymake as we go along. I don't have great faith in their estimates, butI wouldn't have any more faith in any estimates that we try to make uphere. I think we're just stuck with that. It may make us a littlemore sensitive to wide gyrations in interest rates; we may at leastwant to use that to a small extent as an indicator. Governor Wallich.MR. WALLICH. I'd like to start the year off right.MR. SCHULTZ. [Unintelligible]. Now we're going to get "D!"MR. WALLICH. No, I just don't want to exceed our targetswith an early set [of ranges that are above them], so I'd like to comein a little lower than "B."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER(?). A little lower than "B"?MR. WALLICH. Yes, somewhere between "B" and "C" in otherwords, but with 16 to 22 percent [on the funds range]. I'm asking agreat deal.MS. TEETERS. Just a floor.MR. WALLICH. "B" to "C" or sort of "B minus."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.-156-2/2-3/81MR. GUFFEY. I would join those who prefer something between"B" and "C." The problem is complicated as far as I can see becauseof the very sharp one-month drop in money growth in December. Itrebounded in January and we had about 6-1/2 percent growth, which isabove the long-run target that we just established for 1981. If youlook at "A," for example, the money growth that we would have to haveon a monthly basis to get back to our 4-1/4 percent growth by the endof March involves very large figures. The same is true of "B." Itseems to me that we shouldn't [go that fast]. [My prescription]represents what we have done in the past; we've tried to [make up]about one-third of the [way each month, taking three months] to getback to the midpoint. I would suggest that we get back to themidpoint by April or sometime beyond.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suspect in this connection that you haveworked out here someplace--these are monthly figures on page 9--whatthe implied quarterly average is?MR. AXILROD. Well, they're all relatively low. Thosenumbers are in the table on page 10 on the bottom line.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Right, they are low.MR. PARTEE. Because of the profile.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right; it's because of Decemberbeing low. What we might do is think of it as an average of those twofigures.MR. AXILROD. That would be a better way to look at it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That works out fine. [Unintelligible] theaverage is high, and if you look at the quarterly figure, it is low.MR. GUFFEY. Well, just to conclude, I have one other point.If we were to adopt "A," for example, or even "B," we would get backclose to the midpoint by the end of March. And if we're going to hitthe targets we've established for 1981, then we'd have to drop themonthly growth rate of around 6 to 8 percent--8 percent under "A"--back to 4 or 4-1/4 percent. That would really be putting on thebrakes again at the start of the second quarter. It makes more senseto me to take another month or so to get back to the midpoint ratherthan to try to reach it by March as represented by "A" or "B." So,I'd favor someplace between "B" and "C," with the federal funds rateprobably in a range of 15 to 20 percent. I agree with some of thecomments around the table in that I have little confidence in theinterest rate projections in the Bluebook.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you suggesting a funds rate range?MR. GUFFEY. 15 to 20 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 15 to 20 percent.MR. PARTEE. That rule of one-third [of the divergence] amonth for three months, which we did discuss at some length yesterday,is a very reasonable point, Roger. What would that mean in terms ofgetting back, Steve? Have you figured it out? You'd have to take a-157-2/2-3/81little off February and March, I presume, on alternative B. Onalternative A you'd have to take a little off because "A" gets us backto the midpoint, right?MR. AXILROD. "A" got back to the midpoint within 3 months.MR. GUFFEY. Taking January [M-1B growth] at 6-1/2 percent.MR. PARTEE. We wouldn't want to think of that as a regular[procedure], though.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else? Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. I'd buy going between "A" and "B."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Between "A" and "B"?MR. MORRIS. I mean between "B" and "C," as Roger indicated,with a funds range of 15 to 20 percent. With the economy softening, Idon't think it would be suitable at this stage to indicate that we aremoving the interest rate range up. The only number I understand inthat is the M2 number. Assuming the economy cooperates with us, whichI don't think it will, that would mean 8 percent on M2, which is notbad given the range.MS. TEETERS. What is the funds rate range now?MR. MORRIS. 15 to 20 percent.MS. TEETERS. 15 percent with no top.MR. MAYO. The top is 20 percent.MR. MORRIS. It's 15 to 20 percent, so we wouldn't be makingany change.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else? Mr. Balles or Mr. Mayo.MR. BALLES. Just a quick question, if I may, to help me makeup my mind. This is a question to the staff, Steve. Have you seen,or do you have any opinion about, the assertions in the financialpress by some commentators and money watchers that the December dropwas not a real drop--that financial institutions were misreporting tous? The [alleged] scenario is that both banks and S&Ls were gettingcranked up to issue NOW accounts, which weren't legal until the firstof the year, and were making moves internally to take things out ofsavings accounts but hadn't yet classified them as NOW accounts andwere calling them in reports to us "other liabilities." I don't knowwhether that has any merit in reality. I'm asking you.MR. AXILROD. Yes, I have heard of that. I don't believe wehave noticed any substantial increase or change in the otherliabilities category, but I haven't inspected that personally. Wehave not found any real evidence of something like that going on. But[money supply] behavior in the last two weeks of December and thefirst week of January was rather odd; my inclination has been to throwthose three weeks out and start [comparing] recent weeks of January-158-2/2-3/81with where we were because they did drop sharply and then rosesharply. There was a very big increase in M-1A after adjustments.MR. BALLES. I thought you might have had a chance to look atthe trend of the so-called other liabilities that came in.MR. AXILROD. No, I just can't answer that directly. Wedidn't find anything, but there is this peculiarity of the depositdata that we think is just a bad seasonal. But we have to lookelsewhere.MR. BALLES. Well, with that uncertainty, I guess I wouldcome out where several others have already, between "B" and "C."MR. GRAMLEY. When people say between "B" and "C," there issuch a large gap between them--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's get to that at the next stage. Doyou have a federal funds opinion, Mr. Balles?MR. BALLES. 15 to 21 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Mayo.MR. MAYO. Well, since I'm the oldest person around thetable, I'll brag that some 50 years ago I learned for the first timethat the square root of -1 is an imaginary number. It was only when Iarrived at this table that I really learned what imaginary numbers areall about! I think we should repeat our humility that we really don'tknow what we are doing on any of these alternatives and that the bestwe can do is to take the staff's very loose translation here and playwith it, granting that by next week there may be a different set ofnumbers. I think we have to do that in this particular intermeetingperiod; our only refuge is really the way the federal funds ratebehaves regardless of how much bowing and scraping we do about theaggregates. Having said that, I come out also shading "B" toward "C."Just to start that discussion going, I'd say 5-1/2 percent for M-1Aand/or M-1B, 8 percent for M2, and 14 to 20 percent for federal funds.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In all this talk, which I share, that wecan't interpret these figures with precision, let us not forget thatwe can't interpret them with precision even when the numbers are notdistorted. We have a plus or minus 10 percent error anyway, so we areonly slightly worse off in some sense than we ordinarily are.MR. MAYO. Well, we could vote on whether we are 10 percentor 20 percent worse off! That would be further expression--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I would favor "B." That's thealternative that would have gotten us to the midpoint of alternativeII, which I favored. Since the Committee voted for alternative I, Iwouldn't want to go quite to the midpoint of that. So I'd stick with"B." And I think there's a great deal of merit to keeping thatfederal funds ceiling at 20 percent. I haven't much sympathy withceilings but I don't think this is the time to raise it.-159-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roos.MR. ROOS. I would lean toward either alternative A oralternative B. I don't feel strongly enough that I would bepassionately opposed to "C." But we should remember the experience wehad in the early part of last year when we permitted the aggregates todrop from a rather high rate of growth down to a significantly lowerrate of growth. We had M-1B growth over the second half of last yearof something like--I don't know exactly--12 to 14 percent, and we arejamming it down even with alternative A to a significantly lower rate.In my way of analyzing the effects of changes in the growth of theaggregates, I am impressed by research that we've done that shows thatwhen we have an abrupt drop in the rate of money growth from a higherpace to a lower pace and hold it there, that does have a very negativeeffect on output and can precipitate a recession. And it usuallydoes. I think we should really try to avoid unseemly fluctuations inthese aggregates. I would intellectually lean toward the lessrestrictive of "A" or "B," but I wouldn't go to the mat on any ofthese three alternatives. I do feel that the fed funds rate range,short of this Committee overwhelmingly going to a broad range of 1 to20 percent, should be as broad as possible. I'd opt for 14 to 20percent to keep it broad.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.MR. RICE. I would go with alternative B. That alternativeseems to be fairly consistent with the longer-range targets that weadopted, which came out to be someplace in between alternatives I andII. Alternative B promises to get us back to the midpoint ofalternative II by March. So, I would go along with "B" and a federalfunds range of 14 to 20 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who are we missing? Mr. Ford.MR. FORD. I'd go with "B" and keeping the fed funds rate ina range of 14 to 20 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who else is missing? Mr. Boykin.MR. BOYKIN. I would go with "B" with the fed funds rangeshaded to 15 to 20 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Somebody else is missing here. Whom did Inot count?MR. SCHULTZ. Yes, I said what I wanted.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I guess that's right; I don't have [Mr.Gramley].MR. GRAMLEY. I would go with "B." I would be willing tolive with some shading on the down side of "B," if that's the wayothers vote. I wouldn't push interest rates down deliberately to getnumbers as high as "B," if they came in below that. But I wouldn'tlike to see interest rates go up in an effort to try to squeeze thegrowth rate down much below "B."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where are you on the federal funds range?-160-2/2-3/81MR. GRAMLEY. The 15 to 21 percent range is all right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For the very reasons Roger suggested--andalso because of the fact that we were high for about 5 months, not[just] the last 2 months--if I look at the quarterly averages, I'm notthe least bit concerned about having a low quarter on a monthlyaverage basis. I don't think we want declines in the money supply aswe look ahead. We know we don't have all that close control overthese things, but it would concern me if the money supply began movinginto the kind of fall that it did last year, and I think we ought torespond to that. Short of that, I don't think we have much to worryabout in the short run. On the federal funds rate range, a majorityof the Committee wants a top limit of 20 percent or below, and that'strue of almost all the participants not on the Committee. I wouldpropose that we not put the federal funds rate range above 20 percent.[Views on] the bottom are scattered around 14 and 15 percent. I'm notsure that's too terribly vital at this point. The range is 15 to 20percent now. I suppose absolutely the most neutral thing to do is toleave it where it is. We are right in the middle of that range now.I share the view that some place between "B" and "C" isright. I share the instinct that Governor Gramley just expressed inthat I wouldn't want to make a great effort to get down as low as "C"or below "B," if that took a lot of effort. But I would not be verydisturbed if it goes there without any effort. This all bears uponwhere we put the borrowing number. We have to put some numbers downhere. I wonder whether they shouldn't be expressed as a quarterlyaverage. What have we been doing recently? Have we been expressingthem as quarterly averages or--?MR. PARTEE. They are December-to-March, for example, but notquarterly averages.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The reason that occurred to me is thatsome of these numbers sound rather high to put down as a target whenwe just adopted a long-range target [with an upper limit of] 5-1/2percent. If we suddenly put down a number that says we are startingoff fresh out of the box with 6-1/2 percent, even though we canrationalize it, I don't know how many readers are going to berationalizing it.MR. MAYO. Well, that's one reason for using 5-1/2 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What is the target we just adopted: 3 to5-1/2 percent?MR. WALLICH. 3 to 5-1/2 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For M-1B?MR. WALLICH. No, that's 3-1/2 to 6 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-1B and 3 to5-1/2 percent for M-1A.MR. MAYO. Why don't we use 5-1/2 or 6 percent? It's thecowardly way out perhaps, but it isn't too far from the best analysisof our staff.-161-2/2-3/81MR. WALLICH. That would suit me.MR. ROOS. What are we talking about right now? I'm lost.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's a round number. It's going tobe either 5-1/2 or 6 percent, I guess, or we can say roughly 5 to 6percent if we want to indicate a little less precision. One thing forsure: We won't be between 5 and 6 if we say 5 to 6 percent for a2-month period.MR. MORRIS. Nobody will ever know what the number is, Paul.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Nobody will ever know what the number isanyway.MR. MAYO. Is this December-to-March now?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm looking at the December-to-Marchnumbers, yes.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But in drawing up the reservenumbers, the staff needs a little [narrower] guideline I would think.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I suppose if we say 5 to 6 percent,they will assume 5-1/2 percent.MR. GUFFEY. Is that for M-1B?MR. PARTEE. 5 to 6 percent for what?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, both of these numbers are the same.So what I'm talking about are both the M1 numbers.MR. PARTEE. Both of them?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They're both the same now.MR. PARTEE. Oh, I see.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. They're not the same in "C."MS. TEETERS. ["A" and] "B" [don't have] a half percentagepoint [difference] in the numbers.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why is that?MR. AXILROD. Oh, don't ask.MR. MAYO. We've worn Steve out!MR. AXILROD. That's explained in some footnote, which Ithink is accurate. It has to do with where the month of Decemberended up relative to the quarterly average. We constructed the pathgoing from the quarterly average to March, but December's numbers forM-1A and M-1B were divergent relative to where they were on thequarterly average.MR. SCHULTZ. You were right about don't ask!-162-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What's your explanation of why in "C" M-1Bis different from M-1A?MR. AXILROD. There we just started out in December and wentahead with the normal divergence between M-1A and M-1B.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But why isn't it the same for the others?MR. AXILROD. Because we--SPEAKER(?). Don't ask.MR. AXILROD. I would gladly explain it to you after themeeting.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we are at a level of detail thatisn't going to be significant.MS. TEETERS. Steve, am I correct that if we go for anythingless than "B," then total reserves will decline over the quarter?MR. AXILROD. I think that's what we have, but that'ssomewhat an artifact of how the averages for the weeks with laggedreserve accounting worked out. Over the next 2 months it's lower.MS. TEETERS. And if we went closer to "C," we'd have arather sharp decline in total reserves?MR. AXILROD. There would be a decline. I don't have theexact number at hand.MR. MORRIS. That's a decline related to the hypotheticalnumbers, though. The actual reserve numbers would be growing,reflecting a shift out of savings accounts into NOWs. If we get alarge part of [the estimated shift from savings accounts], that's alot of reserves: from nothing to 12 percent.MS. TEETERS. Yes, but this is a total reserves base.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know on what basis it is.That's what Frank is questioning. Is that a hypothetical reservefigure?MR. AXILROD. No, that's a real reserve figure. Reservesdecline 3 percent allegedly under alternative C, assuming all theshifts are as we estimated. I don't think what happens to reserves,of course, is as important as what happens to the money. That takesaccount of lagged reserve accounting, which can make for a certainartificiality.MR. SCHULTZ. It does affect the borrowings, though. How areyou going to decide on what the borrowings are?MR. AXILROD. We suggest for alternative B something like$1.5 billion, which turns out to be very close to where borrowing isrunning this week.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You think it has to be that high?-163-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. Borrowing in the week of January 28 was $1.8billion. In the week of January 21, it was $1.4 billion; and in theweek of the 14th, it was $1.3 billion. It has been rising recentlyand the funds rate has been dropping. The funds rate dropped off thisweek.MR. STERNLIGHT. It's about $1,350 million so far this week.MR. AXILROD. And the funds rate is about 17-1/2 percent.So, we'd say $1.5 billion or perhaps a little less. We're somewhatuncertain.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If anything, we have had a slightlydeclining trend in the money supply since the first week of January.Why would we be increasing the borrowing?MR. SCHULTZ. Nonborrowed reserves are coming down fairlyrapidly.MR. AXILROD. Well, it looked as if there was a sharp drop inthe demand for borrowing in December. So, borrowing was low and thefunds rate was a lot higher than it is now--19 to 20 percent. That'swhat we generally thought was an oddity. More recently it appearedthat what one might have thought of as "normal" relationships werebeing reestablished. But they're being reestablished with borrowinggoing up and the funds rate dropping. This really reflects the factthat we don't think what we had in early January reflects, in essence,banks' demand for borrowing at the funds rate we've projected here,which in fact under alternative B--assuming the economy doesn'tcollapse under foot--is a somewhat higher funds rate than we now have.If the Committee believes that the funds rate should be lower eitherway, then I would certainly suggest to the Committee that it take alower borrowing level.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know where the funds rateshould be. But just looking at the last few weeks, the tendency isfor the money supply to decline with our current level of borrowing,and I would think the natural thing to have, until you have shown usdifferently, is a somewhat lower level of borrowing.MS. TEETERS. That would say we reduced borrowing and totalreserves.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know what the total reserveshave to do with the money supply.MS. TEETERS. You don't think it's [unintelligible]?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's increasing nonborrowed reserves.MR. PARTEE. What's the borrowing figure with "A"?MR. AXILROD. In "A" we had it closer to what it had beenrecently, more like $1-1/4 billion.MR. PARTEE. It's $1-1/4 billion for "A" and $1-1/2 billionfor "B."-164-2/2-3/81MR. AXILROD. Given recent experience, if borrowing in thelast two weeks is anywhere near what bank demands for borrowing are,that would suggest that $1-1/4 billion would perhaps lead to a drop inthe funds rate--one can't be all that certain--from around the currentlevel. We had made that more consistent with "A," where we thoughtthe odds on a drop in interest rates were greater but not with "B,"where we thought the odds were less that interest rates would drop.MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I sensed yesterday in our discussionthat the one improvement in our operating procedures that we werewilling to sign off on, as of that time, was to move our nonborrowedreserve path more frequently to follow any changes in the borrowinglevel. If we do that, it seems to me that it's less important thatour borrowing assumption be totally accurate. If we do what I thinkwe said yesterday we were going to do, this will be adjustedfrequently. So, I'd like to suggest specifically--I hope I'm notmoving too quickly into the directive but I think it's terriblyimportant that we write this into our procedure because this isgermane to what we are talking about--that we put a sentence in at theend of the paragraph of the draft directive shown on page 17 thatwould read something like this: "The Committee assumes that memberbank borrowings will average ___" (fill in whatever we assume duringwhatever period we use) "and instructs the Manager to adjust thenonborrowed reserve path appropriately and promptly if borrowingsdeviate from this assumption." Putting that in the directive gives uswhat I think we agreed yesterday would be a procedural change in ouroperating techniques. It makes it an unmistakable reflection of whatthe Committee said yesterday it was seeking to do. And it putsflexibility into this borrowing assumption exercise and really makesthe initial borrowing assumption less important because we can adjuston a day-to-day or every-other-day basis if our borrowing assumptionproves to be a mistaken one.MR. WALLICH. Would you bring it back to where we had itoriginally by changing the path or would you drive it up or down bychanging the path?MR. ROOS. We would assume that it's impossible to anticipatewhat borrowings would be. Borrowings will occur due to forces notdirectly under our control. We would merely adjust the nonborrowedreserve path to what happens from moment-to-moment or day-to-day inthe totals of member bank borrowing so that we don't try to anticipateor estimate what number to plug in.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think it works that way, Larry.Your basic idea, I think, may be useful. I'm not sure we could writethe language here. The borrowings aren't totally predictable, but forthe most part we make them what they are. The real question thatarises is what we do with the nonborrowed reserve path when the moneysupply deviates and therefore generates--if we don't change the path--a difference in borrowing. But it's not exactly unanticipated; it'santicipated. What we want to end up doing in those conditions is thatif the money supply is high, we'd reduce the nonborrowed reserves andincrease the borrowings still further, not the reverse.MR. WALLICH. If we vary the path merely enough to drive thebanks back to the same level of borrowing, we are coming close topegging the funds rate, which surely isn't what you have in mind.-165-2/2-3/81MR. PARTEE. We adjust the total reserves. That is, ifborrowing goes high, we cut nonborrowed in order to keep the total--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But that's not what that language says.We'd have to--MR. PARTEE. That's what he means.MR. ROOS. Well, that's what I mean to try to achieve--atotal reserves result consistent with what we want to do and, ofcourse, it implies a--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the language would have to readthat if total reserves went off after all our multiplier adjustmentsand all the rest, we would increase the borrowings, not bring themback to the initial level.MR. ROOS. Yes, that might be a better way of stating it.But the principle, I feel, is important.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think it's a mistake to lockourselves in too precisely in terms of the directive. For example, wehave never spelled out in the directive the initial borrowingassumption, even though I know Peter Sternlight would like it. Thereare problems if we try to lock this in. We can and have instructedthe Desk that it's the sense of the Committee that we want a prompteradjustment in the nonborrowed reserve path if we begin to see misses;but I don't know of any parameter we can give for a specific concreteinstruction on that. It's still going to be judgmental.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe we can work on this for the nextmeeting. I don't think the language that Larry has is technicallyaccurate, but maybe we can get some sense of this for next time. Isuspect we will be here all afternoon if we try to do it today.MR. WALLICH. If we simply said "shall vary the path in sucha manner that total reserves are kept on track"--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's a little strong.MR. WALLICH. It's perhaps a little strong, but the point isthat borrowed reserves would be varied from their original--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What it says now is: "In the short run,the Committee seeks behavior of reserve aggregates consistent withgrowth..." We could say: "In the short run, the Committee seeksbehavior of reserve aggregates...and shall so adjust the provision ofnonborrowed reserves consistent with growth..."MR. ROOS. I think there is a certain urgency to it because Ihonestly believe there's a great deal of anticipation and interest inwhat the FOMC will choose to do with the study that was conducted. Wesort of put in abeyance many of the proposals or the options thatSteve's study highlighted. But one that we didn't was this. If wedon't come up with something, I think we can be accused rightfully of,[despite] the study, still conducting our business in the same waythat caused us to miss our targets last year. Again, the big trick isnot just choosing targets but accomplishing them in the year 1981.-166-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we will say something about that inthe testimony, which will be out before the directive is out.MR. GRAMLEY. It seems to me that in the world of uncertaintyin which we are living--with this very, very rapid transition fromdemand deposits and other accounts to NOWs--the worst thing in theworld we can do is to tell the Manager and other staff to speed upthis adjustment process to uncertain numbers. Let's wait until theend of the month and take a look at it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would suggest we defer this in terms ofthe directive. It may be a reasonable suggestion, but we will have tomention something about this in the testimony.MR. SCHULTZ. We'll just blame it on the guy who ran thecredit controls!MR. GUFFEY. I don't mean to resurrect yesterday's discussionbut it seemed to me that we did assume yesterday that there would bemore rapid adjustments in the nonborrowed path. I'd like to go onrecord as saying that I don't happen to agree with that; I thinkthat's what Lyle was talking about.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There certainly was some difference ofopinion expressed yesterday, but I think the weight, at least in termsof a majority opinion, was that we would be looking at that with agreat deal of sensitivity.MR. GUFFEY. A majority opinion, yes. I just want toregister [my disagreement with that].CHAIRMAN VOLCKER It wasn't any powerful unanimous accolade,as I understood it.MS. TEETERS. Steve, if you locked in on the volume ofborrowing, wouldn't your multiplier go all over the map?MR. AXILROD. If we held the level of borrowing, all thestudies suggest we would get further off path than if we varied it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What we are talking about now is in whichdirection the risk is with regard to where the money supply will go.And nobody knows very well. My sense of it is, compared to your $1.5billion, that [borrowing] has been declining a little. It's possiblethe economy is declining. Without being very fancy about it, I guessI would take the risk more on reducing the volume of borrowing fromthe figure you suggested than raising it from the current level, whichis what is involved in your suggestion. [I say that] just as astarting point. If we get a week or two of high money supply figures,then obviously, consistent with everything we have been saying, wewould change it in one direction or another.MR. ROOS. Paul, how would you respond to the question: Whatis going to be done differently this year than last year? You saidthat, hopefully, your testimony will touch on that. The public, or atleast interested people, do know that we've had this study. And thestudy was an excellent one. How do you respond?-167-2/2-3/81 -168-CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think the primary point, and whatI will try to list in the testimony, is what came out of the study.But in this sense, it seems to me the most important thing that cameout of the study is that the present technique wasn't that bad.MR. ROOS. Well--and I say this with the greatest respect forall of you--if any of us tries to say that last year's performance wassatisfactory, I would just have to disagree totally. I think an awfullot of people would disagree.MR. SCHULTZ. Larry, I think the answer to your question isthat we're not going to have credit controls in 1981.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, there are other things, too. I getthis [criticism] all the time, of course, most specifically from thecurrent Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee. I'm justusing him as an example because of his institutional position. He isin a mood where he says: "I don't give a damn where those money supplyfigures go, but you have too much volatility in interest rates." Now,that is one source of criticism. Everybody can unite on criticizingus on volatility. One group comes at it from the standpoint ofinstability in the money supply and another group comes at it frominstability in interest rates. One of the things that came out of thestudy--I don't know whether the study was all this strong on thispoint but I'd love to make it this strong--was that you can't have itboth ways, boys. You can criticize us for one or the other, but notboth. Now, we know what the particularly monetarist oriented peopleare talking about. Mr. Garn has put it quite clearly, saying: "I'msick and tired of all that monetarist business. I don't like thesefluctuations in interest rates." That's a--MR. FORD. I think the volatility issue will be less of aproblem for us if we don't have credit controls again. The last time[the funds rate] went from 16 to 6 percent from top to bottom and thenfrom 6 to 21 percent. So, from peak to trough to peak, we had a 25--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Also, we're going to have a nicestagnantly stable economy!SPEAKER(?). Yes.MR. PARTEE. There's also a 10 percent--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have a lot of sympathy for what you'resaying, Larry, because I've got to answer the questions. But I don'twant to get out of one box and we say we're doing things differentlyfor the sake of doing things differently and then find out that we'rein another box.MR. ROOS. But I would hate, when I'm on my wedding bed andwe're awfully close to making changes that we've been seeking foryears and years, just to be lulled into sleep. That's a bad--MR. MAYO. Larry, I'm really going to miss the Open MarketCommittee meetings!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I could think of quite a few responses tothat, Larry, from which I will refrain!2/2-3/81MR. GRAMLEY. I think you'd be better send him up to testify!MR. SCHULTZ. You've put a totally new light on ourprocedures!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. May I return to our operational decision?Steve put forward the hypothesis of $1-1/2 billion of borrowing tostart with. I tell you, that makes me a little nervous as I see theprobabilities. But it's anybody's guess in practice, I suppose.MR. MORRIS(?). Make it $1-1/4 billion.MR. PARTEE. Was it $1.3 billion last week, did you say?MR. AXILROD. Last week it was higher; it was $1.7 to $1.8billion.MR. STERNLIGHT. But this week so far it's $1.35 billion.MR. PARTEE. Oh, it was moving up again. That's right. Itwas low and--SPEAKER(?). It was higher.MR. GUFFEY. Have excess reserves come down this past week?MR. AXILROD. They've generally been running relatively high.I don't know how they're going to come out this week.MR. GUFFEY. Well, does that account for the drop of the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is a particularly confusing period.But what I'm looking at is the recent trend in the money supply--andif anything it may go too low--and the economic outlook. Steve islooking at the willingness of the banks to borrow recently. He saysthe money markets are relatively easy, given the amount of borrowing,so that leads him to believe that the borrowing figure ought to stayup. So, there are your choices.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The economy may be getting a littlestronger.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that's what you think--that the economymay be a little strong and it continued--that would give weight towhat Steve is saying. If the risk is the money supply being too high,you shade borrowing up and you end up where he is.MR. WALLICH. Well, the banks still haven't exhausted much oftheir borrowing capacity for this quarter. In other words, weprobably can expect them to be borrowing more in January and Februarythan in March, given the administrative procedures.MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I certainly would go along with a levelof borrowing that's lower.MS. TEETERS. That's not inconsistent with the targets wehave for the money supply?-169-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Who knows?MR. SCHULTZ. I don't know.MR. PARTEE. I think it is.SPEAKER(?). I think so.MR. GRAMLEY. It's pretty hard to guess. We're talking about$250 million from borrowing. None of us knows the accuracy of ourforecast of borrowing so we don't know who is going to be right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Anybody for $1.3 billion?MR. GRAMLEY. That's a good compromise.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me assume something generally in thatneighborhood. It depends upon how we want to word it. Is there anyappeal to saying 5 to 6 percent as a hypothetical figure for M-1A andM-1B? I suppose we'd say 8 percent or so for M2.MR. GRAMLEY. I think it would make good sense to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm talking now about the directivelanguage. We fill in those blanks by saying 5 to 6 percent for theM1s and about 8 percent for M2 and leave the federal funds rangewhere it is at 15 to 20 percent, with the understood borrowingassumption. We did have language in the last directive implying thatwe were less concerned about a shortfall than an overshoot. Do youwant to retain some language of that sort or not?SEVERAL. No.MR. PARTEE. I don't think so--not after December.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We may want to help correct anymisimpressions of the kind you mentioned earlier by saying"recognizing the shortfall in December."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It might be useful to get some prettyclear language--I don't know whether in the directive or not--aboutwhat this implies for the quarterly average. We'd say it implies alow quarterly average to avoid misconceptions.MS. TEETERS. What period exactly are you talking about:December-to-March or the quarterly average or from February?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In the 5 to 6 percent figure, we'retalking December-to-March. I guess it doesn't make any difference.Well, the average makes a difference. It doesn't make any difference,if I understand this, [if we use] from January-to-March.MS. TEETERS. The 5 to 6 percent for M-1B is a lot closer to"C" than it is to "B."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If it'll make you happy, I'll look at theJanuary-to-March on this now.-170-2/2-3/81MR. MAYO. It doesn't make a difference anyway.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What I was talking about was the December-to-March figure. For some reason it seems to make very littledifference which one we're looking at.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Then you would put the quarterlyfigures in the directive?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would suggest putting some quarterlyfigure in the directive just so people can see it in perspective.MR. ALTMANN. Directive or policy record?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the directive, in case anybodyjust reads the directive. So, that's the proposition: 5 to 6 percentfor the M1s, about 8 percent for M2, 15 to 20 percent on the federalfunds rate, and an understood initial borrowing level somewhere around$1.3 billion. These borrowings always mean adjustment borrowing asinterpreted by Mr. Axilrod. Those are all the specifications we need.And there is no bias in the statement. Is that clear?MR. BALLES. The only thing that isn't quite clear to me atleast is what the Manager will understand he's to do, if, as, and whenthe borrowing assumption goes considerably off from the $1.3 billion.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think it's if the borrowingassumption goes off; it's if the money supply trend goes off. If itgoes low, he reduces it; if it goes high, he increases it.SPEAKER(?). The path?MR. WALLICH. The borrowing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The borrowing, yes.MR. GUFFEY. What is the federal funds rate assumptionconsistent with $1.3 billion of borrowing?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Apparently Mr. Axilrod thinks it's goingto decline. That's a--MR. AXILROD. That's the range of uncertainty. If youbelieve the borrowing level of early December and early January, youmight think there will be an increase. If you believe the borrowinglevel of very recent weeks, you might think there will be a decline.MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, our guessing hasn't been very good onthis, but if I made a guess--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, the guessing hasn't been very good.MR. STERNLIGHT. --I'd think it would drift off somewhat with$1.3 billion in borrowing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's implicit in Steve's earlier commentthat he thinks it's likely to drift off, but there's a considerableamount of uncertainty.-171-2/2-3/81MR. PARTEE. You mean it would drift off so long as theaggregates aren't coming in strong.MR. ROOS. In line with the spirit of quick adjustments onthese, could we ask the Manager to incorporate in his report at ournext meeting some record, as specific as possible, of what happened interms of unanticipated fluctuations and how the Desk responded?MR. PARTEE. Adjustments in the nonborrowed path? We alreadyget them now.MR. AXILROD. Yes, we generally put that in the Bluebook eachtime.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. Do people understand what we'revoting on?MR. ALTMANN.Chairman Volcker YesVice Chairman Solomon YesGovernor Gramley YesPresident Guffey YesPresident Morris YesGovernor Partee YesGovernor Rice YesPresident Roos YesGovernor Schultz YesGovernor Teeters NoGovernor Wallich NoPresident Winn YesMR. SCHULTZ. That's better.SPEAKER(?). It was hard.MR. SCHULTZ. It was asymmetric in that--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me ask another question that occurredto me earlier. I don't think we have to make this a Committeedecision. Mr. Axilrod keeps telling me that if we make the targetwide enough one target we can always make--which makes people happy--is the reserve base because it's four-fifths currency and it's afairly easy figure to predict. I'm talking about the annual targets.Do you think it would be useful to put in a statement someplace--notin terms of an operational target--that we believe this is allconsistent with growth in the monetary base of such and such?MR. MORRIS. Sure.OTHERS. Yes.MR. WALLICH. I feel there is a matter or principle involvedhere in that the base, in my mind, is not a defensible figure. Ithappens to fit. We can get a correlation with any large number thatgrows slowly the way currency does, but it isn't meaningful.-172-2/2-3/81 -173-MR. GRAMLEY. Henry, I've compromised my principles on M-1A,M-1B, M2, and M3. You ought to be able to compromise yours on thebase.VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We fully agreed to what you proposed,Henry, shading from alternative "B" and "C."MR. WALLICH. Well, [I dissented] because of the borrowingassumption--I wanted $1.5 billion--and the interest rate. I wouldhave been willing to settle for less than what I said, which was "C,"but not quite so low.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay, thank you.END OF MEETING
