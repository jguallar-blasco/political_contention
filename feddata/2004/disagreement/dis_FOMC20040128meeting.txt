January 27-28, 20042 of 238Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on January 27-28, 2004 January 27
—Afternoon Session CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I’ll call on Governor Ferguson.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you.
The first order of business is to elect a Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Committee to serve until our first meeting of 2005.
The floor is open to nominations for both of those positions.
Maybe Governor Kohn would like to make a nomination.
[Laughter] MR. KOHN.
I’ve been in the undecided category for a long time.
Today’s the day to make a decision.
MR.
FERGUSON.
We can’t have a primary, though.
Why don’t you put forth your nominations so we can move on?
MR.
KOHN.
I nominate Alan Greenspan to be Chairman and Tim Geithner to be Vice Chairman of the Committee.
SEVERAL.
Second.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Any objections?
Any other nominations?
Hearing no objections and no other nominations, by acclamation we have a newly elected Chairman and Vice Chairman to serve for the year.
Congratulations!
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Thank you.
[Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.
Democracy moves quickly.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I understand that.
With respect to staff officers, I’ll call on our Secretary to read the nominees.
MR.
BERNARD.
The list of proposed officers is as follows:
January 27-28, 20043 of 238Secretary and Economist Vincent Reinhart Deputy Secretary Normand Bernard Assistant Secretary Michelle Smith General Counsel Virgil Mattingly Deputy General Counsel Thomas Baxter, Jr. Economist Karen Johnson Economist David Stockton Associate Economists from the Board Thomas Connors David Howard Brian Madigan Larry Slifman David Wilcox Associate Economists from the Reserve Banks Christine Cumming, proposed by President Geithner Jeffrey Fuhrer, proposed by President Minehan Craig Hakkio, proposed by President Hoenig Robert Rashe, proposed by President Poole Mark Sniderman, proposed by President Pianalto CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Are there any objections?
If not, so ordered.
We now need to reaffirm the selection of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I move that we select the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Without objection.
We have a memo from Mr. Kos on the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations.
Do you have any further comments on the memo, Dino?
MR.
KOS.
One amendment to the authorization is proposed, and I think the memo speaks for itself on that.
I’d be happy to answer any questions.
January 27-28, 20044 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
If there are no questions, so be it.
We obviously forgot to grant Dino the authority to act in the capacity in which he just acted.
So I will ask someone to move the reaffirmation of Dino Kos as the Manager of the System Open Market Account.
SPEAKER(?).
So moved.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Is there any objection?
If not, so ordered.
Now we’ll go through a regular review of the Foreign Currency Authorization, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.
Again, I call on Mr. Kos.
MR.
KOS.
I recommend that the Committee reaffirm those three documents as they currently stand.
Again, I’d be happy to answer any questions.
MR.
POOLE.
Mr. Chairman, I have a question and a comment.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Certainly.
MR.
POOLE.
I didn’t see a reference in the memo to a warehousing limit, but maybe I missed it.
Is there a dollar limit on warehousing that this Committee votes on?
MR.
KOS.
There is a $5 billion warehousing limit, which is a part of the package of authorizations and instructions under which we operate.
That limit was mentioned in the memo.
MR.
POOLE.
That’s in there.
So there’s a $5 billion limit?
MR.
KOS.
That’s right.
The Committee voted to revert to a limit of $5 billion in 1997 after it had been raised from $5 billion to $20 billion in 1995 to facilitate U.S.
participation in the program to aid Mexico.
MR.
POOLE.
If I may, Mr. Chairman, talk just a little about that?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Certainly.
January 27-28, 20045 of 238MR. POOLE.
I spent a lot of time digging into the history of this, reading the memorandums of discussion from the early 1960s and the transcript
—I think from 1990
—when warehousing was discussed at length by the Committee.
I want to discuss the wisdom of our having that warehousing authority.
If we look at the domestic portfolio, the Federal Reserve Act prohibits the Federal Reserve from buying obligations directly from the Treasury, though there is a $3 billion emergency line, if you will, that the Treasury can call on to sell obligations directly to us.
And I think that that’s a sound provision.
We do not have an obligation to buy
—and in fact, we cannot under the Federal Reserve Act
—unlimited amounts from the Treasury.
The problem on the warehousing side
—given the history on this and given that the Treasury clearly has the lead responsibility on international issues
—is that, when the Treasury comes to us and says it wants another $5 billion, we can find ourselves in a box under present circumstances.
I think it puts us in a very awkward position.
<START>In my view there’s something to be said for making the warehousing limit $3 billion, which would correspond to the $3 billion emergency amount available on the domestic side.<END>
I think that would send the right message
—that the Treasury does not have an unlimited line on the Federal Reserve.
My goal would be to try to prevent our being in the situation where, because the Treasury takes the lead on the international side, somehow the view is that we’re supposed to ante up whenever the Treasury asks us to.
That’s the awkwardness that I see in this situation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
<START>Yes, there are a number of awkward relationships that we have in our role as fiscal agent, none of which to my knowledge has ever triggered any event that would be of concern to us.<END>
I would assume that we could batten down a lot of different holes here and there.
I’m not certain that that would serve a useful purpose.
But that’s a judgment of January 27-28, 20046 of 238the Committee, and I open up the floor for any comments anyone would like to make at this particular stage.
Remember we had a very extensive discussion of the warehousing issue, as you point out, in 1990.
MR.
POOLE.
Right.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Which was only fourteen years ago!
[Laughter] MR. POOLE.
I’m not proposing that we redo that by the way!
That was a very long discussion, and it took a good deal of time just to read it.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
What I would suggest you do, if you would like, is to write a memorandum on this, adverting to the comments and conclusions of the 1990 discussion, and we will circulate it.
If there is significant interest in doing something of the nature that you are proposing, I would suggest that those who agree with that view make that known to Vincent Reinhart.
He can then create whatever vehicle would be required to put that issue before the Committee for consideration.
Is that satisfactory?
MR.
POOLE.
That’s fine.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The next item on the agenda is
— MR. BERNARD.
The Committee needs to take a vote on this item.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I’m sorry, I beg your pardon.
Do you object to a vote being taken at this point?
MR.
POOLE.
No, not at all.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Without objection.
I assume that the vote is in the affirmative on the recommendations in this memorandum.
We also have a memorandum from Vincent Reinhart on the Program for Security of FOMC Information.
Do you want to go beyond what you said in the memo?
January 27-28, 20047 of 238MR. REINHART.
I have nothing to add.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Next is item 6 on the agenda.
Dino Kos has provided an evaluation of the use of GNMAs in outright transactions for the System Open Market Account (SOMA).
Do you have comments on that?
MR.
KOS.1 I was just going to summarize briefly some of the points that were made in the memo and discuss the one-page set of graphs that I circulated today.
The Committee will remember that this topic goes back to the time when we were worried about the stock of Treasuries shrinking rather than expanding and we were looking at alternative assets for the SOMA.
The Committee in November 2002 directed the staff to continue to look at GNMAs as a possibility and to come back with a proposal about how we might use them in transactions for the SOMA if the Committee decided to do so.
The memo describes how we might do that.
We would propose to have the Desk do the front office tasks in house but to outsource the back office work
—the clearing, settlement, custody, and associated tasks as well as the prepayment estimations.
I think we learned some interesting information in the course of this exercise.
Clearly, this is an important market, and it has become more important.
The top chart in the page that I circulated today shows the growth of the mortgage-backed market in totality and the fact that it has outstripped the Treasury market over the last few years.
However, the GNMA market itself actually has been shrinking both on an absolute basis, as can be seen in the middle panel, and on a relative basis compared with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as depicted in the bottom panel.
<START>Despite the growth in the mortgage-backed market, Ginnie Mae has had trouble competing, given that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have specifically lowered their standards in an attempt to build up their assets of lower-income housing, which they’ve been very successful in doing.<END>
But that has had a cost in terms of Ginnie Mae’s success in competing, and that’s something the Committee may want to think about.
The point that I made in my cover memo was that, on the one hand, the Committee may want to approve going ahead with this if it sees the benefits of transacting in this market to be of sufficient value.
Indeed, there may be some value in the central bank’s being in this market.
On the other hand, it would take about three years to implement this program, and there is some expense involved.
Moreover, the fiscal situation has changed quite a bit since the Committee last talked about this.
At that time the forecast for fiscal year 2004 was a surplus of about $150 billion.
Yesterday the CBO came out with an estimated deficit of $477 billion for this fiscal year.
<START>So, to the extent that this was seen as a hedge against the possibility that the Treasury market might begin to shrink, that reason has gone away.<END>
Again, there is the issue of the shrinkage of the Ginnie Mae market itself.
<START>Even in the most favorable scenarios, it’s hard to see how GNMAs would make up more than 2 to 1 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).<END>
January 27-28, 20048 of 2383 percent of the System Open Market Account.
I’d be happy to answer any easy questions.
Bob Elsasser is here to answer any difficult questions.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
It certainly strikes me that the reason we moved in this direction was for contingency purposes
—and necessarily so
—but it turns out in retrospect to have been unnecessary in that respect.
<START>I think we should not move forward and expend additional effort or funds on this.<END>
I would put aside the work that has been done, and in the extraordinarily unlikely event that concern about the availability of Treasury securities reemerges, there’s more than enough time to readdress the issue.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
By that time, the Ginnie Mae market may have disappeared totally.
[Laughter] MS. MINEHAN.
That’s what I was going to say!
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Poole.
MR.
POOLE.
Dino, I thought this memo was superb, and I learned a lot from it.
But I want to mention two arguments not discussed in the memo for why being in the GNMA market might be attractive to us.
I realize that we certainly don’t need GNMAs for the original reason that we embarked on the study.
First of all, developing and maintaining in-house expertise in this market may be helpful in carrying out other parts of our responsibilities, particularly in the bank supervision area because banks hold a lot of this paper.
It’s obviously a very huge market and a complicated one, so I think there is a case on that ground for having expertise in that market.
The other thing that strikes me is that we may end up in a somewhat adversarial relationship with the GSEs in regard to the housing issue.
So from that perspective, there may be something to be said for being involved in supporting housing through a Ginnie Mae portfolio.
MR.
KOS.
On the first point, our focus in the memo was on what it would take to get the program going.
Clearly, there are some broader policy questions that we didn’t think were for January 27-28, 20049 of 238the staff to be opining on.
But if the Committee feels that it’s important to be in this market for whatever reason, the Committee can direct us to do so.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
That issue is independent of this memorandum and indeed just came up.
But it’s an interesting issue to keep in the back of our minds depending on how the discussion relating to GSEs evolves.
It could move in the direction where it might be a reasonably sensible U.S.
government policy to enhance GNMA as an operating agency, in which case we may or may not decide at that point to do anything about it.
MR.
KOHN.
I have a comment on President Poole’s comment.
I saw an advantage in going this route in terms of our being consistent across securities;
we would buy everything that was backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government.
But I also saw it as adding in some sense to the adversarial relationship with the GSEs because it accentuates that difference among them.
And we’re addressing that in other ways.
Given that doing this is a lot of trouble and we don’t need to do it because of the volume of Treasuries, I wonder if it’s more trouble than it’s worth.
<START>So even though adding Ginnie Maes to the SOMA would leave us in a little purer position on the full faith and credit principle, I think I would follow the Chairman’s advice and drop it for now.<END>
Dino, the market knows we’re looking at this.
Do they expect anything?
Will they be surprised?
MR.
KOS.
No, I don’t think they will be surprised.
I think this veered off their radar screen maybe twelve to eighteen months ago.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
I think the costs of this are high and the benefits are very, very slight.
We have been taught to make decisions using these comparisons.
I would say, along with the Chairman and my colleague on the right, let’s put it on the shelf for now CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Minehan.
January 27-28, 200410 of 238MS. MINEHAN.
I’d like to speak to President Poole’s first point because I do agree that these are very important markets and that understanding how they operate is important.
We only have to look at what was going on last spring to realize the importance of understanding how the mortgage-backed securities market works.
But I think that’s different from actually operating in those securities.
<START>Yes, we would learn a little from some hands-on experience, but we would have to outsource a good deal of the work, buy forecasts, and do a lot of things that we really don’t need to do to understand the market.<END>
I’m sure there are people at the New York Federal Reserve Bank who do understand this market.
The fact that we had these memos is proof of it.
So I would think that we could keep up with this and be on top of the situation without being in that market.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Hoenig.
MR.
HOENIG.
I agree with those who have suggested that we put this on the shelf for now.
<START>The original purpose is being dealt with in other ways, and the cost seems to be sizable for this particular very narrow dimension.<END>
If we need to, we can bring it up at another time.
I think it’s better shelved for now.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Does anybody object to that as a conclusion of the Committee?
If not, we’ll assume that is the decision.
Now we go into our regular meeting agenda.
Would somebody like to move approval of the minutes for our December 9 meeting?
SPEAKER (?).
So moved.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Hearing no objection, they are approved.
Now we turn to the Working Group on Communications.
Governor Ferguson and Vincent Reinhart.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you.
I’ll be very brief.
Vincent is going to do most of the heavy lifting in terms of describing a number of different options and conclusions
—both on January 27-28, 200411 of 238issues that the working group looked at and on a number of issues that I asked the staff to address in the memos they prepared.
In my introductory remarks I’d only point out that as we go into this it would be nice, of course, if we were to find a consensus.
But frankly, if at the end of our discussion today there is no obvious consensus, then by definition the Committee can decide to come back and think about this topic further.
Or as someone said to me before the meeting started, the subject of communications is probably going to be on our agenda in some way, formally or informally, for a long time to come.
If we can resolve some of the issues today, that would be great.
But if we can’t, then we’ll move on.
I will try to be sensitive to the fact that we also want to move on to other elements of the agenda.
So at some point I’m going to suggest a go-around
—I don’t know how long it’s going to take
—but ask that we leave time for Dino’s presentation on the Desk’s activity that goes with the discussion for tomorrow.
Vincent, why don’t you pick up from here with this document that was distributed?
MR.
REINHART.2 Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
I’ll be referring to the material called “The Committee’s Communication Strategy” that was handed out to you before the start of the meeting.
Next week marks the tenth anniversary of the Committee’s first public explication of a change in its intended federal funds rate not associated with a change in the discount rate.
But increased openness has not been a U.S.
phenomenon alone.
<START>Across the industrial world and in many emerging-market economies, monetary policy makers now provide real-time information on their forecasts, the risks to those forecasts, and their goals and objectives, often accompanied by narratives explaining their strategies.<END>
These come in the form of statements, policy (often called inflation) reports, and regular press conferences.
The Committee has been riding that wave of increasing communications.
In some ways, it has been ahead of other central banks.
For example, no other policymaking body immediately releases the vote tally at its meetings.
However, in other ways, the Committee has not been at the leading edge.
On page 2 of your handout, I provide a reason why you may have felt it important to be measured in changing your information policy:
Your words matter.
The bars plot the market response
—as measured by the change in the two-year Treasury yield in narrow windows surrounding the events
—around the release of the Committee’s statement (the top 2 The materials used by Mr. Reinhart are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).
January 27-28, 200412 of 238left panel), its minutes (the bottom left panel), and the Chairman’s semiannual testimony (the top right panel) since 1997.
(The reason I describe the top left panel as exclusively the response to the statement is that I have used federal funds futures rates to strip out the portion of any market surprise about the level of the funds rate.) The responses both to statements and to testimonies have been sizable.
Except for the most recent release, though, minutes have tended to be much less of a market event
—presumably because of their publication lag.
As shown in the table at the bottom right, your statements and the Chairman’s testimonies have had effects on market prices that, on average, have been as large as those associated with releases on the employment situation and larger than those associated with the publication of data on the ISM index or consumer prices.
Another point to make about your ten-year experience with statements:
At least as can be judged from the transcript of your meeting on February 4, 1994, Committee members may not have fully appreciated that they were setting a precedent with a public announcement.
<START>In the event, the response to that short paragraph was so positive, you could not go back to signaling policy changes through open market operations.<END>
That might be a lesson to remember as I outline various potential changes to your communications strategy in the rest of my briefing.
Page 3 gives a roadmap of the rest of my remarks.
The options confronting the Committee are interrelated.
To facilitate your discussion, my briefing will have five parts.
I intend to lay out the range of plausible options before the Committee at the outset and then speak about them in more detail.
Those include alternative formulas for the risk assessment of your statement
—that is, I will report on the progress of the working group chaired by Governor Ferguson.
Then I will discuss the pros and cons of expedited release of the minutes, which were given more completely in the memo by Brian Madigan that I circulated, and of an enhanced role for the FOMC projections, which were examined in a memo by Benson Durham.
I will end about where I start by repeating the “Chinese menu” of possibilities so that you can begin the hard work of determining how the pieces might fit together.
Your first look at that Chinese menu is provided on page 4, which gives a broad overview of options across three main communication issues on today’s agenda.
<START>The left column lists the possibilities for the paragraph in the Committee’s statement that gives an assessment of risks to the outlook expressing a probabilistic assessment of the uncertainty surrounding the dual goals of inflation and output.<END>
To some, this serves to hint at the direction of future policy without offering a commitment.
This being a central bank, it is always an option to maintain the status quo in which the drafters start from a formulaic assessment of the risks to inflation and output but have some discretion in the exact wording
—with the expectation that the result will preserve the three-part assessment of risks used since May.
This approach allows some consultation with Committee members through the Bluebook.
The option dubbed “gradual evolution” involves expanding both aspects of the process by allowing more discretion to the drafters to alter the words according to January 27-28, 200413 of 238evolving economic conditions and to provide more discussion of the words of the statement in the Bluebook.
<START>However, there would be an explicit expectation of including a forward-looking aspect to the statement and an assessment of risks, except on those rare occasions, as last March, when no such assessment could reasonably be made.<END>
If you would like, we could structure the forward-looking portion of the Bluebook around two or three draft announcements keyed to conveying to the public possible changes in either the outlook or policy.
Those alternatives would provide the basis for your policy discussion and vote, and one of them
—with whatever last-minute changes you wanted
—would be released to the public.
If events between the publication date of the Bluebook and the Committee meeting changed the situation sufficiently, we would circulate a Bluebook supplement that suggested more appropriate wording.
Another set of possibilities is to adopt new formulaic language, as you had with the “balance of risks” from 2000 to early last year.
In just a bit I will report on the three formulas that the working group forwarded to the full Committee.
<START>Lastly, you could choose to discontinue the assessment of risks portion of the statement, accepting that substantial criticism would ensue for backsliding away from openness.<END>
In principle, that need not be backsliding if the Committee decided to alter some of the other margins of its communication policy.
<START>Of course, such other changes also may be viewed as desirable in conjunction with retention of the risk assessment.<END>
One possibility would be to expedite the release of the minutes, the subject of the middle column.
About two weeks is the barest minimum required for the Secretariat to draft, circulate for comments, and release finished minutes, but you may see some benefit in providing a bit wider cushion by releasing minutes, say, three or four weeks after each meeting.
Another possibility is to enhance the role of the economic projections of the Governors and Bank Presidents as outlined in the right column.
You might want to increase the frequency with which the survey is conducted, lengthen the projection period, or increase the number of variables projected.
You might want to continue to release those projections in the Monetary Policy Report, but they could also be part of expedited minutes or the subject of a separate release.
As you could probably tell from the thirty-page memo that circulated last week, the working group and its staff devoted considerable attention to alternative formulaic language.
Page 5 reviews some of the key lessons learned.
In particular, members settled on six important design principles that any formula should satisfy:
<START>(1) Good governance suggests that the Committee should vote on the exact wording of the risk assessment.<END>
(2) The statement should not hamper the policy discussion, nor should the Committee feel constrained in its choice of action by a formula.
(3) The statement should be flexible enough to encompass the Committee members’ views about the operation of the economy and the concepts that can be usefully measured.
(4) The statement should be clear to the public, or at least as much as it is possible for central bankers to endeavor to be.
(5) The statement should cover the range of feasible contingencies so that the formula would last, if not for the ages, at least a few years.
(6) The statement should avoid the use of potentially charged January 27-28, 200414 of 238terms, such as “risk,” when referring to outcomes that may be seen as positive.
For example, the statement should not convey the mis-impression that the Committee is against strong economic growth for its own sake.
While the working group settled on these six principles fairly quickly, three questions remained unresolved, which are provided in the column at the right.
In particular:
• Should the wording of the risk assessment be in terms of the levels of output and inflation or their changes?
<START>Conveying a sense of levels may make it easier to describe economic performance relative to the benchmarks of potential output and the Committee’s inflation goal.<END>
<START>However, such specificity may be seen as a drawback because there is a range of opinion among members about appropriate benchmarks.<END>
• What conditioning assumption for monetary policy should be employed?
<START>The forecast could be based on the assumption of unchanged interest rates, as was the case with the old balance of risks language, but that presents problems for projections far into the future should that assumption diverge significantly from what is built into financial market prices.<END>
The alternative would be to assume a historically normal policy path;
<START>but if the Committee does not reveal that assumption, the public may have difficulty understanding the message of the risk assessment.<END>
• Over what period should the outlook and risks be considered?
A shorter period
—that is, the next several quarters
—has the advantage of limiting the factors that influence the outlook.
However, such a horizon may not be sufficient if you think the lags in the transmission of policy are substantial, suggesting that you should look forward to the foreseeable future.
<START>Confronted with different potential reasonable answers to these questions, the working group narrowed the field of potential formulas to three:<END>
two stated in terms of levels but differing as to the policy assumption and period, and a third stated in terms of changes.
I should note that the three alternatives do not explicitly mention the conditioning policy assumption.
In principle, that design feature could be conveyed to the public when the new policy is announced and mentioned periodically in the minutes as a reminder.
The “levels A” alternative is provided on page 6, with the left column repeating what was in the memo you received on January 20.
As noted in red in the text and highlighted at the right, this alternative is stated in terms of levels of inflation and economic activity and makes explicit reference to benchmarks for inflation and output.
While the paragraph is silent about the conditioning assumption for policy, it is based on an assumption of “normal” policy.
In addition, as shown in blue, the horizon is “several quarters,” but outcomes are described relative to paths that extend further into the future.
<START>The “levels B” alternative provided on page 7 shares a focus on levels and explicit benchmarks (as noted in red at the right) but differs in two important dimensions.<END>
First, while it is January 27-28, 200415 of 238also silent about the policy assumption, the drafters assumed that the implicit forecast is based on an unchanged policy stance.
Second, as shown in blue, the horizon is “the foreseeable future,” that elastic concept borrowed from the old balance of risks language.
<START>The “changes” alternative given in the left column of page 8 focuses, as indicated in red at the right, on changes in output relative to potential and changes in inflation.<END>
Presumably, if the Committee saw fit, the prior paragraph of the statement that describes economic conditions could refer to levels and benchmarks.
As in the “levels B” alternative, this formula is based on the undisclosed assumption of unchanged policy and applies to the foreseeable future.
Staff subjected these three alternatives to a variety of stress tests to gauge their performance both in scenarios that seem likely in the near future and that have challenged the Committee in the past.
I am not revealing any secrets of the working group by indicating on page 9 that problems emerged with all three formulas.
<START>In particular, measurement issues arise when words with vague or multiple meanings are used, such as the “long-run trend of potential” or “long-run sustainable pace” or even an unquantified notion of “price stability.” In addition, you may feel uncomfortable about the clarity of any statement that relies on words such as “path consistent with,” which may admit many possible trajectories, or “the foreseeable future,” which, for some, appears to have meant a period as short as the intermeeting period and to others a period measured in years.<END>
Lastly, the conditioning assumption used in the implicit forecast introduces a fundamental question as to the purpose of the risk assessment.
Do you want to send hints about the future direction of rates (which seems easier to do with the assumption of unchanged policy), or are you conveying qualitative information about the fan chart surrounding your forecast (as seems the case with the assumption of “normal policy” or the related assumption of “appropriate policy”)?
The working group decided that its mandate was to present information to allow the Committee to determine an acceptable tradeoff among the various pitfalls, recognizing that abandoning an attempt to arrive at a formula is also an option.
No doubt, this decision also interacts with any you might make about expediting the release of the minutes, the subject of page 10.
<START>Central banks that do release minutes before their next scheduled meeting, such as the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England, stress advantages such as a desire to provide more timely information to the public consistent with their responsibility to be transparent and accountable.<END>
In addition, minutes provide a platform to present the outlook and policy strategy in a more nuanced fashion than is possible in an immediately released statement.
And relevant to my earlier discussion, expedited minutes may make you more comfortable in trimming the statement.
The disadvantages mostly seem related to possible effects on Committee dynamics and other aspects of your communication policies over time.
You might be concerned that, as the minutes increase in market importance because they are released in real time, mention in the minutes would be viewed as a chip in the bargaining process in arriving at a policy decision.
The quality of the minutes might January 27-28, 200416 of 238suffer over time if they were “scrubbed” to mitigate potential market reaction.
In particular, you might be hesitant about including conditional statements in the minutes, such as a desire to change policy at the next meeting if intervening data run in a certain direction or to hold an intermeeting conference call.
The bottom line is that experience has shown that market participants tend to overreact to contingent statements, and fear of possible inappropriate market response might be viewed as a decided negative.
In addition, the Committee, and future Committees, would have to exercise some self-discipline so as not to succumb to the temptation of using the minutes to send signals in response to developments after the meeting.
Some thought would have to be given also as to the timing of the release of the minutes, particularly on those occasions twice a year when the Chairman delivers the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.
<START>Indeed, as a general principle, the prospect of creating an additional news event in which market participants and reporters await some fixed release from the FOMC may seem especially daunting.<END>
And in that regard, the Committee may want to review its policy regarding blackout periods so that the release of the minutes marks the first news about the thinking of policymakers at the previous meeting.
Twice a year, the minutes include the central tendencies and the ranges of the Governors’ and Bank Presidents’ forecasts of key macroeconomic variables.
Early release of the minutes naturally raises the question of the role of those projections, as is discussed on page 11.
There are several margins over which the Committee could enhance the role of those forecasts.
In particular, you might want to (1) increase the frequency of the survey to every meeting or every quarter;
(2) increase the length of the projection period, thereby giving the public some sense of the Committee’s views of the longer-term prospects for the economy;
(3) increase the number of variables in the projections, perhaps to include core PCE inflation, which seems central to the deliberations of the Committee.
<START>Indeed, you might view the projections as a means of conveying to the public your view of the longer-term elements essential for policy, such as the growth rate of potential output and your individual working definitions of price stability, and perhaps the degree of uncertainty about that outlook, by including the width of uncertainty bands about each variable forecasted.<END>
<START>The latter might be particularly attractive, as wide bands would reinforce that monetary policy is as much about controlling potential risks when a forecast, almost inevitably, come true as it is about making projections.<END>
does not At a practical level, the Committee will have to decide also whether it is appropriate to separate its projections from the Monetary Policy Report and testimony.
The pros of an enhanced role of the projections given at the top right should seem familiar.
By getting them out earlier, you would be providing more-timely information to the public, both about your central tendencies and range of opinion, thereby increasing transparency and accountability.
<START>Some might find a particular attraction in substituting a survey of numbers that is mechanical for the risk-assessment portion of the statement, which requires consensus.<END>
The cons relate January 27-28, 200417 of 238mostly to the Committee’s process and market participants’ interpretations.
You will have several decisions as to whether the forecasts should be included in the minutes of the meetings, can be revised after meetings, or their release augmented with explanatory text.
The public might not understand the conditional nature of the projections and ascribe to them more weight than they actually receive in the policy process, thereby creating another news event in intermeeting periods and impairing your reputation as forecast errors cumulate.
With the last page in your package, I deliver on my promise to end where I started.
Page 12 repeats the Chinese menu and underscores that I am seeking direction from the Committee on all aspects of its communications policy.
Many of the options that are listed will require much more staff work to arrive at a solution acceptable to the Committee.
That is, the discussion to follow will not be the end of work on communications policy, but I am hopeful that it is the end of the beginning of work on communications policy.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you, Vincent.
We know it’s not the beginning of the end.
Having done this a few times, I know that there will be deep emotion, short speeches, and long speeches, which is all fine.
That’s what democracy is all about.
To help us try to figure out if we have a consensus, though, Vincent has given us what he describes as a Chinese menu here.
It would be very helpful if in your comments you could at least touch on each one of these three topics
—as I’m sure most of you will
—so we can keep a record as we’re going through this.
With that plea, why don’t we open it up for discussion and see who wants to start.
Chairman Greenspan, do you wish to start this round?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, that’s what this signal means.
[Secretary’s note:
The Chairman had raised his hand.] MR. PARRY.
That might end it!
MR.
FERGUSON.
Yes, so much for democracy!
Chairman Greenspan is recognized, and then my list says there are others who wish to follow.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
There are a number of very interesting ideas in here that have the characteristic that they are irreversible upon implementation.
Hence there is a certain January 27-28, 200418 of 238barrier above which I think a proposal has to rise before we move forward on it.
I was a little distressed that my alternative to a number of these issues, which I hadn’t thought of before, get considered!
didn’t I’ve given considerable thought to various formulaic procedures that we could use in trying to craft our post-meeting statement.
MR.
FERGUSON.
It’s in there somewhere!
[Laughter] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
While I was one who thought in the beginning that it would be possible to use a formulaic approach to that endeavor, I’ve concluded at the end of the day that there’s something fundamentally wrong with such a process.
That is, the statement either has to have too little specificity
—which means it doesn’t give us the flexibility to pick up nuances reflected in our discussion
—or it becomes extremely complicated because we are forced to put into a small number of alternative phrases very complex judgments about what the Committee is doing.
As we’ve gradually been going through this process, we have come out with a number of ad hoc statements, which I frankly think have not been bad.
The reason they were not bad is that they were tailored to some very specific and complex discussions that had taken place at our meetings.
<START>And I think we readily communicated our judgment about the alternatives we had, our true assessment of the balance of risks, and most importantly the inclination of the Committee.<END>
We used a number of different ways to convey that, and the reason we did was that each meeting was essentially different.
It had a different mold to it.
<START>The main concern in doing this is the basic problem, which I think we have all eschewed, of writing a communiqué authored by nineteen people at the end of the meeting.<END>
<START>That is physically impossible in every respect that one can conceive of.<END>
January 27-28, 200419 of 238Cathy Minehan, as I recall, raised a point at the end of the last meeting about restricting the number of words in our statements.
As I’ve thought about it over the intermeeting period, my impression of what we ought to do
—and I grant you it is not in these materials
—is to continue the type of statements we have now.
We have a statement that gives our view of the outlook and indeed of what has been happening.
I think there has been almost no dissent on the words we’ve used even though they’ve been different from meeting to meeting.
We then give some sense of where we think the risks are, and unless I’m mistaken, in virtually all cases
—even though at times we’ve used more words than we would have liked
—we were able to describe that in a relatively few words.
The important advance of communicating several wording options to the Committee through the Bluebook prior to the meeting
—associating alternative statements with various policy choices
—struck me as a working model.
So I’m of the opinion that we really don’t need a significant alteration in what we’re doing.
I would prefer that we continue to try to do this the way we have been doing it, but with two caveats if you will.
One is that we use the Bluebook to provide alternative wording suggestions, and two is that we adhere to what I would call the Minehan restraint.
My impression is that would work;
I don’t know that for certain.
It has worked to date.
I’m very uncomfortable with the elaborate formulaic announcements largely because I think they will force us into rigid forms of communication.
If we have an economy that is continuously changing, I think it is going to require us to be flexible in our language and in our approach.
We always have the capability of going from what we’re doing now to formulaic language in the future.
<START>We probably have the capacity to reverse a decision to use formulaic language and to go back to something like we’re doing today, though not without some negative cheering from January 27-28, 200420 of 238outside observers of Fed policy.<END>
But we can live with that.
Nonetheless, I don’t think we need to go with formulaic wording.
That’s my view on this particular issue.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I think I would describe that, in terms of the options Vincent has laid out, as gradual evolution.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Right.
MR.
FERGUSON.
It gives us greater flexibility and involves using the Bluebook to provide alternative wording for the statement.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I will grant you that that is probably the right characterization of my view.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Since you have the floor, do you wish to go on to the other two topics on the menu, earlier release of the minutes and the role of the projections?
Or would you like to hear more discussion?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
If I may suggest
—since this is going to be a long discussion and each of these is a relatively separate issue
<START>—I think we’d be better off doing risk assessment first, then release of the minutes, and then the role of projections.<END>
After we’ve done that I’d go on to the fourth item, which would be the coordination of these various aspects of our communication policy, because there is interaction among them.
MR.
FERGUSON.
How they all work together.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay.
<START>This being a committee, people will either accept or reject that approach.<END>
I have President Hoenig next on my list.
MR.
HOENIG.
Given the suggested approach that you’ve just outlined, Mr. Chairman, I’ll confine my comments.
On the risk statement, if that’s what we’re narrowly focusing on, I January 27-28, 200421 of 238don’t have any difference with you.
But I’d start out by saying that I wish we could get rid of the risk assessment in the statement.
I’d like the statement merely to say this is the action we took.
<START>It’s the risk statement that always seems to hang us up and raise other issues.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Is that option listed?
Oh, here it is.
MR.
FERGUSON.
That’s the very last one on the list
—to discontinue the assessment of the risks.
I’m not sure if you’re saying you want to go with that one or with something else.
MR.
HOENIG.
Well, that’s what I would prefer.
But barring that, depending on how this Committee discussion comes out, my second choice would be the gradual evolution option.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay.
Do you want to stop there, or do you want to address the other topics?
MR.
HOENIG.
I’ll stop there.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay, why don’t we keep going in this mode.
We seem to have fallen into focusing mainly on the risk assessment.
President Santomero.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
Following that model, I too found myself in the situation when I had finished reading the document
—while it was well prepared and helped me think about the process
—where I wasn’t particularly happy with the set of options.
I’m trying to decide whether I am in Chairman Greenspan’s camp or President Hoenig’s
—whether my preference is an evolution or an evolution to a shorter statement.
In fact, in the formally prepared comments that I have with me today, I ended with a line similar to President Minehan’s view, saying that in many cases less is more.
I don’t think any of the options that we have before us quite gets us where we want to be.
It’s hard to talk about levels without talking about growth rates.
It’s hard to talk about where we are without making a statement about whether or not it is in fact a desirable place to be.
I found myself looking at and reviewing the options and finding different January 27-28, 200422 of 238subtleties and implications associated with the different statements.
As a result, I felt as if we were actually moving backward rather than forward.
My own sense is that we would be better off saying less.
I’d begin by saying where we are currently, as we do in paragraph 1.
Second, I think we should give some context to the decision, similar to what we do now but perhaps expand it a bit.
<START>As in our last statement, we might also comment on whether or not our current policy is accommodative, and then we could include information on what we think about current and future economic conditions.<END>
<START>Paragraph 3 would relate to what we think the outlook is for GDP growth as well as inflation.<END>
Importantly, in my opinion, we should have an assessment of whether or not the growth rate is problematic, and I’d be more symmetric in terms of the words “problematic” or “worrisome” that appear in our statements every once in a while.
With that I think we could stop.
So in that regard I am closer to President Hoenig’s position, but I think we can get there over time by essentially stopping at that point.
MR.
PARRY.
Tony, that would be a shorter statement?
MR.
SANTOMERO.
It would be indeed.
It’s almost what we’re doing now;
it just doesn’t go on into detail with the formulaic language regarding our assessment of the risks.
I do worry about the formulaic wording.
As I was reading the memo, I asked myself, Does this tell us the same thing using formulaic approach A, B, or C?
And frequently my answer was “no.” Second, I thought it would tend to force our discussions into something that seemed quite constrained.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I must say, Tony, as I listened to what you said, it struck me as not very dissimilar from the gradual evolution approach because you want to talk about the future.
You used some phrases that dealt with whether or not the outlook was problematic, which I think January 27-28, 200423 of 238is what was intended by the gradual evolution option.
But I think I understand where you are.
The next one on my list is President Stern.
MR.
STERN.
I was part of the working group, but I certainly agree that none of the alternatives is perfect.
<START>Confining myself to the risk assessment, if I were going to select formulaic language, I would select the “levels A” alternative<END>
—for very practical reasons.
When I ran through the stress tests, that alternative seemed to me to do the best job of conveying to the public the situation and the prospective stance of policy given what we knew at the time.
<START>Others may disagree, I realize, but that’s where I came out.<END>
However, I would have no trouble
—as you know, Roger
—going with gradual evolution.
Indeed, if you look at the criteria on page 5 in Vincent’s memo, I think that approach may well do a better job on items 2, 3, and 4.
So I have no problem with that approach and would be very comfortable with it.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I have Governor Gramlich next.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
I began the exercise thinking that we could come up with a formulaic statement that would work most of the time.
In working through it
—I was also part of the working group
—I now think we can’t.
<START>I’m pretty much in sympathy with the Chairman in believing that we will face situations where we may think the differences are subtle and not that great but in fact they are.<END>
In going through the stress-test exercise, as was done in the memo, I found that nothing here appealed to me very much.
Not only do these options not appeal to me, I think they are worse than what we’re doing now.
So I would be for gradual evolution.
I actually recommended a sentence limit before.
Maybe Cathy’s word limit is better than a sentence limit.
I don’t know.
But I do think that we ought to keep it short.
I would like to address a different issue.
The one cost that has been mentioned is that associated with writing a new statement each time
—that it is too hard for us in terms of the January 27-28, 200424 of 238process.
You pass out a draft, we’ve got to read it and think about it, and so forth.
I’ve actually thought about that issue, and in my view, it is less of a problem than we may think.
First, in the way these statements have gone, they really haven’t changed all that much from meeting to meeting.
<START>Second, in the last few Bluebooks, Vincent has described how the statement might change, so we have some warning or advance notice.<END>
Consequently, when we see the final statement, I don’t think it’s that much of a shock.
In terms of the process, I believe it’s something we can handle at each meeting.
In sum, I think the formulaic approaches don’t really do it.
Second, I think we have overrated the cost of writing a separate short statement each time to convey exactly what it is we want to convey.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I have President Broaddus next.
MR.
BROADDUS.
Let me approach it this way:
In terms of the chart here, I’m probably going to come out with respect to the risk assessment somewhere in the gradual evolution area.
But to me that’s closely related to the early release of the minutes.
I view that as an integral part of the communications effort
—as sort of a package.
And even though at the end of the day I have difficulty with a formulaic approach, I think we ought to have some discussion of the proposals in the memorandum.
We received this documentation, and it’s very involved.
I’ve tried to think through these options, and I believe that can help to illuminate some of the issues we’re discussing.
So let me make just a couple of comments that I worked up before I came in.
They may be a little off the immediate mark, given the direction of the conversation.
The first thing I would say is that I think the working group made a very constructive and helpful effort in trying to look at this and I learned a lot from it.
It taught me, among other things, that even minimum clarity requires that we be willing to describe our thinking in terms of levels of economic activity and inflation in relation to their potential or desired levels.
Two of January 27-28, 200425 of 238the three proposed approaches do this.
As I worked through the language itself, I didn’t think it was successful in pulling it off.
For what it’s worth, let me suggest why I think that’s true.
I focused mainly on the two alternatives labeled “levels A” and “levels B.” You know, there’s a lot in this memorandum.
<START>I looked primarily at scenario one, which seems to be the closest to where we are and where I think the balance of risks lies going into this meeting.<END>
To my mind, it may be helpful to consider why the suggested language doesn’t quite achieve what we want.
The levels A alternative assumes that the public understands that the funds rate has to rise at some point down the road, which seems to accord with the facts.
But for me the problem with the particular language in that alternative is that it doesn’t give a clear sense of the current magnitude of the output gap.
Nor does it convey our expectation
—and I believe this is the expectation of many of us
—that that gap will close only gradually over a two-year period.
It seems to me, however, that that’s precisely the kind of information the markets and the public need to be able to form their expectations efficiently and effectively.
In some sense the language we’re using now does a better job with the “considerable period” phrase.
Then I looked at the levels B alternative;
that language is at the bottom of page 20 of the memo.
In this case it is based on the assumption of a constant funds rate.
That boils down to a statement that, in the absence of a funds rate increase, the output gap is likely to turn positive at some point down the road.
But again, in my view, the language doesn’t give a clear sense of how quickly all of this might happen or how it might evolve, which I think is what the public needs to know.
Having gone through this thought process, I think if one were to work through the other six scenarios there would be similar problems.
So I conclude that it just may not be feasible to convey in a few short sentences what we need to convey to allow the public to form its policy January 27-28, 200426 of 238expectations efficiently.
We might be able to do it if, in addition to the suggested language, we stated explicitly and separately our current view about the sign and magnitude of both the output and the resource gaps and how quickly we think they will be eliminated.
At some point, if we were following a procedure like that, we could even add, as we have done with the “considerable period” language, some explicit reference to the funds rate target.
Of course, the problem is that, if we have all those sentences, it’s going to be nearly impossible to talk about it and vote on it in this Committee.
So that takes me back to where I was in September, when I felt that it might be a good idea to advance the publication of the minutes
—and I’ll come back to that later.
Before I do, let me make one last point.
Whether or not we decide to alter the statement language, I think we could sharpen our discussion at our meetings in the spirit of your committee’s levels A and B proposals, Roger, by talking more explicitly and quantitatively about the roles that the output and inflation gaps play in our analysis of the economic outlook and in our discussion of short-run policy alternatives.
<START>Whether or not we move up the release of the minutes, I think a discussion of the gaps, along the lines that I just outlined, improve our external communications at least by making the minutes more explicit and clearer.<END>
could To reap the full benefits of this, though, I think we would need to maintain a working estimate of the path of potential GDP, and I would argue that we would need to share that with the public.
<START>If we did that, we would need to drop obviously the other shoe and indicate publicly the quantitative range for inflation that we think is consistent with price stability.<END>
I won’t push that last point any further.
I did that last time, and I don’t want the Chairman to throw me out of the meeting or maybe out of the window!
[Laughter] That’s where I’d come out.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Bernanke.
January 27-28, 200427 of 238MR. BERNANKE.
Thank you.
<START>This exercise shows us that achieving clarity and transparency for a large and diverse committee is quite difficult.<END>
But it’s also very important both in our role as a public institution and for the efficacy of monetary policy.
<START>So I hope, even though it’s a very difficult task, that we don’t let ourselves backslide in this effort.<END>
I want to say that I’m actually sympathetic to the view of gradual evolution in the policy statement.
We saw last week a statement by the Bank of Canada that was quite a model of clarity.
In simple English it explained conditions in the economy, and it explained why policy steps were taken.
In that respect I thought it conveyed everything without the need for formulaic language.
But as we go to a simpler and shorter statement, I would hope that we would increase the information we provide in other dimensions, particularly the minutes and our individual projections
—and we’ll come back to that later.
Let me say a word about the statements.
Very briefly, I agree with President Stern.
My preference among the three statements would be levels A for two reasons.
The first is that I do think it’s important to describe the outlook in terms of levels relative to benchmarks.
The changes statement requires unspecified preliminary language in order to make it clear, which I think is a major drawback to that statement.
My second point has to do with the conditioning policy assumption.
A number of central banks do use the constant interest rate assumption in making their projections.
This assumption has been very strongly criticized by a number of observers, including Glenn Rudebusch and Lars Svenson and by Mike Woodford in his book and other places.
There are two problems with the constant interest rate assumption.
One is theoretical, and the other is practical, and they’re related.
At the theoretical level, the constant interest rate assumption is usually not well defined in the sense that many forward-looking rational expectations models simply do not have January 27-28, 200428 of 238equilibriums or they have multiple equilibriums under that assumption, whereas backward-looking models tend to diverge and have unstable behavior.
In practice, that means showing paths in the projections that look very unrealistic.
<START>As a practical matter, the constant interest rate assumption is really not well specified because it doesn’t specify what financial markets believe, for example.<END>
Do they believe that interest rates are going to be constant, or do they have the current market revealed preferences?
How long will the constant interest rate path be maintained?
What would be the policy after that path has ended?
<START>It’s not really a very useful conditioning assumption, and therefore, I just warn you that there are some serious reservations about that approach.<END>
Thank you.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you very much.
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Thank you, Roger.
For the record anyway, I expressed the view last time that I was in favor of fewer moving parts, although I think that would translate to both fewer words and, I hope, fewer sentences as well.
I think we should focus a little
—and this picks up a bit on what the Chairman was saying
—on the problem that we’re trying to fix here.
Until last spring, I for one thought our communication wasn’t too bad.
We were misinterpreted for a lot of different reasons last spring, some of which related to what was happening in the economy and some of which related to our ongoing discussions about what we would do if deflation were actually staring us in the face.
<START>I think splitting the risk assessment in our statement, while it seemed logical and felt right at the time, probably played into that a little, and we were in some sense forced to add the “considerable period” language in the summer to try to get market expectations back on track.<END>
I’m not particularly comfortable with that language, though some of the rest of you may be.
January 27-28, 200429 of 238I think it’s entirely appropriate to tell the markets what we did
—we owe them that
—and why we it, though the latter involves a degree of forward-looking analysis.
<START>did But I don’t think it’s a good idea to be speculating on what we might do over an uncertain period of time, given a number of specific assumptions.<END>
Any one of the formulaic statements we’re looking at requires a short course in macroeconomics to be understood.
I don’t think we’re speaking to the academics with these statements.
In my view we’re speaking to the markets and the public.
<START>And in that regard I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of either discontinuing the risk assessment or going back to the simpler risk assessment we had before we split it into addressing the two risks separately.<END>
The simpler assessment worked for us for a number of years.
Maybe that’s gradual evolution.
The sense I got of gradual evolution from Vincent’s comments was that we were going to get Bluebooks of forty pages in length, three-quarters of which would be devoted to explicating three different presentations of the three different ways we could change the various aspects of the risk statement.
I’m not in favor of that.
<START>We need to figure out a simple way to convey what we want to say about the future, and I think we ought to have some agreement on that.<END>
But there seem to be very big differences of opinion among us on that, and maybe it’s foolish to try to reach a consensus here.
Do we really feel obligated to tell people what we might do, given an uncertain future?
<START>That’s not necessarily what I would vote for, nor do I think that it would be helpful.<END>
If we’re going to try to hint at our future policy with a risk statement, I’d rather go back to some variation of what we used to do.
That’s all I have to say for now.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Parry.
MR.
PARRY.
Thank you.
<START>I began this process as a member of the working group leaning toward formulaic language, and the alternative that seemed most appealing to me was the January 27-28, 200430 of 238“levels A” one.<END>
<START>But it became clear to me that, even in our group of seven, it would be extremely difficult to get a consensus built around that alternative.<END>
In fact, I wonder whether we can build a consensus of nineteen around any of the three alternatives, which leads me to believe that probably the approach now being referred to as “gradual evolution” might be the correct route to go.
It seems to me that, if we have language in the Bluebook that is specific to the policy alternatives, then the discussion of the words associated with whatever policy we want to follow should be rather simple, requiring relatively few changes.
Of course, Ned, the policy decision would determine the statement we would issue;
it would be based on that vote.
So I come to the conclusion that, given our different views of how the economy works, we probably ought to look more at the gradual evolution alternative.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President McTeer.
MR.
MCTEER.
I came to this meeting somewhat fearful that we would do something fairly dramatic and possibly make a big mistake.
So I was very reassured by the Chairman’s opening remarks, which I would characterize as saying that the status quo is not all that bad.
I think the gradual evolution alternative involves more gradual than evolution, which is an approach I agree with.
I’ve long been in favor of discontinuing the statement of risks, and I still am.
I agree with Cathy that announcing what we did and why we it provides enough context about the future.
did In my view we make a mistake if we go further than that;
it creates one more thing to be wrong about or to appease people about.
So I’m for gradual evolution, but I would hope to fold discontinuing the risk assessment into that process.
Preliminarily, I’m content with the way we’re doing the minutes and the projections now.
But if we have to make some changes in those areas in order to justify eliminating the risk statement, then I would be in favor of that.
MR.
FERGUSON.
We’ll come back to those issues and explore them.
President Guynn.
January 27-28, 200431 of 238MR. GUYNN.
Thank you.
When Roger called me and I asked him if an option was “none of the above,” I shuddered, thinking that I’d be the only one with that preference.
But I gather from the comments thus far that I’m not alone.
So let me just say up front that I certainly share the view that we ought to resist the temptation to tinker at the margin at this point.
I, too, found the working group and staff papers helpful, but for a reason other than the reasons that have already been articulated.
I think those materials exposed some very fundamental issues that we simply haven’t come to grips with.
I would suggest that the more we’ve tried to say and the more we’ve tried to sharpen up the language of our post-meeting statements, the more we have bumped into some very frustrating fundamentals that I don’t think we’ve begun to agree on around this table.
Not only is that going to get in the way with regard to what to say in our post-meeting statements, but I think it’s going to carry over into the discussion of the minutes.
In that regard, I don’t think we’ve really decided what information we ought to provide to the public.
I agree with Presidents Minehan and McTeer that we have not even necessarily agreed that we ought to be in the business of providing short-term
—and I underscore short-term
—guidance to financial markets.
<START>We differ in our views as to whether that has been helpful and appropriate.<END>
<START>In my opinion, it has created a very short-term focus on policy that has not been terribly helpful.<END>
So to my mind there are some very fundamental questions along those lines.
I don’t think we’ve even begun to deal with some of the basic questions about how to communicate our policy objectives and benchmarks.
<START>In fact, we haven’t even agreed on the definition of some of the very fundamental terms that Vincent highlighted, such as “sustainable growth,” “long-term potential,” and “price stability.” Until we’ve defined those kinds of terms among ourselves, it January 27-28, 200432 of 238seems to me that such concepts as “gaps” have no meaning.<END>
They certainly have no independent meaning;
they have meaning only in the context of the Phillips curve framework, a construct on which at least some of us have very different views.
So how do we anchor the forward-looking portion of our post-meeting statements on some kind of agreed-upon targets and objectives?
The notion of our targets and objectives creeps into those statements even by the way we construct them now.
What is the relationship between the post-FOMC statements and the semiannual Monetary Policy Reports to the Congress?
Those are questions we need to talk about, and I think we’ll have some interesting discussions In sum, my view of the work that has been done is that we should use it to highlight some of the very fundamental issues that I think are going to be with us whether we’re talking about the post-meeting statements or the minutes.
Until we can come to grips with those issues, I think we’re going to continue to struggle.
<START>And the more we try to say, the more difficult it will be for us to be comfortable with the post-meeting statements.<END>
I’d like to come back and add some further thoughts when we talk about the minutes and our semiannual forecasts.
Thank you.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay.
President Pianalto.

PIANALTO.
Thank you.
I also found the work of the working group helpful in thinking through some of these issues.
<START>Like others, I began the exercise thinking that formulaic language would help the Committee communicate because it would narrow the range of words we would be using and the markets would become more comfortable with the phrases and then interpret them in the same way over time.<END>
However, as I reviewed the alternatives presented by the working group and also the concerns listed in the document and the pitfalls noted on page 9 of Vincent’s report today
—measurement issues, clarity, and the conditioning assumptions
—my preference became gradual evolution.
I favor telling the markets what we did and why we it.
did January 27-28, 200433 of 238I don’t think it’s appropriate to signal future policy action.
And I strongly support having explicit language alternatives spelled out in the Bluebook.
That said, I have favored for the past several months discontinuing the assessment of risks portion of the statement.
But I didn’t think that was an option.
When we were discussing our communication with the markets, I thought we took off the table the possibility of going backwards, so to speak, and communicating less.
I thought taking something away would not be an option.
So for now my preference is gradual evolution, but depending on how we come out on the earlier release of the minutes or the role of the projections, discontinuing the risk-assessment portion of the statement might be a possibility.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Bies.

Like several others, I found the efforts of the working group very helpful in terms of laying out the issues we’ve been talking about at the last several meetings and putting them all together in one place.
I also thought that, if I went through all the formulas and the various scenarios, one of them would really appeal to me.
<START>I did go through them, and I must say that, while I like the levels B alternative in principle, I didn’t like the answer it came out with in some of the scenarios.<END>
That led me to the view that a formula isn’t going to work for us.
To my mind, what we have to talk about in our statement is what we believe is the most important issue.
In the little over two years that I’ve been on this Committee we’ve faced a lot of volatility in that we’ve had to deal with a number of unforeseen events.
So if nothing else we need flexibility because financial stability is one of our objectives, though we usually don’t talk about that explicitly.
But we are seen as one of the forces that keeps the market stable in part because we have a reputation for integrity, which I think is very important.
January 27-28, 200434 of 238Let me make just a couple of general comments.
<START>One, I like the idea of eliminating words like “risk” that may have different connotations to the public.<END>
I say that as a former risk manager.
I also like the idea of a little ambiguity in some of the alternatives we’ve discussed because around this table we all come at the policy decision from different points of view.
And we know that in economics there are alternative paths to achieving our objectives going forward.
So I’m not troubled by some ambiguity in the statements that we issue.
Also, while the idea of setting benchmarks has been discussed, as we start to move toward defining those benchmarks, I think we’ll find that our different points of view will become more of an issue.
Some of the alternative wording proposed I found very troubling because I don’t know if we can come to a consensus on what the benchmarks are.
As I thought through where we’ve had communication issues
—particularly in the last few months
—one of the things that struck me is that we actually have described very well the data that drove us to the decision we took at each meeting.
<START>As a few people have suggested with regard to fitting in the conclusion of the risk statement, maybe we could do a better job by adding an extra phrase or words about the incoming data.<END>
<START>Maybe we could characterize economic growth in terms of the output gap or better describe the risks of inflation rather than adhere to a fixed formula that is so rigid that it doesn’t allow us the flexibility to respond to unusual developments.<END>
<START>While I don’t want to see a statement that goes on page after page, I’d almost prefer to drop the part of the risk assessment about the output gap and inflation and add a few well chosen words to describe the incoming data that drove us to our action.<END>
<START>I think that actually would make the statement more concise and clear, and perhaps it would deal better with the ambiguity that was pointed out in some of the scenarios under the various alternatives.<END>
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Poole.
January 27-28, 200435 of 238MR. POOLE.
We’re using the word “evolution” here.
If I could use a genetic analogy, I think we want to be careful that we have some highly selected breeding and not random mutation.
[Laughter] To begin my remarks, let me reflect a bit on how we got to where we are
—some of the past evolution.
Originally, of course, there was no statement issued at the end of the meeting, not even a release of the policy decision.
I think it was in the early ’80s that the Committee started to vote on a bias or asymmetry in the directive, but that was not released until a few days after the next meeting.
Then in 1994, almost ten years ago to the day, the Committee agreed to release its policy decision on the day of the meeting.
Initially the practice was to make an announcement when there was a change in the intended federal funds rate and no statement otherwise.
So, clearly, the original idea was to provide an explanation of what we had done and why.
After all, a decision to keep the intended funds rate unchanged is also a policy decision, but we did not have a statement at the end of every meeting.
So the original idea was to explain why we did what we did.
A little after that we made the decision
—and I think this was after I came on board
—to release the bias statement.
Subsequently the bias was viewed as a problem, and we substituted the balance of risk statement for reasons that we discussed at length.
I won’t go into that.
Now we seem to be focusing on the balance of risk statement, and to me we’re not focusing adequately on the explanation of why we acted as we did and what the background was for our decision.
There have been many expressions of unhappiness with a formulaic approach or standard language, so I raise this point.
To me the problem is not so much with standard language but that there is no way to construct standard language or any other kind of language that does a good job on a forward-looking commitment
—or quasi-commitment or whatever it is
—regarding where policy is going to go in the future.
But I do think it is quite possible to come up with some January 27-28, 200436 of 238standard phrases or summary phrases to describe the policy decision that was taken.
Now, that’s not the issue the working group investigated.
What it did investigate and what I think is being revealed in this discussion is that it is very hard to come up with standard language
—and I’ll predict any language
—that we would regard as satisfactory in terms of the forward-looking nature of the policy decisions.
I think we need to provide forward-looking information about where we expect the economy to go and that probably has to be nuanced depending on the facts case by case and meeting by meeting.
But I believe that we ought to be able to come up with some standard language that says, for example, that we decided to raise the federal funds rate for this basic reason or we decided to leave it alone for this basic reason.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Kohn.
MR.
KOHN.
Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
I think there should be forward-looking elements in what we announce to the public when we make our policy decisions.
The reasons for our decisions, as President Poole was suggesting, always have some forward-looking elements in them.
<START>But I think we can be a little more helpful than that in the sense that the Committee has an idea of how the economy and inflation will evolve over time and we could convey that notion.<END>
Not only is that judgment a factor in the current decision, but also it would give people some sense of how policy might evolve in the future.
I’m not in favor of making commitments on the short-term path of the federal funds rate.
I think what we did last August and have done since then with the “considerable period” language was an unusual step taken in unusual circumstances.
I’m not in favor of that as standard practice.
But I do think that we have some ideas and some analysis that it would be beneficial for us to impart to the markets, which would help them act in a more stabilizing way, consistent with accomplishing the goals we want to achieve.
January 27-28, 200437 of 238On the balance of risks language, I agree with President Poole’s history.
We got to the wording we use today in a rather unusual way.
But in some sense that language evolved as a substitute for the forecasts that other central banks provide.
Other monetary authorities are able to issue more straightforward rationales for their actions in the sense that they have very specific forecasts and ways to discuss economic developments relative to those forecasts.
<START>There’s a very clear sense of how they see the balance of risks going forward.<END>
I don’t think that this group of nineteen people will ever have a forecast that it can agree on that will perform that function.
So the balance of risks language has substituted for a forecast in giving us a forward-looking element in our statements.
I agree that none of the formulas for the balance of risks has worked well.
I came in favoring the change alternative.
<START>I thought that was the cleanest way to talk about what might be influencing the direction of rates going forward, but other people clearly don’t agree.<END>
And in my view, both levels formulas have problems.
<START>So, Mr. Chairman, I support your proposal for lack of any better alternative, acknowledging that where we are isn’t so bad as a starting place for a gradual evolution in the language.<END>
I do think it needs to evolve.
The Committee members don’t quite agree on the meaning of some of the language we use now.
So I think we need to have that language evolve, and it needs to happen gradually in accordance with the situation that we’re facing.
I do have some reaction to the general notion of shortening the statement.
I think it should be as concise as possible to get our basic ideas across but not more concise.
I’m a little concerned that arbitrary limits on sentences or words
—even though I realize that people don’t mean that literally
—will not afford us adequate flexibility to convey the important notions that we need to convey.
<START>So yes, it needs to be concise, but in my view it would not be a good idea to drive for it to be so short that it didn’t contain adequate information.<END>
We have some information January 27-28, 200438 of 238to impart to the markets about where we think the economy is going, which will be helpful to them, and I think we should communicate that information in a very general way.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
I, too, was in the working group and, as you can see, there was obviously not a consensus among the group on how to move forward.
I was attracted to the formulaic language, though I recognize that there are some difficulties with it.
It doesn’t apply to every specific circumstance, but it does provide a very good framework for the Committee to express its views, recognizing that we can always amplify those views in earlier paragraphs of the statement.
The formulaic language doesn’t prevent us from doing that, and we would have to do clearly that in some cases.
But obviously there’s no consensus in going forward on a formulaic approach today.
So I won’t push it.
Just to be on the record, I favor the levels B alternative.
I found some problems with the levels A alternative.
The phrase “the path to” I found very confusing.
There are many different paths that would enable us to reach our ultimate objectives for output and inflation, and I think that phrase would be very hard to explain to the public.
So I have serious questions about whether levels A would be helpful to us, and I thought levels B was easier to understand.
In terms of the gradual evolution approach, which we seem to be evolving to gradually [laughter]
—or maybe rapidly
—I would just say this:
I think putting the statement in the Bluebook is a very constructive step.
I believe it is very important for everyone on the Committee to see the draft wording ahead of time.
If there are last minute changes to the draft statement, which I think was a possibility mentioned by Vincent, those addenda should be sent out as rapidly as possible to the members of the Committee.
<START>I do think this process will require more of our time as a Committee, which I’m sure is fine with all of us, and I think we should January 27-28, 200439 of 238recognize that prospect, in terms of the discussion of the specifics of the statement at our meetings.<END>
In terms of the nature of the forward look at policy, I agree with what Don Kohn said, but I’d add another point.
<START>I think there’s a practical issue here in that it’s very difficult for us as a Committee to back away from providing that forward-looking insight into policy.<END>
I think it would be viewed by the markets and by the public as a big step backwards no matter what we do with the minutes or even with our individual forecasts.
When we get to the discussion of the minutes and the other communication issues, I think we can formulate a package.
So I’ll hold off on the rest of my comments until then.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Vice Chairman Geithner.
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.
Let me just make a complicating observation, which is that I’m not quite sure what we think we mean when we say we’re in favor of “gradual evolution.” Many of you who have spoken today of gradual evolution have somewhat different views about the future statement in terms of what the third paragraph should be.
So I was just going to ask this complicating question of you, Governor Ferguson:
What does greater flexibility in assessing the risks mean in terms of which direction you want to see flexibility?
MR.
FERGUSON.
I’m glad you asked because I was going to try to summarize the discussion and be more explicit about where I think we are.
I’ve listened and written down some notes.
Clearly a number of you
—though not a majority
—would like us to discontinue anything that looks like a risk assessment.
I’m interpreting that even more broadly, which is that this group doesn’t want to give what might be perceived as hints about future policy.
That said, as I listened, most people seemed to evolve to the following view:
Pre-set formulaic language at some point will fall apart.
The formulaic language we used previously lasted for a few years.
January 27-28, 200440 of 238This language may last, but it will never cover a very subtle and complex situation.
However, I sense that most people also agree with Governor Kohn, President Moskow, and a few others that either for practical reasons or for theoretical reasons we do need to provide something that is a bit forward-looking.
In part that’s because it may help explain our policy and in part because it may help us communicate to the markets
—not in the sense of giving hints about policy but of fostering an appropriate mindset in the markets with respect to the incoming data and what we are worried about.
That has been described as a balance of risks assessment, but it doesn’t have to be.
So what I think we’re agreeing to here is a commitment among ourselves, and frankly with the market, that we will continue to provide some forward-looking language that may have the flavor of indicating that the Committee tends to be more worried about X than about Y. And how we say that has to be tailored a bit each time to the particular circumstances.
If we are far away from what the Committee generally thinks of as an acceptable level
—it could be a growth rate, but let’s say level
—then presumably we’re concerned about that gap, whatever it is.
On the other hand, if we are close to whatever we view as the right level, then presumably we are worried about the point at which things may change and veer away
—and we would be likely to move.
So I think what we have agreed to here in this gradual evolution approach is that each statement will have something that is forward-looking but it has to be tailored to the particular circumstances that are prevailing at that point.
The language may or may not include a summation
—what used to be the old balance of risks
—indicating that we are more worried about X than Y or that we are equally worried about both.
<START>There may be times when we clearly are more worried about inflation going lower or rising higher than we’d like.<END>
But we don’t January 27-28, 200441 of 238necessarily have to commit to exactly when we are going to tie together our assessment of the risks.
The other thing that I detected was a strong sense that, because we’re giving the staff greater room to maneuver in drafting the language
—not reducing it to a formula or to choosing from column A or B
—it’s important for various alternatives to be shown in the Bluebook.
We’re not talking about forty pages, but there should be explicit examples of how the forward-looking part might emphasize one current or potential development more than another.
I think those are the things that we agreed to.
<START>Another point, which I believe Vincent mentioned, is that being flexible by definition means that we also have the option not to include a forward-looking element in the statement if we simply can’t come to a common point of view.<END>
I think what I have outlined here reflects the general consensus, though there are some outlying points of view for sure.
I believe that’s what we’re agreeing to, and that strikes me as not a very bad outcome.
That’s my own summation.
Is that helpful?
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.
Yes.
I’m happy to associate myself with that consensus.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay, that is the broad consensus.
Let me say one other thing.
<START>Though the Chairman introduced the subject and got us somewhat focused on gradual evolution, from some previous discussions I think that is also a reflection of the broad middle view among the Committee members after having looked at the pros and cons of the formulaic language.<END>
<START>I’m not at all surprised that we came to the sense that we want to be forward-looking but not tie ourselves to a formula.<END>
Now I’d like to introduce the second topic, which is the release of the minutes.
What I propose to do is to call on you in exactly the same order as before in lieu of asking people to January 27-28, 200442 of 238raise their hands again.
This topic was covered in one of the memos that were distributed, and I think that memo lays out very clearly the pros and cons.
This strikes me as an area in which we are once again balancing a lot of considerations.
My view on this is that, if we decide to release the minutes earlier, that is a decision we cannot adjust
—unlike the risk-assessment issue that we just discussed, where I believe we can choose to include a risk assessment or not.
If we move up the publication of the minutes, we are stuck with that decision
—not just for this Committee but for a very long time.
Therefore, as the Chairman indicated in his opening remarks, on this one we have to be very, very careful.
If we were to decide to release the minutes early, in all honesty I think it would be roundly applauded by many people
—academics, perhaps other central banks, and even the markets.
I had a discussion on another issue with the board of directors of the Bond Market Association, and a number of them independently came up to me afterwards and said, “Release those minutes earlier.” Having said that, I have come to the conclusion that, on balance, doing so may not be well regarded in the long run.
The reason is that I firmly believe that there would be an obvious interaction between that decision on the minutes and the discussion at our meetings.
One of two things would likely happen over time.
One, the discussion itself would become less thorough and rich.
The members would express fewer opinions about what might happen should some development emerge.
<START>I suspect the conditional statements we often make would not be expressed so fully, and I think that would limit our ability to share our views and understand each other.<END>
<START>Or two, which is equally bad, the minutes would become a less accurate reflection of the discussion that took place at the meeting.<END>
That is, we might have these forward-looking conditional discussions, but they wouldn’t be captured in the minutes out of anxiety that the markets would react negatively.
Vincent’s chart points out that, in fact, our minutes have served January 27-28, 200443 of 238us quite well because they are very full and complete but they really haven’t moved the market, with one noticeable exception.
<START>I’m afraid that if we accelerate their release so that they are closer to real time we would find ourselves intervening with the market more often.<END>
That leads to my second concern, which is the announcement effect of the minutes.
I believe it is far better for this Committee to speak once contemporaneously with the decision and then let the markets look at the incoming data and react as opposed to coming back two or three weeks later with another round of Fed interaction with the market.
I think that doing so, if anything, will limit our ability to read the market fully.
The reason I chose to speak first on this topic is that I believe that it’s extremely important to think of this in a risk-assessment context.
While many people would argue that the benefits outweigh the risks, I am firmly of the view that that is not necessarily the case.
So before we move headlong down this path, we need to think about it very, very carefully.
Having had my intervention first, let me go next to President Hoenig.
MR.
HOENIG.
I’ll combine a couple of things at this point.
Let me start out by saying that, if the consensus conforms with the view that you have just summarized, I can live with that.
I originally was in favor of releasing the minutes earlier, and my thinking was that doing so would allow us to get rid of the risk statement.
I know there is the thought that we can’t move back from a decision to accelerate the release of the minutes, but I think the quid pro quo of eliminating the risk statement could be favorable.
So that has some appeal to me.
Plus the minutes give the market a more complete reflection of the broad views of the Committee members, and there is perhaps a benefit from that.
I think that assessment still holds.
However, I recognize your main point.
I’ve been down that road before:
You jump, and then you’ve done it, and you can’t back out.
<START>So I don’t January 27-28, 200444 of 238have a problem with approaching the decision slowly, with a lot of thought.<END>
But I think it is a step worth considering and deliberating.
As for some of the comments that arise in our discussions, certainly if the minutes are not released for two or three weeks, what we say in public statements during that period can be more complicated.
But I think we live with that to an important degree now.
So I don’t see that as a very significant complicating factor.
The news event of the minutes could be an issue if somehow the minutes give a completely different view of our assessment of the balance of risks than the statement did when we released it.
So I think the proposal to advance the publication of the minutes deserves continual thought if not acceptance at this point.
Finally, I’m just going to go ahead to the next item, the role of our individual projections.
My thought was that, if eliminating the risk statement were viewed as a backing away, the projections could be the substitute in terms of filling in for information that is forward-looking.
<START>That’s not as critical to me as the idea of releasing the minutes sooner to make public the general views of the Committee.<END>
I’ll stop there.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Santomero.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
Thank you.
<START>I don’t view releasing the minutes earlier as necessarily a bad idea.<END>
I do have two caveats associated with that view, and they are important to me.
The first is that we should not do so and also expand the “blackout period” so that we end up with three or four weeks of blackout, essentially moving us backward rather than forward.
Second, we should not release the minutes with such rapidity as to get ourselves into a mechanical problem that could later become a political problem.
<START>What I mean by that is that, in my view, every member should have an opportunity to see the minutes and be comfortable with them.<END>
<START>We don’t want to find ourselves in a situation where there is a difference of opinion about January 27-28, 200445 of 238what should be in the minutes or what was said in the meeting and have no way of resolving it because of the pressure of time.<END>
The way I expressed it in my notes on the subject is that at a different time with a different staff we could find ourselves in a contentious environment, with disagreement among the Committee members as to what we wanted to say in the minutes.
I would hate to have a situation where the resolution is rushed because the minutes have to go to bed by Thursday, say, or otherwise the markets will see that there is discord in the Committee.
With that mechanical piece of it resolved, I think we could in fact release the minutes somewhat more rapidly.
When I was thinking about all this, I wondered how rapidly that was.
Are we essentially talking about moving up the publication by a week and then getting into an overlap with the next FOMC meeting, or are we talking about releasing it in two weeks with plenty of time for everybody to get a chance to review it?
I thought perhaps we should consider doing a dry run without actually releasing the minutes early.
We could say suppose we were to release the document in three weeks, what would be the mechanics?
Could we get there?
I’d try that during 2004 and see, with the benefit of a year’s history, if we are comfortable with the prospect of accelerating the preparation and release of the minutes.
So that’s where I am.
MR.
FERGUSON.
So you come out with trying the mechanics of this without going to the last step of releasing the minutes?
MR.
SANTOMERO.
Yes, to make sure that we’re happy with the results.
We can have a whole year of experience.
We could ask ourselves, If we were going to release these minutes, do we think that would change the market?
Why or why not?
Do we think the mechanical issues would make it impractical to release the minutes for four or five weeks and then would that interfere with the next FOMC meeting?
A dry run would give us an opportunity internally to see how this would work.
January 27-28, 200446 of 238MR. FERGUSON.
Okay.
President Santomero has laid a third alternative on the table.
President Stern.
MR.
STERN.
I’ve long been relatively enthusiastic about releasing the minutes earlier, and that continues to be my view.
I think Tony’s suggestion for doing some dry runs is a constructive one.
I’ve basically thought that the minutes are an underappreciated asset.
They contain a lot of information, but people don’t pay any attention to them because of the timing of their release.
So I’m interested in having them taken seriously.
I’m making what is perhaps a naïve assumption that the substance wouldn’t change.
After all, the minutes are based on a transcript of the meeting, so to some extent I think that’s a reasonable but not foolproof assumption.
<START>Your comment, Roger, about hitting the market a second time and perhaps creating more chaos than being helpful gives me a bit of pause.<END>
My ultimate reaction to that, though, is that there’s bound to be some learning period that’s going to go on for I don’t know how long
—months, quarters, or maybe even a year.
But I would think that over time market participants would come to understand what’s going on.
And in my view, the better communication is worth the price.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Gramlich.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
Thank you.
First, Roger, I thought you had a very good summary of the first discussion.
<START>There was something you said then that I would like to emphasize regarding the last item in the first column in Vincent’s table, “discontinue the assessment of risks portion of the statement.” I believe that you said we would be flexible about the risk statement but we would not eliminate it.<END>
That happens to be my position.
I think that from time to time people are going to want a bottom line, and I think we ought to give it.
We can be flexible with it
—we have been flexible with it
—but I wouldn’t want to eliminate it.
January 27-28, 200447 of 238On the minutes, I frankly used to agree with you that it was good to release them after the next meeting and keep them out of the news.
But this latest episode has turned me around because it is now clear that many people think
—even though it is not true
—that we used the minutes, say, from our October meeting to amplify our December message.
<START>While that is not true, once the suspicions are out there it’s hard, no matter what we say, to get rid of them.<END>
So I am somewhat reluctantly going to the notion that maybe releasing the minutes earlier is in order.
That is, after we have the meeting, then two or three weeks later
—whenever the staff can prepare them
—we publish the minutes.
I think we ought to keep the minutes just the way they are now.
I agree with Gary that they are an underappreciated asset, and I wouldn’t change their substantive content at all.
I’m persuaded that the Committee is quite ethical, and I don’t believe we would change them.
I think the process would go forward just as it does now with the one exception
—that the minutes would come out three weeks, say, after the meeting.
I would agree with Tony in that I would not change the blackout period.
Pretty soon we could be blacked out totally!
So I’d keep the blackout period the same.
We’d really do everything as we do now except that we’d release the minutes three weeks after the meeting.
On the experiment, it’s my impression, Vincent, that you already did that.
<START>You accelerated the preparation of the minutes this last time, and I didn’t notice any loss of output or productivity.<END>
Maybe somebody did, but I thought they were just as they always have been.
So even provisionally I don’t think we need to experiment much.
MR.
REINHART.
We did the easy part of the experiment, which was the staff side.
Well, it may not have been easy for the people actually drafting the minutes.
We created a rough draft by about this time next week.
We’ll do that again.
The harder part of the experiment is resolving how you will comment on the draft.
Will you want to see other members’ comments?
January 27-28, 200448 of 238How will you know that the Secretary has incorporated your comments and weighed various suggestions against each other?
How will we deliver it to you electronically in a secure manner?
So there is some work to do.
Also, we need to think about the rules associated with the production of the minutes, such as the deadline for submitting comments and other items of that nature.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Broaddus.
MR.
BROADDUS.
I strongly favor moving forward the release of the minutes, but let me review briefly how I get there.
I go back to the basic principle of the way I understand how monetary policy affects the economy
—what we used to refer to as the transmission mechanism.
Namely, what we do and what we say affects expectations about future policy and interest rates generally.
That is the foundation on which I build all of my thinking about this.
With that point of view, it seems to me inescapable that we have to have forward-looking statements.
<START>And to me it’s highly desirable for us to try to give some sense of how we see the balance of risks in the outlook.<END>
So I come out on that where Don and Mike did.
I feel strongly that we have to have a forward-looking element in our statement;
I don’t see how we can do without that.
<START>Going back to our earlier discussion, it’s also clear to me, largely from the work of Roger’s working group, that it’s going to be very difficult and probably impossible to convey this forward-looking assessment with a brief post-meeting statement.<END>
Even if we had some additional sentences, I just don’t think that’s likely to work.
So that is what leads me to conclude that we need to consider moving the minutes forward.
The minutes are detailed enough to convey
—as they already do
<START>—both the majority and minority opinions about the outlook and the balance of risks, and they do it reasonably robustly.<END>
Also in terms of transition, the public and the markets are familiar with the minutes.
Yes, I realize there’s a risk that they may change if we January 27-28, 200449 of 238change the regime here.
Still, the general form and content of the minutes certainly are going to be similar, so they will be familiar to people.
There are obviously drawbacks.
It’s not a freebie.
It’s not a panacea.
A lot has already been said about that.
Obviously, too, staff and Committee members are going to have to be willing to devote time in the period right after the meetings just to go through the process of getting the minutes ready for release.
And that’s not trivial.
It’s going to require changes in schedules and practices.
I don’t see how in the world we can make a blackout work.
So there is the risk that statements we make will add some noise to financial markets.
But markets know how to discount that type of thing already, so I’m not terribly concerned about that.
I must say that some of the points you raised, Roger, are worth thinking about.
I’m not sure that I’ve thought them through completely enough yet.
On the point about our hitting the markets a second time, my initial reaction is to try to imagine what this new regime would be like where we are continuously releasing much earlier a lot more information about what went on at each meeting.
It may well be that, in that sort of atmosphere, it wouldn’t be news in the same sense that the statement is news now.
I just haven’t thought that through completely, but it’s a point worth making.
In any event, for all these reasons I think releasing the minutes earlier is our best alternative.
If we did that, we should continue to issue a statement immediately after the meeting.
And that’s how I got to the conclusion earlier that something on the order of the gradual evolution path would be okay for the statement if we took these other measures.
But I can’t separate them.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay.
Governor Bernanke.
MR.
BERNANKE.
Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
One of the reasons we find it difficult to issue a policy statement is that there’s such a wide divergence of views around the January 27-28, 200450 of 238table.
The special advantage of the minutes is that they represent the diverse views and give some perspective and depth to the discussion.
They also include a lot of valuable and interesting information from the staff presentations about the state of the economy.
So I would be very much in favor of moving up the publication of the minutes.
I would note, to address Governor Ferguson’s concerns, that we would not be the first central bank to use the minutes this way.
Many central banks around the world do that without problems as far as I’m aware.
With respect to the blackout, I think extending the blackout period would be counterproductive for many reasons.
One of them is that it would be like a drum roll up to the minutes that would in fact exaggerate the impact of the minutes.
So I would favor keeping the blackout as it is.
No one has mentioned this
—the Chairman might want to weigh in on it
—but it might make sense on the regularly scheduled two-day meetings to hold the minutes until after the Chairman’s testimony but just in those two instances.
Finally, with respect to the idea of dry runs, perhaps one or two might be worthwhile but it seems to me that, if we are going to make some changes, it would nice to be able to announce them as a package.
Doing dry runs for the whole year would limit in that respect the impact of the overall change, if there is one, in our transparency policy.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Thank you, Roger.
First of all I’d like to congratulate you on your somewhat brilliant description of gradual evolution.
I think there was something in there that everybody could hang onto and like.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Oh no, you caught me!
MS.
MINEHAN.
It’s going to be interesting to see this evolution.
But as you’ve described it, I’m comfortable with it, and I think that’s the way we should go.
<START>I must say that I January 27-28, 200451 of 238thought Governor Bies was correct and conveyed my sense of the value of ambiguity in a short statement.<END>
We’ve used it a lot.
If one goes back and looks at the statements we’ve issued over the last three or four years, they’ve contained a lot of vague wording.
But they’ve also conveyed a decent sense of where the Committee was going without tying us down.
<START>So I think there is some value in ambiguity<END>
—and not just because it may result in a shorter statement or any reason like that.
<START>So I want to put in a little vote for some constructive ambiguity, if I may call it that.<END>
I have long been in favor of releasing the minutes early and had begun to question myself a little on that for some of the reasons that Roger just mentioned.
But as I throw my concerns back and forth I come out on balance in favor of releasing the minutes early.
I was looking at it as a quid pro quo for eliminating the risk statement.
I’m not so sure we can use it that way.
I tend to agree with President Moskow that totally eliminating the risk statement might be viewed as taking a step backwards, but I’m not sure about that.
There is an issue that nobody has talked about with respect to the release of the minutes that goes to the diversity of opinions that are expressed in them.
If we put the minutes out early, those opinions are public at a time when they have some meaning with regard to the next meeting.
Suddenly there may be a drumbeat from the press and other places as to who said this and who said that and who said the other thing who said that and who said the other thing.
There’s a possibility that that could affect us, although I don’t agree with a blackout either.
In any event, it may be obvious by the time the minutes come out where the nuances of perspective are at least among some of the more publicly active members of the Committee.
I think President Santomero has a good idea
—and it’s one that I had in my notes as well
—in suggesting that we should parallel test this.
If I recall correctly, not only the December minutes but even the minutes from the meeting before that were done somewhat earlier than usual.
But I didn’t look at them in the same way that I would look at them now
—in terms of January 27-28, 200452 of 238what they say versus the prevailing views in the market and whether there would likely be any market implications when the minutes are released.
Do I think they would have a big impact or not?
<START>So I would favor a period of parallel testing of this if people think it’s worthwhile going to the extra trouble to do that.<END>
Frankly, I wouldn’t make any discernible changes in our communications process before doing that or much before midyear or so.
I don’t think the gradual evolution in the statement would be viewed by the market as a major change.
And if we’re going to release the minutes early, we need some time to really think about that as a group and see how we feel about it when we review what’s in the early renditions of the draft minutes that we get.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you, Cathy.
<START>I always make it a practice of calling for a coffee break whenever anyone says something nice about me.<END>
<START>This seems like a good time to have a coffee break.<END>
SPEAKER(?).
Now I’ll know in the future!
[Coffee break] MR. FERGUSON.
President Parry.
MR.
PARRY.
<START>I’m interested in but not yet enthusiastic about accelerating the release of the minutes.<END>
I think the information advantage to the markets of getting the minutes roughly in their current form several weeks earlier would be meaningful.
But since the earlier release of the minutes would become a significant policy event in itself and since it precedes the next FOMC meeting, I am concerned that the accelerated minutes would be different and perhaps less informative than the current ones.
I also worry that our discussions would be affected by the knowledge that the market would focus more sharply on the minutes than they do now.
That leads me to the view, if we’re going to pursue this
—and I’d certainly be supportive of going the January 27-28, 200453 of 238next step or two
—that we should have trial runs or parallel processes.
For me the issue is not getting the minutes drafted
—I think the staff can do that readily
—but the process of editing and resolving any disagreements that may arise with regard to specific editing changes.
So in my view there’s room to look at this further.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you.
President McTeer.
MR.
MCTEER.
<START>Governor Ferguson, I think Cathy described your summary of the risk-assessment discussion as somewhat brilliant.<END>
I agree with that although we don’t need another coffee break!
[Laughter] When you summarized the discussion I thought you had left open the possibility of discontinuing the formal risk-assessment portion of the statement.
But Governor Gramlich indicated that he thought you hadn’t.
I would urge you to keep considering that option.
<START>Many of you have emphasized the value of continuing to have something that is forward looking, but I think there is the possibility of having forward-looking, relevant information in backward-looking statements.<END>
When we take an action at a meeting and we say why we it, we are giving information about the kind of development that triggers an action by us.
did If those conditions change or if they don’t change in the next several weeks, then market participants can form their own conclusions about the implications of that.
<START>Moving on to the release of the minutes, I thought your preemptive description of that was brilliant, not just somewhat brilliant.<END>
I agree with all of it.
I was prepared to trade away something on the minutes for the elimination of the risk assessment.
But I agree that what we have in the minutes now is very good, and given my druthers, I’d stay with our current procedures.
By our releasing them after the next meeting they’re available for scholars, economists, and others to do what they want with them.
They don’t disturb the markets.
Putting them out before the next meeting I think inevitably is going to disturb the markets.
<START>The only January 27-28, 200454 of 238time the minutes could come out before the next meeting and not do damage would be immediately after the meeting they’re describing, which is obviously impossible.<END>
So I agree with everything you said about releasing the minutes earlier.
Of course, this puts us on the wrong side of what people perceive as inevitable history.
We’re not going to be regarded as progressive in terms of transparency.
But I do believe your position is right With regard to blackouts, I think the blackout period after our meetings is already an anachronism, and we ought to be considering shortening rather than lengthening it.
To me the blackout several days before the meeting is useful.
<START>But once we began issuing statements on the day of the meeting, the post-meeting blackout no longer served a useful purpose.<END>
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Guynn.
MR.
GUYNN.
Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
I agree with your characterization of the way to think about this as being risk management.
That’s a concept the Chairman has used in other policy discussions.
<START>I don’t think the risks are so large in terms of the process of producing the minutes, though I see some small risks there.<END>
<START>And like most others who have spoken, I don’t like the idea of a blackout of essentially half of the period between meetings.<END>
I think that would be a terrible step backwards.
To me the larger risk
—and this is going to seem strange, but I take a different view from the one you expressed
—is that, rather than being less informative, the minutes could become more informative in an unfortunate sense.
You were saying that perhaps the discussion would be more careful and more circumspect and as a result the minutes would not be as informative
—a point that Bob Parry also mentioned.
I think it’s possible that it could go the other way and that some people would be trying to get into the minutes their own particular way of thinking about the economy.
That could inadvertently lead to a lot of time being spent in the meetings trying to January 27-28, 200455 of 238get our preferred points of view into the minutes and more time spent arguing during the editing process about how much of that language survives.
And it seems to me, as Cathy Minehan suggested, that the minutes will be read more carefully if they come out before the next policy meeting.
So depending on whose views the readers pick out of the minutes, if we have that kind of jousting for phraseology and language in the minutes, we could in fact end up with minutes that are more informative than we really want them to be.
I see that as a larger risk, as strange as that may sound.
I just don’t think we need to go in that direction right now.
And once we do, we’ll have a very hard time going back the other way.
So I would strongly prefer to sit tight.
I also originally thought of the early release of the minutes as a possible tradeoff to get away from the risk assessment in the post-meeting statements.
But I think there’s another way to make that kind of trade and it’s in the Monetary Policy Reports.
We’ll come back to that shortly;
that’s an issue I would like to keep open also, as President McTeer suggested.
Thank you.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Pianalto.
MS.
PIANALTO.
Thank you.
For all the reasons that were listed as pros in Vincent’s presentation, I was leaning toward supporting early release of the minutes.
However, some of the cons listed on the same page and in Brian Madigan’s memo are more troublesome to me.
<START>I think they also present some greater risks, especially the temptation to send signals and the ability to make conditional statements<END>
—some of the points that President Guynn just made.
Also, there’s the issue that President Santomero raised about the ability to work out differences among Committee members or the Committee and the staff in a timely fashion.
Those concerns cause me to step back and not support early release at this time.
I was also going to recommend, as President Santomero did, that we do some dry runs if the Committee at some point feels compelled to go in this direction.
I think we really do need to have some practice with this January 27-28, 200456 of 238process to make sure that we are working out all of these issues, especially those that are listed on the “cons” side.
So at this time I’m not willing to support early release of the minutes.
I want to have a better understanding of some of the issues that have been raised.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you.
Governor Bies.
MS.
BIES.
Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
I’m going to come out on the side of supporting earlier release of the minutes.
Let me tell you why.
In response to the comment that the early release of the minutes would be another news event and could move the market, I’d point out that we are out giving speeches all the time.
Our public statements all have the potential to move markets on occasion, and in fact it has happened.
To my mind we’re better off releasing the minutes.
At least then there’s a balanced approach, with the diversity of views presented at one time rather than the views that get press attention being dependent on whose speaking engagements come where on the calendar.
So I think that the earlier publication of the minutes would diminish the news events.
It would help put into context when a Bank President or Governor is speaking where their views are in the continuum of views expressed at the meeting that had just occurred.
I believe it actually would help lessen the “news” impact compared with the reaction to our speeches.
I also don’t want to extend the blackout period because I think our public appearances are a critical way for us to communicate between meetings.
We can communicate when economic conditions have changed from those that led to the decision we made at a meeting;
new data may get us moving in a different way.
So I would hate to extend the blackout period.
Let me comment on one of the alternatives regarding how to handle the approval of the minutes
—whether we should do that as a subcommittee or not.
I strongly disagree with the subcommittee approach.
I think all of us need to be involved because these are our minutes and January 27-28, 200457 of 238they are very important.
I would feel very uncomfortable having a subcommittee perform that function.
I also would like to see us go ahead and do the dry runs where all of us have to make sure we schedule time to read and comment on the minutes.
Given that we couldn’t pull back from the release date
—but we could always release them earlier
—I would suggest that, if we do go forward, we release the minutes with a relatively long window for the drafting and approval process.
If we get better and faster at it, we can move up the publication date, but we can’t go the other way.
So I would leave us some room and start with a longer period initially.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Poole.
MR.
POOLE.
Thank you.
I’m quite skeptical of early release of the minutes.
Let me say that I start from the position that the minutes must absolutely be true to the transcript that is going to be released five years later.
We can’t have a discussion of an issue that might be sensitive and leave it out of the minutes entirely;
somebody will look at the transcript later and say that the minutes just didn’t reflect what happened at that meeting.
So I think that’s a very important consideration.
As I think about my own experience, not too long after I came here in 1998 we had the problem of the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund and the related upset in the securities markets.
If I recall
—and my recollection may be wrong, but that doesn’t matter for this purpose because we could imagine it taking place
—at our August meeting of that year we had some discussion of what was going on at that fund.
And we had an interim conference call discussion before the September FOMC meeting.
If we had released the minutes for August on some standard schedule along the lines of what is being considered now, they would have come out just at the time that all hell was breaking loose, if I may put it that way, in the financial markets.
Now, unlike Governor Bies, I think there are times when it’s very constructive to be January 27-28, 200458 of 238quiet and not to say anything.
Even if one has a scheduled speech, there’s a way of giving a speech and not saying anything about the FOMC and monetary policy.
I think we’ve all been there.
But if the minutes are coming out and they’re going to be true to the transcript, we may not have any choice but to say in the minutes what went on at the meeting.
So, that’s one of the reasons that I come out against early release of the minutes.
There’s also a practical issue that was not discussed in the working group’s report;
I don’t know whether they considered it, but I think it would need to be considered.
What happens if we want to have an interim meeting a couple of days before or a couple of days after the date the minutes are to be released?
How does that complicate our situation?
Does the release of the minutes then muddy the message that comes from a policy decision at an interim meeting?
Or if the minutes are released a couple of days before an interim meeting, what do we do?
What is the release schedule for minutes of an interim meeting because, as I recall, those traditionally are attached to the minutes of the earlier meeting?
I don’t know whether or not those issues were discussed, but it seems to me very important that we think through how we would handle those types of situations.
<START>I’m quite skeptical about moving up the release of the minutes because when we look at all this carefully, I think we’re going to find a lot of very sensitive and potentially unfortunate interactions of that kind.<END>
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Kohn.
MR.
KOHN.
Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
On balance I’m leaning in favor of early release of the minutes.
I think there is a lot of information in them.
It’s a much more complete explanation of why we did what we did and how we look at the future
—points that I made before in talking about the statement.
And as President Minehan said, the minutes do give a sense of alternative perspectives.
Partly because we have so few dissents on the Committee’s policy January 27-28, 200459 of 238decision, I think it is important to get the sense out there that there are alternative reasons for arriving at the same decision.
Consequently, though I do think early release would move markets and it could be uncomfortable from time to time, on balance I believe that over time it would result in markets being more stabilizing by moving in directions we want.
I do recognize the concerns that President Poole, President Guynn, and Governor Ferguson have raised.
They also have raised some technical issues about intermeeting moves or discussions that we need to think about carefully.
And I do think it would require some discipline on the part of the Committee to avoid having the earlier release of the minutes cause feedback effects on the Committee’s deliberations.
I like the idea of the dry run.
I’m not sure we need to go through a whole year of dry runs, but we should do them at least for a while.
And it’s not only a production issue.
It’s a matter of thinking about what these minutes would do to the markets if they came out today.
Now, the value of the dry run is limited because, with our knowing that it’s a dry run, we won’t get the feedback of the minutes on the deliberations.
But I think it can at least help inform a decision later if we have a number of instances of the dry run.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
This is a very important issue, and on balance I come out favoring early release of the minutes.
It might make us a little uncomfortable at times;
but I think, as the document said, it will also make us more accountable, and in my view that’s a plus.
It’s a real positive in that it improves our transparency.
Quite frankly, in this age of rapid communication it’s hard to justify holding off for six to eight weeks before we release them.
It’s a red face test that I find difficult.
I know we can always say that we have to approve them at the next meeting, but again in this era of communication I find that hard to justify.
I think the minutes are a supplement to the statement that we release shortly after the meeting.
I don’t view them as a January 27-28, 200460 of 238substitute for that in any way.
So to me it’s an additional bit of transparency.
I think Tony’s suggestion of a dry run is a good one;
we need to work out the mechanics and to set the rules for processing the minutes.
I don’t think a full year is necessary, but it would be helpful to have a dry run.
Let me touch on the two points that Roger made, which are both very important.
One is that it may affect the Committee’s discussion.
On balance I really don’t think it would affect the comments at the meeting all that much.
The only time it might have an impact is when we make conditional statements
—for example, that if certain developments occur, we may need to have an intermeeting telephone call
INSTANCE OF DISAGREEMENT: 109

I think we’d have to work out some way to deal with those types of circumstances.
I don’t know exactly what that should be, but we do have to address that.
Other than that, I just don’t see it affecting the discussion at the meeting any more than the release of the minutes after the subsequent meeting does.
As for the other point about speaking once in our post-meeting statement and then letting the markets interpret the data, I think Susan Bies put it very well.
We are all individually speaking at various times, and in the process we generate a lot of news events.
The press is covering us more than we would like.
That’s just part of the process, and if we release the minutes earlier, the markets and the press will become accustomed to it.
On the blackout, I agree completely with Bob McTeer that the blackout period after the meeting is obsolete.
I think it could be shortened quite considerably.
We did shorten it about eight years ago as I recall.
It used to go through the weekend, and we pushed it back to the close of business on the Friday after the meeting.
In my view, we could easily move it back earlier.
As for Bill Poole’s comments about the timing of interim meetings, I think these are important issues to think through ahead of time, but on balance I believe they’re manageable.
January 27-28, 200461 of 238MR. FERGUSON.
Vice Chairman Geithner.
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.
Coming new to this discussion, I have been more moved by the arguments in favor of accelerating the release of the minutes than I am troubled by the arguments against.
But the arguments against are proliferating, and those arguments are significant.
Some of them I hadn’t thought through, and I believe they’re worth thinking about carefully.
<START>My general sense is that we should try to get ourselves more comfortable than we are now as a group with moving toward early release.<END>
Whatever ways we can get ourselves more comfortable are worth investing in.
I would offer the qualification, just to amplify what Don said, that I doubt a dry run is going to tell us much about what’s really material to the choice here.
It won’t tell us anything about the market dynamics.
It won’t tell us anything about how the decision will affect the dynamics of the discussion.
It won’t tell us anything about how hard it is to get a consensus on the minutes if the differences of view become consequential.
My sense is that we should think through these two specific questions of whether it complicates an intermeeting decision or reduces our discretion on intermeeting action.
And we should explore a bit Bill Poole’s question about whether there are discussions we would have in this room
—on subjects such as a major financial system issue
—that we would not want to mention publicly within six weeks much less three weeks or two weeks.
I think those matters are worth exploring, frankly, before we take this next step of going into a dry run.
But just to end where I began, I think it’s worth trying to see if we can get ourselves more comfortable with moving in this direction because I suspect the returns are worth it.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Olson.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
May I ask the Vice Chair a question?
MR.
FERGUSON.
Sure.
January 27-28, 200462 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
What do you have in mind?
Let me put it this way:
A dry run as an abstraction obviously has a purpose.
You’re suggesting that it won’t work.
Nonetheless, you’re agreeing with the purpose of it, which means you have an alternate suggestion.
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.
Why don’t we ask the barons of this place to explore a bit some of these technical questions that haven’t been explored in detail in the paper?
Why don’t we ask them to do that, and come back to us before we go through the mechanics of launching a dry run?
I suggest that because I think those issues are more important, frankly, than what we’re going to learn in a dry run.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Let me give Governor Olson a chance to speak, and then I’ll try another summation
—or the Chairman may want to speak, and then I’ll try another summation.
MR.
OLSON.
Let me make a couple of points.
First of all, I think there are two goals in this process:
clarity and transparency.
Going back to the risk-assessment issue and speaking as a gradual evolutionist
—regardless of what alternative we might have chosen among the risk-assessment alternatives
—in spite of the fact that we think we do a pretty good job of communicating, not everybody in the market agrees.
<START>So no matter what we might have decided on the risk-assessment issue, some people would have said that we had not increased either the transparency or the clarity.<END>
<START>As for moving up the release of the minutes, I don’t see how there can be any question that doing so would be an improvement in our efforts toward both goals.<END>
I haven’t been involved in this process on this side of the walls for as long as many of you, but I started following the Fed from a public policy point of view over thirty years ago.
And it seems to me that something the Fed has done to improve itself is to increase its transparency.
The statement on the policy decision, the expanded minutes, the concurrent January 27-28, 200463 of 238release of the vote, and the release of the transcript all have helped to reduce some of the mystery regarding the Fed.
I think that the Fed operates in more anonymity than almost any other public or quasi-public body.
And how we continue to deal with the question of transparency is a matter that I think we want to control and not have somebody suggest to us that we ought to be doing more.
Having said that, I want to come back to Governor Ferguson’s opening remarks because I think what he said is critical.
In this instance, once we have made the decision, we can never go back.
So of all the options we’re looking at, this is one that we need to consider with the most deliberation.
I would suggest that, if we move in this direction, we do a dry run and simulate the process at the same time.
Even if it doesn’t change much
—and I think it will
—it has the potential to change a great deal, and the simulation may suggest to us issues that we may not have thought of.
So I’m in favor of the early release of the minutes, but I’m in favor of doing it under a variation of the Santomero approach
—that we test it very carefully before going forward.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Chairman Greenspan on the early release of the minutes.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
There is a major issue here that I find troublesome, and I don’t know how to get around it, though I recognize that it may be feasible to do so.
It’s the issue that Tony Santomero has raised.
We have very scrupulously avoided a nineteen-member communiqué-type discussion of the post-meeting statement.
Now, if we take this issue of individually editing the minutes seriously, it involves a very standard procedure that, if we actually followed, we would never finish by the time we now release the minutes.
That’s because we all would have suggested additions and deletions.
And additions and deletions change the context of what we have in the minutes.
At our meetings we typically have three or January 27-28, 200464 of 238four hours of discussion, and writing the minutes to fully capture what went on is an art.
The notion that we would all decide on what to include in the minutes that would fully reflect our discussion or that we would agree on how to say it is just not believable.
It’s not a big deal now because the impact on the markets and the impact on what we do is not very large.
I do think that this is really an unknown.
We have no idea how this process would work.
It is quite conceivable, if we go ahead and subsequently find out that we can’t make it work because we are running into the equivalent of a nineteen-person communiqué, that we’re going to have some very serious difficulties.
It may mean that we will so diminish the minutes that the issue Bill Poole raised
—namely whether they will look like an accurate reflection of the transcript released five years later
—will become a very serious credibility issue.
I frankly don’t know the answer to that.
That’s one of the reasons I think the trial runs, or the equivalent of what the Vice Chair is talking about, have a certain ring of desirability.
My judgment, as I’ve said before, is that in a very general way we ought to be seeking to find as our ultimate communication vehicle a way that, when we make a statement after meetings
—regardless of whether we act or don’t act
—nothing happens.
What that suggests is that anything we can do to converge the amount of information currently available in the intermeeting period to the point at which we make our decision is to the good.
Theoretically that would suggest that we definitely should speed up the publication of the minutes because by construction that would do it.
We have one problem, however.
The problem is that apparently the markets overreact to whatever we say.
If that is indeed the case, then to move up the release of the minutes could be counterproductive to our goal.
Frankly, I don’t see how one can know the answer to that particular question.
January 27-28, 200465 of 238There’s very little doubt that a goodly part of our deliberations has become increasingly conditional.
Indeed, the whole pattern of the most recent period has been characterized by this evolving “considerable period” discussion, which is a contingency if I ever saw one.
And we’re going to do more of that because a risk-management mode is invariably emerging as the way we operate.
What I was identifying in the AEA paper I delivered at the beginning of the month was actually what had evolved in this Committee.
I was not suggesting that there was some point when we said:
“We are going to take a risk-management view of monetary policy.” It didn’t happen that way.
It was, as we like to say today, gradual.
The reason that has happened is that these markets are changing and becoming ever more sophisticated, so our approach is of necessity trying to match that degree of sophistication and is continuously evolving.
Consequently, I think it’s very difficult to know whether releasing the minutes earlier will be a plus or a minus.
A number of things could start to happen of which I don’t think we’re aware.
Nobody has mentioned the obvious thing, which I’m sure will start to occur, which is that there will be pressure to identify the people who took various positions.
We don’t get that now because virtually nobody except the academics reads the post-meeting minutes.
But I don’t think it’s credible to believe that that’s not going to happen.
Susan Bies made a very important observation
—namely, that there is a tendency for our speeches not to be uniform.
We have nineteen members in this group, and I will submit to you that the distribution of words uttered publicly between meetings by members of this Committee is highly concentrated;
I would say that most of the statements are made by significantly less than half the members.
And I don’t think they are necessarily a representative half.
So in that respect it’s useful, as Susan said, to get the minutes out to provide some specific context for the policy decision.
January 27-28, 200466 of 238Having listened to the conversation today
—and I must admit that I have been on all sides of this issue over the years
—my sense is that it gets more and more complex.
The one thing I’m sure of is that we ought to be reasonably certain how we think this is going to come out before we move.
I don’t know what vehicles we could use to become reasonably certain.
I do think the trial run is not going to solve the problem, as the Vice Chair points out, but it will give us some insights.
And I’m sure that trying to work our way through what we would do under various conditions will be helpful.
The crucial question, however, is what we will do about contingent statements.
If we decide to leave them in, there is a fairly significant risk that we’re going to increase the volatility going into the next meeting.
<START>If we take them out, we are doing an injustice to the intent of conveying what actually went on in the meeting;<END>
and without them, we may in fact make the meeting minutes incoherent.
In other words, somebody will note that something obviously went on that’s not mentioned in the minutes because the discussion doesn’t seem to track.
People are not reacting to each other’s views.
When the contingency statements are put in, it all comes together.
So of the three issues that we’ve raised here, I think this is the toughest one.
I understand the notion that we are a public institution and we have an obligation to the electorate to be forthcoming in all respects short of that which diminishes our capability to do what we are statutorily required to do by the Federal Reserve Act.
And we are the only ones who can make that judgment unless we do it so poorly that somebody else will impose a different judgment on us.
But we can be certain, as someone said
—I believe it you, Mark
<START>was—that the judgment imposed on us by somebody else would scarcely be better than one we would make.<END>
So the way I come out at this stage is that I’m a little concerned about moving forward on this.
But because of the public nature of this institution, I do think that we have to try to see if January 27-28, 200467 of 238we can move forward on it.
<START>Before we act, though, we have to be reasonably convinced that it will not make our job on monetary policy, which is the most important issue here, more difficult to implement because we’ve set up barriers to our ability to function effectively.<END>
If that in fact happens, we are doing a grave disservice to our mandate.
I think the crucial issue here is not an issue first and foremost of being transparent.
The crucial issue is to do the right thing in terms of our monetary policy decisions.
Being transparent merely involves explaining what we did and what we might do.
<START>But if in the process of the explanation we undercut our ability to do the best thing, that to me is a net loss.<END>
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you.
Let me first disclose what I think the tally is.
There are, I believe
—it’s hard to get all the nuances right
—seven or maybe eight people whom I would describe as not enthusiastic.
The remainder apparently feel that they’ve weighed the pros and cons and on balance are more comfortable going ahead with an earlier release of the minutes.
The obvious middle ground is to undertake some form of testing as best we can, understanding that what Tim Geithner said is true
—the ultimate test will not occur until we actually release the minutes.
However, I suspect we all believe, since no other approach immediately comes to mind, that we ought to try a bit of a dry run.
That’s one thing to do.
Another thing we can do, which I have done, though maybe a lot of you have not, is to read some of the minutes from other central banks.
We can ask the staff to circulate them, and you’ll see that some look familiar in terms of being consistent with what we do.
Some, such as those from the Bank of Sweden, are very much in the mode that Tony Santomero suggested:
One member said X, another member said Y, and when you’re through what you get is a one-paragraph version of the transcript.
So there’s a range in the way the minutes could be formulated.
I propose that we circulate some examples so people can see what minutes from January 27-28, 200468 of 238other central banks look like.
I would propose also that the staff go back and develop a way to work through Tony’s thought of having a bit of a dry run for long enough to test some of the concerns we have raised.
Doing a dry run for just one or two meetings this year may not prove to be much of a test because the probability
—though I can’t predict it fully
<START>—that we’re going to be in a mode where we’re talking about contingencies and potential changes in interest rates doesn’t seem so high.<END>
On the other hand, if we conduct dry runs for a year, I think we will get to a position where we are at least having more serious discussions of changes.
So I think we could conclude by saying that we should go forward with some sort of concept of a dry run, with the staff trying to give us an idea of how the minutes would look and how this process would work.
We could proceed down that path, recognizing the concerns that have been raised and the fact that, as Tim has picked up, this is a very close call.
Even those who are enthusiastic see some risks, and a number of other people clearly are not enthusiastic.
Does that seem like a reasonable place to end this discussion, knowing that we’ll have to come back to make a decision on how to do the dry run and then once the dry run is done we’ll look at this again?
Cathy Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
I would just like to interject that I think we can make the dry run a bit more effective, recognizing that, as Tim said, we won’t really know what the market feedback would be.
Nonetheless, we should put some effort into addressing the minutes issue by preparing them for publication and then reading them again at the time they would have been released in the context of what’s going on in the markets.
We could then come to some assessment of what the impact of their release might be.
January 27-28, 200469 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, I think that’s an important point.
We’re obligated to take this test seriously.
Unless that is done, we’re going to learn nothing.
If we all essentially try to replicate what we would do in the real game, I think we’ll learn something.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I think the staff needs to help us figure out if there’s a way to look at the content of the minutes at the time they are completed as well as the incoming data since the meeting and judge what the market reaction might have been.
We need to try to get an approximation, though admittedly a very rough one, of how the markets might have reacted.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
You know what we’ll learn?
We’re going to learn how many iterations we need.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Oh, we’ll learn that.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
That’s one of the crucial aspects.
<START>I’ve sat through the writing of too many G-7 communiqués, and that process makes the old sausage factory analogy seem benign.<END>
And the FOMC has more members than the G-7.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Could I suggest in the interest of time, unless someone has a burning issue here, that we move on to the third topic, which is the role of projections.
That is also very important to a number of people.
Can we start our go-around on that?
Would you like to start, Mr. Chairman?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I might as well since I have the floor.
MR.
FERGUSON.
You always have the floor!
You can exercise that prerogative.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I have very considerable concerns about this.
<START>Let me say, first, that if somebody is merely arguing that we should substitute core PCE for the CPI in our projections, I think that’s fine.<END>
If somebody is discussing the width of uncertainty bands for the January 27-28, 200470 of 238projections, I’m all for that.
But remember what these “forecasts” are.
I say that because every six months I have to struggle when I appear before the Banking Committees to try to explain what these forecasts mean.
Everything I am discussing at those hearings
—which is a reflection of what we said at our previous meeting
—is full of vaguenesses here, imbalances there, and my endeavor to convey a fairly broad sense of where the risks are.
And then we have point estimates with no specification of what the assumptions are and no specification of what the analytical structure of the forecast mechanism is.
What we call the range of forecasts is not the true range.
It’s the range of means.
And that, as everybody knows, is smaller than the range of potential outcomes seen by each individual.
I would almost prefer, if we are going to continue giving these sorts of projections, that we just show the ranges without a central tendency.
The reason I say that is that the central tendency isn’t a reflection of the way we function.
These forecasts were largely provided to avoid having to put out what would really be an interesting forecast
—the staff forecast.
That forecast is an internally consistent forecast with explicit assumptions and explicit exogenous variables in it, and therefore one has some way of evaluating it.
I submit to you that there is no way to evaluate what one is looking at in the forecasts we provide.
To make them more elaborate would involve a very difficult process.
And to try to average a group of heterogeneous statistics is particularly counterproductive to the subtleties in which we are engaged when we are trying to make very nuanced monetary policy decisions.
Remember that we don’t actually function off these forecasts.
It is quite conceivable, as has been the case on many occasions, that our “maximum likelihood” estimate
—or median or central tendency or any other term you can think of to describe it
—is overwhelmed by a particularly low probability event.
That low probability event, if it were to occur, is so important January 27-28, 200471 of 238that it overrides the central tendency forecast.
The issue of deflation, for example, has been a concern.
In none of our forecasts last year did we project anything resembling deflation.
Yet I would submit to you that the strongest aspect of our monetary policy had to do not with the forecast or the expectation of the most likely outcome but with that low probability, high difficulty problem.
I have always tried to decrease the exposure of these forecasts, and I’ve tried very specifically to avoid them as much as possible in my semiannual testimonies on monetary policy.
Indeed, as you may have noticed, on occasion I don’t mention them in my testimony but they are in the Monetary Policy Report.
The reason is that it is very difficult to handle, in part because the outlook might have changed since the forecasts were made.
At the point when I’m testifying, these forecasts are three or four weeks old.
A short-term forecast that is three, four, or five weeks out of date is really very peculiar looking, and it’s to have to sit hard there and try to explain what that forecast is supposed to mean.
I’ve personally found having to deal with that during my testimony psychologically debilitating.
[Laughter] But that, I grant you, is not a reason not to provide it.
I certainly think it’s wise to put in the core PCE, largely because that doesn’t change anything I just said.
I don’t see how we can widen the uncertainty bands without defining what we mean by them.
To talk about uncertainty bands for a set of projections that have no appropriate statistical characteristics to add them up strikes me as stretching our knowledge with regard to the nature of measuring probabilities.
So I think there’s nothing to be gained
—for myself anyway
—by expanding the role of the projections.
<START>If we really want to move forward in this respect, then basically it becomes a question of whether or not to provide a staff forecast.<END>
We can decide what the exogenous January 27-28, 200472 of 238variables are and instruct the staff to change variables X, Y, and Z on fiscal policy, say, or even monetary policy for that matter, and then we’d have something that has statistical characteristics.
I’m not sure I’d be in favor of doing that.
It’s a huge job.
I don’t think expanding the role of our projections is going to help us very much because I don’t think these forecasts really correspond all that much to what we say about the economy.
At the July meeting I sat there with everybody’s forecast in front of me as you all discussed the economy, and I had great difficulty matching the forecasts with the commentary.
And I will tell you the reason.
When you talk, you speak in probabilistic terms;
when you put down your forecast, it’s a specific number.
If the forecasts really mattered greatly in our deliberations and in our policy decisions, then I think we’d have an obligation to make that clear in order to be transparent and to communicate to the markets that those forecasts are what we’re looking at.
But we’re not.
<START>So, to focus on those forecasts would in my view actually be counterproductive to our purpose of being transparent.<END>
I think we would be confusing the markets by leading them to think that the forecasts provide a basis for our operations.
The markets would react to changes in the forecasts when in fact those forecasts have very little to do with the way we function.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Hoenig.
MR.
HOENIG.
Thank you.
Let me just say that the idea of using the projections came to me perhaps more as a reflection of how much I disliked the risk statement than how much I really liked the projections.
<START>So, given the almost brilliant discussion of the risk statement, I’m not married at all to the projections.<END>
I understand all the issues and concerns, and I agree that we’d have a very difficult time making that work going forward.
But I suppose it did serve my purpose in the sense that it illustrated my willingness to get rid of the risk statement.
With that I’m going to be quiet.
January 27-28, 200473 of 238MR. FERGUSON.
Okay.
President Santomero.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
Are we still on the risk statement?
[Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.
We’re theoretically on the role of the projections.
You have the floor.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
Well, I concur with the Chairman on this one.
I think we have to keep in mind that we’re not in the forecasting business.
And we should not do anything to reinforce the notion that eight or ten times a year we have a forecast of the macroeconomy, no matter what its statistical validity.
It takes away from what people should be focusing on as our responsibility.
Moving from two to eight forecast releases each year with our thirteen staffs working on the projection estimates would take up a lot of time.
And explaining our forecasts on an ongoing basis
—discussing their accuracy or inaccuracy
—doesn’t particularly make sense to me.
So from my perspective twice a year for the Monetary Policy Reports is fine.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Stern.
MR.
STERN.
I’m not in favor of changing the way we currently deal with the forecasts.
When the idea first surfaced, I thought it was intriguing.
But the more I thought about it, the more I thought it would raise more questions than it would answer.
We would get into the business of trying to explain or trying to qualify what all these numbers meant.
And that would not be likely to turn out to be a productive exercise;
or at least, as I tried to go through that exercise for the moment, I couldn’t come up with a satisfactory way of doing all that.
So I would put this idea on the back burner.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Gramlich.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
I agree with everybody else and in particular with the Chairman.
I’ll make an admission here.
I don’t really forecast.
I have forecasters on the staff over there, and January 27-28, 200474 of 238they do a thorough job.
They run alternative simulations.
If something looks a little funny to me, I can pick up the phone and ask why that is and dig into it to any degree I want.
I don’t put down a coherent forecast when I prepare for our meetings.
What I do is to try to think how I ought to vote on monetary policy.
I was curious on why this interest in our forecasts came about.
I read appendix A in the document.
It seemed to stem from a somewhat contentious debate between Chairman Miller and Chairman Burns and various members of the Banking Committees when the first report on monetary policy was required.
So I agree with the Chairman that there is zero information here.
There is a lot of confusion.
<START>To be perfectly blunt about it, if there were some way to get rid of giving our forecast in the Monetary Policy Report, I would even favor that.<END>
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Broaddus.
MR.
BROADDUS.
I think Ned’s comment is a good one.
I would like to find a way to get rid of that obligation as well.
If there were some possibility of communicating the staff forecast
—or whatever kind of consistent forecast we could possibly develop
—and talk about how that outlook deviates from our ultimate objective, that’s what I think the public and the market need to know.
None of these alternatives to our current forecasting procedure would come anywhere near that.
So I wouldn’t want to go in this direction.
Again, I think we ought to consider whether there’s some way we can stop doing these Committee member forecasts.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Bernanke.
MR.
BERNANKE.
Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
<START>Basically I’m just going to make a few suggestions for marginal changes in our current practice that might be useful.<END>
<START>But then I want be the devil’s advocate at the end of my remarks.<END>
First, I think we should substitute or add the core PCE because that probably is, after all, the measure more relevant to policy.
Second, I January 27-28, 200475 of 238think it would be useful to add six months to the January forecast so that it has the same time horizon as the July forecast.
That would not be changing anything substantive.
<START>Third, to address an issue that the Chairman raised, I think we should revise our forecasts as close to the release date as possible so that they are not dated or stale when they come out.<END>
And finally, I do have a thought on the standard errors.
<START>Concerns have been raised in earlier discussions of the projections that they might be considered objectives or goals, for example, rather than forecasts or that, by making a forecast, we risk our credibility in some way.<END>
<START>Obviously, we can put in standard errors to make it clear that they are forecasts and are subject to error and so on.<END>
<START>One simple way to put in standard errors would be to ask each forecaster to put a 25-75 bound around their estimates<END>
—the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile.
Then we could take the average width of those bounds across the people whose forecasts are included in the central tendency forecast.
That would give an estimate of the average uncertainty among the forecasts of members who are making forecasts.
There are ways, I think, to add that.
I just wanted to raise that as something to be considered.
<START>Let me be the devil’s advocate for just a minute, although I’m not proposing any changes.<END>
Statements have been made that these forecasts have no meaning and that they don’t guide our policy in any way.
I think that’s an empirical question, and most of the empirical evidence that exists goes exactly against that.
<START>Work that has done at the St. Louis Fed suggests that FOMC forecasts are better forecasts of inflation than the Blue Chip forecasts, for example, over long periods of time.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
So far!
MR.
BERNANKE.
So far, and that’s all we can evaluate the forecasts on.
There’s also evidence that suggests that the Taylor rule based on FOMC forecasts is a better descriptor of January 27-28, 200476 of 238Federal Reserve behavior than other naïve type of Taylor rules.
So I think it’s an empirical question whether or not they’re useful.
Again, I’m not suggesting a major change in the way we use them, but I would ask us to leave open the issue of what information they contain.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Thank you, Roger.
I think the question of whether or not we should release forecasts is intriguing.
But on balance I come to the view that we should not for many of the reasons others have talked about.
I also think we ought to be clear as to what we’re talking about because it seems to me that two different proposals have been made here.
One has to do with the staff forecast, which is incredibly deep and intensive and is produced through the efforts of a number of people here at the Board.
It is extremely helpful in its Greenbook formulation in terms of providing a base and a framework for us to think about the outlook.
I view that forecast differently from the numbers that I provide for purposes of the Monetary Policy Reports.
The four or five people we have working on our forecast in Boston are very good economists, but they can’t substitute for the depth and breadth and experience of the staff at the Board.
Let’s say I had to produce a forecast for every meeting, or even quarterly, similar to what we do for the January and July meetings
—based on the “appropriate monetary policy” assumption, which would be different from everybody else’s assumption, I suppose.
I’d have to add a lot of people to my forecasting staff to be sure it was a forecast that I could defend or be proud of.
There would be a continuing issue about the quality of the forecast I was releasing.
Now, if mine got merged with a number of other forecasts and the public saw a central tendency and didn’t see highs and lows, maybe that would be okay.
But an accumulation of forecasts isn’t necessarily better just because it’s an accumulation.
January 27-28, 200477 of 238I think over time, because numbers are precise and it’s easier to pin people down on numbers, there would be an enormous amount of pressure to discover who was on either side of the distribution around these projections.
It’s conceivable that we could get ourselves into a situation where we release the forecast, it becomes known who has forecast what, and we might get ourselves dug into positions coming into a meeting.
<START>What really worries me is that, in all of this communication effort, we could get ourselves into a situation<END>
—and I think it’s more probable with numerical forecasts because they are specific and can be tracked
—where people come into a Committee meeting with a hardened policy position.
People might be unwilling to listen to one another or to change their views because they have staked out a position associated with a number that is well known to the outside world.
That could make it hard to come to a consensus within the Committee.
For me this proposal raises that possibility more than the other proposals do.
I think over time that would tend to wreak havoc on the way we operate.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Parry.
MR.
PARRY.
Thank you.
I assume that we’ll continue with the MPR forecast, so I would suggest only minor changes much along the lines of those mentioned by Governor Bernanke.
I think going to the core PCE measure makes a lot of sense because that’s in fact what we focus on.
And I’d probably favor a slight change in terms of the duration of the forecast.
I’d take the January forecast out two years so that both forecasts made in a single year cover the same time period.
I think that would be useful to the public.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President McTeer.
MR.
MCTEER.
<START>Back when Mike Prell was in charge of the staff’s forecast, the way I did mine was to subtract a percentage point from inflation and add it to real growth.<END>
[Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.
The McTeer rule!
January 27-28, 200478 of 238MR. MCTEER.
My practice now is to get very, very close to the staff forecast.
<START>But putting standard errors around my forecast would be, as they say in Texas, like putting lipstick on a hog!<END>
[Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.
President Guynn.
MR.
GUYNN.
Do I have to follow that?
Could I ask for a bye and have you come back to me?
I’m going to risk a bloody nose.
I think the Chairman has already popped my balloon before I tried to blow it up!
I’ve actually been laboring under the apparently false impression that we are in fact in the forecasting business.
I’ve assumed that we make policy decisions based on both our collective and individual forecasts.
We spend a lot of time not only studying the staff’s forecast but looking at outside forecasts and doing some of our own.
<START>My staff tells me that there’s a not insignificant body of research that says there is in fact some value in putting together a number of forecasts that are done on a different set of assumptions.<END>
I guess I was dreaming
—it may be the equivalent of the nineteen-person communiqué that the Chairman says just can’t be done
—that twice a year we would take a look out twelve to eighteen months and try to inform the public about what we see.
I have the sense not so much in the forecast but in the semiannual statements that we have an opportunity as a Committee to let the public know our view of the outlook and how they might expect policy to respond to developments that might unfold.
<START>I know we respond to low probability events, but I hate to think that our policy from meeting to meeting is driven without the benefit of a longer-term forecast obviously adjusted for short-term events as they unfold.<END>
That troubles me a lot.
So I had this dream that we could provide a really thoughtful semiannual statement from this Committee
—whether it’s done before the Chairman’s testimony or after the testimony
—and offer that as our forward-looking view of the broader economy.
If we did that and talked about January 27-28, 200479 of 238developments that we believed would be important in the period ahead, I thought we might be able to get away from the shorter-term statements that react to the recent data.
I’m troubled, for example, by the current Bluebook
—that we’re going to struggle tomorrow with how to re-characterize the labor markets because last time we said they were modestly improving and now it appears that they may or may not be.
I just wish that we could get ourselves and others thinking a little more about the longer term, obviously tempered as we go along by unfolding developments.
That was my balloon that got popped, and I guess my nose is bloodied.
But I wanted to take a crack at it.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Your head is unbowed!
President Pianalto.
MS.
PIANALTO.
I concur with the Chairman.
I don’t think there is anything to be gained by an enhanced role for FOMC member projections.
I, like others, am not in the business of forecasting.
My staff does not prepare projections.
I rely on the Greenbook projections as a starting point.
So I’m not in favor of expanding the role of the FOMC projections.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Bies.
MS.
BIES.
Thank you, Governor Ferguson.
I support the Chairman in the sense that I really don’t want to do any more forecasting.
In fact, I would rather make all of our twice-a-year forecasts rolling ones and revise them for four quarters ahead only.
I’d prefer not to go past a one-year horizon because I tend not to have much wisdom about the outlook beyond that.
But another point
<START>—and I’m going back to the idea of focusing on risk rather than the forecast<END>
—is that the minutes issue is relevant here.
I think releasing the minutes earlier is important because it’s the one place that conveys the discussions we have around the table about mitigating the risks of the different forecasts we have.
<START>Over the past year, for example, while we didn’t forecast deflation, we certainly had quite a bit of discussion about the vulnerability of the January 27-28, 200480 of 238forecast in that regard.<END>
At least I personally was struck by the fact that it wasn’t out of the realm of probability that we could be faced with such severe issues.
And I think our views about those risks come out more in the minutes than in any forecast we could put together.
I feel that we do a better job describing the outlook and our concerns in the minutes than in our forecasts.
So I’d emphasize the minutes rather than the projections for that reason.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Poole.
MR.
POOLE.
I would make two changes and two changes only.
One would be to substitute the core PCE for the total.
I emphasize substitute.
If we do both, we have an implicit energy price forecast in there, and I don’t think that’s useful.
Second, I think we ought to be able to survey the Committee members for any changes in their forecasts a week or two before the testimony, or whatever is practical in terms of the schedule for doing it.
And maybe we could put a footnote in the MPR that these are the Committee’s forecasts as of whatever the date is.
Those are the only changes I would make.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Kohn.
MR.
KOHN.
<START>I wouldn’t elevate the forecast either for all the reasons people have noted, and I certainly wouldn’t want to do psychological damage to the Chairman!<END>
I’m not quite as negative on them, I think, as Governor Gramlich and Chairman Greenspan.
I do think the forecasts give a sense of where the central tendencies of the Committee’s views lie.
You’re right, Chairman Greenspan, that most of what we do in the policymaking process has to do with the risks around those central tendencies, but I think it’s helpful for the public to get at least some sense of where the central tendencies are.
And along the lines of the issues that Governor Bernanke raised, they do actually contribute a bit of understanding as to how we moved on January 27-28, 200481 of 238average over time, though maybe not at particular points in time.
But they have all the problems everybody has noted, and I wouldn’t elevate their role.
I would like to address the issue of the staff forecast, however.
<START>Maybe it’s because I used to be sitting on the other side of the table, but I really think that releasing the staff forecast would be a terrible idea.<END>
What we get from Dave, Karen, and Vincent is their best judgment about what is going to happen and what the most likely course for the economy is.
Any attempt to release that forecast would tend to move them, even if only subconsciously, toward hedging that, given worries about the market reaction or whatever.
So I believe that would be a very, very bad way to go.
I don’t think it would serve the Committee well.
In terms of minor tinkering with the forecast and what we release, to me core PCE is worth thinking about.
Unlike President Poole, I probably would add it rather than substitute it.
I agree that would result in an implicit food and energy price projection being there, but so be it.
Total inflation is not irrelevant.
<START>What is happening to total inflation could very well shape expectations about future inflation, and it probably does.<END>
If we believe those expectations are important, I think we ought to talk about the total as well as the core inflation, though I agree that the latter is more relevant to the underlying pressures on the economy so I would add it.
And I would give serious consideration to adding six months or a year, particularly to the January forecast horizon.
Maybe we can return to those issues before we come back in July.
MR.
FERGUSON.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
I agree, Mr. Chairman, with the way you characterized this.
I don’t think the forecasts serve a useful purpose here.
Also, though people have very good ideas for minor tinkering that will improve them
—the core PCE, maybe lengthening the time period, and things of that sort
—quite frankly, I think there’s a danger in doing that.
If we do that, we draw January 27-28, 200482 of 238more attention to these forecasts.
And we give the impression that we’re putting more emphasis on them, and to that extent I think we elevate them.
That would be counterproductive.
I’d leave it the way it is and not make any changes whatsoever.
<START>Discussing core inflation is obviously important, and you do that in your testimony, which I think is a very appropriate place to do it.<END>
But I would not change the way we present the forecasts one bit.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Vice Chairman Geithner.
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.
I have only the weakest of convictions on this issue.
I think Mike Moskow’s point is a very interesting one:
<START>If there are sensible changes that we could all embrace in how we present these forecasts but we’re all against or uncomfortable with elevating their importance, it may be a mistake to contemplate sensible changes.<END>
I have a somewhat more open mind to the merits of thinking about some sensible changes even if we’re going to retain the current relatively limited role of the forecasts in our thinking.
So I’d say those minor adjustments are worth thinking through a bit more.
<START>But I see no great benefit in substantially raising the profile or the contribution of the forecasts<END>
—nor the time we invest in them
—as a guide to policy going forward.
It may not be worth going through this, but I don’t think there’s a case for increasing their frequency, and I don’t know how I come out on the merits of separating them from the testimony itself.
So I offer those weak convictions.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Governor Olson.
MR.
OLSON.
Just as a reminder, when we discussed the first two issues
—risk assessment and the release of the minutes
—we were talking about communicating FOMC decisions, and we have a very important responsibility in that regard.
But I agree that we are not in the business of making forecasts.
Also, I would remind people of the purpose behind the legislation calling for semiannual reports on monetary policy.
I feel like an old man because I January 27-28, 200483 of 238had left the congressional staff before the Humphrey–Hawkins Act was passed, but I had been there until two years before that, and I remember the mindset.
It was a disclosure issue.
It was not viewed as a tool of monetary policy or economic policy;
it was a disclosure issue.
To underscore that fact, let me refer you to the last line on page 13 of Benson Durham’s memo
—you don’t need to look at it
—where it talks about the House Committee’s response to the second MPR in July 1979.
“We feel this step constitutes a definite improvement in monetary policy oversight.” The issue was not monetary policy implementation but monetary policy oversight.
<START>To put it in simple terms, the Congress was asking, “What does the FOMC know that we don’t know?” This was put into the law at a time when we did not have anywhere near the level of disclosure or transparency that we do now.<END>
As you probably remember, the Humphrey–Hawkins Act did sunset in 2000;
at that time I was back on Capitol Hill with the Senate.
What happened was that there was no particular sentiment for continuing the specific components of the Humphrey–Hawkins legislation, but there was great interest in making sure that the Chairman came before the House and Senate Finance and Banking Committees at least twice a year to discuss monetary policy.
So the wording of the legislation that followed, starting in 2000, was designed to ensure that that would happen.
With that in mind, I don’t see any reason to change anything that we do with the reporting because its purpose is so different from what it had been.
The Chairman may have a different recollection of what transpired in the successor to the Humphrey–Hawkins Act, but that’s my recollection.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Let me give you my perspective on this issue.
I am in the camp that says we have a range of skills with respect to forecasting, but my observation over the years that I’ve been here is that we are mainly consumers of a range of forecasts.
<START>We are looking at forecasts to see whether we agree or disagree and to assess what the risks are, and so forth.<END>
I, January 27-28, 200484 of 238like the Chairman, have observed a number of meetings where the forecasts and the commentary seemed not to be closely intertwined.
Also, just to pick up on Mark Olson’s point about what we know that others don’t know, I don’t think this Committee has ever forecast a recession.
I can’t quite imagine how it would work.
If we’re going to be very transparent and forward-looking, in the sense of what do we know that they don’t know, would we say that the FOMC’s central tendency forecast was for a recession?
That never happens.
It never would happen.
<START>We’re not very good at foreseeing a recession, and if we did, we’d conduct policy to try to avoid it.<END>
If you think about it, I suspect we’d always forecast something that looked pretty much like trend, which I frankly think we do anyway.
It would certainly undercut any sense of credibility around these forecasts.
On some of these smaller changes:
the core PCE, sure;
add six months, possibly;
survey for revisions, I’m not sure, partially because that gets to Michael Moskow’s point that doing that starts to convey this sense of great real time validity about the Committee forecast.
So I’m not really sure where I stand on those.
Let me now step out and try to summarize what I think I heard.
There were no votes, as far as I could tell, for substantially changing the way we think about or use the forecasts.
There was a range of views expressed on some of these small fixes
—the core PCE, adding a few months, et cetera
—and some people did not address those issues at all.
I would propose, since we don’t have to decide any of this until July, that I or the staff send around to everyone a list of two or three options for a simple yes or no vote.
I’m not sure it requires a lot more discussion.
We can then report back to you on how the vote came out on core PCE
—do we add it, do we use it as a substitute
—adding six months or a year to the forecast horizon and revising our forecasts closer to the time of the Chairman’s testimony.
I think those were the three issues that came up.
January 27-28, 200485 of 238We’ll see if there’s an obvious yes or no, up or down, and then discuss all this when we get closer to the next forecast round, but we have a couple of meetings before then.
Governor Gramlich.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
Let me just mention one issue that we might also put on your list.
I think all of us would care very much about the Chairman’s psychological well being.
What is the legal requirement in terms of whether these forecasts have to go in the testimony or just in the report itself?
MR.
KOHN.
In the past it has been in the report and not in the testimony.
MR.
REINHART.
I think we have already crossed that bridge.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Yes, just in the report.
There have been times when the Chairman doesn’t refer to them.
MR.
REINHART.
There have been times when they are not even included in the testimony.
In the last ten years the Chairman has almost never referred to them in the reading draft of the testimony, but there have been times when they haven’t even been in the text of the formal testimony submitted.
They are always in the report.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
So do you get asked about them, then?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
If they are in the report, no.
<START>There were occasions in the past when we were clearly in a recession and the forecast was for no recession.<END>
And the issue that Governor Ferguson raised is a really important one in the sense that these are not best-estimate forecasts.
We can basically come out in, say, the June meeting with a 50 basis cut in the funds rate and in the report on monetary policy show the economy going up.
There’s also a question here of whether these are goals or objective forecasts.
But the major problem is that they are not anything in particular because we haven’t a clue what the underlying assumptions January 27-28, 200486 of 238are.
To have a bunch of forecasts and not know the underlying assumptions and then add them altogether is a statistical monstrosity.
I don’t what the mathematical characteristics are.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
I don’t know if anybody has ever thought of this, but there could be in a special appendix to the report some verbiage about some of these caveats?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
We don’t know what the caveats are!
Then the whole question is why we are doing it.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
As you know, I would prefer not to.
MR.
REINHART.
In the last report we significantly trimmed back the discussion in the testimony.
Basically we just presented the table, did the table reading, and did not offer an interpretation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I don’t think we got a negative response to that as far as I’m aware.
MR.
REINHART.
I would say that there are basically two things that go wrong with regard to the testimony process.
One is that occasionally there will be questions such as:
Six months ago you were forecasting this, and it didn’t happen.
What went wrong?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
It’s only that.
It’s never “you were right!” MR. REINHART.
The second is that the forecasts are numbers, and it’s easy for reporters to characterize them.
So sometimes the newspaper articles that come out after the testimony are not what we would have expected because the reporters latch on only to the numbers.
MR.
POOLE.
It may be a statistical monstrosity, but it’s much better to leave it there than to have the Congress demand the staff forecast.
So we should just leave it alone.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Well, that’s why we have it.
That’s how we got into it.
January 27-28, 200487 of 238SPEAKER(?).
It’s a legal requirement.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
That’s where it came from
—to protect the staff.
That’s the reason that Don Kohn was mentioning that.
MR.
POOLE.
And that’s still very important, so let’s leave it.
MR.
MCTEER.
The sunsetting didn’t affect the legality?
MR.
MATTINGLY.
It’s not required.
MR.
KOHN.
No, it wasn’t even required by law before.
By law the only thing that was required was monetary aggregate targets.
And this was appended to those targets partly because the Committee was supposed to say how the monetary aggregate targets lined up with the Administration’s economic forecast.
So this was a way of working around that as well.
The only thing in the law right now is that we are supposed to give some sense of likely future developments.
MR.
OLSON.
I think the wording is a discussion of “prospects.” MR. KOHN.
Right, “prospects.” MR. OLSON.
The memo mentions the question of whether or not an MPR without a forecast would comply with the law.
That’s an open question.
MR.
REINHART.
It was an open question because the Committee had established a precedent and they interpreted “prospects” to mean these forecast numbers.
But the issue isn’t whether you will be sued;
it’s whether you’ll get a worse outcome when the Congress pushes back.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Let me close this because we want to get on to something else.
It strikes me that the sense of the group is retaining the status quo in terms of this last question.
We have a long history of doing forecasts.
I’m not sure that we’d be better served by not doing January 27-28, 200488 of 238them.
There may be some room to do some tinkering on the edges, and the staff will do a survey on the three or four or five ideas that have come up here.
I think that’s it.
I thank you all for a productive discussion.
I got through a number of semi-brilliant conclusions!
[Laughter] MR. MCTEER.
Somewhat brilliant.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Thanks to the chairman of our working group who obviously came out exactly where he wanted!
[Laughter] MR. FERGUSON.
No comment.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
We have time to hear Dino Kos.
Dino.
MR.
KOS.3 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In the interest of getting everybody out of here quickly, I’ll read even faster than usual today.
If the marketplace is designed to frustrate the majority by moving against conventional wisdom and
—more importantly
—the positions of most market participants, the fixed-income market during this period can be labeled as exhibit A. Although most dealers and investors waited and were positioned for interest rates to rise, their expectations were frustrated.
Foreign exchange traders, on the other hand, experienced the opposite sensation.
They expected the dollar to depreciate further, and their hopes were fulfilled.
<START>At times it seemed that the frustration of one group and the gratification of the other were linked by the intervention of foreign central banks and their subsequent investment of dollar accumulations, but I’ll say more on that later.<END>
The top panel on page 1 graphs the three-month cash rate in the solid red line and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed red lines.
Forward rates fluctuated in a band pushed up by mostly strong data, positive corporate earnings, and expectations that GDP growth would moderate to a healthy 4 to 5 percent rate in Q4 and continue into 2004.
However, forward rates were pushed down by two factors.
First, two consecutive weak employment reports offset other positive data.
Second, comments by a number of Committee members that rates would not rise anytime soon led to short-covering rallies and brought forward rates back down.
The same set of factors affected government bond yields.
In their hearts, market participants wanted yields to go up.
Forecasts for GDP suggested growth above 4 percent and maybe even above 5 percent, and the market increasingly talked about the timing of the first policy tightening.
And corporate results in many cases surprised to the upside, suggesting a turn in the profit cycle.
Also, there was the rise in commodity prices and the fall of the dollar, both of which might have inflationary implications.
3 The materials used by Mr. Kos are appended to this transcript (appendix 3).
January 27-28, 200489 of 238So why didn’t yields rise?
Among the reasons offered were the following:
First, the comments by Committee members emphasizing that short rates would stay low.
Second, January’s weak employment report, which came as a surprise to many.
Third, the already rather steep yield curve;
the 3 percent differential between the funds rate and the yield on the ten-year bond is historically wide, and further steepening probably would bring in new investors to take advantage of the carry.
<START>Fourth, real yields as measured by a simple difference between, say, the nominal ten-year note and current inflation measures are within historical norms and don’t necessarily suggest that bonds are overvalued.<END>
Finally, and this is a subject that has received substantial airplay recently, Asian central banks are recycling the proceeds of interventions aimed at keeping their currencies from appreciating and are buying in large volume in the U.S.
markets.
<START>While none of these explanations by themselves is convincing, taken together they may begin to help explain the price action.<END>
With Treasury yields trapped in a range and corporate credit quality improving, spreads continued to narrow across most credit categories.
The two bottom panels on page 1 show the narrowing of investment-grade spreads on the left and of high-yield and emerging-market spreads on the right.
The latter have narrowed despite ongoing warnings from emerging-market strategists that spreads have overshot to the downside.
I should mention that volatilities for most asset markets are also on the low side.
The VIX equity volatility index is below 15 percent for the first time since 1996.
As shown on the top of page 2, the dollar continued to depreciate against most floating currencies, as concerns about the cost of financing the current account deficit continued to occupy the market.
Early in January, Governor Bernanke’s comments about both the dollar and the outlook for interest rates emboldened dollar shorts.
The euro hit a lifetime high of $1.29 early on January 12 before President Trichet of the ECB
—in his press conference after the G-10 governors’ meeting at the BIS
—protested against what he called the “brutal” moves of the exchange market.
The dollar recovered after those comments, but this morning the euro was rising again to above $1.26.
One of the reasons given for the dollar’s strength during the late 1990s was that asset returns in the United States were higher than those available elsewhere.
That is no longer the case when taking into account moves of both asset prices and foreign exchange rates.
The middle panel depicts equity market returns
—expressed in local currency terms in the gray bars
—for the Nasdaq, the S&P 500, the DJ Euro Stoxx, and the Nikkei since January 1, 2003.
All did well on that basis.
However, the returns of a euro- or yen-based investor were trimmed substantially, when exchange rate fluctuations are taken into account.
So while the S&P has appreciated about 30 percent in dollar terms over that span, the appreciation for a euro-based investor is about one-third of that.
Similarly a U.S.
dollar-based investor would have done better investing overseas, given the currency kicker.
<START>The Nasdaq was something of an exception in that its returns were high regardless of the currency base, though that was after three difficult preceding years.<END>
The other factor that has worked against the dollar in most cases
—with the exception of Japan
—is interest rate differentials.
Short-term differentials shown in the bottom left panel and long-term January 27-28, 200490 of 238differentials shown on the right both favor other currencies, which have had the advantage of offering higher yields and appreciating currencies.
And those foreign inflows that have moved into U.S.
fixed-income paper are more likely to be hedged by selling dollars.
That may be another factor that helps explain the seeming paradox between strong asset markets and a depreciating currency.
The focus on central bank activity has been most acute with respect to the yen and renminbi exchange rates, though we have less information about the latter.
The top panel of page 3 graphs the dollar–yen exchange rate since August.
As the yen has appreciated, the pace of Japanese intervention has accelerated, with the notable exception of the pause in operations at the time of the Dubai G-7 meeting in September.
During the intermeeting period the Japanese purchased another $80 billion.
The middle panel updates a graph I showed a few meetings ago.
During calendar 2003, Japan acquired a bit more than $180 billion
—triple its previous high in 1999.
In just the first four weeks of the year they are on pace to far exceed last year’s Herculean effort.
The bottom left panel graphs cumulative purchases of Treasury notes and bills for 2003 through November (the last available data point) from the Treasury’s TIC data.
In general, this confirms anecdotal commentary that official capital flows are making up an increasing portion of the financing of our deficits.
The bottom right panel graphs increases in the New York Fed’s custodial holdings of Treasuries in green on the left scale and of agencies in blue on the right scale
—both of which continue to grow.
The scale of these purchases must have some impact on the yield curve, though the magnitude is difficult to estimate, especially given other factors that are at play.
Although the focus of global markets was mostly on the dollar and U.S.
markets, the European and Japanese markets had their own excitement at times.
The top panel on page 4 depicts the three-month euro deposit rate in the solid green line, and the three-month deposit rate three, six, and nine months forward in the dashed green lines.
The sine curve pattern observed in the forward rates mirrors to some degree the pattern of U.S.
rates.
The downward trend over the past six weeks is also due in part to the strength of the euro.
As the euro appreciated, the market first priced out a possible tightening in the middle of next year, and now market participants are increasingly talking about a possible ease to counteract the currency’s strength.
As can be seen in the middle panel, the Japanese yield curve actually has not changed much since the last meeting.
But it is up substantially since last year at this time and is much higher than it was last June when the ten-year JGB yield bottomed out at about 42 basis points.
While some credit goes to technical factors, most ascribe the rise in yields to an improving economy and a more activist approach by the authorities.
Equity markets have risen in line with global shares.
The bottom panel graphs the broad Topix index along with the bank and electronics sub-indexes.
<START>The electronics sector is one of the main exporting groups, and the interesting point here is how close its sub-index tracks the overall index despite the strength of the yen.<END>
Whatever the restraining effect of the appreciating yen, it is being offset
—in the market’s eyes at least
—by other factors such as increased activity both in Japan and elsewhere.
Japanese banks had a terrible spring, as investors worried about the FSA’s January 27-28, 200491 of 238approach to the financial sector and prices of bank shares slumped.
But with the bailout of Resona Bank, the improving economic outlook, and the write-offs taken by most of the major banks since then, bank equity shares have risen sharply.
They have handily outperformed the index, although yesterday they did sell off after it became known that one major bank was being inspected for possibly dressing up its loan ratings.
Mr. Chairman, in the fed funds market the year-end came and went calmly with no unusual pressures to report.
There were no foreign operations.
I will need a vote to approve domestic operations.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Does the failure of banks to window-dress have anything to do with the Freddie Mac fiasco or any of the other related manipulations by banks?
MR.
KOS.
I don’t know the details, but there was apparently some discrepancy between the way the loans were classified and the way they were actually performing.
But that’s something I understand the FSA will be looking into.
More details to come, I’m sure.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Questions for Dino?
If not, Governor Ferguson.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I move approval of the domestic operations.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Thank you.
Without objection, they are approved.
We are adjourned until 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow.
[Meeting recessed] January 27-28, 200492 of 238January 28
—Morning Session CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Good morning, everyone.
David, do you want to go over this material that was just distributed?
MR.
STOCKTON.
I think Larry was planning on talking about it.
MR.
SLIFMAN.4CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The first quarter is going to have an upward revision?
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
We have distributed to you an extra sheet that has the latest information from this morning’s release on the orders and shipments data.
The lines that we typically like to look at are the orders excluding aircraft, shown part way down the table, and the “all other” category which encompasses roughly two-thirds of the total.
The orders numbers, particularly for the “all other” category, look pretty good to us and would imply perhaps a small upward revision to the fourth quarter.
The shipments numbers, shown a little further down on the page, also indicate some positives in the two categories
—ex aircraft and “all other”
—but it turns out that there were some downward revisions to the preceding months.
So on net, we actually would wind up cutting our Q4 number by just a small amount.
On balance, we think the changes in the two series would be about offsetting, and in our opinion the outlook for business spending remains quite strong.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
We’ll have an upward revision to Q1 and probably a downward revision to Q4.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Let me ask something further.
A problem in this survey is the very peculiar movement of unfilled orders for communications equipment.
You may recall
—I’m not sure what month it was but probably October
—that there was an extraordinary rise in unfilled orders, and it looked idiosyncratic.
I gather that when we checked with the 4 The materials used by Mr. Slifman are appended to this transcript (appendix 4).
January 27-28, 200493 of 238Bureau of the Census they indicated that there were some flaky numbers for unfilled orders.
Some communications equipment manufacturers didn’t think those numbers were real, and they now apparently are being written off.
If you remember, new orders are calculated as shipments plus the increase in unfilled orders, so we are getting a very sharp decline in communications equipment, and that is holding down the figures for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft.
But if you take out the communications equipment peculiarity, the report is a lot better than it appears on the surface, as Larry just indicated.
I would say it is a wash.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
Well, the one other thing that I would note, as we pointed out in the Greenbook as well, is that the level of new orders has been running above the level of shipments, implying an increase in unfilled orders for some time now for the “all other” category.
So, again, we take that to be a favorable sign.
Shall we get started with the chart show now?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Please.
MR.
SLIFMAN.5 For the chart show, Sandy Struckmeyer, Steve Kamin, and I will be referring to the packet of materials that was distributed to you.
<START>While putting together the Greenbook, two of the questions we asked ourselves were, first, “Where is the economy now?” and, second, “What are the forces that should sustain above-potential growth over the next two years?” With regard to what is sometimes called “forecasting the present,” your first exhibit shows a variety of indicators that have informed our judgments.<END>
The top left panel plots average monthly changes in private payrolls.
Like most observers, we were disappointed by the payroll employment report for December.
However, that reading came on the heels of more-favorable reports for the preceding two months.
Averaging through the monthly ups and downs, as I’ve done in the bars on your chart, you can see that, after a protracted period of job losses, employment has been on an uptrend since midyear, albeit a weaker one than is typical for this stage of the business cycle.
In contrast to the payroll numbers, most indicators of final demand have been quite favorable.
Sales of autos and light trucks (the top right panel) and other consumer goods (the middle left panel) point to continued strength of household demand, while the orders and shipments figures (the middle right panel), which here are plotted only through November, tell a similar story for business demand.
And as I 5 The materials used by Messrs. Slifman, Struckmeyer, and Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).
January 27-28, 200494 of 238mentioned earlier, this morning’s orders and shipments release provided further confirmation of an ongoing pickup in business spending.
<START>Thus, in putting together our near-term GDP forecast, we once again were faced with a tension between lackluster payroll employment numbers and pretty stellar incoming data for final sales and production.<END>
And, once again, we’ve resolved that tension by writing down sizable increases in productivity (the bottom left panel).
Sandy will be discussing productivity in greater detail later.
The table at the bottom right adds it all up.
We now estimate that real GDP grew at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2003 and will expand at a 5 percent pace in the current quarter.
The bulk of the increase in GDP over this two-quarter period comes from robust gains in final sales;
but with stock–sales ratios so low, inventory investment is expected to make a noticeable contribution as well.
Let me note that this exhibit reflects the figures that were in the Greenbook
—before we got the data on shipments and orders this morning.
So perhaps we might take a tenth or two off Q4 and add a tenth or two to Q1.
Turning to the outlook for the next two years, the subject of exhibit 2, the question is, “Will the current rapid growth be sustained and why?” As you can see from the top panel, we think that economic growth will be sustained at rates faster than potential through the end of 2005.
The remaining panels highlight some of the key contributing forces.
Fiscal policy has been quite expansionary in recent years, and as can be seen in the middle left panel, we expect it to provide additional impetus to growth through the end of this year.
However, on our assumptions, fiscal policy swings to slight restraint in 2005 as the partial-expensing provision expires and the growth of defense spending slows.
Monetary policy also has been quite supportive of growth over the past few years.
And with the funds rates projected to remain relatively low over the forecast period, it will continue to be so.
Another factor with favorable implications for growth is the ongoing strength of productivity gains, which should influence household perceptions of permanent income and business perceptions of profitability.
Given the surge of earnings lately, firms have been able to finance their desired spending while keeping a tight lid on their borrowing.
Indeed, as shown in the bottom left panel, debt ratios have fallen sharply in recent years and are now either at or near the lowest levels in the past two decades.
With the marked improvement in business financial conditions, risk spreads
—as Dino noted yesterday
—have dropped dramatically on both investment-grade and junk bonds.
Returning to the top right panel, the stock market is assumed to rise at a 6¼ percent annual rate over the projection period
—maintaining risk-adjusted parity with the projected yield on long-term Treasury securities.
In our forecast, we see the higher stock market as providing some support to household spending after several years in which it was a considerable drag.
Your next exhibit focuses in greater detail on the household sector.
Personal income (the dark bars in the top left panel) is expected to rise smartly over the next two years, supported in part, as I mentioned earlier, by the strength of productivity.
The strong income growth provides a considerable lift to consumption outlays (the January 27-28, 200495 of 238yellow bars).
In addition, last year’s tax cut continues to boost spending in 2004.
The top right panel shows the implications of the PCE and income projections for the saving rate.
<START>As indicated by the thick line, the BEA currently estimates that the saving rate was only 2.3 percent in the third quarter of last year, and we think it fell another ½ percentage point in the fourth quarter.<END>
In our forecast, the saving rate climbs about a percentage point over the projection period.
One risk to the household sector forecast is that the saving rate might rise more than we have allowed for in the baseline.
The bullets in the middle panel present our thinking on this issue.
The first thing to note is that the BEA, in effect, shifted the goal posts in its most recent comprehensive revision, by taking the level of the saving rate down on average over the past decade about a percentage point.
This suggested to us that we ought to revise down our thinking about what constitutes a “normal” or “target” saving rate by a like amount.
Considerable econometric work suggested the same.
That said, the current saving rate still is well below the level that many observers often think of as a more normal rate.
It’s important to keep in mind, however, that the target saving rate is a moving target.
It varies over time as the fundamental determinants, such as the wealth–income ratio, the composition of income, and real interest rates, change.
Indeed, we read the current settings of those fundamentals as pointing to a target saving rate for the next year or two in the neighborhood of 3 percent.
In our projection, the saving rate rises to 2.8 percent by the fourth quarter of 2005, eliminating the bulk
—but not all
—of the gap between actual and target saving.
We’re not sure what accounts for the gap that we’re seeing currently, but departures from our saving models of this magnitude are not unusual.
Historically, disequilibriums like this have been worked off fairly gradually, but a more sudden and complete adjustment, and a consequent drag on aggregate demand, certainly is a risk.
The forecast for housing starts is presented in the bottom left panel.
<START>The pace of homebuilding, fueled by low mortgage rates and robust income growth, is anticipated to remain strong over the projection period, edging down only a bit from the current elevated pace as mortgage rates drift up a bit.<END>
The bottom right panel shows our projection of house prices.
In our forecast, house prices slow from the 7 to 8 percent gains posted in recent years, to about 2½ percent during 2005.
The downtilt primarily reflects the current disparity between rapid house-price inflation and much smaller increases in the data for rents.
The econometric evidence suggests that such a disparity typically is closed by house-price increases moving into alignment with rents.
Of course, there is a wide band of uncertainty around this forecast, which imparts a wide band of uncertainty
—both upside and downside
—to movements in household net worth over the next two years, with consequent implications for household spending.
Turning to the business sector, exhibit 4, we expect real outlays for equipment and software
—both the high-tech component and the “other” component
—to rise rapidly this year, spurred in part by the temporary tax incentive.
Indeed, the partial-expensing provision adds about 2½ percentage points to overall E&S growth this year January 27-28, 200496 of 238and subtracts close to 6 percentage points next year.
The basic contour of the forecast is consistent with the information given recently to the Reserve Banks by businesses in their Districts.
As shown in the middle left panel, slightly more than half of the respondents plan to boost their capital spending in 2004
—the responses are appreciably more upbeat than those in June.
Although the usual accelerator effects were the primary reason given for the improvement, a sizable fraction of respondents also pointed to replacement needs as an important consideration.
Moreover, partial expensing finally appears to be on the radar screens of at least some firms.
<START>A quarter of the respondents also cited improved cash flow or balance sheet positions, reflecting no doubt strong profits and, presumably, the expected profitability of new investments.<END>
As shown to the right, in our forecast the profit share continues to rise through mid-2004 before drifting down as labor costs accelerate and competition puts pressure on margins.
Nonetheless, even through the end of next year, profits are still elevated by historical standards.
An important element of our capital spending forecast is strong demand for computers.
In part, our forecast for computer spending has been informed by the projections of industry analysts for unit sales of PCs
—both so-called desktop boxes (which typically sit on the floor) and laptops (which often sit on desks).
[Laughter] The bottom left panel shows one such forecast from a leading consulting group.
As you can see, unit sales are expected to rise sharply throughout the projection period, driven by the need to replace machines that have become physically or technologically obsolete.
After adding in the effects of quality change, these unit sales translate into real spending increases on the order of 40 percent annually over the next two years
—roughly in line with the increases posted during the second half of the 1990s.
One concern that has been raised in many circles is the implication for the domestic economy of outsourcing computer production
—that is, whether today’s boxes contain considerably less domestic content than the boxes sold a few years ago.
The bottom right panel addresses this question.
It uses cost shares to measure the domestic content of PCs sold in the United States.
Most of the domestic value-added in a PC is for the micro-processing unit
—the Pentium or similar chip that lies at the heart of our PCs.
This is shown by the black shaded portion of the bars;
smaller contributions come from the production of specialized chips that provide basic logic or act like traffic managers inside your PC and, to a lesser extent, from integration and final shipment.
The bulk of the foreign value-added is for such things as printed circuit boards, storage devices, and peripherals.
The point is that the United States is still the world leader in designing leading-edge chips (a very high value-added activity) and fabricating them (also a high value-added activity).
As a result, the domestic content of PCs has changed relatively little over the past few years.
Accordingly, the sharp rise in PC sales that we are forecasting should translate into domestic production at about the same rate as in recent years.
Steve will now turn the discussion from domestic content to foreign content.
MR.
KAMIN.
Your first international exhibit presents an overview of developments in selected international financial markets.
As can be seen in the top left panel, a key development over the past half-year has been the renewed slide in the January 27-28, 200497 of 238foreign exchange value of the dollar.
The decline in the broad dollar (the black line) was due entirely to depreciation against the major currencies (the red line).
The dollar fell to record lows against the euro (the black line on the right) but also fell substantially against the pound (the magenta line) and the yen (the blue line) as well as all the other major currencies.
In contrast, since last summer the dollar has held its ground against the currencies of our other important trading partners, depicted by the blue line in the left panel.
The dollar appreciated against the Mexican peso, while developing Asian governments generally continued to resist appreciation of the currencies, as indicated by the stability of the Korean won.
The other key development in international financial markets since your last chart show has been the response to expectations of rising economic growth.
As indicated in your middle left panel, movements in long-term bond yields in major foreign economies have mirrored the rise in U.S.
yields since last summer, as well as their recent slight decline.
Stock prices, on the right, extended their second-quarter rebound through the end of the year, both in industrial countries and in emerging markets.
As shown in the bottom left panel, another indicator of improving confidence, yield spreads for both emerging-market countries and industrial-country corporate borrowers, continued to move down last year.
<START>With EMBI+ spreads now at their lowest level since before the Russia crisis in 1998, some concerns have been raised that borrowing conditions have become too easy, raising the possibility of future financial crises.<END>
<START>However, as shown on the right, gross capital flows to emerging-market countries remain well below their 1997 peaks, even as cross-border debt issuance by industrial economies has continued to grow.<END>
Your next exhibit describes the recent and projected recovery of global economic growth.
As indicated in the first row of the top left panel, our trade-weighted aggregate of foreign real GDP, after languishing in the first half of 2003, is estimated to have accelerated to a pace of nearly 4 percent in the second half.
With monetary and fiscal conditions in most economies remaining accommodative, the global high-tech sector on the rebound, and U.S.
growth projected to remain strong, we see foreign real GDP growth remaining brisk through 2004 before slowing a bit next year.
This growth should gradually reduce the extent of economic slack abroad.
It should also support continued expansion of international trade;
as shown in the top right panel, the rebound in world exports over the past two years has mirrored the turnaround in global industrial production.
As indicated in the middle left panel, the acceleration in economic activity has also contributed, along with the decline in the dollar and other developments, to rebounds in oil prices (the black line) and other commodity prices (the red line).
Going forward, oil prices are projected to decline over the next two years, in line with quotes from futures markets, as increasing supplies of Iraqi and non-OPEC oil become available, while nonfuel commodity prices level off.
<START>With commodity prices stabilizing and excess capacity projected to diminish only gradually, inflation rates, shown on the right, are expected to continue moving down in Latin America and to remain subdued in the industrial countries and developing Asia.<END>
January 27-28, 200498 of 238Returning to the top left panel of your exhibit, the second row indicates that the foreign industrial countries are expected to share in the global economic rebound, but at a slower pace than the world economy as a whole.
Industrial country growth is expected to register just under 3 percent this year and next, and the path of euro-area growth (line 3) is expected to be lower still.
As shown by the red line in the bottom left panel, industrial production in the euro area has moved up since the middle of last year, while the rise in business sentiment indicators such as the German Ifo survey (the black line) point to further strengthening.
<START>Going forward, the euro-area economy will likely benefit from the rebound in global growth and from continued low interest rates;<END>
however, it faces headwinds in the form of an appreciating currency and some move toward fiscal restraint.
In Japan (line 4 in the top left panel) GDP growth is expected to slow a bit in the next two years from the 2½ percent pace registered in the second half of 2003, notwithstanding the additional quantitative monetary easing announced by the Bank of Japan last week.
As shown in the bottom right panel, available indicators suggest the economy is unlikely to fall back into recession.
Machinery orders have moved up on balance in recent months while unemployment is edging down.
Still, unemployment rates remain high by historical standards and are likely to restrain future consumption.
Moreover, much of Japan’s growth in recent quarters has been due to buoyant exports to developing Asia;
<START>with growth in this region slated to slow from its brisk second-half rebound, and with the yen having strengthened recently, the stimulus from exports and export-related investment will likely diminish.<END>
The outlook for the emerging-market economies is described in your next exhibit.
As indicated in line 1 of the top left panel, real GDP growth for these countries rebounded at a 6.1 percent annual rate in the second half of last year and is projected to grow at still brisk rates over the next two years.
The rebound in growth since last summer was due almost entirely to developing Asia (line 2), which grew at a blistering 11 percent pace in the second half after contracting slightly in the first half.
<START>This rebound in part reflected the recovery of retail sales, tourism, and confidence from the SARS epidemic.<END>
The rebound was also due to the continued recovery of the global high-tech sector;
as shown in the top right panel, industrial production in many developing Asian countries has tracked the recovery in the global semiconductor industry.
<START>Finally, developing Asian growth has been boosted by buoyant domestic demand in China, including substantial state sector investment.<END>
As shown in the middle left panel, rising demand has helped to push consumer price inflation into positive territory
—although much of the rise reflects higher food prices
—and has also pushed down China’s trade surplus a bit.
<START>As shown on the right, exports of developing Asian economies to China (the red line) have soared, even as exports to the United States and Europe have been much weaker.<END>
While much of the increased exports to China are being drawn in by higher domestic demand, many of these goods are being further processed and re-exported to third markets.
This reorientation of the region’s trade along more vertically integrated lines is evidenced in the bottom left panel, which shows that the recent growth of U.S.
imports from Asia is accounted for exclusively by higher purchases from China.
January 27-28, 200499 of 238In contrast to developing Asia, the recovery of growth in Latin America (line 5 in the top left panel) has been tentative.
This is due in large part to lackluster performance in Mexico (line 6).
As indicated in the bottom right panel, since mid-2003, Mexican exports (the blue line) have recovered in tandem with U.S.
industrial production (the black line).
However, Mexican industrial production (the red line) has only recently turned up.
The earlier weakness in Mexican production likely reflected runoffs of inventories, and with U.S.
demand growth expected to remain strong over the forecast period, we are projecting a rebound in Mexican growth going forward.
Nevertheless, several factors, including the failure of Mexico’s government to make progress on tax and energy-sector reforms, point to vulnerabilities in the economy’s performance.
Your next exhibit addresses the outlook for the U.S.
external sector.
As indicated in the top left panel, both U.S.
<START>export growth (the blue bars) and import growth (the red bars) were quite weak in the first half of 2003 but picked up substantially in the second half.<END>
This pattern reflects the recovery of GDP growth, shown at the right, with U.S.
<START>growth (the red bars) and foreign GDP (the blue bars) both rebounding from their subdued first-half performance.<END>
Going forward, continued rapid GDP growth here and abroad is expected to keep both exports and imports expanding briskly.
I should note that, while beef exports fall nearly to zero for most of this year as a consequence of import bans prompted by mad cow disease, this should have only a very small effect on aggregate export sales.
Because U.S.
growth is projected to exceed foreign growth and because the responsiveness of U.S.
imports to income is believed to exceed that of U.S.
exports to foreign income, the growth of imports would be expected to exceed that of exports, all else being equal.
However, lagged effects of the past depreciation of the dollar, shown in the middle left panel, as well as effects of mild projected future depreciation are expected to buoy exports and restrain imports going forward.
In consequence, the growth of exports is projected to exceed that of imports in 2004 and 2005.
Nevertheless, because imports are substantially greater than exports, imports rise in absolute amount by more than exports over the forecast period.
This leads to a further widening of the current account deficit, shown as the black line in the middle right panel.
Owing to growth in the U.S.
economy, the deficit as a percent of GDP, shown as the red line, narrows slightly over the next two years.
Returning to the middle left panel, our forecast of a modest further depreciation of the dollar is based on the view that the widening U.S.
current account deficit and the need to finance it will continue to weigh on the dollar.
Nevertheless, the timing and magnitude of any future additional decline is obviously quite uncertain.
The bottom panel of your exhibit breaks down the recent financing of the current account, shown on line 1.
Notably, the share of the financing coming from official sources (line 2) has stepped up considerably over the past year, reaching about $250 billion at an annual rate in the first two months of the fourth quarter.
Conversely, net private capital flows (line 3) have moved down.
Foreign purchases of U.S.
securities (line 4) declined from $418 billion at an annual rate in the first half of 2003 to a little over January 27-28, 2004100 of 238$300 billion in the first two months of the fourth quarter.
Interpreting these data is complicated, however, as purchases in September and October were extremely weak, whereas they bounced back in November.
<START>Data on foreign direct investment in the United States (line 6) are available only through the third quarter of last year, but these inflows also show a decline from 2003:<END>
H1.
Conversely, U.S.
purchases of foreign securities (line 5) and U.S.
direct investment abroad (line 7) appear to have held up well in the second half of last year.
These data suggest that official purchases of dollars increasingly are substituting for private capital inflows in financing the U.S.
current account deficit and, as such, may be preventing the dollar from moving down more rapidly than would otherwise be the case.
Your final exhibit explores some alternative scenarios for the dollar.
As indicated by the black line in the top panel, the broad real dollar, though down considerably from its peak in early 2002, is still well above its trough in the 1990s.
Particularly given the widening external deficit, a steeper decline in the dollar than our baseline projection is a distinct possibility.
However, the implications for the U.S.
and foreign economies will depend upon the circumstances in which this decline takes place.
The middle left panel details several alternative simulations of the staff’s model.
<START>In the first scenario, indicated by the solid red line, the fall in the dollar is triggered by higher-than-expected foreign GDP growth.<END>
Such higher growth might plausibly be due to the long-awaited rise in productivity growth among foreign industrial countries, for example, or to a pickup of investment and consumption in developing Asia.
Specifically, this scenario combines a shock to the risk premium on U.S.
assets, which would lead to a 10 percent decline in the dollar in the absence of changes in monetary policy, with a shock to foreign domestic demand equal to 1 percent of GDP in 2004 and an additional 2 percent of GDP in 2005.
This combination of higher foreign growth, indicated by the red line in the bottom left panel, and the lower dollar leads to an improvement in the U.S.
current account balance, the bottom right panel, and a rise in U.S.
growth of about ½ percentage point, the middle right.
<START>The second dollar depreciation scenario is a so-called disorderly correction<END>
—that is, a rapid fall in the dollar that engenders a steep falloff in U.S.
bond and equity prices as well.
It is not clear how plausible this scenario is.
The fall in the dollar since early 2002 has not disrupted financial markets, nor did it do so during the dollar’s previous correction in the 1980s.
Nevertheless, this scenario arises frequently in financial press commentary on the dollar.
So to explore its effects, we assumed the same shock to the dollar as in scenario 1 but added shocks to risk premiums in other asset markets that lower U.S.
stock prices about 12 percent and raise long-term bond yields 50 basis points.
The combined effect of these shocks is to leave U.S.
growth (the dashed red line in the middle right panel) down only a little from its baseline path, as the adverse effects of higher interest rates and lower stock prices are offset by the stimulative effect of the dollar’s decline on net exports.
<START>However, foreign growth is lowered about ½ percentage point below baseline, reflecting both the appreciation of their currencies and lower U.S.<END>
growth.
January 27-28, 2004101 of 238Finally, while we view the risks to the dollar to be weighted toward the downside, we cannot preclude the possibility that the dollar may rise above its projected path over the next several quarters.
Our projection of U.S.
real GDP growth exceeds that of most private forecasters, and as the market’s assessment of U.S.
growth and associated rates of return is adjusted upward, the dollar may be boosted as well.
The blue dashed lines in your exhibit trace out the effects of such a shock.
While foreign growth is boosted above its baseline path, U.S.
<START>growth is restrained a bit, and the current account deficit widens.<END>
To sum up, considerable uncertainty surrounds both future movements of the dollar and the circumstances under which such movements might occur.
At the risk of saying something you may have heard here before, this makes the outlook for the U.S.
external sector particularly difficult to pin down at the present time.
[Laughter] Sandy will now continue our presentation.
MR.
STRUCKMEYER.
Your next exhibit discusses key trends in the labor market.
As Larry noted in his first chart, until very recently, payroll employment has been notably weak in this expansion.
<START>As shown by the blue line in the top left panel, gains in payroll employment have run well below the typical postwar cyclical experience and have now diverged even from those in the jobless recovery of the early 1990s.<END>
<START>Of course, the flip side of the lack of employment growth has been the spectacular increases in labor productivity in recent years.<END>
In putting together our forecast, we have again reassessed our outlook for the supply side of the economy in light of these latest developments.
<START>With the comprehensive revision to the national income and product accounts not changing the underlying picture of productivity growth in the past few years, and with the gains in payroll employment remaining on the anemic side, we have raised our estimates of structural productivity.<END>
As indicated in the top right panel, we now estimate that structural multifactor productivity increased almost 3 percent last year, as businesses met increases in demand by better management of their existing capital and labor resources.
We don’t think increases in structural MFP of last year’s magnitude are likely to persist, but we have boosted our projections for the growth of structural MFP this year and next.
Even with these revisions, the estimated level of actual productivity (shown in the middle left panel) lies above its structural trend.
We expect actual productivity to run about parallel to the trend early in 2004, resulting in continued modest gains in payrolls (the middle right).
But with businesses becoming more optimistic about sales prospects, we anticipate that hiring will pick up, bringing the level of actual productivity back into line with the estimated structural trend in 2005.
Returning to the top left panel, you can see by comparing the slopes of the three lines that, once hiring picks up in earnest, employment grows at about the same rate as in preceding business cycles.
<START>Despite the lack of gains in the payroll survey of employment, household employment has increased, and the unemployment rate (the black line in the bottom left panel) has fallen.<END>
<START>I should note that, although it has outpaced the payroll survey measure, growth in household employment in this expansion also has been weak relative to its normal cyclical pattern.<END>
Moreover, with the labor market perceived to January 27-28, 2004102 of 238have little vitality, the labor force participation rate (the red line) has moved lower, on net, over the past four years.
As is illustrated in the bottom right panel, this pattern seems consistent with past cyclical movements in participation about its estimated trend, and we are anticipating some upward movement in participation in the not-too-distant future in response to the past and prospective firming in economic activity.
<START>However, such an increase in the participation rate still remains a forecast, and we clearly cannot rule out the possibility that further declines in participation will result in a more rapid decline in the unemployment rate than we are projecting in the January Greenbook forecast.<END>
Your next exhibit presents our current projections of potential GDP.
As can be seen by comparing lines 1 and 3, we did not raise our estimates of potential by as much as our estimates of structural productivity.
This reflects three key considerations.
First, post-revision rates of wage and price inflation seemed consistent with our earlier estimates of resource gaps.
Second, our model of Okun’s law, shown in the middle panel, remained solidly on track after the comprehensive revision.
<START>Third, based on the persistent differences in the growth of hours worked in the household and payroll surveys, we reduced the so-called technical factor (shown on line 6) that accounts for the differences in the trend growth of hours in the household and payroll surveys.<END>
As can be seen in the bottom panel, the resultant forecast of the GDP gap is little different from the December Greenbook.
And we continue to project the elimination of slack in both product and labor markets by the end of next year.
Your next exhibit presents recent data on inflation.
After an energy-related bulge at the beginning of 2003, consumer prices
—as measured by either the CPI or the PCE price index
—slowed significantly, on net, over the remainder of the year.
There also was a broad-based slowing in measures of core consumer price inflation (the top right panel) to a pace of about 1 percent.
In contrast, as shown in the middle left panel, food prices accelerated over the course of last year.
<START>The pickup was related to stronger foreign and domestic demand for beef as well as to some delays in the supply response to higher prices.<END>
The middle right panel illustrates how this excess demand bid up the prices of live cattle until the discovery of mad cow disease in the United States in late December (shown as the vertical line in the panel).
After a few days of significant declines, spot cattle prices stabilized at their levels of last summer and then ticked back up a bit.
Futures prices suggest some downward pressure on spot prices in the first half of this year.
As far as labor costs are concerned, we will get the ECI for the fourth quarter on Thursday.
Wage inflation, as measured by average hourly earnings in the bottom left, fell to a 2 percent pace in December, reflecting the slack in labor markets and relative stability in expected inflation, shown on the bottom right.
Your next exhibit outlines our outlook for inflation.
Overall PCE inflation is expected to slow to a 1 percent pace, on average, over the projection period.
<START>The decline from last year’s pace reflects smaller increases in food prices and renewed declines in energy prices.<END>
Core PCE prices also are projected to rise at about a January 27-28, 2004103 of 2381 percent pace
—a tad higher than last year.
<START>Although non-oil import prices are expected to give a slight boost to inflation this year, continued strong growth in structural productivity, stable inflation expectations, and some remaining slack in resource utilization are expected to keep core inflation contained.<END>
The middle right panel presents the outlook for ECI compensation per hour, which is projected to increase about 3¾ percent per year in 2004 and 2005
—a bit below the pace in 2003.
We expect the contribution from wages and salaries to fall slightly as the influence of labor market slack is almost offset by somewhat greater pass-through of productivity gains into wages.
Pressure from rising health insurance costs and a cyclical increase in bonuses is responsible for the rise in the contribution of benefit costs over the projection period.
The bottom two panels update our FRB/US-based estimates of the probability of deflation.
As you will recall, we have presented two definitions of deflation in the past.
<START>We defined “effective” deflation to be PCE price inflation of ½ percent or less.<END>
“Pernicious” deflation adds the additional requirement that the unemployment rate exceeds 6 percent.
As shown on the bottom right, although both probabilities have fallen significantly since your June 2003 meeting, they still remain nontrivial risks to the staff forecast.
<START>Finally, at the risk of inflicting further psychological trauma on the Chairman, the last exhibit presents your forecasts for 2004.<END>
[Laughter] The central tendency of your projections for real GDP is 4½ to 5 percent, which you forecast will result in a decline in the unemployment rate to between 5¼ and 5½ percent.
You project consumer price inflation to be little changed this year at a pace of 1 to 1¼ percent.
That concludes our report.
My colleagues and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Let me go sequentially in reverse.
First, a minor issue on chart 10.
You mentioned that the decline in the unemployment rate was held down by the rise in household employment.
My recollection is that the unemployment rate is a sample statistic, independent of the population number from which we measure household employment.
So that number would hold even if there were a downward revision in population.
In other words, if household employment is revised down, we will still have the same unemployment rate.
But the obvious issue is the participation rate, as I think you pointed out.
On the foreign economic outlook, in chart 6 in the top right panel, are these nominal U.S.
dollars on world exports?
MR.
KAMIN.
Yes, they are.
January 27-28, 2004104 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Shouldn’t they be in constant price SDRs?
I ask because, clearly if I were to convert these data into euros, which I could just as easily do, the exports would not show as much of an uptrend, though I assume they still would go up.
MR.
KAMIN.
They would most likely still go up, but I think you’re quite right.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
In other words, the decline you show here has exports going down with IP in 2001, which makes it look highly correlated.
Yet a goodly part of that is that IP is physical, and this is nominal;
but far more importantly, it’s a function of which exchange rate you quote the numbers in.
I’m merely indicating that I assume
—but I don’t know
—that if you use SDRs and constant prices, that wouldn’t do violence to the conclusion that you came to.
Is that right?
MR.
KAMIN.
That is very much the case.
I completely agree with you that the measure you are proposing probably would be superior.
The constant price data for all of these different countries, which we were getting from their national data sources, available.
were not Transforming it into SDRs is a very good idea and would be worthwhile.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Prices are not moving enough to make that much difference here.
They probably don’t do too much violence, but the exchange rate does.
MR.
KAMIN.
That is correct, and I think you’re quite right that transforming the data into SDRs would be useful.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Could you actually run it using SDRs?
I would be curious to see what it looks like.
MR.
KAMIN.
Absolutely.
That said, one of the issues we’ve been focusing on in our forecast of trade is the fact that trade does seem to be much more sensitive to industrial production than it does to GDP.
That’s in part because much of trade is composed of January 27-28, 2004105 of 238manufactured goods, which are more related to industrial production than to GDP as a whole.
So we think there are definitely a lot of fundamentals underlying this correlation.
But I believe you are quite right that the decline in the dollar has probably exaggerated the relationship presented in that chart.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Going back to chart 3
—prior to the NIPA revisions, the flow of funds saving rate using the NIPA definition and the saving rate as measured by actual NIPA disposable income minus consumer outlays were remarkably close, and the pattern of the gap between them wasn’t too bad.
We haven’t revised the flow of funds numbers, obviously;
but with the NIPA revisions, that gap has opened up a bit, and there is a little more discrepancy between the two.
What do we know at this stage, after all these years of looking at those two independent residual estimates of saving, to suggest which is likely to be more accurate?
MR.
SLIFMAN.
I don’t think we have a conclusion on that.
Accuracy has to be defined as relative to what?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Well, relative to the real world.
Let me put it this way:
In the real world, there is no discrepancy between the flow of funds saving rate and the NIPA saving rate.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
I understand, but I don’t have any third source of the real world against which to compare the other two.
<START>The one thing we can perhaps do is to ask ourselves which of the two measures, in terms of the econometrics, helps us best in transforming the data into an understanding of consumption behavior or household behavior.<END>
Once again, I don’t think there is a firm conclusion.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
We’ve tried both.
January 27-28, 2004106 of 238MR. SLIFMAN.
Yes, and we can’t definitively say which has won over the other.
In all of our work we stay with the NIPA measure because then we are working with a consistently measured system.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
There’s only one discrepancy.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
Right.
So that’s why we do all of our work using the NIPA data.
Obviously we do look at what’s happening to household balance sheets, and the flow of funds saving rate is a part of that household balance sheet system.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
But remember, you’re endeavoring to forecast the NIPA saving rate with the flow of funds household wealth data.
And household wealth data are obviously directly convertible into a saving rate.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
It’s the flow of funds saving rate.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
So when there is a discrepancy, as is now emerging, I assume that has some noise effect on the use of that particular system.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
Right.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Parry.
MR.
PARRY.
Thank you.
Sandy, I have a question about inflation related to the panel on the top right of chart 13.
If we were looking at this chart in quarterly terms, we would be seeing at the end of 2003 a rate of 0.5 percent
—that’s the number in the Greenbook
—and then it goes up to 1.0 percent in the first quarter of this year.
I know that in the Greenbook the recent softness was characterized as “likely temporary.” I just wondered if you could talk about that a bit because obviously, if it turns out to be less temporary, it would affect one’s assessment of the probability of deflation and so forth.
There wasn’t much said about why it is viewed as likely to be temporary.
January 27-28, 2004107 of 238MR. STRUCKMEYER.
As we looked at the consumer price data for November and December, we were surprised at the large decline in core prices in November.
In examining the detail, the declines were in some components for which we did not expect continued large price reductions.
<START>One of the categories in which we saw huge price declines in the fourth quarter was used cars, which was probably related to the price incentives on new cars.<END>
Those declines were big enough to matter for the actual total price indexes.
We looked at that, and we didn’t expect prices for used cars to bounce back up, but then again we didn’t think they would continue to go down at a double-digit pace either.
As we went through other categories, it seemed to us that in the last couple of months the prices for some particular categories were affected a lot by special circumstances.
<START>We saw that early in the year, too, when prices in certain categories moved up and then down or moved down and then back up again, and the three-month change in core inflation moved around a lot relative to the twelve-month change.<END>
I think we showed a chart in the pre-FOMC briefings several times last year depicting that pattern.
The two series are converging and are fairly close together
—the latest three-month change is a little below the twelve-month change
—so we do think that prices are a little low now and will probably move up a bit in coming months.
We aren’t talking about a big bounceback;
these are still monthly changes of around 0.1percent on core CPI.
That is just enough relative to what happened in November and December to have this measure tick up a bit relative to the fourth quarter.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Poole.
MR.
POOLE.
First, I want to thank Dave Stockton and Dave Wilcox for the memo they prepared in response to my request.
I thought it was very helpful.
Without going into it, I will say that I think it provides mild support for my position, but that’s another matter.
[Laughter] January 27-28, 2004108 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Are you going to let the rest of us in on at least the subject matter?
MR.
POOLE.
This was in response to my request that the Greenbook forecast be conditioned on the market’s federal funds rate assumption rather than the Greenbook assumption.
It’s a very good memo, and I think that it explores the issues in a very fine fashion.
I’ll just repeat my summary that I think it presents a case for my position.
I want to pursue that same issue in the context of the current period by thinking about where the economy is going to be at the time of our June meeting.
Let’s suppose that the Greenbook forecast comes true between now and then.
What we would be looking at in the June meeting is five months of data on payroll employment with gains averaging 200,000 a month.
That is a million more jobs
—5 x 200,000.
So we’d have a million more jobs, some depreciation of the dollar, and the prospect that by the end of the year the gap will be almost entirely closed.
Yet we have a forecast that is built on the assumption of no response in the federal funds rate before roughly a year from now.
Now, obviously, the market’s funds rate forecast has moved back and forth.
The December employment number itself made quite a difference in the market’s view.
But if we get a series of monthly increases in payroll employment averaging 200,000, quite frankly I find it hard to believe that the market is not going to be forecasting some policy response.
I think that scenario fits in nicely with the subject of the Stockton and Wilcox memorandum, and I would like you to respond to that.
MR.
STOCKTON.
President Poole, if we went back to June of last year and had this conversation, you would have said suppose we had forecast for the second half of the year what actually transpired.
If the story was 6 percent GDP growth in the second half of last year, do you January 27-28, 2004109 of 238think the markets would possibly have forecast us not to be tightening until late 2004?
That might have sounded far-fetched last June, but in fact that is exactly where we are right now.
There has been considerable convergence between our forecast and the market’s forecast.
I take that to be in part because market participants have been surprised as well at the apparent capacity of this economy to grow without generating significant pressures on resource utilization and without generating significant pressures on price inflation.
In fact, we view our forecast
—that we could get to the middle of this year without tightening
<START>—as not unreasonable because, if we see some pickup in payroll employment and continued strong growth, we’re still going to be looking at an inflation situation that looks incredibly benign.<END>
Despite the fact that the dollar has gone down, the pass-through of that into import prices has been relatively modest, as we discussed on Monday at the pre-FOMC briefing.
The indirect effects of the jump in energy prices that we’ve seen appear to us to be moderate, and they were quite modest previously.
We’re seeing very little sign of pressures on the labor cost side either in nominal compensation or in unit labor costs, obviously, with the strength in productivity.
So, we don’t think the funds rate path we have assumed is unreasonable;
and in essence, at this point the difference between our path and the market’s path is about 50 basis points by the end of 2005.
We think the market will continue to be surprised by a combination of strong growth in aggregate demand but with that being matched by considerable strength in aggregate supply.
We’re expecting a continuation of the kind of convergence that we’ve seen over the last six months in their expectations toward ours.
<START>Having said that, there’s tremendous uncertainty about how the markets will react to the data, whether or not our forecast will be right, or whether the market’s view of underlying economic developments will be correct.<END>
So, we feel pretty comfortable that we are putting on January 27-28, 2004110 of 238the table an outlook that is not far-fetched and in fact could be quite reasonable.
And I take the behavior of financial markets over the last six months as some small evidence in support of our position and approach.
MR.
POOLE.
If I may make a follow-up comment:
The issue to me is not so much who wins the horse race.
Obviously, we can point to particular cases where one approach is superior by looking at the statistical evidence you present.
In fact, in recent periods I believe the market forecast has been perhaps ever so slightly better but not significantly different.
For me that is not the issue.
It’s exactly what you just said
—that if we were to condition the Greenbook baseline on the market forecast, then it would display very clearly what is different in your view from the market expectation.
Let me also refer to another example, which was the beginning of the recession.
In that case the market was predicting declines in rates before you were.
If you had used the market view as your conditioning assumption for the forecast, you would have asked the question, Is the market detecting some weakness in the situation that we don’t see?
That was the key question at that time, just as the key question now is whether the market is picking up the possibility of either some inflationary pressure that we don’t see or a boom that is going to outrun what is currently our best guess regarding the economy’s performance.
It seems to me that using the market assumption would help us to focus on those very key questions.
MR.
STOCKTON.
Obviously, we are looking at those signals from the market and asking ourselves precisely those kinds of questions.
We are not ignoring that.
We think we have incorporated our best judgment as to what signals the markets are sending us.
It wasn’t that we weren’t paying attention to what the market was saying in late 2000;
we just had an excessively optimistic view of what was going on.
<START>I would say that three or four months later we were January 27-28, 2004111 of 238forecasting a flat funds rate going out and the markets were already forecasting an increase in interest rates starting in the second half of 2001.<END>
We did not incorporate that market view, and in that case I think our judgment was better.
But you are right
—it’s not a matter of who wins the horse race.
It’s a matter of putting on the table a vehicle that is useful for your discussions.
And as we noted in the memo, we thought we would be producing a less helpful vehicle by using those market expectations.
We cited a few examples where using the market-based funds rate would have presented an outlook that was inconsistent with our view of the economy.
<START>There were times that the market was forecasting a tightening of monetary policy when we viewed the underlying strength of the economy as considerably weaker than the market thought.<END>
<START>So if we had taken the market’s view about interest rates with our view about how the economy was developing, we would have produced a baseline forecast that had a tightening of the federal funds rate with the unemployment rate rising and the inflation rate continuing to come down.<END>
That did not seem likely to be the most helpful vehicle for organizing your discussion.
As David Wilcox and I noted in our memo, the information content of the staff’s forecast is pretty much independent of the assumed funds rate path.
We could write down an infinite number of funds rate paths and an infinite number of GDP, inflation, and employment paths to go along with that.
The fundamental information that we would be bringing to the table would be the same in each one of those various simulations.
The issue is where you want to begin in terms of the framework on which to base your discussions, and I think that’s a matter of taste on your parts.
<START>We’ve tried to address some of your concerns by putting on the table some alternatives, and at times we’ve provided a market-based funds rate scenario.<END>
At other times we’ve recognized that many of you might be wondering what the outlook would be if the fed January 27-28, 2004112 of 238funds rate were held constant throughout the forecast period
—that in some sense that could be more helpful in your discussions.
That’s where we come out at this point.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Gramlich.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
I put my name on the list because I wanted to ask a mere question, but since this other issue has come up let me give my view on that.
I tend to be on the Stockton–Wilcox side on this issue.
It seems to me that, for the staff forecast to be maximally useful to us, we want to know what is being assumed and how it all fits together.
I have more confidence in the way the staff now does it
—where they are perfectly open about their assumptions, and there is some central guidance to make sure that all of the sectors are using the same assumptions.
As Dave just pointed out, if there is random information here and there about this or that, they can work it in.
But at bottom they have a consistent view of what is going on.
I think if we asked them to base everything on the market funds rate, they would have to get the market view of this and the market view of that, and I’m not sure how they could do that.
So I’ve always had a preference for the way the staff does its forecasts now.
I think, Bill, that the simulations you asked for on the market funds rate have been very helpful, but I’m actually quite content with the methodology that is presently in use.
Now, let me ask my question.
In the press there is beginning to be talk of new bubbles.
I’m collecting all the information the staff has on that, so let me see if I have it right.
First, Larry, at the bottom right of chart 3 on house prices:
If you squint at that, before the forecast domain house prices actually are falling rather sharply.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
They’ve started to fall.
Rather, the rate of increase is coming down.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
Yes, the rate of increase is coming down.
Another issue discussed in the press is the earnings–price ratio, and that ratio was a subject discussed in the briefing on January 27-28, 2004113 of 238Monday.
<START>The earnings–price ratio is at reasonably high levels, which means that prices must not be extraordinarily high.<END>
Prices are the denominator there.
So as far as I can tell, you don’t collectively put much credence in the likelihood of new bubbles.
Maybe somebody would like to comment on that issue.
MR.
SLIFMAN.
I will agree with you.
[Laughter] It is true that in our baseline forecast we don’t see any bubbles.
We’ve tried to lay out the possibility of risks and point out to you where, if we are wrong in that judgment, bubbles could occur.
For example, by our forecast there isn’t a bubble in house prices;
but if there were, we have tried to point out that that could be a risk.
So if that sector were to collapse suddenly, we have indicated the implications of that for household balance sheets.
But you are correct that in our baseline we do not have a bubble.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The earnings–price ratio is a function of the low interest rates.
We have low discount factors going out on earnings, which create the high ratio of price to earnings.
One would have to argue really that the bubble is in the bond market and not in the stock market, which raises interesting inflation expectations.
MR.
STOCKTON.
I would just add a comment on the house-price side.
I would say that a year and a half or two years ago we were very skeptical about house prices having more frothy characteristics.
We are quite happy to see a slowing in house-price appreciation.
House prices have moved high relative to rents, and I think we are a little less confident about those being at full equilibrium.
If anything, we would be a little worried about the risks of a sharper deceleration.
It is quite rare for aggregate national house prices actually to turn down, but I don’t think we could rule out a period of extended flatness in real estate prices going forward.
And that would put more pressure on household balance sheets than is incorporated in the baseline forecast.
January 27-28, 2004114 of 238MR. GRAMLICH.
But the argument is that, if there were a bubble or a mini bubble, we are already seeing the adjustment to it as house prices are coming back into better balance with rents.
MR.
STOCKTON.
Well, even these rates of house-price appreciation are faster than the growth rates that we’ve seen in nominal rents so far.
So we’ve got to get that part down into a sort of balance before we even have the ratio of house prices to rents flattening out some.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Is the house-price-to-rent ratio affected by the rapidity of the rise in the homeownership ratio?
MR.
STOCKTON.
I’m not sure.
There wouldn’t necessarily be any linkages.
There is some substitution but
— CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
People’s propensity to move out of rental units and into their own homes clearly has far more effect.
MR.
STOCKTON.
On the margin that could certainly be a factor.
My guess is that it wouldn’t explain the basic divergence we’ve seen between house prices and rents.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Ferguson.
MR.
FERGUSON.
This last exchange actually was my question.
The assumption you seem to have made is that in fact the relationship between house prices and rents will converge back to the norm.
We’ve talked about some of the risks
INSTANCE OF DISAGREEMENT: 195

INSTANCE OF DISAGREEMENT: 195

Mr. Chairman, I support both your recommendation on the rate and the change in the wording.
I have a question.
At our last meeting we voted on the exact words in the press release.
Are we going to do that again?
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Yes, we shall.
MR.
PARRY.
Thanks.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Moskow.
MR.
MOSKOW.
Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation for the rate.
My preference on the sentence would be somewhat different from what you’re recommending.
I would prefer to have you explain “considerable period” in more detail in your testimony.
It will be delivered after the jobs report comes out, so you will have the flexibility of giving a clearer signal.
If the jobs report is very strong, as I think it will be, you would be in a position to give a very clear signal that the “considerable period” will not last for long.
<START>We have conditioned it already, and my preference would be to get rid of the concept completely and not have it phased January 27-28, 2004181 of 238out by a reference to “patience.” If we have a sentence in our statement that says the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation, we will still have the problem of removing that sentence sometime in the future.<END>
So my preference would be to have you do the explaining during your testimony and to get rid of the time reference completely in the March statement.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Stern.
MR.
STERN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I support your recommendation on the rate and on the change in language.
I would reiterate one point I’ve tried to make before
—apparently unpersuasively
<START>—that further disinflation or even a touch of deflation, if it’s stemming from rapid productivity growth, is not necessarily a cause for concern.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Ferguson.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I can support both elements of your recommendation.
As I said in my earlier remarks, I’m somewhat torn between two kinds of risk.
But as I think about the outlook for this year, it seems to me that the economy could unfold very much the way it did in ’95, ’96, and ’97.
In that period we started to get a better sense of the productivity story and its implication that real equilibrium interest rates should rise.
I want to be set up for that possibility.
But I also want to be set up for the possibility that we won’t want to do anything.
<START>Given the degree of uncertainty that I feel about the appropriate strategy for this year and maybe next year, I think gradually starting to get to a position of greater flexibility is without a doubt the right thing to do.<END>
Nevertheless, I would not in any sense want to suggest that we’re eager to move.
<START>So, keeping the inflation balance a little to the downside and leaving the rate unchanged while starting to remove the “considerable period” commitment by modifying the language strikes me as the best way to give us the degree of flexibility we’ll need this year.<END>
January 27-28, 2004182 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Bies.
MS.
BIES.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I support your recommendation on the rate, and I am glad to see that the old language referring to a “considerable period” is going away.
I can support the recommended wording change to “patience,” but like President Moskow I would prefer not to use the “patience” language because we’ll have to get rid of that also.
I’d feel much more comfortable going back to not including in the statement any kind of forward commitment of that sort.
<START>The faster we can eliminate both the “considerable period” and the reference to “patience” the better I will feel.<END>
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Olson.
MR.
OLSON.
I support both parts of the proposal.
But I would echo what Governor Bies and Mike Moskow said.
Implicit with the introduction of the words “considerable period” was the need at some point for an exit strategy.
And in my view even with the term “patience” we will need an exit strategy.
But I agree with your unchanged rate proposal, and I think the change in wording to “patience” is an improvement from where we are now.
So I support both parts of your proposal.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I agree that there’s no need to move policy now.
The far more important issue right now is what we say about it.
<START>It has been clear from our discussion that risks are perceived on both sides of the Greenbook forecast<END>
<START>—growth and inflation.<END>
<START>Some believe we could be surprised on the upside with both growth and inflation.<END>
Others see supply trends as possibly leading to declining inflation even in the face of what may otherwise be strong growth.
January 27-28, 2004183 of 238This raises the question
—and you, too, raised this issue in your comments
—of where it is most costly to be wrong.
I think some of us believe that being wrong on the inflation trend side
—that is, lower inflation than we are projecting
—would be more costly.
I have questions about that along the lines that President Stern just suggested.
I don’t believe that price decreases prompted by strong productivity create a pernicious form of deflation.
<START>On the other hand, if supply contracts faster than we expect and both growth and inflation take off, there is way too much accommodation in the pipeline.<END>
Fiscal policy is accommodative, monetary policy is accommodative, and financial markets are increasingly so.
I agree with your position that being wrong on that combined risk may in fact be more costly than being wrong on the inflation side.
It is true that we have yet to see the kind of strong employment growth that we expect.
But by modifying our language I think we get a bit of flexibility for the time when we do see that growth and a little more space to move proactively in the face of a strongly growing economy.
So I feel that it’s a good move on both sides.
I also think that it’s better for markets to see us take several steps in removing the “considerable period” language because there seems to be some froth out there.
It’s going to take a little while to get rid of some of the bets that people have been making on how long the “considerable period” be.
will If we step back gradually, the market reaction will be less.
CHAIRMAN GREENPAN.
President Pianalto.
MS.
PIANALTO.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I support your recommendation on the rate and also on the change in language.
I welcome the removal of the “considerable period” reference because, as I said earlier, I would prefer to be silent on any future policy actions that the Committee might take.
In that regard I would have to agree also with the concerns that January 27-28, 2004184 of 238President Moskow and Governors Bies and Olson raised regarding the new language.
But I do support the change at this point.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Guynn.
MR.
GUYNN.
Mr. Chairman, I support your recommendation.
I do think the new language is a nice recalibration of our signal.
It is an exit strategy that is thoughtful and gentle, and in that regard it makes sense.
When Ned was talking about calling in the fire trucks, I was thinking that we had already planned to do that, but we sent the gas trucks in their place.
[Laughter] We’ve had the nozzle on automatic, and I think it’s time that we put our hand back on the nozzle.
In my view, your proposed rewording is a great signal, and I support it.
Thank you.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Santomero.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
I support your recommendation on the rate and also on the wording.
<START>In terms of the timing, at some level I could make a case that the weak jobs report makes it a little easier for us to take this step because it doesn’t involve the anticipation of an immediate interest rate movement.<END>
As to the concerns about whether or not this is a big enough step, we need an exit strategy, and this is one.
These are baby steps, but as we know from our babies, the first step is the hardest.
And moving away from “considerable period” is probably a step well taken now.
We can move over time to where we want to be, and then we can finally get rid of this contingency language.
So I think it’s the right thing to do and the right time to do it.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Governor Bernanke.
MR.
BERNANKE.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I agree with the phase-out approach.
I think it would be a mistake to drop this language suddenly.
It would risk sending a signal that a January 27-28, 2004185 of 238tightening is imminent and creating an overreaction in the financial markets.
So I support both your rate recommendation and your language recommendation.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President McTeer.
MR.
MCTEER.
So do I. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Vice Chair.
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.
So do I. CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Broaddus.
MR.
BROADDUS.
Mr. Chairman, I had my hand up rather quickly, although Norm didn’t see it, because I was looking forward to supporting what I thought would be Don’s recommendation to keep the “considerable period” language.
But I can accept your recommendation.
This is a tough issue, and I think you made some very persuasive arguments, especially at the end of your statement.
But let me just comment very quickly.
I agree that most of us are now much more optimistic about the outlook, though I may not feel quite as strongly as you do.
But I do believe that the supply-side issues that Don discussed and that are raised in the forecast are significant or at least not insignificant.
Also, we talked a little about downside costs.
As you know, there is a probability and a cost.
I agree that the probability of further disinflation may be lower than a move in the opposite direction, but I think it’s important not to underestimate the cost if in fact we do have further disinflation.
We have the funds rate at 1 percent.
I’m not confident that we are fully prepared yet to deal with the kinds of policy issues we would have to deal with if we got a bigger disinflation move than we now anticipate.
So if it were my call, I would leave the “considerable period” language in the statement a little longer.
But again it’s a close call, and I could certainly accept your recommendation.
January 27-28, 2004186 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Let’s get the draft statement distributed around the table.
I assume everyone has had a chance to read it.
Any questions, comments, or objections?
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
I have no objection to this press release.
I think it’s a really good one.
But I would just like to make a comment.
Maybe it’s because of the discussion yesterday or the way the Bluebook was lined out or the presentation today, but as a member of this Committee, I really feel better about the process we’ve gone through over the last couple of days as it relates to the statement than I have at any time in the last several months.
I think I’m coming around to understanding better how this communication is working.
And I thought the process of working through portions of the statement in the Bluebook was really helpful.
So despite my comments yesterday about forty pages involving three alternatives and so forth, I do want to compliment the staff on the job you did.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
<START>If there are no further comments, I’ll ask the Secretary to read the appropriate language.<END>
MR.
BERNARD.
Starting with the directive wording itself:
“The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.
To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with maintaining the federal funds rate at an average of around 1 percent.” And with regard to the announcement language that the Committee is voting on:
<START>“The Committee perceives that the upside and downside risks to the attainment of sustainable growth for the next few quarters are roughly equal.<END>
<START>The probability of an unwelcome fall in inflation has diminished in recent months and now appears almost equal to that of a rise in inflation.<END>
With January 27-28, 2004187 of 238inflation quite low and resource use slack, the Committee believes that it can be patient in removing its policy accommodation.” CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Would you call the roll?
MR.
BERNARD.
Chairman Greenspan Yes Vice Chairman Geithner Yes Governor Bernanke MR. BERNANKE.
Am I voting on the statement or the statement and the policy action?
MR.
BERNARD.
On both.
MR.
BERNANKE.
On both.
Thank you.
Yes MR. BERNARD.
Governor Bies Yes Governor Ferguson Yes Governor Gramlich Yes President Hoenig Yes Governor Kohn Yes President Minehan Yes Governor Olson Yes President Pianalto Yes President Poole Yes CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
May I interject?
In fact, the Vice Chair has an interesting suggestion, so let me call on him.
VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.
The third sentence in the second paragraph, which is the sentence about labor markets, now reads in the proposed text:
<START>“Although new hiring remained subdued, other indicators show an improvement in the labor market.” I was just going to suggest that we replace “show” with “suggest.” SPEAKER(?).<END>
Yes, that’s a good idea.
January 27-28, 2004188 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I think that would be useful.
<START>Unless anybody disagrees, let’s make that change in the statement.<END>
[Secretary’s note:
The change in question was not in the paragraph of the statement covered by the foregoing vote.] CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I have a note from Michelle about an issue that we should address.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Here is the issue that has come up.
The press and people in the market know that we had a Working Group on Communications and that we were going to discuss communication issues today.
There was no secret as to what we would be talking about at this meeting.
The press I suspect will be interested in knowing what came out of the discussion today.
So Michelle would like us to consider what we want her to say about that.
She has some thoughts of what she might say.
Do you have other copies of this note that you have given me, Michelle?
MS.
SMITH.
I can get other copies.
That one is for you.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Okay.
Here are some thoughts about what Michelle might say.
I think we all want to provide a consistent message in our public comments.
One question is whether we are going to be making some changes.
Michelle proposes to say that the Committee considered a range of issues and has no new formulation to announce, which is the case, and that we decided to adapt the statement gradually in response to changing economic circumstances.
I think that is a fair assessment.
The second question is whether today’s discussion was related to the study of the working group mentioned in the October minutes.
In lieu of trying to tie this to anything, I think it is best simply to say that we’ve been evaluating and will continue to evaluate communications January 27-28, 2004189 of 238in response to changing circumstances but announce that the working group has disbanded.
That group doesn’t have more to do.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Why don’t you just say it has completed its work.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Or has been shot?
[Laughter] Okay, it has completed its work.
Finally, the hardest question is the one about releasing the minutes earlier.
I think the safest thing is to say that we have made no decision on early release of the minutes because, in fact, we haven’t yet made any decisions on that issue.
<START>Does anyone have any strong objection to that approach to dealing with what I think is going to be a pretty frenzied interest in what happened?<END>
MR.
MOSKOW.
This is not an objection but a question.
What about the role of projections?
That issue has been in the press.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Oh, it has?
I don’t recall that being in the press.
MS.
SMITH.
Governor Bernanke in his ABA speech raised the possibility of increasing the frequency and the time period.
I don’t believe that people expected you to make a decision about that at this meeting, but we may get some questions about that.
It would be a good idea for you to give me some guidance.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Well, I think the answer is that we decided not to increase the frequency or change the time when we release the forecasts.
But I think we can say that our policies will continue to evolve as we go forward with regard to exactly what we forecast.
I think that’s a fair statement of where we came out.
Is anyone uncomfortable with that?
MR.
OLSON.
I would be inclined at least to emphasize that we recognize the importance of communication.
My concern is that this sounds as if we’re suggesting that our work on communication issues has been concluded.
I don’t have precise wording to suggest, but I think we want to emphasize that we will continue to look at issues of communication.
January 27-28, 2004190 of 238CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
I was about to raise the same issue.
<START>Also missing here is a statement that we actually had a very productive discussion.<END>
MR.
OLSON.
Right.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
In fact, we discussed this subject of communication for several hours and came to a number of conclusions.
This makes it sound as though we couldn’t agree on what page number we were dealing with.
MR.
FERGUSON.
Well, I think just the opposite occurred.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
It was actually a very interesting and useful discussion about how we ought to communicate.
And I think we will continue as is necessary to be involved in endeavoring to improve our communications as the economy and markets change.
MR.
REINHART.
Mr. Chairman, the Committee did vote on the exact words of the press statement.
If you intend to do that in the future, that is another piece of positive news that Michelle can relay.
And that will be in the minutes.
MS.
MINEHAN.
We didn’t vote on the whole press statement.
MR.
REINHART.
But you voted on the risk-assessment paragraph.
MS.
MINEHAN.
We voted on that paragraph, yes.
MR.
FERGUSON.
That strikes me as very much a question in intra-Committee dynamics, not a question of external communication.
I’m not sure about the degree to which the markets are focused on what gets voted on and what doesn’t.
MR.
REINHART.
Well, at the last Bond Market Association meeting
—or rather the time before
—the significance of not voting on that wording was an issue that was raised.
MR.
FERGUSON.
And I thought the way we handled that was to say that it just happened.
January 27-28, 2004191 of 238MR. SANTOMERO.
After you work through all of these pieces, can you make sure everyone of us gets a script, if you will, from this so we know what’s out there and what isn’t about what we concluded?
MR.
FERGUSON.
Yes.
MR.
SANTOMERO.
They’re going to come at us in different directions, so I think it’s important that we have some uniform way of talking about what we have concluded.
MR.
FERGUSON.
I would hope that we can get this draft redone and circulated to everybody relatively quickly.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
President Minehan.
MS.
MINEHAN.
We did have a rather extensive discussion yesterday on whether or not we should parallel test, with some work involved on both the staff side and our side, the earlier release of the minutes just to see how it goes.
I don’t have a single problem with not telling anybody that.
In fact, my own view is that that’s the sensible thing to do.
Let’s see how it feels to us first before we go telling the world that’s what we’re doing.
There are, however, different opinions about how to deal with the outside world among those of us at this table.
Should we have an understanding about that?
MR.
SANTOMERO.
That’s why we need that document.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
Let’s ask Michelle her view.
MS.
SMITH.
I think if we did announce that you were conducting a parallel test, you would be forced to release the minutes early.
MS.
MINEHAN.
That’s what I think.
January 27-28, 2004192 of 238MS. SMITH.
I would recommend that the Committee not say anything about parallel testing and give yourselves an opportunity to see how that process works.
You could then choose whether or not to make a comment.
MS.
MINEHAN.
I agree with that.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
This is one of those cases where, once we move in a direction, we cannot move back.
MS.
MINEHAN.
I know.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
And announcing that would actually be a move in a direction.
<START>We don’t have the luxury to say we’re contemplating doing something like that and then say we made a decision not to be transparent.<END>
MS.
MINEHAN.
Right.
I think we learned our lesson about that last year.
I really do think that we need to agree not to talk about this because, if we talk about it, then parallel testing doesn’t do us any good.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
<START>It is regrettable I must say, but unfortunately that is an accurate statement.<END>
MR.
FERGUSON.
Well, I presume that decision, which was taken yesterday, is covered by all the security and confidentiality rules that cover all these kinds of issues.
MS.
MINEHAN.
I hope so.
MR.
FERGUSON.
So that’s the point in trying to be clear about what we are saying and what we’re not saying.
MR.
GRAMLICH.
Could I just raise another approach?
Maybe you won’t like it.
But if Michelle gets asked about this, could she just say that it will be dealt with in the minutes?
January 27-28, 2004193 of 238MS. SMITH.
I don’t believe so.
I think you all will experience some pressure from the media and the public.
And I think this issue will come up in the Chairman’s Monetary Policy Report testimony.
Reporters in the last week were saying that they expect some announcement at this meeting on the conclusion of your efforts in this area.
So I don’t think we have that luxury.
CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN.
The next meeting is March 16.
Dave Stockton is available to accept revisions on your forecasts up to the close of business Friday.
Let us go to lunch.
