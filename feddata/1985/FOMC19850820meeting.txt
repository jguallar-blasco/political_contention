We need to approve the minutes of the lastmeeting. [Secretary's Note: Approved without objection.]MR. CROSS. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Comments or questions?MR. WALLICH. The drop that you described, which goes back tothe peak, has been quite substantial--I think 20 percent against themark and 16 percent [overall]. Do people regard that as a very rapidslide in the market?MR. CROSS. Well, I don't think it has been a dramatic slide.It has been on average about 17 percent or so, and against theEuropean currencies it has been more than that. So, it is certainlyenough of a decline in the period of six months or less that it hasattracted attention. It seems that the dollar has made this rathersubstantial adjustment, but I don't think there is a lot ofexpectation that it is necessarily going to fall off the table.Certainly, there is a generally bearish tone to the dollar and to themarket's attitude toward it. And to the extent that these things canbe generalized, there seems to be an expectation of possiblecontinuing softness unless our economy changes.MR. MARTIN. You put quite a bit of emphasis on the Treasuryrefunding as an indicator that foreigners, including the Japanese, arenot going to rush to sell their U.S. securities. I am not quarrelingwith that implication of your comment, but can you broaden thatanalysis a little? Are foreigners tending to shorten their maturitiesas they roll securities over? What kinds of, for want of a betterterm, leading financial indicators are we getting out of theEuromarkets with regard to holdings of dollar-denominated versusotherwise denominated securities--these securities, whatever you callthem, on which the interest is paid in one currency and the principalin another? Can you expand on that a bit?MR. CROSS. Well, it is difficult to say very much because wereally don't have enough information. Before the last refunding,which of course was a substantial one, there had been concernsexpressed that [foreign investors] might stay away from thatparticular operation and that it would be in difficulty as a result.That didn't seem to happen. It was more the case of a nonbarking dog.MR. MARTIN. But of course we didn't have a special offeringto foreigners either, right?MR. CROSS. That is correct. What we do know--or what we seeand hear about--is that the Japanese, at least beginning in June, havetended to start doing more hedging. They continue to have substantiallong-term outflows into dollars and U.S. securities, but they havetended, for I think the first time, to be doing more hedging. Also,we hear at least anecdotally, but it is very difficult to know howmuch attention to pay to these things, that one of the factors thathas tended to keep sterling somewhat strong has been the tendency ofinvestors to diversify a little toward sterling, which has been paying8/20/85very high interest rates. But these [reports] are anecdotal; youcan't really get a very sound understanding of something as large andas complicated as this market on the basis of a relatively smallnumber of conversations and what you hear.MR. MARTIN. Not even a shortening in maturities?MR. STERNLIGHT. I could add a little comment on that too.Governor Martin. What we are hearing anecdotally also suggests alesser pace of foreign buying, but continuing interest in theintermediate and long-term area. I don't get any sense, particularlyfrom the dealers who have active Japanese operations, of a shorteningof maturities. They are taking a little less but are continuing tolook at the 10-year and longer area.MR. WALLICH. If I may comment on this: The idea ofshortening [maturities] is that they are more liquid and investors canget out more rapidly, which is a concern. But the investors whobelieve that they can ride out a substantial fall of the dollarpresumably look at the long end and they probably would be right.MR. PARTEE. Sam, the price of gold has increasedsignificantly over this period that you are talking about too--that isto say, the dollar has dropped relative to gold. Gold wouldn't havechanged much in price in terms of marks or Swiss francs, I don'tsuppose. Is that all that is being reflected here: that the market ismade in Switzerland and Germany? Or do you think there is somethingelse behind this move in gold?MR. CROSS. Well, I think the interesting thing about gold isthat the price has risen somewhat as the dollar has weakened, as yousuggested, but it hasn't risen all that much. And in terms of theSwiss franc, it has been reasonably stable.MR. PARTEE. Yes, I think that is probably right.MR. CROSS. One of the interesting things has been that thedifficulties in South Africa do not seem to have caused a greaterincrease in the price of gold. Now, there are all kinds of questionsabout that. There is a feeling that substantial supplies are beingwithheld from the market by the main producers, the South Africans andthe Russians in particular. As the price moves up, then they tend tosell a little more and then it goes back down again. That seems tohave been the pattern. One might have thought, with the concerns inSouth Africa and the possibility being talked about of mining strikesand other potential supply disruptions, that the price might haverisen more than it has. It's now about $336 today, and that's not upall that much from where it was before so much attention was beingpaid to this. What has happened is that the price of platinum hasgone up. I gather that South Africa is more critical to the platinummarket than to the gold market, and platinum has moved up much morerapidly. But gold in a sense has shown relatively less buoyancy, inlight of all these factors, than one might have expected.MR. PARTEE. I see.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Sternlight.8/20/85MR. STERNLIGHT. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Questions?MR. FORRESTAL. Peter, was there any particular reaction tothe Bank of America dividend action?MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, we were following their fundingoperations closely on the heels of that, and they did experience aslight widening of spreads--maybe by 0.5 or something like that. Itwas not a big reaction. They have a quite liquid operation; they havean enormous local deposit base. They generally are sellers ratherthan buyers in the overnight fed funds market. They have had a littleerosion of the commercial paper funding of the holding company but,based on our observations, I would say they are weathering it prettywell.MR. GUFFEY. What are the current spreads on the Farm CreditAgency--?MR. STERNLIGHT. The current spreads would range from about 5to 15 basis points on maturities up to one year--and those had beenjust about even with Treasuries earlier--to maybe 40 or 50 basispoints on some of the longer maturities, which earlier had spreads ofmaybe 20 to 25 basis points.MR. KEEHN. Did they defer a long-term issue within the lastweek or so?MR. STERNLIGHT. Not that I am aware of. I think the marketis looking for them to announce a term issue within the next fewweeks.MR. MELZER. Peter, how would you characterize dealerpositions right now?MR. STERNLIGHT. Given all the hedges on positions that aretaken these days, it has become very difficult to make sensiblecomments about where dealer positions are. My impression is thatthere has been a pretty good distribution from the refunding that wasjust paid for a few days ago. I'd say they are on the moderate side.MR. WALLICH. Peter, you mentioned the Japanese firms. Ihave always felt quite strongly about national treatment but I see inthe press a statement that Karl Otto Poehl made after the lastBundesbank meeting that he takes a very different line. He refers toJapanese firms that want to come into the German market to assume thislead role; [the German authorities] have told them "no" untilsomething is worked out with German banks in Japan. That's just asidelight on that.MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes. I think in the UK also there has beenmore of an attitude of looking at it as reciprocal--looking forspecific olive branches and reciprocity before Japanese firms arewelcomed into the developing gilt market in London. We have beenfollowing the situation and I'm still collecting impressions of justwhat the situation is in Japan; but my impression so far is that atleast a respectable number of U.S. firms--8 or 10 or something like8/20/85that--have quite good access to Japanese investors, in terms ofselling U.S. securities in the Japanese market.MS. SEGER. Peter and I discussed this a little because Ithink this is a bigger issue than just the Open Market Desk in thathow we deal with Japan has general public policy interest. We have sofew levers to use on them, and people I know on Wall Street tell me[the playing field] is not even. Maybe it is in a narrow governmentdealer sense; I don't know. But certainly, looking at the financialmarkets across the board, we treat them a lot better in this countrythan they treat us. I think we ought to consider a lot more anglesthan whether or not the dealer in securities is well capitalized anddoes a big volume of business. I am a competitive person, and I thinkit is only fair that it go both ways.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [If no one else has] any comments, wemight as well turn to Mr. Kichline.MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.]MR. PARTEE. You depend on a levelling out of net imports toget this improvement in GNP?MR. KICHLINE. That is right. Was that a question to me orto Ted?MR. PARTEE. Well, you made the presentation.MR. KICHLINE. Well, there are two parts that really areimportant. We have very clearly much slower growth in final sales;instead of numbers in the 5 percent area, we are talking about numbersmuch less than that--something in the 2-1/2 percent area. So we aretalking about a substantial slowing. What is going to happen in thisenvironment for us to get 3 percent growth is essentially thatinventories are not negative--that they are basically a smallcontributor--and that the deterioration in the trade balance comes toa halt pretty quickly. Ted, maybe you want to talk a little aboutsome of those numbers. Maybe not!MR. TRUMAN. Maybe not! One contributing factor clearly isthat there is going to be less demand here. That certainly will beone factor slowing down the rate of increase in imports. It is alsotrue that the rest of the world, while not booming, will be growingsomewhat faster than we will. We feel that the export level wasdepressed, perhaps somewhat artificially, in the second quarter andthat it should pick up some. I think that we have put in a relativelyconservative--well, maybe "agnostic" would be a better way of puttingit--trajectory for non-oil imports. Those imports in real terms hadbeen running somewhat higher than the historical relationships wouldpredict. It is not clear to what extent that is associated withstructural changes in the world economy or with responses to exchangerates, which are not picked up by historical relationships. As thedollar has declined, and assuming it will continue to declinesomewhat, we have chosen not to reverse that. In that sense we havebeen agnostic. Now, you could also say that we have not been sopessimistic as to believe that the phenomenon is going to increase inmagnitude. Basically what we have on the import side is that importsare being driven by the slower growth in the United States and the8/20/85decline in the value of the dollar, some of which has occurred alreadybut much of which--basically for the projection period--is ahead ofus. It is clear that there is considerable uncertainty in thesenumbers, as Jim indicated and as we have indicated before, becauseamong other things they have been bouncing around quite a lot. Icertainly wouldn't rule out the possibility that imports in particularcould rise substantially faster than we have forecast. In fact, wehave the imports in real terms continuing to rise marginally throughthe early part of 1986. It is also true that if they did rise morerapidly, everything else including demand being the same, thenproduction obviously would be lower. On the other hand, to the extentthat we may have been too conservative or shouldn't have beenagnostic, or to the extent that more push comes from the exchange ratethan we have built into the forecast, things could go somewhat theother way. There is some potential possibility that a sharper declinein the dollar, or a faster response to that, could produce more in theway of a cutback earlier than we have put into the forecast. We don'thave anything really happening until early 1986 in quantitative terms.MR. PARTEE. You ordinarily would expect quite a lag.MR. TRUMAN. Yes, but you get quantity effects that begin toshow through within a quarter or so.MR. PARTEE. Within a quarter?MR. TRUMAN. Yes, but again, you have to go four quarters inorder to get half of the effects and a couple of years before you getall of them. There is considerable difficulty in knowing how tointerpret the first quarter phenomenon where the dollar went far upand came back down. How much in the way of imports were discouragedduring that period or weren't discouraged during that period? That isone of the conundrums involved here. Should you throw out thatexchange rate [move] as basically not affecting anybody's decisions?Or should you include it? If you include it, then you would say thatyou were going to have the lagged effect of the first quarter in somesense feeding on through the remainder of the year. Since we'reforced to fall back on more or less historical relationships, we havebuilt some of that in. I think we could argue that a conservativeapproach to putting the forecast together can be justified on a microor disaggregated level to the extent that we have had and willcontinue to have higher imports of Japanese automobiles in this newfull year and that will work somewhat in the other direction.MR. PARTEE. If I might ask another question: Jim, what doyou make of the fairly pervasive weakness in nonresidential indicatorsin the last couple of months? Contracts and most of the elementsthere have been off quite substantially.MR. KICHLINE. As you know, in the office building area, wehave been anticipating for a long time that it would slow down. Thatwas the domestic [equivalent of the] exchange value of the dollar; itkept rising and we said it was supposed to go down. It has been goingdown now. If you look at construction put in place as well ascontracts, as you noted, and permits, the whole ball of wax suggeststhat that indeed is slowing. Now, it slows rather slowly because ofthe fact that there is a long construction lead time. So it is notsomething that we think will collapse. The problem in that area is8/20/85that other indicators of activity--even in industrial buildings,public utilities and so forth--give us a sense that basically it hasbeen weakening. So, in this forecast we have small declines; theycould be larger depending on the assumptions one wants to make. Butthroughout the forecast period we have some small declines. Now, Iwould note that some of these data are very volatile; we have beencaught before where the numbers go down for two or three months andthey snap back. But I think that the fundamentals in vacancy ratesand other things would argue now that perhaps we are in a period wherewe should expect small declines in real terms. And that is what wehave built in throughout the period.MR. BOEHNE. The main case for getting 3 percent is that theleakages from the foreign sector and inventories don't leak as much.On the other hand, there is the consumer sector, which is 60 somepercent of total final demand. And there are at least some hints--income not growing quite as fast, the debt problems, mortgagedelinquencies up a touch--that maybe that will not go on as it has.There is nothing dramatic, but at least there are a few straws in thewind. In the housing area, as you rightfully pointed out, one wouldexpect some sluggishness in the multifamily area. But in the single-family area, while you would expect a drop in mortgage rates to havesome effect, I wonder if you would expect a drop to have the sameeffect in an era when most mortgages are at variable rates compared toan era when most were at fixed rates. I guess I would expect a dropin rates to have some positive impact on single-family housing starts[but] not be as much of a stimulus in this kind of environment. Iwould like for you to comment some on the downside risks, two of whichI pointed out: the consumer side and single-family housing.MR. KICHLINE. Well, I don't feel quite as nervous aboutpersonal consumption expenditures at the moment as you suggest, if ourincome is right--if we are generating enough income in other sectors--because I think we have basically fairly mild expectations forpersonal consumption expenditures. We have to get some monthlyincreases, however, to get the 3 percent. I think I pointed that out;it is not in the bag. What we are expecting is literally 1-1/2 to 2percent annual rates of increase in personal consumption expendituresfrom now on over the balance of the forecast period. In the firsthalf of the year we have seen 5-1/4 percent increases--just a surge.At that time the saving rate dropped and debt was being taken on insubstantial volume. What we have here is essentially a fairly lowsaving rate, income growth just tracking along, and not really abullish environment. But you can point to the negatives, and the debtside is certainly one. Income growth, I think, is a little risky;there is not a lot of income growth being generated and you don't haveto have too much happening in other sectors to lead to slower growth.So, I don't view it as a big risk in that we really do have a muchslower pace of consumer spending in store.The housing area is one where we may have the lags wrong. Inthinking back, we said some time ago that we had seen a drop of acouple of percentage points in mortgage interest rates and, given thelags, we ought to be seeing some pickup. And we just haven't. Ithink I would abandon that story about the time the August numberscome in. Basically, our notion was that this should have happenedthis summer and it just has not happened yet; if the August numberscome in [and don't show a pickup], I think I will conclude that we8/20/85really have miscalculated what may be driving that. We have gonethrough fairly carefully our sense of what ought to be happening.There is an awful lot of anecdotal evidence floating around: mortgageloan applications are up; appraisers are very busy; and existing homesales have picked up. But new home sales haven't done anything.Single-family starts haven't done anything. We have gone through andidentified some of the positives. With lower interest rates,mortgages are more affordable; the demographics are strong, andhousehold formation is good. On the other side is an environment inwhich expectations of major capital appreciation are not there,probably; tightened mortgage underwriting standards may be doingsomething at the margin; and there is uncertainty over the taxtreatment of interest and property tax deductions. How you slice thatis very important. If we had put this forecast together today, wewould have a lower housing start number and a little lower residentialexpenditures. Those data came in after we put the forecast togetherand were weaker than we had built in.MR. MARTIN. Jim, let me address Ed's question in a littledifferent way. I don't have any problems with what you said. Butisn't it true that, as the housing market has matured, there has beena shift in the direction of fixed rate mortgage originations and awayfrom adjustable rate mortgage originations? If you go back a fewmonths and take out the spike in the fixed mortgage rate, you reallyhave a decrease of 100 to 150 basis points in that rate; the shift hasbeen to using fixed rate loans. If you go along that line then, thetightening of credit underwriting can offset 100 or 150 points; itcan't offset 200 or 300 points, probably. Perhaps there has not beenthat much improvement at the point of sale fixed rate mortgage,[given] that no appreciation in the house is looked for. So, just tocomplicate it further--MR. BOEHNE. You know too much about that market, Pres.MR. PARTEE. Yesterday I was reading--I think a number of usreceived this--a letter from the home builders. They really had quitean upbeat letter this time on traffic in the subdivisions and on salesand the outlook for sales over the next six months. For them it wasas optimistic as I have seen for a long time.MR. KICHLINE. They also had one in June; it was sort ofgoing off the charts in terms of single-family home builders'expectations. That fits with other evidence; I'm just saying that wedon't see it yet in terms of starts having picked up.MR. MARTIN. I never talk personalities but that is aSumicrast survey of home builders and the Colton projection is still1.6, 1.7 million. Let the record not show that.MR. BALLES. Jim, now that we have a budget resolution ofsorts, I am wondering what your analysis shows with respect to therevised deficit realistically interpreted for the coming fiscal year.How, if at all, would you change your forecast as a result of thatCongressional action?MR. KICHLINE. The differences from our earlier assumptionswere really quite small. We had assumed a package of about $50billion on our basis and we interpret what actually was accomplished8/20/85and our reading of what likely will be done in the following steps toamount to $45 billion. It is really quite close; we have onlyadjusted a little for that. The way we come out, though, is much lessoptimistic than some. In part, we have a weaker forecast so thatthere is some [difference in the] economic assumptions and lessrevenue. But we also have felt that many of the actions requiresingle-year appropriations bills and that they will be addressing thisyear-in and year-out. There clearly are pressures now in the farmarea to overrun those targets. There are some phony things, but it isstripping away the phony things. It really does take persistentaction. So, in the near term we are fairly close; where I think Iwould be much less optimistic is in year two and year three. There wehave not gone through an explicit process, but of course the CBOrecently came forth with some numbers and they were considerablyhigher by the time you get to the third year. The Congress used veryoptimistic assumptions and also assumed actions that appear to usrather difficult to undertake. So I think it is a story that may haveto be revisited. Our [estimate] on their basis of the total deficitis about $191 billion for fiscal year 1986 in contrast to theirassumed $175 billion or so. We are in the range of $15 to $18 billionhigher than Congress would be.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Axilrod.MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now it's all very clear!MR. PARTEE. I didn't know he had stopped! Don't you haveanother paragraph?MR. BALLES. Could we pursue this issue of a shift in thedemand for money a little more, Steve? What is your best guess? Isthere a shift going on? There is that possibility, as you talkedabout. If that is not it, what is causing the drop in velocity of Ml?MR. AXILROD. I think it is semantics as to whether you callit a shift or not. I suspect at the moment that there is a changesimply in the distribution of savings flows. And it could have arelatively simple explanation. If time deposits that are now maturingwere put in a year ago--we don't have adequate data on when they wereput in--they were earning 10 percent. Now they are earning 7 or 7-1/2percent; I have forgotten the exact rate. And people may just simplyout of psychological disappointment say: "Well, I will just put mymoney in this account where I can get at it rapidly and maybe rateswill be a little higher later. I am used to earning a higher rate."There may not be any actual sense of real uncertainty or doubts aboutthe economy in that context. I tend to think something sort of simplelike that may be occurring at this point. And there is no way thatthe models pick up something like that--whether you call it a wrongelasticity or a demand shift. The surveys of consumer confidence arenot so weak as to make you think that people are making a big broadshift in their pattern of saving. I don't know whether that kind ofmoney behavior will in the future lead to the kind of strength of GNPthat these models--this rather simple look at lagged money versus GNP--would lead you to think. One would say "no"--that that kind ofsaving behavior doesn't necessarily entail strong growth.8/20/85MR. BALLES. Would it be fair to say, based on thatexplanation or view of yours, that we could at least expect thisovershoot of M1 from our new midyear targets not to carry with it theusual inflationary implications that it might otherwise have?MR. AXILROD. Well, I think it wouldn't so far. If you wereto ask me after it had gone on for four to six months, I would have tosay that I think there is enough in monetarism to say that the risk isvery strong that it would. And I am not so sure that I wouldn't thinkthat there is a little risk at this very moment.MR. BALLES. That's the $64 question!MR. MELZER. Steve, your projected money growth for August is14.3 percent, which is [a month-end level of] about $602.8 billion andwe are at $601.9 billion. What do you think the risk is in thatforecast? Obviously, it implies very little additional money growthover the month of August.MR. AXILROD. A drop from what we had assumed. Well, we aregoing to get some data very soon and it is hard to say before that;but I guess the risk is probably that August might be a little lowerand September higher. That's how I would tend to guess it, but myinstinct is that we could be there or a shade higher as of now. Idon't expect any great weakness. This NOW account behavior seems tome a little difficult to explain. The rate spreads are widening andare making time deposits a little more attractive and market rates alittle more attractive, so I expect some shifting away from that soon.It is hard to say exactly when that will occur, but that ought tooccur. Whether it will occur now or in September or October is hardto say.MR. MELZER. By the way, on your point about the psychologyof single digit rates, my feeling would be that there is some validityto that--that people have a very hard time accepting committing theirmoney over a longer term for less than 10 percent.MR. WALLICH. If you did a survey of 40 banks with a largeexpansion in NOW accounts, you might stop those the way you stoppeddemand deposits in your surveys!MR. AXILROD. We did the survey after the demand depositsstopped.MR. BLACK. Are you suggesting that as a new control device?MR. WALLICH. He seems to have discovered one.MR. AXILROD. Old M1A, or old M1--currency and demanddeposits--in July rose 3.3 percent, so it is much less. And if ourprojections are right for August--we still have [data for] less thanhalf the month--it would be rising 5-3/4 percent. So it has dropped[from the rapid pace in the spring]. The quarterly average, giventhat and a very reasonable September, would be about 8 percent. Itgrew 6.8 percent in the first quarter and 8 percent in the second; andon a quarterly average basis it has [unintelligible].8/20/85CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What has the old M1A done through thisyear so far?MR. AXILROD. Well, it was 6.8 percent in the first quarterand 8 percent in the second quarter--a couple of points below currentM1. But it is much more below in July and August; it is deceleratingmore at this moment. Old M1 was 13 percent in May and 18-1/2 percentin June.MR. BLACK. Steve, some time back you were experimenting withthe predictive qualities of M1A. Have you played around with thatlately to see whether it has any promise?MR. AXILROD. Well, I did for that paper that I sent to theCommittee before the last meeting. I did it in an excessivelysimplified way and it did not look very much different one way or theother. That is the conclusion I drew from it. In another approach,looking at it since 1982--not using the sort of model that I used, butin a simple way just looking at lagged M1 and lagged M1-A versus GNP--the deviations between M1 and GNP and M1A and GNP favor M1. They arenarrower in M1 than in M1A.MR. MORRIS. I have a technical question, Steve. In theBluebook you mentioned state and local government advance refundingborrowing. Are they included in the net debt number?MR. PRELL. Yes.MR. MORRIS. Isn't that double counting?MR. PRELL. Well, it is one of many forms of double countingthat are in practice unavoidable because there are many layerings ofborrowing and lending in the accounts. They are included and theyhave been sizable this year.MR. MORRIS. So, that is a fairly major factor inflating thedebt number now.MR. PRELL. There has been about $20 billion worth ofrefundings thus far this year.MR. MORRIS. Since interest rates are down, what they do isfund municipal issues and invest the proceeds in government[securities] and pick up the differential. Or, I guess maybe theTreasury doesn't let them do that anymore.MR. AXILROD. No, there is a special issue.MR. STERNLIGHT. They usually have to take a special issuefrom the Treasury.MR. PARTEE. Of course, a corporation can do the same thingand call it defeasance.MR. MORRIS. Yes. So, I should think those should be nettedout of the number.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It is a little hard to know where to stop.-10-8/20/85MR. PRELL. That is right.MR. MORRIS. Presumably, we don't include bank liabilitiesand also include bank investments in short-term securities. So wehave tried to net where we can. It seems to me that if we have anarea where clearly we have double counting and can identify it, thatit ought to be eliminated.MR. AXILROD. I think we did mention it the year before lastas one of the factors causing credit to be strong along with themergers and the drop in equity.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What does $20 billion amount to--1/4 ofone percent?MR. PRELL. Let's see. The [monthly] flow is about [$1700million]; if it ran [$20] billion for the year, it would be about 1/2of a percent.MR. WALLICH. Did the lagged study that you did differentiatebetween the impact of M1 on inflation and on the real?MR. AXILROD. No. I was just doing what some people do intown here. It was the short run, looking at M1 versus nominal GNPwith various quarterly moving averages--3, 6, and 9 months. It wasnot a very scientific study of looking ahead through models. No, theprice effect, we still think, would take longer; this was just tonominal GNP.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All these charts here would suggest thatwe are about to launch into a sizable boom, if you believe that.MR. PARTEE. In the third quarter; we're right there.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you could argue, depending upon whatlag you put in, that it could be delayed to the fourth quarter.MR. PARTEE. The question is: Does anybody see it?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that is the question that I raise.MR. BLACK. I don't think that there is anything out therenow, but I think it is going to be out there some time, with a laterlag. In 1982-1983, velocity behaved very unusually and yet we had avery strong pickup in 1983 and nobody expected that. The only thingthat predicted it was M1. So, I am a pragmatist, and my faith isbeing shaken to some extent, but I still believe I am going to bevindicated on that somewhere down the road. It would be very unusualif it didn't happen.MR. MARTIN. Laffer says that's the first effective date ofthe supply-siders' tax cuts.MR. BLACK. Well, I'll have to [unintelligible] and find whenthat went in. I don't remember exactly.MR. MORRIS. The leading indicators showed a little firmingpattern in May and June, but what sort of depressed me is that the-11-8/20/85July numbers for the leading indicators that we have don't look allthat great. They reflect a definite weakening from the May-Junenumber.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is the figure that hasn't beenpublished yet?MR. MORRIS. No, I'm just looking at the individual[components that we have].MR. BOEHNE. It seems to me that the only way that we couldget a major increase in economic activity would be if suddenly therewere a change in the trade account, and that just strikes me as beingunrealistic. We already have gross national expenditures, if you lookat it from the expenditure side, probably rising 4 to 5 percent; ifyou take out the leakages, you get down to this 2 percent. So unlessone can say we are going to have a big turnaround in the tradeaccounts in the near-term horizon, it is awfully hard to say that weare going to have a major increase in economic activity.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A characteristic of the forecast youalluded to earlier is that we are going to have--I hate to call itmajor--a significant change in the trade trend and a weakening of thegross national expenditures of some magnitude. That is what theforecast is anyway.MR. BLACK. Lyle is already pumping us for information! Heasked me last night if I thought we would still get 8 percent in thefourth quarter, and I told him that it might be as late as the firstquarter before we got that.MR. BOYKIN. There is not anything down our way that leads toa whole lot of optimism. Just about everything--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Your directors don't seem to think so.MR. BOYKIN. That's for sure. The major thing, of course, isuncertainty in energy. We talked about that. Texas A&M University ispredicting a 40 percent drop in farm income for this year. The Bureauof Business Research at the University of Texas is saying that Texasis already in a recession. There are uncertainties developing. Ourunemployment rate has matched the national average, which is not allthat bad, but it is rather bad compared to what we are used to. Thewhole sense, in an anecdotal way, is for not very much--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What is happening in the energy area? Isthere anything new?MR. BOYKIN. No, nothing that I am aware of, other than[lingering] concern and predictions, at least, of further softening inoil prices. I don't think we are hearing quite the same scaryscenario of [a decline to] something less than $20 a barrel, but westill are expecting some further decline.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Drilling activity is doing what?-12-8/20/85MR. BOYKIN. The drilling activity is down. The rig count isdown about 25 percent from what it was a year ago, I believe. It'sapproximately that in Texas.MR. RICE. But isn't it up in the most recent period?MR. BOYKIN. It's up slightly, but for the nation--MR. RICE. Not for Texas?MR. BOYKIN. For Texas--MR. FORRESTAL. It's up slightly for Louisiana.MR. BOYKIN. I was thinking we were still running about [thesame as] last time, which was about 25 percent--MR. RICE. I don't have any quarrel with the comparison to ayear earlier, but I somehow got the impression that within the lastcouple of months the rig count had climbed.MR. PARTEE. Well, that's a 25 percent drop from a pretty lownumber.MR. BOYKIN. From a pretty low number, yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, does anyone have a differenteconomic outlook?MR. AXILROD. If it were helpful, partly for purposes ofunderstanding the process, I could offer a scenario coming off of thismoney supply that would lead to maybe not much increase in real GNPbut more in nominal and prices. Assume a little further decline ininterest rates, which probably would be needed to start it, andsuppose the natural rate of unemployment is more like 7 to 7-1/4percent and that the productivity growth over time isn't going to bemuch more than 1/2 to 1 percent--taking some extreme assumptions--andthat the Committee makes a strong effort to have real GNP grow 2-1/2to 3 percent in that environment. Assume further that foreigncountries loosen up a bit--and interest rates have declined in a few.It may very well be under those circumstances that the present goodbehavior of wages would begin to unravel as people would have to bid alittle harder to get some decent labor. Commodity prices around theworld, instead of dropping, could begin rising a bit more and we couldget some rise in inflationary expectations in that environment.Because the restraint is being undone in other areas, we could at somepoint begin to get more upward pressures on prices and maybe a littlereal GNP, but not as much as many think is potential. It would bereflected more in the price element than in nominal GNP somewhere inthe fourth quarter or in the first or second quarter of next year;that wouldn't be terribly inconsistent with the strong money growththat we have had, assuming that continues for a couple of monthsahead. But all that is predicated on very weak productivity growthand attitudes in the labor market that would say the present rate ofunemployment is something like the natural rate, plus an effort topush the economy beyond what its productivity would permit.-13-8/20/85MR. BOEHNE. On the economy, the mood in my part of thecountry is better than in Bob's, but I think that has to do more withthe regional comeback than with anything of national significance.There are an awful lot of [help] wanted ads or signs in the windowsabout jobs available, but I don't see any boom. Again, I don't attacha great deal of national significance to this, because I think it isjust a regional correction from the kinds of things that we saw in theother direction in the 1970s.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There is a lot of evidence that theNortheast is doing better than other areas of the country.MR. RICE. Could I just ask Steve a question? Do you thinkthere are good reasons for expecting that a slight decline in interestrates would stimulate the economy significantly?MR. AXILROD. I don't know that a slight--MR. RICE. Well, within a range of 1/2 to 3/4 of a point.MR. AXILROD. Well, I would think that if short rates camedown 1/2 point or so with some definiteness, in the short run the longrates could come down. It would be helpful in the mortgage market andwould probably be on the stimulative side. Whether it would besufficient to get more than 1/4 or 1/2 point on real GNP over time, Idon't know, but it is certainly in that direction.MR. RICE. My guess is it wouldn't.MR. MARTIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't have a very positivescenario. I think the staff work was careful and conservative. Itseems to me that if you look at the sectors in which they are pickingup that increase in real growth from 1.7 or 1.5 percent--or whateverthe revised figure is going to turn out to be--to 3.0 percent, you getfederal spending, residential spending, inventory change, a bit ofbusiness fixed in the producer durable equipment area, and a littleincrease in consumption. But as I look at those categories and thinkof the downside risk in most of them, it seems to me that it is nottoo much like Cassandra to look at the chance of a recession. I willtake the other end of the spectrum from Steve. Certainly, we have theimbalances in this expansion. They are not the usual imbalances thatwe are used to: it isn't capacity utilization pressing against athreshold; it isn't rising interest rates. But goodness knows, thereare imbalances: the foreign trade side, the farm situation, and allthe rest of them we know about. I think that the mortgage backedsecurity market is extremely vulnerable, and that is an $80 billion ayear market. On the federal spending side, could we have a realcutback there or a real expansion for that matter? I think neither.The procurement criticisms, the resignation of one procurementofficer, and the hearings in the Congress are all constraints onWeinberger and company. So it is quite unlikely, even if they wantedto, that they could give a big push to the economy by saying they haveall of this [spending] authority, now let's spend it. Nor is itlikely, given the philosophical [mind] set of Mr. Weinberger and hisboss, that there would be the opposite--a real cutback in that area.So that's probably a small contribution on the plus side.-14-8/20/85 -15-We have spoken of the consumer. Employment is still going upa little, unlike the Europeans. The debt burden looks like it hasadjusted a little. With tax refunds coming in, those credit cardcredits have dropped a little, so maybe the debt burden can behandled. In the residential area, I think we are very vulnerable inour forecast. Jim, this will come as absolutely no surprise to you: Ithink the talk about a 16 percent spurt in residential spending isoverly optimistic. It might be half that. That's a couple percentagepoints off the growth increment maybe. I already made a comment withregard to the importance of the fixed rate mortgage, but there are theTICOR mortgage-backed security losses and private mortgage insurancecompanies are already talking about $50 to $100 [billion] in lossexposure. I don't know whether the Swiss reinsurance process is goingto work here; it has never been tested in this particular kind ofinsurance. I don't know whether REITs, as they are called, will comein and make the settlements and back up the private mortgage insurancecompanies so that you can get that $80 billion continuing as fundingfor the residential spending.MR. PARTEE. They won't do it willingly, that's for sure.MR. MARTIN. No, they won't do it willingly--not when you aretalking $50 million at a clip per company. So I think there is a realexposure there. As for inventories, goodness, what swings there are:We can get a $50 million help or we can get a $50 million hurt. Theinventory situation is puzzling all of us, in terms of its swings. Itcould help or not. So it seems to me that there are vulnerabilitieswith regard to the very careful forecast of Jim and his associates foran increase up to 3 percent real GNP. The risks are on the down sidein every one of those areas and in other areas that we all know about.The risk of recession, though, seems to turn on some kind of systemicfinancial--well, not collapse--but real troubles that are hard tohandle. I'm talking not just about the ag banks and the thrifts andall of the things that we have talked about so many times, butsystemic--[all] financial institutions [unintelligible] privatemortgage insurance companies don't pay. And the mortgage-backedsecurities side of the market--I am stretching to get the biggestfigure I can--may be in the widest sense a $350 billion market. Idon't think that is the most probable occurrence, but the risks are onthe down side. We need to keep those in mind as we set policy.MR. MORRIS. Do you also have double counting in the mortgagebacked securities in the debt number?MR. KICHLINE. No. Mortgage pools are not in the domesticnonfinancial debt aggregate. The mortgages themselves--that is, themortgage originations--are.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I normally have afairly optimistic outlook on most things in life, but I must say atthe moment that it has been damped somewhat. In our area of thecountry there has been a great deal of discussion about agricultureand what may happen. At the moment, as I think most of you know, wewill have an outstanding wheat harvest and the prediction on corn, soybeans, sorghum, and so forth is very, very good. On the other hand,there already has been a 20 to 25 percent drop in prices for those8/20/85commodities; for each of them the price is now below the break-evenpoint for production. At the same time, red meat prices, hogs andcattle, have dropped roughly 20 to 25 percent over the last 60 days.And those producers now are either at a break-even or a loss position.The energy problem somebody has mentioned--the rig count is indeeddown by 25 percent from a year ago, but it is flat or going on down inOklahoma, Wyoming, and Colorado. Mining is flat on its back.Aircraft sales, which are a fairly large component of the output inthe Tenth District are flat--flat being no sales at all unless to themilitary. As a result, there is not a great deal of happiness outsideof the metropolitan areas, where economic activity is still goingfairly strong in terms of auto production and other activity.Let me say further that I take no comfort in the budgetresolution that has been passed by Congress, because if you look atthe history of what has happened in this so-called new budgetenvironment, the budget resolution has not meant very much in thepast. Indeed this time, if you look at the agricultural sector,whether you like it or not, the government is going to end up withabout 2/3 of all of the production this year as a result of the sign-ups for CCC; the producers simply are going to walk away because thetarget prices are higher than the commodity price in the market. Andthat all is a direct tap on the Treasury.MR. PARTEE. Is that a potentially big number?MR. GUFFEY. That's a very big number--somewhere in the $24to $30 billion range. It is something like $18 billion above whatotherwise would have been projected. So in my own view, the budgetdeficit problem is far from resolution and it is going to get worserather than better. It seems to me that with respect to monetarypolicy, we have one of two choices. One is in some way to get realinterest rates down, which will help marginally in agriculture andsome of these areas; and to me the only lever we have to pull is lower[nominal] interest rates and that implies monetization of the debt.As a result I am gloomy and not very optimistic.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It doesn't sound like a highlyinflationary report.MR. GUFFEY. Not with farm commodity prices dropping.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you sense land prices are doingnow? I was talking to some farmers the other day who claimed thatthey were going down faster, if anything.MR. GUFFEY. Well, it is very difficult to tell what landprices are doing simply because there are foreclosures but there areno sales. And as a result, you can get the survey--as we do and Ithink Minneapolis and Chicago do--and it shows that they are stilldeclining. But those are numbers that are not based upon sales. Theamount of land now being held by the Farm Credit Bureau is large. Thenumbers that I know come out of Wichita and Omaha and they are verylarge numbers. Most of the agricultural banks that have been deeplyinvolved, and indeed are in trouble, are holding considerable amountsof real estate and simply have hired somebody to try to farm itbecause they can't sell it. The question, I guess, involves not onlythe gloom that already has spread, but there is a systemic problem in-16-8/20/85the financial area that evolves out of the agricultural bankingproblems that I think is very great.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.MR. KEEHN. Well, I am certainly in no way disagreeing withJim's forecast and there really is very little I can add to previousreports that I have given at other meetings. Weak sectors in theMidwest are continuing to be very weak, with no particular signs ofimprovement. And I think at this point some of these very heavyindustries really won't experience a significant change this cycle.But offsetting that, those parts of the economy that have been doingbetter continue to do well, and from that perspective the currentoutlook is pretty good. In autos, for example, the people I've talkedto say that despite some aberrations in the current numbers, theunderlying demand continues to be pretty good. Construction activityis relatively strong and consumer spending seems to be okay. Butperhaps for emphasis, I would echo Roger's comments about theagricultural situation. Land values as we look at them continue todecline. In Iowa, for example, in a statistical sense land values aredown almost 30 percent from last year and some 45 percent from thepeak. I agree with Roger that this is a statistical look at landvalues; the transactions that are occurring, are in fact [at pricesthat are] substantially under that. And given the pressure oncommodity prices, I would think that land values are going to continueto come down. Whereas in the past we have had the view that this isall containable and not systemic, I do think it is beginning to backup--both from the banking sector as well as from the farm creditsituation. In sum, with the passage of time and with continueddeterioration, it begins to take on some systemic implications.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, in the Southeast wecontinue to experience some moderation in the economic growth. Ithink what is happening there is basically an adjustment to a lessboom-like atmosphere than we had previously. While there are someareas of weakness, I think the strengths in our local economy outweighthose weaknesses at the present time. Louisiana is clearly a veryweak area at the moment because of the energy sector, agriculture, andnonresidential building. And while nonresidential building iscontinuing in the rest of the District, it is a source of concern; Ithink the absorption rates are not going to be good enough to takethis glut of office space that we are getting in most cities of theSoutheast, and I think that is going to catch up with builders andfinancial institutions before too much longer. The recent decline inthe dollar has given some hope to the textile and apparel people,although I think most of them realize that it is going to take quite along time before they feel any particular impact from that. Just aparenthetical observation: I have been very, very surprised at thestrength of the protectionist sentiment that I am hearing around theDistrict. In fact, it is not really just from around the District.For example, I had a meeting with the board of directors of a localcorporation that has directors from all over the country and thevirulence of the protectionist sentiment and the anti-Japanesesentiment was really remarkable to me. I thought we were back inWorld War II. If this is true around the country, when Congressreturns I think we are going to hear a good deal more about this.-17-8/20/85The virulence and the "them against us" sentiment was really quiteremarkable. I had no idea it was that strong.As I look at the economy as a whole, I guess I would revisemy forecast down somewhat, although basically I would agree with theGreenbook forecast both for the rest of 1985 and for 1986. Myconcerns would be that the dangers are on the down side. I think wemight be lucky if we get 3 percent growth. And I say that because Iam not very sanguine about consumer spending. Given the level ofconsumer debt and the lower personal income that has come in, I am notso sure that the consumer--although consumer confidence appears to behigh--is going to spend at quite the levels that the forecast implies.I am also not so sure about the inventory buildup. I think that thereis a feeling among many people that they don't have to build theirinventories because of the [excess] capacity that we have in thesystem--that production times are lower and, therefore, they don'thave to have as much inventory. Also, I think the uncertainties aboutthe economy are causing some people to reconsider their inventorybuildup. So given all of that, Mr. Chairman, I too am not terriblyoptimistic, although I don't fear a recession. And people I havetalked to don't fear a recession, but nobody that I have talked tosees any particular boom for the rest of the year and nobody sees anygreater danger of inflation either. So in terms of monetary policy,we are in the usual dilemma in light of the sluggishness of theeconomy and the growth of the money supply. My hunch would be that weought to stay about where we are; I will talk about that a little morelater when we get to the specifications.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comments?MR. MELZER. I don't have anything to add on the regionalside other than to say that in June we had an increase inmanufacturing employment at a 2 percent annual rate, which was anencouraging sign. But some of the other indicators are flat to down.One comment I would make is that I appreciate the risks onthe down side in the forecast as well, but I think there really issomething to be said in terms of addressing the long-term imbalancesin the economy arising out of the trade deficit and a moderate rate ofgrowth at this period of time. I know that has implications for howthe budget deficits are ultimately financed, but I think in the longerterm enduring a lower rate of growth for a period of time could bevery constructive in terms of addressing some of these imbalances.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Enduring what, these slower rates?MR. RICE. Lower rates.MR. MELZER. Yes.MR. WALLICH. I have very little to add but maybe a littlebalance on the up side. The case for a resumption of growth at anyrate of speed certainly has diminished. Still, I think thepredominant view outside this room is that [the expansion] willaccelerate a little to the 3 percent--and some people think more--range. I don't think anybody is concerned about a cumulative downturnthat in retrospect, if we hadn't done anything, would have required usto take immediate stimulative action. Even if the economy weakens a-188/20/85little further and then turns around, it would be a great mistake tohave done a great deal and found ourselves having to backtrack. SoI'd exclude from my thinking doing something expansionary. Now, onthe expectation of a stronger economy, I think we have something tolook forward to in the longer run as the main cause of our troubles.I think as the trade deficit begins to mend--at first stabilizes andthen, God willing, is very substantially diminished--that that willhave some expectational effects, though nothing very decisive in theshort run. But in regard to the possibility of an acceleration, whichdoesn't seem to be fitting very well into this conversation, thedanger that it will run too far I think is also not very great becausewe have enough leeway. In my view we are well above the natural rateof unemployment and if it were to happen that the economy speeded up,we could accept that for awhile. But that is evidently not the mainrisk that is being discussed here. I just want to argue that the riskof a significant slowing seems not very strong and the consequences offalsely assessing that seem to be quite great.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. Well, in order to counterbalance you, Henry, Iguess I would have to say that I think the possibilities of arecession are distinctly there now. The way I would visualize itoccurring is that we have had enough sapping of the strength of theeconomy through the net imports, which I don't think will level off inthe immediate future, that income growth will slow to very little.The saving rate is as low as it can get. The best forecast the staffcan give us is for really very little final demand. And with thatvery small final demand, I think the credit system will start tounwind. We have this disaster awaiting us in income properties and itis getting closer every month than it was the month before. Inaddition, as the Chairman and others have pointed out, in the last twoyears the equity buy-backs and mergers and so forth have added todebt, and [firms] just have to have increased revenue in order tosupport those quantities of debt. Without the increased revenue thatis associated with rising sales, we are going to have more and moretrouble in that category of finance also. And the farm creditsituation is so bad that it is really hard to see what could happennow that would do other than get us into a crisis. I realize thatthis is a very quiet period, but that is just because the fall has notcome and these notes have not come due yet. When they do, there aregoing to be very few people who are going to have any money to servicetheir debt. I think the fundamental source of [the problem] is theimbalance caused by the import situation, but where [the crisis] isgoing to occur, if it does occur, will be in the credit area as we getinto the fall and winter--in the credit quality problems that theeconomy now faces. I don't know that there is anything much thatpolicy can do about it. Indeed, it might be a mistake to followstrongly with expansion to try to deal with it because I think theultimate result of that would be more inflation in the country. And Iguess I have a little streak of monetarism in me too, or at least I dobelieve that in the long run money matters and that if you get a lotof money out there, sooner or later it is going to bring inflation.So I say this hesitantly because I don't have a solution to deal withit; but I do think we must recognize that recession is a distinctpossibility.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Ms. Seger.-19-8/20/85MS. SEGER. I hate to make this a bias of the Supervision andRegulation Committee, which I think is the way it will look since--MR. PARTEE. Well, if it is the right bias--MS. SEGER. --since I am on that Committee with GovernorPartee, but I agree that there is a risk of recession. I think thereal vulnerability is the financial system; I just don't know whatwill be the specific trigger to ring the bell there. I don't knowwhether it will be in farm credit, whether it will be some falloutfrom what is now going on in Maryland, or whether it will be somethingmore in the mortgage-backed securities area, but my stomach tells methat [the financial system] will be the trigger that will cause theunwinding.I had a couple of conversations recently with some peopleabout the import situation, since imported cars from Japan are a verybig portion of that total number. You might find it interesting thatDetroit, at least, does not see any big fall-off in imports. In fact,they are surprised that the Japanese reacted so quickly to the endingof the "gentlemen's agreement" or whatever you care to call it thathad been on the books for four years. Apparently, they would havesent more cars over faster but they could not get them on the ships.Now they are [on the ships] and the sales of imports would have beenstill stronger except for the strike of the car haulers; the importdealers are far more impacted by that than the domestic dealersbecause they have to get the cars from the ports to the dealer lots.Anyway, I don't see this import issue going away. I see it getting alot worse. And the "big decline in the dollar" is in terms ofweighted averages; if you look at the dollar vis-a-vis the Japaneseyen, the decline isn't that much. These people out in the trenches donot expect the Japanese--even if the dollar were to decline further--to quickly adjust the prices of the autos upward. In fact it wouldnot surprise them to see the Japanese cut car prices to get a muchbigger chunk of our market. That did not make me feel terribly good.I don't care what the theory is, but what may go on in a businessstrategy sense is very, very key to this in my judgment. Also, acouple of people I talked with are in the process of cutting theirtotal sales expectations figure. Before, they had a decline of300,000 units between the expectations for 1985 and for 1986; I don'tknow what they will come out with when they get through the revisionprocess. This is something that already is a big drag on the economyand I think it is going to get worse. Maybe I am just being aparochial Midwesterner, but I think that this is a really significantsapping of economic strength, and when the foundation gets termites init the house eventually feels it. So, that is my concern, and I dothink that lower interest rates help in these particular situations.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Stern.MR. STERN. I don't think there is any doubt that we have asluggish economy on our hands but nevertheless one that is continuingto grow. I think the sluggishness is due to the imbalances that weall have been discussing, and those stem in large measure from theforeign trade situation. I am not sure there is very much thatmonetary policy can do about that. As best I can judge the situationin our District, this rather sluggish pattern is likely to continuebecause the sectors or areas that are doing well are continuing to do-20-8/20/85well and those that are in trouble are going to remain in trouble. Ithink we are kind of stuck here without a lot of good options. If Itake the Greenbook forecast as a starting point, the one question Ihave about the outlook is the inventory situation, in part for some ofthe reasons that Bob Forrestal mentioned but also in part because Idon't know what it means when we are satisfying as much final demandas we are from abroad and what that means for domestic inventoryaccumulation. I have a concern that maybe it means that moreinventory is going to get held abroad relative to what one wouldexpect otherwise and that that is going to filter into domesticproduction and domestic inventory levels in a conservative way.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.MR. RICE. I really don't have much to add to what hasalready been said. I don't see a high risk of recession over theforecast period, but I agree with the views that have been expressedthat the risks to the forecast are on the down side. I think theprobability that we will be able to see 3 percent real growth in thesecond half is probably less than 50 percent. And I think the rate ofgrowth we get in the second half will not be satisfactory. But justas I see nothing to encourage me to believe that we are going to getsome significant acceleration, I don't see anything that is going topush us into recession; I think we are just going to bump along withslow growth. And I agree with Chuck that there is probably verylittle that monetary policy can do about that at the present timewithout making things worse.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, I feel as comfortable with theforecast in the Greenbook as I can feel, and I don't at the moment seea recession looming immediately in front of us. In terms ofdevelopments in the last 6 or 8 weeks, the thing in the economy thatprobably has surprised me most is housing. I certainly did expectthat we would see a little more spark there than we have seen, whichled me to believe that maybe this rise in delinquency rates that wehave seen in the home mortgage sector was telling us something. Buteven that doesn't seem to hold up because, for example, on closerinspection we find that the delinquency rates are higher in theNortheast than they are in the South and the West, even though thereverse pattern seems to apply in terms of where the housing shortagesare versus the surpluses. So I am at a complete loss to rationalizethat. More generally, I sense a much more acute dilemma growing outof the dollar situation than a number of the comments around the tablewould seem to imply. For one thing, barring a recession in the UnitedStates, which would obviously raise havoc with the LDC situation, Isee more risk in the possibility of some kind of sudden tumble in theexchange rate, notwithstanding all that the exchange rate implies inthe current situation for the trade account. But more importantly,when you look through the exchange rate situation and the tradeaccount, barring that precipitous drop in the exchange rate that wouldcreate its own problems, it seems to me that we are looking at a quitereal possibility for at least a couple--or maybe even three, four, orfive--years of having trade and current account deficits of $100billion, which in turn--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. To be optimistic.-21-8/20/85VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I think that's probably right.As a matter of fact, we did an exercise that suggested thateven if the exchange rate fell 25 percent over the next two years fromwhere it is now, the current account and trade deficit would tend onlyto stabilize at around $100 billion. I might add that that was withfaster growth in the industrialized countries than is now beingprojected. But regardless of what number you put on it, the fact ofthe matter is that any kind of scenario like that implies clearly awillingness on the part of foreigners to continue to accumulatedollar-denominated assets at a pretty rapid rate. And as far out inthe future as we considered, it also implies that foreigners are goingto be continuing to finance a big chunk of our budgetary deficit. Sothat situation in itself has worked itself into a classic Catch-22problem that, in my judgment, aggravates the policy dilemma to a veryconsiderable degree.Now, I would associate myself with the comments that Marthaand Chuck made on the financial situation. I too cannot quite shakethe feeling that something, someplace there could pop in anunfortunate way at any moment. But there too what to do about thatfrom a policy perspective is not at all clear. One could make anargument that the whole situation, notwithstanding the problems in theeconomy and the problems on the international side, could point moreeasily in the opposite direction from a policy perspective than whatthe economy itself would say.You raised a question, Mr. Chairman, about this energysituation. Just by way of a quick anecdote:told me the other day that when they had to bail out thatenergy bank up in this spring, in the process theyacquired some oil rigs which at that time they valued at about 35cents on a dollar. They now think they are worth a nickel to a dimeon a dollar. Now, is not the universe, but I thinkthat is symptomatic of the general situation. So I can't find much tocelebrate about here, to put it mildly. But the policy dilemmasimplicit in all of this, I think, are as acute as they have beenperhaps for a while.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe we better celebrate with a cup ofcoffee.[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would judge from the comments I heardearlier that there isn't much stomach for dramatic new initiatives atthis stage of the game, in terms of our own [policy] behavior. Ithink that is a correct conclusion. Let me just add a few comments towhat was said earlier to summarize and to put some different light onthem. I think that we are operating in a worldwide situation andsometimes we focus too much on an uncertain outlook for the domesticeconomy. What happens over a period of time, I think, is verydependent on a larger setting. Bob Forrestal mentioned being shockedby the protectionist sentiment that he heard. That gives an accuratepicture of the extent to which that sentiment has built and may bestill building. And we are going to have quite a different economicsituation, I suspect, here and around the world over the next year to18 months, if we have big protectionist legislation in the remainder-22-8/20/85of this Congressional session. I have felt myself a relative optimistin Washington in believing that this can be held off this year. Idon't have any illusions that it can held off next year, if thingsdon't improve. Many many people think that I am unduly optimistic insaying that it can be held off this year; we shall see. My optimismis not based on any great analysis other than such things as the factthat the [Congressional] Committees mainly involved that have tooriginate the legislation fortunately are tied up in tax reform and soforth. That is a political excuse for fending off some of this; Idon't know whether it will hold.Some reference was made to the dollar this morning. I thinkthis is a very sensitive area. We can all argue that the dollarshould be down for the trade balance and in time it may well have tobe. But if we achieve that lower dollar in a way that underminesconfidence in where we are going, I think we are going to have lots ofproblems. As Jerry Corrigan said, we depend on that inflow of moneyto finance the budget and maintain reasonably low interest rates. Andwhen I look ahead, this clearly is the overwhelming threat on theprice front. We are going to have to swallow a decline of the dollarover time. But how it comes is going to make a big difference as willhow fast it comes--whether it is manageable or not. I don't knowwhether it is going down, but just to draw a policy implication: It isan interesting conversation when we can talk about whether the dollarhas come down very much when it has come down 17 percent or whateverit is in about three months. By any historical standards, except thelast three or four years, that is an enormous change in the value ofthe dollar in that period of time. Of course, it followed a periodduring which it went up 17 percent, I suppose, in the previous sixmonths. It is a very unstable situation. I have a feeling that weare teetering--that is maybe stating it a little too strongly--but weare beginning to run some risk of a loss of confidence in the area.We have managed a 17 percent decline without, I think, raising a lotof concerns so far on the confidence front. I think we have to becautious about that. We face the situation in terms of the pricefront where the prices of commodities--many of which are produced inother countries rather than here and not all of them are down here, Iguess, but I can't think of a [unintelligible] one--are just terriblylow in terms of historical experience relative to other prices. [Theyare below the cost of] American production anyway; I don't knowwhether they are below the cost of foreign production. Some day theyprobably will have to go up somewhat; but they don't seem to be movingin that direction now. There are deflationary forces in certaincontexts of the economy; there is no doubt that the prices of servicesare still going up. I think this is a long-term problem; we can'tcure that in the short run.I don't have anything to add on all the domestic financialstrains that were mentioned by a number of people earlier. I wouldjust report that I think the international debt situation is in aperiod of some fermentation and if we have a break it could easilycome there. It's not that it would put us under any greater economicstrain at the moment but it certainly could put us under greaterpolitical strain. There is a great deal of restiveness in that area;whether people are going to jump the [unintelligible] and follow themore aggressive interpretations of the Peruvian situation is very muchin doubt.-23-8/20/85Finally, looking at the growth in industrialized countries,there may be some room for feeling a little better. They have takensome easing measures, largely in response to the weakness of thedollar. I think that is one of the constructive repercussions of thedecline in the dollar, but those measures have come pretty late. Ifyou just look at the outlook there, it is hard to build up a greatfeeling that there is going to be great support for the world economy;it may not be a deterioration but you don't get any sense of greatexuberance abroad.I don't think we ought to get in the mood that these problemsare all unsolvable. They are going to take a lot of work, even in themonetary policy area, and in the regulatory area and other areas.Monetary policy has something to do with how it comes out. Myinterpretation of your views is that this isn't the time for strongnew tightening or easing, and I share that view. We have edgedinsubstantially tighter in this intermeeting period, reflectingprimarily the more rapid growth in M1. I think our discussion lasttime suggested that that would be appropriate. We started out with anotional $350 million borrowing level and never hit it in fact--notalways deliberately. As the period went on we became more cautious inthe provision of reserves but only slightly so. So, I think somethinglike an unchanged approach would imply $400 million plus on borrowing.I could conceive of a little more substantial tightening if peoplethought that was appropriate, but I don't know how other people feelabout that. So let's proceed and get more precise. I don't have anyfeelings about these various [draft] directives, not having read themuntil about 10 minutes ago. I might just say as a preliminary thoughtthat I am not sure these directives--depending on what we do--are veryaccurate reflections anymore of what we think. We really ought tothink about rewriting them in a more basic way, but I don't think wecan do that in the next--MR. PARTEE. We have had a sort of informal desire not tochange the directives in the mid-quarter meeting. It will be prettyhard to avoid that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We will have to change M1. I would liketo say that the latest figures that we have on M1 are not terriblydifferent. They don't suggest any [big change] in the M1 estimates.If anything, they are consistent with a less optimistic view--if thatis the way to express it. They are slightly stronger but growth isnot substantially different from the very high August number we weretalking about.MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I would favor moving a littleinsubstantially in the direction of--I wouldn't say tightening, but oftrying to rein in M1 a bit more. The main reason I feel this way isbecause the credibility of the Federal Reserve and its targetingprocedures may well be at stake at some point soon, and I wouldn'tlike to see us lose that credibility. So, I would like to indicatesome perceptible move or effort toward bringing M1 back toward the topof the band by the end of the year. I don't want to do anythingsubstantial, as I said; I just want to indicate that we want M1 tomove back. So I would be in favor of doing a little more thanalternative B and possibly a little less than alternative C, if thatcould be done. And I would even be prepared to see borrowing around$500 million. But my main concern would be to show some concern for-24-8/20/85what has been happening to M1. There is a lot of liquidity out therenow and I don't think that a slight rise in interest rates will haveany perceptible effect on the economy at this point any more than Ifeel that a slight decline in interest rates will have any effect onthe economy.MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I pretty much agree with theeconomic outlook as discussed here earlier. In the West it isessentially flat or down in most traditional areas: mining,manufacturing, and agriculture. Those things that are going well area number of the service industries, whether financial services ortelecommunication, and of course defense is going through somewhat ofa boom. But by and large it is hard to see anything that is going topush the economy up with any real vigor and our staff forecast isessentially the same as the Greenbook forecast. I would agree withJim Kichline that, if anything, the 3 percent real GNP growth in thesecond half has more risk on the down side than the up side. While I,too, have a streak of monetarism in me, I am prepared to ignore thisovershoot of M1 as long as we have this peculiar and unusual, andhopefully not permanent, behavior of M1 in terms of the decline invelocity--whether it is a shift in money demand or differentelasticities than we thought existed. I would be prepared to overlookthat overshoot because of the risk of possible recession, although Ithink the risk is more toward sluggish growth. Therefore, all thingsconsidered, bottom line I am essentially in agreement with theposition you expressed: that this is not the time to make anysignificant moves, either easing or tightening. I think thatalternative B pretty much expresses the sort of policy I would like tosee between now and the next meeting, with a borrowing targetsomewhere in the range that was specified in alternative B of $350 to$450 million, probably centered on $400 million.MR. KEEHN. My view would be very consistent with Emmett'scomments. It does seem that we want to be very careful of what we do.But we have a high trajectory of the aggregates, particularly M1, andI also think that we need to begin to scale down as we come toward theend of the year. So I would end up being in favor of alternative B.I'd also move up the borrowings just very slightly to about the $500million range, as a way to begin to take these initial steps.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me interrupt the flow here because Iforgot to get confirmation of the transactions of the domestic Desk.It occurs to me now and I raise it now or I will forget about.SPEAKER(?). So moved.SPEAKER(?). Second.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection. Mr. Black.MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I am very close to Emmett Rice onthis. Even if we are in the midst of a one-time downward shift in M1velocity such as apparently occurred in 1982-83, or if we have a oneor two percentage point drop in the long-term trend of velocity, stillI think by any measure that a rate of increase of 11.5 percent sincelast October has to have provided plenty of financial underpinningsfor expansion. I am concerned that we will run into this credibilityproblem that Emmett outlined very clearly, so I think we ought to take-25-8/20/85an unequivocal action to try to bring M1 down somewhere near at leastthe top of its long-term range. Alternative C seems about the rightsort of alternative to me. But in addition to selecting this path, itis important that we also think about our methodology a bit, becausemerely choosing that path doesn't insure that we will hit it. I thinkthat we ought to be prepared to take some kind of action to hit this.The relationship between the level of borrowed reserves and the growthof M1 is very tenuous and we keep getting fooled by that. I think itis going to be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to predictthat, so I would like to see us insert in our operating instructionsto the Desk something a little more explicit. We have provided thatactions will be taken in the light of what is happening in theeconomy, what is happening in the domestic markets, the foreignexchange markets, inflation, and the like. And I would like to passon firm instructions to Peter that we would raise our borrowed reservetarget if we start exceeding that unless the economy shows decidedsigns of weakening beyond what we now expect. It has been very hard,at least for me anyway, to know what was going to be done once we leftthis meeting in the way of actions in the intermeeting period. And Iwould like to see us tighten up those procedures if I can persuade youto do so.MS. HORN. Well, Mr. Chairman, as seems to be the consensusof this Committee, I don't find any reason to argue for much changetoday in the way we are conducting policy. So I would come outwanting more of the same, which would be alternative B in my mind.However, I would associate myself with some previous speakers whosaid, with a background of a pretty reasonable forecast in theGreenbook and a background of quite a bit of liquidity in the economy,that we can't go on at this rate forever. So I would like to suggestthat some more insubstantial tightening, as the period progresses andas we see events unfold, might be appropriate. And it might beappropriate--more than accomplishing something substantive in terms ofthe growth rate of money--just as a small signal to markets that infact we think it can't go on forever and that we are waiting for theright time to take further action. I suppose that would be reflectedin the directive, based on the same kind of language we used the lasttime--that is, the "would" and "might"--that we would react in theevent of higher-than-expected growth and might on the lower side.MR. MELZER. My view would be very similar to what GovernorRice expressed at the beginning. I think we have an opportunity herepossibly to slow down the rate of reserve growth without a substantialimpact on rates. I was struck by the fact that banks apparently havebeen running off some of their term liabilities, the Fed has snuggedperhaps imperceptibly here over the last period, reserve growth hasslowed down, and yet in terms of the impact on the funds rate reallyall we washed out probably was an unwarranted expectation that therewould be a further cut in the discount rate. We really have notfirmed beyond the equilibrium level we thought funds might trade atwith a slightly easier borrowing target. I asked Peter before aboutdealers' positions; they seem to be in pretty good shape. So I thinkthere is an opportunity here possibly to slow down the rate of growthof reserves somewhat and perhaps buy a little more flexibility for thefuture, particularly against the backdrop of 14 percent money growthexpected in August. We don't have a lot of flexibility in terms ofcredibility in foreign exchange markets and so forth to ease reservepositions without damaging that credibility. So I think there is an-26-8/20/85opportunity here, as I say, to buy some flexibility for the futurewithout a dramatic impact on rates. I would say that "C" is toodramatic a shift, but I would position myself somewhere between "B"and "C;" perhaps a target of $500 million is about appropriate.MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, to adhere at this time to anemphasis on the monetary aggregates, which has been [our approach]since 1979 or at least from 1979 to 1982, is not justified by what weknow about them or what we can predict in terms of the pattern ofchange in the aggregates, particularly in M1. Well, let me correctmyself: the narrow aggregate is still behaving in a pattern outsidethe modeling of projections plus or minus some standard error. Ithink there is increasing merit to the thesis that there has been ashift in the demand curve. It seems to me that there's a cumulativeeffect on the public of financial crises in state after state and intype of institution after type of institution. I am not just talkingabout Ohio and Maryland and thrifts in California and industrial loancompanies in Utah and institutions in Texas and so forth; I'm thinkingof the cumulative effect on the public's consciousness of thisconstant news about failed financial institutions following a multi-decade period in which nobody failed. Take Chicago--pardon me Silas--where the two biggest S&Ls and the two biggest banks, the fourdominant financial institutions there, are on sufferance. There'sBank of America, Seafirst, Financial Corporation of America, TexasCommerce--you could go on and on. [There are problem] maritime loans,energy loans, and now real estate loans.I think we will see more evidence as time goes by that therehas been a shift in the demand curve. And for us now to gear ourpolicies around bringing M1 down simply is not warranted given theextreme degree of uncertainty. So I would not support any move whichwould raise interest rates at this time. Think of the leverage--I usethe term badly--that interest rates have in the foreign exchangemarkets, in less developed countries, in debt coverage servicing, andon and on. While we should not dismiss M1 entirely, of course, wedon't know [what drives] M1 at this time. Eventually we will; ex postwe will look back on this period and say it was quite obvious that X,Y, and Z were the reasons why M1 behaved in the way it did. So, do welose credibility if we continue to treat M1 the way we have? No oneknows. But we have a Chairman who communicates pretty well with thefinancial community. After all, we have sublimated or at least setaside to some degree the narrow aggregate to date; we have two otheraggregates and we have the debt number and other measures; and we havean able spokesman here. What I am trying to say here is to someextent heresy and that is that I think in this six-week period weshould concentrate more on the fed funds rate in the execution ofpolicy. I would mean by that that we would keep the rate exactlywhere it is now. We would not let it drift up or push it up as somehave advocated. I believe we can maintain credibility by maintainingthe rate. While I would go for "B," I would hope that in theimplementation by the Chairman and the staff that we would keep ratesrelatively stable. I think stable interest rates might be acontribution to this short-run period. We have heard of stable rates;we have experienced those--it is hard to remember--and I think thatmight add to our credibility and to some measure of stability in anunstable world. It might even add stability to the decline, andhopefully the gradual decline, in the dollar. I would hope in thatregard, Mr. Chairman, that in the [wording of the directive] we would-27-8/20/85move the [reference to] foreign exchange markets up in position and/orhave language indicating that we are paying considerably moreattention to that part of the directive.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just in the interest of clarity, where doyou interpret the federal funds rate to be?MR. MARTIN. Well, I was going by the report of our StaffDirector who said 7-5/8, 7-3/4, 8 percent. I would hope that theChairman wouldn't see fit to go above 8 percent, and I would thinkthat would be consistent with about $350 to $450 million in borrowingand whatever excess reserve path goes along with a cap of 8 percent.I wouldn't want to see 8 percent in the directive but I would hope--failing some gyration in the dollar, which I think is the thing thatwould be a more important factor now--that we could keep it at 8percent to 7-1/2 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Having had this strong endorsement of Ml,I think it is appropriate that we turn to Mr. Morris.MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I agree with everything thatGovernor Martin said. The outlook is extremely uncertain. I don'tthink there is very considerable risk of a recession developing, but Ithink there is a considerable risk of a sub-optimal [economic] growthrate, more of the same that we have had in the first half. And itseems to me that there is no need for even a moderate upward movementin interest rates until we have some conviction that the economyreally is strengthening, and I don't see that in the numbers yet. Isee it in the forecast, but I don't see it anywhere else. As to thiscredibility issue, it seems to me that if we were in a position wherethe credibility of the Federal Reserve was rather shaky, one couldmake a case for moving--despite the uncertainty about the economicoutlook--simply because a loss of credibility would have veryimportant consequences in the foreign exchange market, for example.But I don't see that as I observe the foreign exchange market. Idon't see participants in that market worried about the FederalReserve following inflationary monetary policies. So I don't see thatthere is a need, in order to maintain our credibility, to do somethingthat we don't think necessarily has to be done because of the state ofthe economy. So it seems to me that a stand-pat policy is anappropriate policy here.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, Governor Martin made myspeech for me as well. Given the state of the economy--the sluggishnature of what is going on and an outlook not all that marvelous--Ithink money market conditions are about where they should be. I don'treally see any case for tightening except if one wanted to concentrateon the narrow money supply. I think that would only exacerbate thetrade problem. Equally, I don't see a great need for any significanteasing. I would be a little concerned about the effect of anyappreciable easing on the foreign exchange market. The dollar needsto come down but, as you indicated earlier, a free-fall is certainlynot what we want. Given all of those factors and all of theuncertainties that we have in the markets, I would think that stayingwhere we are is right. And if that means letting M1 run over thetarget, I think we just have to let that happen and explain it as best-28-8/20/85we can. So, I would opt for a stand-pat policy, and that to metranslates into alternative B with a directive that would beasymmetric leaning toward alternative A. I think the borrowing levelof $350 to $450 million, centering around $400 million, is aboutright.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.MR. PARTEE. Well, this certainly is a time that separatesthe sheep from the goats! I am not enough of a monetarist to be ableto bring myself to do something because of the behavior of themonetary numbers that has absolutely no confirmation in the realeconomy or in the outlook for the real economy as we can see it.Indeed. I would be in favor of easing if it were not for the monetaryaggregates--MR. RICE. So would I.MR. BLACK(?). I would too.MR. PARTEE. --because I think we are going through a verydifficult period in which a little ease in rates might not hurt. Itmight be pushing on a string and it might not accomplish too much, butit certainly would not hurt. I am also quite bothered by the foreignexchange market. I think that Jerry and Paul are right: that we couldget quite a drop in that. And I suppose a material move toward easierrates would increase the odds that that would be true. I think alsothat there is a little question about the credibility of the FederalReserve developing out there. I have seen quite a few reports andheard from quite a few people who say: "Well, we don't see anyinflation immediately but you really are setting the stage for it--youare providing all of the liquidity--and we think the result of this isgoing to be inflationary in the long run."MR. MORRIS. It is not showing up in the bond market or theforeign exchange market.MR. PARTEE. I think it's showing up in the foreign exchangemarket and I think it's showing up a little in the precious metalsmarket. And I believe that is something that we have to be somewhatconcerned about. But, as I said, I just cannot bring myself totighten interest rates--to be specific about what tightening means--onaccount of this behavior in M1. Therefore, I guess I am stuck prettymuch where the Chairman was, except I would sort of like to see thefunds rate drift back to about 7-1/2 percent, where it was when westarted out, rather than see it cruise along in the high 7s--at 7-3/4to 8 percent. I think there probably has been a little questioningout there in the market as to whether these numbers mean that therehas been some [slight] tightening that has been planned by the FederalReserve, so I guess that would mean that I would lean toward the lowside on this range of borrowings. A $500 million level certainlyseems too high to me; $350 to $400 million I think would probably doit and I hope that M1 comes back [within its range]. That certainlyis not a plan to bring M1 back; that's a hope that M1 will come backwhile we continue what is, in market terms, an unchanged policy.MR. BOEHNE. Well, I feel most comfortable with staying wherewe are with alternative B--not because I think it is the right place-29-8/20/85to be, but because I just feel uncomfortable about either tighteningor loosening. The more interesting question, as we go past theinitial couple of weeks after this meeting, is: What kinds ofcircumstances would cause one to want to change that to eithertightening or loosening? Someone earlier brought up the point that weought to harden up the procedures. I don't see how we can do that. Ithink that we are just in a highly judgmental period. However, my ownbias is that we ought to have a significant burden of proof [beforemoving] in either direction at this point. I would go into the periodwith pretty much an open mind--a symmetrical mindset as far as thedirective goes. I could foresee circumstances in which looseningwould be the better way or, conceivably, tightening, but I don't thinkwe can nail down those procedures in any meaningful way. But I wouldnot want to see a substantial change in reserve provision unless therewere some really pretty good reasons and not just somewhat marginalchanges.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich. No, Mr. Stern first.MR. STERN. I would favor alternative B with a slight tilttoward alternative C; that, in my mind, is associated with borrowingof perhaps $400 to $500 million. This credibility issue seems to meto be a troublesome one because in the abstract it can cut both ways.There are risks in ignoring M1 and there are also risks in reacting toan aggregate whose behavior we don't seem to understand very well. Atleast in my mind the foreign exchange market is perhaps decisive atthis juncture and it seems to be expressing some doubts about the kindof disciplined policy that is being pursued in this country. Largelyfor that reason I would tilt in the direction of "C," as I indicated.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay, Governor Wallich.MR. WALLICH. I would not want to see a great change inpolicy. I would like to lean toward the harder side just todemonstrate our good faith with having rebased and then set a newrange. I agree that M1 is very dubious; I think there has been ademand curve change. Nevertheless, I think credibility is anobjective fact. It's not what people think; it's the way they aregoing to forge expectations and the way they are going to react toother things we do. So there is an investment there and something isat stake. I think "B," if I read the Bluebook correctly, would by thefourth quarter or the end of the year get us back close to the cone.Is that right, Steve?MR. AXILROD. That's the projection, but the projections havebeen consistently wrong.MR. WALLICH. As of now, one could say that we aim to bringM1 back on track by the end of the year. That, I think, is arespectable reaction to the overshooting of a not-very-reliablevariable.MR. PARTEE. It takes a small fourth quarter to do that.MR. BLACK(?). It sure does; it's moving away.MR. RICE(?). He doesn't give it a very high probability.-30-8/20/85CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's his best guess. It has a probabilityof 10 percent!MR. WALLICH. I would not invest a great deal in the effortto bring it back. I think there have been a great many challengesfrom sensible people to our credibility and I would like to establisha record of having tried, without doing any serious damage by doingso. So, I think "B" and going to $500 million with the funds ratewhere it is now--it could be 8 percent--and the same funds rate rangethat we have now.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. For reasons I stated before, I'm inthe "B" camp with a little tilt toward the "C" camp as well. I thinkthere is something at least at the margin to this credibility questionright now, so that reinforces my own thinking. As far as thespecifics are concerned, I would have borrowing of $400 to $450million going perhaps as high as $500 million if we got into troubleon the exchange rate. But barring that, I think $400 to $450 millionshould do it. I would have a very modest preference--certainly nothingI would go to war about--for specifying the aggregates at 8-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent. But that's symbolic.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.MR. BOYKIN. I would also look at "B," obviously for all thereasons that have been stated. My tilt--and it would be a very slighttilt--would be toward "C," which would be a very slight increase. Ido have concern about the credibility problem; what is happening to M1is extremely difficult to explain. I think some stability, if youwill, in interest rates would not be bad. I start getting a littlenervous when I hear words that seem to say that we need to peg the fedfunds rate. I get uncomfortable with that. That would not be theobjective, but some stability would be good. Borrowings of about $450million would be all right with me.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Seger.MS. SEGER. I was thinking about the objectives set at thelast meeting and the fact that a position of no change in reservepressure produced borrowing going from $350 million up to about $800million in one of the maintenance periods and an average above $500million in the other periods, and short and intermediate rates creptup something in the neighborhood of 35 to 50 basis points, dependingupon which series you look at. So, if that is what no changeproduced, then I guess today I would like to vote for alternative A,which is an easing. My thinking is that maybe an easing position orless pressure on reserves will produce no change in rates, which iswhat I think is really needed. In fact, I would like to see therecent uptick unwound or undone and the borrowings back to the targetmentioned last time. So I guess I will vote for alternative A with aborrowings target of about $300 to $350 million.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just in the interest of clarity, thedecision last time was something like $350 million tilted toward thehigh side, with the directive saying that we might move higher if themoney supply was higher.-31-8/20/85MS. SEGER. But I thought it was in the context of someother--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In the context of some other things aswell. But the dollar was down and the economy [unintelligible]. Now,we had an odd week in there.MR. PARTEE. If I understood Mr. Black correctly, we didn'ttighten enough, given the aggregates.MR. BLACK. But I dissented in May because I thought 6percent was too much; we got twice that much and so--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey, I guess you're the only oneleft out.MR. GUFFEY. That may have been intentional, Mr. Chairman. Ithink that everything has been said. In my view, we are neutered withregard to policy at the moment.MR. BLACK. We are neutered?MR. GUFFEY. We are neutered to the extent that we don't knowwhat is happening in M1 and we don't know what is going to happen tothe economy and, as a result, I don't see any reason to change policy.Thus, if "B" represents no change, that's my preference.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would rather describe it as a wellbalanced, astute, careful--. We have a great predominance, obviously,for "B" with some shadings as to what that means. Now, in what wayshould that be tilted? A range of $350 to $500 million encompassesalmost everybody's view; that's a wider range than we normally talkabout. I want to be ecumenical in this exercise. What are borrowingsrunning this week?MR. STERNLIGHT. We are using $400 million in the path; ithas been averaging, through yesterday, slightly over $500 million.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where were we last time?MR. STERNLIGHT. The last full two-week period was $480million.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well?MR. RICE. No change from where we are now.MR. PARTEE. That's $400 million.MR. RICE. No, we were a little over--around $500 million.MR. PARTEE. No, they're targeting $400 million.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's where you can read it one way oranother, depending.-32-8/20/85MR. AXILROD. Governor Partee, we have to write down anumber, so we wrote down $400 million. But I think, in essence, ithas been $350 to $450 million.MR. PARTEE. Well, my point is that this doesn't say where ithappened to have come out; the [issue] isn't where we are now. It'swhat we were planning, targeting, expecting to do. That is where weare now.MR. MORRIS. Even if we aren't there.MR. PARTEE. It's always either above or below.MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if we could consider someflexibility as we look out, along the lines suggested by Ed Boehne.If growth in the aggregates should slow markedly, we could move towardease rather promptly. But if they continue to grow at current rates,we could tilt in the other direction.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's one variable. We would haveto define that a little more. Given what we have now on the moneysupply, it would be awfully hard to get that down over the next threeor four weeks to a figure that to many people seems low for thequarter. I guess this doesn't answer your question. It just raisesthe question of what you mean by weak.MR. RICE. I would say the rate of growth is weak if it slowsto the 8 percent area.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. For the quarter?MR. RICE. For the quarter.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not objecting to what you say,I'm just saying that as a practical matter--MR. RICE. It's not going to do that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it might. But we're not going toknow until shortly before the next meeting. That doesn't say weshouldn't do it. But since we are going to get a high August, to getdown to 8 percent we would have to have--. The projection already isfor a lower September. I don't know when we next meet; it's the firstof October. It might become apparent along about September 20 unlesssomething very surprising happens. I'm not saying you're wrong; Ijust wanted--MR. RICE. Yes, I understand.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we put it in that kind of number, thereis no substantial prospect of easing purely on the M1 number for amonth. That may be all right, but I just want to make clear theimplication of what you're saying.MR. PARTEE. We had specified 5 to 6 percent.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. For the quarter, anyway.-33-8/20/85CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The only way it could be different wouldbe if we had a $5 billion drop or something like that right away. Itwould have to happen in next week's figures. If I were to write downa number, I would say $400 to $500 million, depending upon theaggregates and the dollar. If the economic news clearly weakened, wewould have to say that we may go below it. If the money supplyremained very strong, or if the combination of a strong money supplyand a declining dollar produced a progressive loss of confidence orloss of credibility, if that's the right word--I'm very chary of thecredibility argument for all the reasons that have been stated. [Wecould have] a great increase of credibility with the monetarists inthe short run and if the economy plunges into recession or we have agreat financial crisis, we will suffer an enormous loss of credibilityin a more basic sense.MR. RICE(?). An insubstantial change, though, is unlikely todo that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't expect that to happen. Ithink there is something to this credibility issue as appreciated bythe markets. Whether or not it's dependent upon M1, I am not so sure.But I think there's something to it. It's not the only factor. Itdepends upon what's happening to bond prices, the gold price, thedollar, and the economy. Well, I have to get some expression ofconsensus here. I'd say $400 to $500 million; $450 million is notmuch different. A lot of people just said $350 to $450 million, alittle lower than what we have been running.MR. MARTIN. How about $350 to $500 million and a funds rateof 7-1/2 to 8 percent?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That $350 to $500 million is a wider bandthan we have been expressing, but I don't think it's unrealistic. Thestarting point or the center of gravity is $425 million, if I averagethe $350 and $500 million.MR. PARTEE. Well, I wouldn't want to specify the funds rate.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think that Governor Martin issuggesting that; he's thinking that's the center of gravity of thefunds rate with this.MR. MARTIN. I wouldn't want to specify it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just try that, in the interest ofevoking a response. I don't know what the $350 to $500 million means,except where we start. It's kind of an acceptable range within whichborrowing would be varied--nothing much different happening from whatwe have now--depending upon short-term tactics. It says that thenumber that Mr. Axilrod would write down would be $425 million. Ifthings changed enough so that we deliberately would go above $500million or below $350 million, it might be a point where we would havean intermeeting consultation anyway.MR. KEEHN. If, say, M1 in September came in on the low side,the way that Steve suggested in the Bluebook, does that mean that infact we would move the borrowing down to $350 million, whereas if that-34-8/20/85expectation does not come to pass--if we have a higher number--wewould aim toward the $500 million? Is that the operative translation?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I am afraid I cannot translate itquite that simply. You have to tell me some other things that aregoing to happen too. It would certainly go in that direction, if youwere just looking at M1. But, if you were telling me that M1 growthwas going down at the same time housing starts were coming in at 2million a year and leading indicators were shooting up and everybodywas feeling ebullient about the economy, it might or might not.MR. KEEHN. I was assuming all other things might be equal.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All other things equal, I would tend toagree with you. But if the economy looked as sluggish as it did andall the rest--. I would also remind you: We have worried about thedollar falling in an atmosphere of lack of confidence, but if thedollar for some reason were very strong in this period--I don't thinkwe expect that--that would be a factor I'd put certainly on the sideof taking my chances with M1. It wouldn't be an atmosphere suggestinglack of confidence and credibility and all of the rest.MR. MORRIS. Did we contemplate buying foreign [currencies]in a situation when the dollar is rising?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if it rose exceptionally I would.I'm not [sure] the Treasury would even though it would seem to makelots of sense.MR. MORRIS(?). Has anyone talked to the Treasury in thatforward-looking sense?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have not found that terribly productivebut I think if that happened, the question would be raised.MR. KEEHN. Hearing the way you described that range,certainly from my point of view that would be an acceptable approach.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Anyone else like to respond to that?MR. RICE. Well, the range is fine; the midpoint is not.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You want an assymmetrical midpoint.MR. PARTEE. The midpoint being $425 million?MR. RICE. The midpoint being $425 million.MR. PARTEE. It is a little high.MR. RICE. A little low.MR. MARTIN. It must be about right!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is what makes a horse race. Well,--MR. PARTEE. Of course, if something happens: say, the moneysupply comes in stronger than has been projected or other things8/20/85happen in the economy, you would expect borrowing to run above that.We are talking about a beginning range, aren't we, for the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I would interpret this ordinarily aswhere we are. As I said, we just start at $425 million here. And youare right, within experience. But I guess I would interpret this widemargin as saying that something outside of that--not necessarily[unintelligible] obviously--might be the occasion for a little mid-meeting discussion.MR. PARTEE. So, unless something pushes it rather stronglyin one direction or another, it does become the operating range forthe period. It is different than what we have done before.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think this will be a little differenttwist. There is some mistake, I guess, to reading this[unintelligible] as you tell me. But I think this is a littledifferent from saying, for instance, $425 million and then raising ita little or [lowering it] without specifying the reasons. Excuse me,did somebody have something to say down there?MR. GUFFEY. Well, I am a bit puzzled. We are in the middleof August now, and if the projections for the money supply in Augustare somewhat correct, there would have to be a very dramatic movementit would seem to me from the projected 4 percent in September for usto move off the $425 million.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you are only looking at the moneysupply.MR. GUFFEY. Okay. I am satisfied with the answer then.MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, just to clarify one thing: I amnot sure what the Committee feels or what you individually believeabout the dollar. My own personal view is that continuation of agradual unwinding of the dollar from the excessively high valueprobably would be for the good of the country--just thinking of theimport-export situation. I hope that it will continue and that agradual orderly drop in the dollar would not trigger our moving uptoward the upper end of the borrowing range. I'd like to hear whatyour views are, though.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if I could blink my eyes and wake uptomorrow with a lower dollar and no accompanying change in attitudes[as a result of] that, I might argue that that is a good thing. Butthat is an impossible scenario. The question is: How do we get alower dollar if that is what we inevitably have to get over time,without throwing inflation off course, interest rates off course, andwithout overshooting on the down side, in some short-term senseanyway, and if that would bring more pressure on the industrial sectorthan we can stand because we are so far behind the eight ball there?And we do have to shift literally--it is going to happen. It's notgoing to happen in the [unintelligible] but it may happenexpectationally and in terms of prospects. What does it come to now,Mr. Truman, with a $150 billion trade deficit--maybe 15 percent of ourmanufacturing output? If we went from where we are now to balance intwo years or three years we wouldn't have the capacity to meet [the-36-8/20/85export demand] without a lot of inflationary pressures, I am afraid,assuming the economy generally isn't otherwise in recession.MR. PARTEE. Yes.MR. TRUMAN. Yes. It depends on how you think capacity wouldbe going otherwise. But it is clear that demand depends on what elseis going on.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are at what [on manufacturing capacity]--roughly 80 percent--if you believe these figures?MR. TRUMAN. We have done a crude calculation that wouldsuggest on one scenario that, in fact, we would be over 100 percent onthe capacity utilization index, if--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is not going to [happen]. It isanother way of saying it is impossible to correct the trade balance inthat timeframe. But if we had a set of conditions that went in thatdirection and put in that kind of potential demand on our capacity,even though we could not meet it in three years, we would have a[difficult] circumstance in the manufacturing sector of the economy interms of sustainability, inflationary pressures, or whatever. Lookingat this more broadly here, we are importing 3 percent or more of theGNP. We are consuming 3 percent more than we are producing. If wecorrect that, we are going to have to have some period of time whenconsumption is rising by 3 percent less than GNP. Countries don'tfind that very easy to do. It means lower real incomes. Ifproductivity were rising by 3 percent a year, which it is not--.Let's be realistic about it; it could be rising by 1 percent a year;so it takes three years' growth of productivity to do that withoutincreases in real income.MR. PARTEE. On John's question, Paul: I think that is areasonable question. He was talking about the exchange rate, not therate of change in the balance of trade.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I got off the question a bit but--MR. PARTEE. Was it a 4 percent decline since the lastmeeting?MR. TRUMAN. A little more than that.MR. KICHLINE. It was a little over 4 percent.MR. PARTEE. A little more than that. Is that too much?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not too much if it doesn't--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. The problem is that there is athreshold level in there someplace.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. One would hope to get it down asfast as when it first began coming down and get it over with and thenhave a feeling of greater stability. Could we take another 4 percent[decline]? That depends, really. If people thought we were concernedabout 4 percent and concerned about the inflationary impact, we would8/20/85get a different situation. What I would fear the most is a feelingthat we were driving it down, that we were easing policy to drive thedollar down, saying "Let's get this thing going." That, I think, isfraught with danger.MR. BALLES. Well, I would certainly agree.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The situation with that 4 percent may bethat it's the first 10 percent of a 40 percent drop. So long as thereis a feeling that it's not getting out of hand, I think--MR. CROSS. It's very unrealistic, isn't it, to think that wecould really have a soft landing that people talk about? Graduallymoving the dollar down and having this not generate all kinds ofresponses that would accelerate it and make it happen in 10 minutes--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's my problem. We may just have animpossible problem. But to the extent the dollar is declining becausepeople feel genuinely better about let's say, Germany and Japan--. Orit could decline against sterling. Sterling got very low and to theextent that people feel that was overdone and sterling went up, oneresult would be a decline in the dollar exchange rate. But I don'tthink that is the kind of thing that sets off great expectationalmovements in the rate; it is much less likely to. I don't know how toquantify it.MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I could ask Sam toexplain a bit further why he thinks that a soft landing for the dollaris a very unrealistic possibility.MR. CROSS. Well, if you are really talking about a softlanding, a continuing steady decline, it seems to me that all thepeople who are sitting there holding dollars are going to beinfluenced by what they see going on. And I think they will eitheranticipate it continuing or take other steps, and it just won't golike that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Just in conceptual terms: If therewere a firm feeling in the market that the dollar was going to declinegradually, I assure you it would decline suddenly.MR. CROSS. It would happen overnight once they--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now, it might not be the worst thing inthe world if it happened--if, as I say, you woke up tomorrow and thedollar was 10 percent lower and people said: "That is the end of it.We are down there now. We have great confidence in the dollar at thislower level." That would be great, but I--MR. CROSS. It is not going to happen that way.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The question is whether they think thefirst 10 percent is--MR. BALLES. It's hard to get from here to there.MR. CROSS. It is impossible.-38-8/20/85VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Long before we got any of thebenefits on the trade side we would get the financial effects of thatkind of sudden drop. It would be very messy.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, it is not even the suddenness. Ithink we are getting along within limits. If it were sudden andpeople thought it was over, that's fine. But I don't know how youarrange that particular scenario. What you want is a littleconstructive uncertainty in the market concerning all the ways itcould go.MR. CROSS. You would have to have it move [down] and go up alittle and then sideways and then everybody would wonder [which way]it is going. That is the only way you can get there.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we have been pretty lucky so far,that is, with what the dollar has been doing in a very compressed timeperiod. But it is so compressed that markets are not going to forgetthat this trend is pretty clear and sharp. Even though we may getstability for one week, it may go down 2 percent the next week. Sofar we have been able to play that quite nicely--again by luck, lotsof luck. Whether we can continue that, I don't know; it is the bestscenario we could have.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. You get stories even from theJapanese people who theoretically are in longer-term Treasurysecurities that they have this calibrated down to the tee in terms ofwhat set of expectational circumstances with regard to the decline inthe dollar would make them move and move fast.MS. SEGER. What if today's levels of exchange rates areconsistent with still higher deficits in the balance of trade?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That may be, and that is a reason why thedollar has to come down. But that does not tell you how to get thereeasily. We cannot cure the underlying problem that we are borrowing$150 billion a year abroad.MR. GUFFEY. Or $200 billion at home.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And that you can't dispense with thatwithout it having other consequences.MS. SEGER. Well, the American banks would buy governmentsecurities and make less consumer loans and tighten up their standardsthere. Is that all bad?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. And never sell them.MR. TRUMAN. You'd have less consumption.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Within limits it is probably not all bad.But you are saying tighten up on consumer loans, tighten up on allother kinds of loans. What you are saying is higher interest rates.That is one consequence, I agree.-39-8/20/85MR. WALLICH. Well, at this level of capacity utilizationwhat would it do? Three percent of GNP would be about 4 to 5 percenton capacity utilization.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know. You have to look atmanufacturing capacity. That is where? You say [85] percent?MS. SEGER. Well, you have to look industry-by-industry too.MR. WALLICH. Manufacturing.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Truman has a subtotal of 100 percentcapacity utilization.MR. TRUMAN. Yes, but that's with no give.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that is probably exaggerated alittle.MR. TRUMAN. That is simply the counterpart to your [85]percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's not going to happen that fast. Butthe tendency, with a sharp enough decline in the dollar, would be inthat direction.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, it would have to be more thanthat because you would have to compensate for the oil imports; youwouldn't be able to stop those.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let us return to an operatingdecision here. We had a proposal on the table.MR. PARTEE. $350 to $500 million.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What we are saying in traditional terms is$425 million with a band of flexibility around there that issignificant but not huge. It's barely significant, I suppose, interms of its flexibility. If we got much beyond that, conditionsprobably would justify some discussion. That, I guess, is fairlyobvious.MR. PARTEE. And the specifications of "B"?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I haven't looked very carefully at these.Has anybody thought or felt some strong predilections? We have acouple of alternatives here. Which alternative do we start with?MR. RICE. Mr. Corrigan put some specifications on the table.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, apart from the specifications, wehave some language labeled alternative I and alternative II. Is thereany feeling between alternative I and alternative II, apart from whatnumbers we pick?MR. PARTEE. Pres does.-40-8/20/85CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Alternative I spotlights the overshoot onM1; that's the substance of the difference in approach. It may beappropriate. Having not read it carefully yet, I will express anopinion that the fact that M1 is kind of out of bounds would lean metoward II just in terms of format, not substance, here.MR. MARTIN. It seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that alternativeII is a somewhat fuller discussion of M1 growth--what we expect andwhat its implication is--than alternative I.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's my offhand feeling. Shall we workfrom alternative II?MR. PARTEE. Yes.MR. BALLES. I would prefer it.MR. FORRESTAL. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All right. Let's for the moment work fromalternative II. I think we are saying "maintain" basically, but thatdoes leave a question in my mind. Either here or in the discussion[in the policy record]--maybe we can do it just in the discussion--wemight say that we did have an insubstantial firming.MR. AXILROD. We would put it in the policy record.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We could say here "maintain the degree ofpressure on reserve positions sought in recent weeks" and then explainin the policy record that that is very slightly tighter than when wesaid maintain last time.MR. PARTEE. It would be characterized as a little tighter?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would be very delicate in what words weuse. "A somewhat more cautious provision of reserves" I think isabout--MR. AXILROD. It requires extreme delicacy this time sincethe level of borrowing unfortunately has been dropping as we havegotten slightly tighter.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We would have to explain the aberration inthe one week and say we approached it a bit more cautiously. That'senough. Now, what numbers do you want to put in here on M2 and M3?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I had suggested--MR. BALLES. 9, 8-1/2 and 6-1/4 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't like to use the quarters.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I had suggested 6-1/2 and 8-1/2percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What did we say last time?-41-8/20/85MR. AXILROD. You had 7-1/2 percent last time, Mr. Chairman.And our present estimates are 8-1/2 percent for M2 and 6-1/2 percentfor M3, so--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Suppose we said 7 to 8 percent for both ofthem? One is slightly lower and one is slightly higher but--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. That is fine with me.MR. MARTIN. Seems reasonable.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Rates of around 7 to 8 percent.MR. PARTEE. Expecting to miss both of them. An average--SPEAKER(?). The average guesses.MR. MARTIN. 8-1/2 percent and 6-1/2 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't feel strongly about it but--MR. BALLES. That 8 percent sounds pretty high for M3, Mr.Chairman. That is above anything shown in the alternatives here.MR. PARTEE. I'd rather pick 6-1/2 and 8-1/2 percent. I'dtake the point estimates. That happens to average to 7-1/2 percent; Idon't know that that means anything. Have we ever said that weaverage the aggregates?MR. MARTIN. Geometrically or arithmetically!CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would have some preference, or more thana slight preference, for not changing the numbers if we don't have to.That is the only advantage of 7 to 8 percent, but I will not press thepoint. Would you rather say 7 to 8 percent or 8-1/2 and 6-1/2percent?MR. WALLICH. 8-1/2 percent would be good.MR. MARTIN. 8-1/2 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we'll just be wrong on both.MR. PARTEE. With a point estimate you don't expect it to beexactly right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I didn't realize they did when you said--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. You could have lucked out.MR. AXILROD. I should change my definition of success inprojecting, Mr. Chairman, because I always thought within a percentagepoint was success.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So did I.MR. BLACK. Even with the period half done.-42-8/20/85SPEAKER(?). [Unintelligible] third quarter.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 8-1/2 and 6-1/2 percent. "M1 growth isexpected to slow markedly--"MR. KEEHN. How about that word "markedly"?MR. MARTIN. Yes. How about omitting it?MR. PARTEE. Well, it has gone from 14 percent to 4 percent;that's quite a slowing.MR. KEEHN. Yes, but it is subject to judgment, and peoplewill interpret it one way that may not be appropriate. I'd eliminateit.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why don't we say "given relatively rapidgrowth in recent weeks." What number do you want to put in there?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I'd want to put 8-1/2 percent.MR. PARTEE. 6 to 10 percent.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Come on! You wanted to put in a precisenumber on the others.MR. BALLES. I'd suggest 9 percent.MR. GUFFEY. How about 7 to 9 percent?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Let me make the case for this 8-1/2percent. I don't feel that strongly about it, but the only reason I'mattracted to it is that I think it does lend a little to the point ofview that suggests we are not totally indifferent about being outsidethe tunnel, or whatever the heck we call it, for the second half ofthe year that we just adopted 6 weeks ago. That's the only thing thatleads me to that number as opposed to the 9 percent. But I--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You prefer 8-1/2 percent to the 8 to 9percent?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes, but I am somewhat agnostic.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where does the sense of the meeting lie?MR. MARTIN. That it matters less than it used to.MR. GUFFEY. If we use the 7 to 9 percent, it is centered on8 percent but it does give us some flexibility to go one way or theother without having to make any policy move.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The trouble that I see with that is the 7percent; it is realistically less than most people think it is goingto get to, I guess.MR. BALLES. Well, it should be.-43-8/20/85MR. GUFFEY. But to use 7 to 9 percent, centering on 8percent, seems to me to provide flexibility that would be desirable.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. We need a decline in September toget 7 percent.MR. MORRIS. Why do we say "relatively rapid growth"? Thatsounds like it wasn't really very rapid growth at all--that it wassort of rapid growth. And it was a heck of a lot bigger than that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, take out the "relatively."MR. MORRIS. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's acceptable?MR. PARTEE. "Given the rapid growth in recent weeks" is whatwe say?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What number do you want to put in?MR. MARTIN. 9 percent is the expectation, isn't it? Whydon't--MR. FORRESTAL. 9 percent is what I'd like to see.MR. BALLES. 9 percent is what I want.MR. RICE. I'd prefer 8-1/2 percent.MR. WALLICH. I'd like to stick in some way with the rangethat we set; maybe we can straddle it with 7 to 9 percent.MR. PARTEE. Well, this is an expectation and not a policystatement. Maybe--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In terms of a policy statement, we'daccept [unintelligible] depending upon what we do and given thisuncertainty. It sounds like the right thing is 8 to 9 percent, butI'm not sure. If we have a consensus for 8-1/2 percent, that's fine.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. That's fine.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 8 to 9 percent?MR. MARTIN. No problems with it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now, on this next sentence it strikes methat we don't need that "although" part. It sounds awfully precise.MR. PARTEE. That's the second next sentence?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.MR. MARTIN. I'd prefer "might" instead of "would" in thefirst sentence.-44-8/20/85MR. PARTEE. Since that's what we seem to have done, I thinkthat's what we ought to put in.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you want to put in? Well, we'llgo to the "woulds" and "mights." First of all, forget about theclause at the end; we'll take that up separately. Just on thisstandard phrase about somewhat greater or somewhat lesser restraint,the issue is: Do we want a sentence like that?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes.MR. MARTIN. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In the absence of any objection we willhave a sentence like this. Now we have to discuss whether to put in"mights" or "woulds." Is there some expression for "mights"? What'sthe--MS. SEGER. It was a "might" and a "would."MR. KEEHN. It's not a strong preference, but I would prefer"would."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're just talking about the firstsentence.MR. RICE. On the first sentence?MR. KEEHN. Right.MR. MELZER. Didn't we have "would" last time?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we did.MR. MELZER. If the thought is to lean a little firmer thistime, I would think we'd stay with "would."MR. PARTEE. But we didn't do it.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we did it slightly. On this basistoo I--MR. PARTEE. I guess so.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not very substantial.MR. RICE. I'd say "would."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, how many opt for "would"?VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I prefer "would."MR. BERNARD. Six.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How many are for "might"? I suppose 5; Icount 4; somebody is not voting.MR. BERNARD. There are 11 voting members.-45-8/20/85CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Tentatively, we have "would," [not] Iguess by an enormous majority. Now, the next sentence. We had"might" last time.SPEAKER(?). I'd say it should be "would."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me propose that we put in a "would"here too but leave out the bottom part.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Yes, the "although"--SPEAKER(?). I would support that.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is the last part of that sentence off?SPEAKER(?). Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Somebody suggested that in this nextsentence we move up "foreign exchange markets."MR. MARTIN. Yes. Given its importance today in all marketsand the vulnerability of the financial system, I think we should giveevidence that we are indeed more concerned about that sector.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How would you do it specifically? I don'tdisagree with the sentiment, but that's--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, if we really wanted to changeit, we could put the reference to the foreign exchange markets in the"somewhat greater restraint" sentence: "somewhat greater restraintwould be sought in the event of substantially higher growth of themonetary aggregates in the context of exchange rate developments" orsomething like that.MR. MARTIN. If the Chairman had just made a presentation toCongress or a major address on that subject and given a signal, I'd befor putting it up there. But since that has not--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is the kind of thing I had in mind: Idon't know whether we can make this any more substantial and I don'tknow whether--MR. PARTEE. These other factors are really quite important:the business expansion, inflation, conditions in domestic creditmarkets and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, that's the problem with changing it.In substance, I don't know whether we should do it for the reasonsGovernor Martin suggested but in a short-term tactical sense itbelongs there. But these other things are very important and providethe general background. I guess it would be--MR. MARTIN. Put it in after "strength of the businessexpansion" now, and then when you have made such a presentation moveit up.VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. We may not be able to do it now, butI'll tell you: The more I think about it, it makes a heck of a lot of-46-8/20/85sense because it also allows us in that context to get back to thisdamn budget deficit question. That thing is just going out the windowon us and, ultimately, that's what is driving the whole conundrum.MR. PARTEE. Paul, I think we might say simply "the movementof foreign exchange rates" or something like that after "the businessexpansion." But then the last phrase ought to be revised to say"domestic and international credit markets." We don't want to dropout the international credit markets.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No. "In either case such a change wouldbe considered in the context of appraisals of the strength of thebusiness expansion and--." What's the word: "conditions"?MR. PARTEE. I said "movements" but--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. "Patterns."MR. PARTEE. "Developments in foreign exchange markets."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --"developments in foreign exchangemarkets, progress against inflation and conditions in domestic andinternational credit markets."SPEAKER(?). Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "Changes in developments in foreignexchange markets."MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I just want to point out that adifference between alternative II and alternative I was that the twosentences are reversed. At the last meeting the lesser restraintsentence was first and the greater restraint sentence was second. Inalternative II, I reversed them; I don't know how that will be read bythe market or how the Committee would feel about that. Also the words"somewhat greater restraint would be sought" in the previous directivewere "would be acceptable," but for better English language I changedthat because I used "acceptable" in another sense later on.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where is this "acceptable"?MR. AXILROD. Where it now says "somewhat greater restraintwould be sought in the event of..." last time it said "would beacceptable in the event of...."CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why don't we leave that.MR. AXILROD. You're leaving the other out?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Also take it out.MR. AXILROD. I took it out because I had another"acceptable" in there.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] acceptable and--MR. AXILROD. I'm hung up on---47-8/20/85MR. PARTEE. Oh, we just took that out.MR. AXILROD. Yes, that's right. So you can put the"acceptable" back in. That's what I'm pointing out.SPEAKER(?). Yes, the "acceptable" we can.MR. AXILROD. That's right.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do we put the "acceptable" back in?SEVERAL. Yes.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody have any other comments orsuggestions on the whole package?MR. GUFFEY. Can you tell me what you've done with that lastsentence with respect to the foreign exchange markets?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "In either case such a change would beconsidered in the context of appraisals of the strength of thebusiness expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progressagainst inflation, and conditions in domestic and international creditmarkets."MR. FORRESTAL. And the "although" clause in the previoussentence is out?CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Out. They are both "woulds" and"acceptable." Well, we're going to vote unless somebody has a--MR. BLACK. It's 6 to 10 percent, I guess, Mr. Chairman.CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 6 to 10 percent at the bottom andborrowing of $425 million, which is about where we are now and withflexibility around there in either direction depending on the moneysupply and other circumstances.MR.
