Passage number 1.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The question is incomplete as it does not contain the passage for analysis. Please provide the passage you would like to assess for contention or disagreement.


Passage number 2.
 WILLIAMS.  Will there be a sufficient supply of doughnuts during the break.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we gave you a good lunch.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The response from Chair Yellen evokes laughter, which suggests a lighthearted reaction rather than a disagreement.

  [Laughter] MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The presence of laughter indicates a light and friendly atmosphere, suggesting agreement or amusement.


Passage number 4.
 WILLIAMS.  Tomorrow morning, tomorrow morning. CHAIR YELLEN.  You should have confidence and trust your colleagues to do the best they possibly can on that score. Okay.  Importantly, I would like to welcome Neel Kashkari to his first FOMC meeting.  Neel became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis at the turn of this year.  President Kashkari brings valuable government-sector experience, including service as senior advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury and assistant secretary of the Treasury during the global financial crisis.  In addition, he has extensive experience in the private financial sector, and going back before that, he was employed as an aerospace engineer, contributing to what we affectionately call the “real side” of the economy.  So, Neel, we look forward to working with you.  And I would also like to welcome back onto the Committee Presidents Bullard, George, Mester, and Rosengren. Now, as usual, this entire FOMC meeting will be considered a joint meeting with the Board of Governors.  So I need a motion to close the Board meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists mostly of welcoming remarks and procedural information.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter expresses a personal struggle he had with saying "Thank you, Madam Chair" at the beginning, and Chair Yellen acknowledges his accomplishment and praises him for getting through it.


Passage number 24.
 MR. POTTER.1  As part of the annual review of the Committee’s authorization for domestic open market operations, and as discussed in the memo titled “Request for Votes on the Authorization for Desk Operations” that you received before the meeting, the Desk recommends approval, with one minor change to ensure consistency in the use of terms “repo” and “reverse repo” transactions.  That would be on page 44 of the organizational document. 1 The materials for annual organizational items are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). I’d also like to highlight another item for the Committee’s consideration.  In January 2009, the Committee suspended the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Open Market Operations in Federal-Agency Issues in light of the Federal Reserve’s having begun a program of purchases of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities.  The SOMA contains a significant amount of agency debt and agency MBS, and it continues to conduct transactions in agency MBS as part of the reinvestment policy adopted by the Committee.  That being the case, I recommend the continued suspension of these guidelines.  No Committee vote is needed to continue the suspension. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there questions for Simon.  [No response]  Hearing none, we need a motion to approve the proposals.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 25.

 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Without objection.  Okay.  We’re now ready to move on to item 5, “Proposed Revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Without objection" indicates that there was agreement or consensus among the participants.


Passage number 27.
” MR. POTTER.  Excuse me.  Can we do the foreign authorization. CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, I’m sorry.  I apologize.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 28.
 MR. POTTER.  We also recommend that the Committee approve the documents governing foreign transactions without amendment.  As I mentioned at the December FOMC meeting, the staff is evaluating the current foreign exchange reserve management framework and working on modernizing the documents related to foreign operations.  I plan to defer recommending any changes to the documents governing foreign operations until these projects are complete.  Note that the approval of the “foreign” documents includes approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.  As has been the case since February 5, 1997, the limit on warehousing is set at $5 billion.  There are currently no outstanding balances. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there questions for Simon on the foreign currency matters.  Comments.  [No response]  Then we need a motion to approve that proposal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a recommendation and proposal without any opposing views or objections.


Passage number 29.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "So moved" is a formality commonly used in meetings and discussions to indicate that a motion has been put forward and is now ready for a vote. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 30.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Now, item 5—I’d like to turn to “Proposed Revisions to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.”  The staff is proposing three sets of relatively minor changes to the program.  The first is to clarify that all Federal Reserve persons—and that includes FOMC participants as well as staff members—must receive, review, and agree to abide by the program.  Second, there are some proposed changes to provide more flexibility in making FOMC information access decisions for persons at the Board.  And, third, there are some technical changes, such as making program language more consistent and correcting a typo. There is also a slightly more substantive change that I would like to propose, and I sent you a memo on this.  As you know, our program for security of FOMC information has received some attention from the Congress and others as a consequence of the 2012 leak of FOMC information.  Protecting confidential FOMC information is clearly a matter of the utmost importance, and it’s appropriate that we continually review our program to ensure that our policies and practices remain strong and transparent.  The proposed changes to section 7 of the program are intended to clarify our procedures in the event of a potential breach of confidential FOMC information.  To date, our program has stated that, once notified of a potential breach, the Committee’s secretary and general counsel will perform a review of the incident and, in light of the review results, the general counsel will determine whether to request the Board’s inspector general to perform an investigation of the incident. Now, during my tenure as Chair, all potential material breaches have been referred to the inspector general, with only minimal review by the secretary and general counsel.  I believe that that approach is fully consistent with the program, and the proposed revisions are meant to codify this practice.  In addition, the revised language states that the secretary or the general counsel will make a referral to the inspector general, thereby vesting that responsibility in more than one person and reducing the possibility of any apparent conflict of interest in making a referral determination. So I would like to propose those changes.  And, before we go to a vote, let me ask whether there are any comments or questions on that proposal or other changes to the organizational documents proposed by the staff.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The chair is proposing some revisions to the program for security of FOMC information and explaining the reasons for these changes. There are no comments or questions mentioned, indicating that there is no opposition or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 31.
 MS. GEORGE.  Madam Chair, I support what you’ve proposed here, but I noted in the strikeouts that the previous version, at some level, offered consultation with the president of the relevant Reserve Bank in the event of a breach.  And if the breach emanated from a Reserve Bank, I just wondered, as a practical matter, even though you’re striking through that in favor of this stronger process, whether there would be such consultation. CHAIR YELLEN.  I think there could be such consultation.  I do think our default response should be that any material breach will be referred to the inspector general.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage.
Explanation: Ms. George expresses her concern about the removal of consultation with the president of the relevant Reserve Bank in the event of a breach. However, Chair Yellen disagrees and believes there could still be such consultation.


Passage number 32.
 MS. GEORGE.  I agree. CHAIR YELLEN.  That should be the default.  It shouldn’t be a specific judgment that we’re making once something has been determined to be material.  It should be turned over to the IG.   There could certainly continue to be consultation.  But I do think it’s important to make clear that our policy will be to turn any material matter over to the IG.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Ms. George and Chair Yellen agree on the idea that any material matter should be turned over to the IG (Inspector General).


Passage number 33.
 MS. GEORGE.  And I support that.  I’m thinking, as a practical matter, with employment and code of conduct issues within the Banks, we would have some follow-up if it involves the staff in a Reserve Bank as well. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions or comments.  [No response]  Okay.  Then I guess we need just one motion to approve the organizational document.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. George voices her support and there is no response or further discussion.


Passage number 34.
 MR. MADIGAN.  I would vote on this program explicitly. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  We’ll vote explicitly on the changes to “The Program for Security of FOMC Information.”  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Madigan and Chair Yellen are in agreement that they will vote explicitly on the changes to "The Program for Security of FOMC Information."


Passage number 35.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Without objection.  Thank you very much.  Our next agenda item, is “Proposed Change to the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.”  Before I turn things over to Governor Fischer, I would like to extend my thanks to the subcommittee on communications and to the staff who have supported their work on this topic.  I think they are proposing potential enhancements to what is a very important document of this Committee.  So let me turn things over to Governor Fischer to introduce this topic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are expressing gratitude and agreement with the proposed change to the statement.


Passage number 36.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  At the October 2014 FOMC meeting, we discussed the possibility of amending the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is shortened to the “consensus statement,” in order to clarify that the Committee’s inflation objective is symmetric.  At that time, there was widespread agreement that inflation moderately above the Committee’s 2 percent goal and inflation the same amount below that level were equally costly.  Although many participants thought that the symmetry of the objective was understood by the public, it nonetheless seemed useful to clarify that symmetry in the consensus statement.  However, some members thought that making a change to the consensus statement at that time posed a risk that the change could be seen as signaling a change in the Committee’s views about the appropriate timing of liftoff.  In order to avoid such confusion, the change was deferred until after liftoff.  With liftoff now behind us, the Committee thought that this would be an appropriate time to make the modification.  To do so, we have worked with all of you to develop specific language, which is shown in blue ink on page 4 of the handout, that has received broad support. The modified wording makes clear that a sequence of one-sided misses of the 2 percent target in either direction would be undesirable.  Even if inflation was ultimately expected to return to target, persistent misses would represent a welfare loss and might cause inflation expectations to become unanchored over time.  Regarding the specific wording, we use the words “were running” in order to be clear that the deviations are ongoing.  That is, they are not simply :bygones” but are expected to continue, at least for a time.  I think this wording is appropriate because expected future deviations would be a greater concern if they followed a sequence of past deviations in the same direction, as the expected deviations would be more likely to have an effect on longer-term inflation expectations. That said, the word “concerned” was chosen because it provides flexibility regarding whether the Committee would take action in response to the deviations.  It might do so, of course, but a policy response would not necessarily be called for.  For example, if inflation was running above 2 percent but unemployment was above the level consistent with maximum employment, then the Committee might judge that no change in policy was appropriate.  Similarly, if inflation was running below 2 percent but the economy was strengthening and inflation was expected to return to 2 percent over the medium term, then the Committee also might see unchanged policy as appropriate. As we noted in the memo, we have also updated the reference to the SEP estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.  In doing so, we changed the reference from the central tendency to the median, a change consistent with the outcome of the Committee’s discussion last July. In view of the timing of the Chair’s monetary policy testimony, we plan to release the updated statement following our meeting tomorrow along with the usual postmeeting statement.  A draft of the short cover note that would be used for that press release is on page 5 of 5 of the memo from the subcommittee to the FOMC.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  We now have an opportunity for comments on the consensus statement.  Let me start with President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 37.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 38.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Governor Fischer has explained the process that we went through in the subcommittee on this as well as the reasons for the change, and I strongly support the change in the language.  I just want to add one particular comment that I think is relevant for thinking about what we are trying to accomplish here.  This part of the consensus statement is really just about our longer-run inflation objective.  It doesn’t shed light on what the policy responses are to deviations from the objective, or to the shape of the objective beyond the fact that it is a symmetric objective.  I think one of the great achievements of the consensus statement over the years is that it has provided the biggest umbrella we are able to provide with regard to what we agree on—the 2 percent objective, and the view that this is symmetric—and leaves off of the consensus statement the particulars of how one thinks about the appropriate policy response and other things that we may have different views on.  I think the goal here, really, is just to cement in the public’s mind that the goal is 2 percent, that it is the midpoint of the target, and that it is symmetric around that.  And the rest of the statement, which stays basically the same as before, describes our policy strategy on deviations from that objective and doesn’t indicate specifically what we do in those circumstances but lays out a general strategy. So, again, I strongly support the statement.  I think it is something that will help clarify our thinking for those who may still think that our 2 percent objective is somehow a ceiling and not a point target.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There doesn't appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. Williams strongly supports the change in language and believes that the consensus statement clarifies the Fed's 2 percent inflation objective.


Passage number 39.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The FOMC Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy was first introduced in January 2012.  It serves to clarify the Committee’s decisionmaking framework, and I do view the statement as an important addition to our communications arsenal.  It is known internally as the consensus statement.  That is not a misnomer.  The statement has had very broad support among FOMC participants since its adoption.  Of course, it wasn’t by accident that that happened.  The previous communications subcommittee and its chair, Janet Yellen, worked diligently to devise language that would encompass the diversity of views among participants while at the same time articulate to the public the Committee’s approach to policymaking. Due to the quasi-constitutional nature of the document and the fact that it has had very broad support, participants have generally agreed that the bar should be fairly high for making any changes.  At the same time, the Committee has periodically considered amendments that could help clarify the document or make it a more effective communications device.  And one of those changes, which is on the table today—the clarification that the Committee views a  percent inflation objective as symmetric—has received widespread support at previous meetings and, as Governor Fischer said, with the thought that the change would wait until after normalization had begun. Consistent with those past discussions, I strongly support making the change now.  The change has been signaled with the minutes of earlier meetings.  And, now that liftoff has occurred, it sounds like the right time to do it.  Moreover, January is the normal time for reaffirming the consensus statement.  So I am not concerned that the change will be interpreted as a comment or signal about current monetary policy.  And we can contain that interpretation by what we say about the change after it is released, explaining that the purpose is to clarify the framework in the interest of furthering transparency. In terms of the specific language, I can tell you that the communications subcommittee and staff, under the able leadership of our chair, Stan Fischer, took a page out of the previous subcommittee’s book and strove to craft language that would represent the broad consensus.  We did engage in deliberations and consultations, and we took the comments and suggestions of each FOMC participant very seriously.  Our deliberations suggest that the language now on the table is acceptable to almost all participants, and I want to acknowledge the willingness of many Committee members to compromise on their favorite phraseology in the spirit of reaching a workable consensus in the pursuit of our common goal of clarifying to the public this aspect of our policymaking framework. With regard to the specific wording, the broad intent is to clarify that the Committee views the 2 percent inflation objective as symmetric.  As Governor Fischer said, the phrase “were running” captures the idea that the primary concern is with deviations from target that are expected to persist into the future.  It allows for different preferred models of the inflation progress among participants.  Some might put more weight on current and past deviations from the target as informative about future inflation.  Others who view inflation expectations as a predominant factor when forecasting inflation might look at persistent deviations as a potential risk for unanchoring expectations. As was said earlier, the word “concerned” is consistent with the Committee’s past behavior.  Concern about persistent deviations doesn’t mean that they necessarily warrant Committee action.  For example, I am concerned by the low level of inflation, but, on the basis of the outlook, I think a reasonable forecast is that inflation will return to target over the medium term, and I don’t believe additional policy accommodation is called for.  A look at the minutes of the FOMC meetings in late 2006 and early 2007, when core inflation was above 2 percent, shows that the Committee was indeed concerned about elevated core inflation but held the funds rate target at 5¼ percent because it expected inflation to move lower over time. The proposed wording clarifies the nature of the inflation target.  How policymakers approach setting policy in order to promote achieving the symmetric inflation goal and our other dual-mandate goal of maximum employment is discussed later in the consensus statement.  I don’t feel that the proposed wording constrains or changes in any way the ability of the Committee to chart the appropriate course of policy in pursuit of our goals.  Again, we might all think of alternative wordings that we might individually prefer in one way or the other.  But this statement is meant to be a consensus statement giving the Committee’s policymaking principles, and the specific wording proposed has been developed with that in mind.  In supporting this change, I feel comfortable that I can explain my own approach to monetary policymaking within the context of this statement.  I hope that others will approach it in this way, too, and I hope that they will support it as well.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Mester, expresses strong support for making a specific change to the FOMC statement and emphasizes that the change has widespread support among participants. She acknowledges the willingness of many Committee members to compromise on their preferred wording in order to reach a consensus. Overall, there is a sense of agreement and unity in this passage.


Passage number 40.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair, and let me briefly, offer the basis for my support for this change.  I support it for three reasons.  First, the change is an important, even fundamental, one in the sense that it rises to the level of inclusion in the consensus statement.  The question of whether the 2 percent medium-term objective is a ceiling or a goal, with a symmetric loss function focused on it, is a critical one, particularly today—when inflation has undershot the target since the crisis, including almost every single month of my four years here at the Board.  Second, as the meeting that Governor Fischer referred to earlier showed, Committee participants have broadly agreed that the loss function is symmetric.  And, third, the proposed language, as Loretta indicated, has been the result of extensive consultation and now attracts the support of nearly all.  And for those reasons, I am happy to support the language.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a clear expression of support for a change, backed by three reasons.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 41.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As some of you have probably noticed, I have abstained from voting on this statement since it was introduced in January 2012 in part, as I have stated for the record in each of the past four years, on the ground that it really didn’t communicate much that gave useful insight into how the FOMC would approach its policy decisions.  In part, though, I abstained because certain expectations I had been given regarding language that would be included in the original statement were confounded at that time.  Experience over those four years hasn’t really changed my mind as to how useful the statement is in communicating how we go about making our policy decisions.  As I anticipated at the time, in actual decisionmaking, everybody pretty much, I think, takes his or her own reading or interpretation of the statement. However, it is not a bad thing to have even a high-level expression of consensus as to the FOMC’s longer-range goals, and there does come a point when it is probably not too productive to continue to abstain.  This seems to me such a point, particularly in light of the helpful changes that Chair Yellen, Governors Fischer and Powell, and Presidents Mester and Williams have worked out.  And although this change is not directed at the issue that was in play back in late 2011, I think it is noteworthy, in light of recent experience and current circumstances.  So I will vote for the statement today. I now want to add one thought, though.  We don’t have a lot of expressions of agreement on the Committee.  The statement expresses, albeit at a very high level, an agreement, despite some nontrivial differences that lie beneath it.  President Williams, captured this well in his introductory remarks.  I think it is institutionally important for us to project an ability to agree, even if only at a fairly high level, and that is why I abstained rather than dissented over each of the past several years.  And that is why I have gone out of my way in the past four years not to highlight publicly my points of difference with the statement. I also appreciate the fact that so far as I am aware, none of you has tried to argue publicly that the statement compels or justifies a particular policy outcome.  There is plenty of room to interpret the statement in a variety of ways, as we have de facto done in our policymaking.  And I suspect many of you, like me, would be happier if it were drafted somewhat differently.  Indeed, I am not sure the language being added is exactly the way I would have phrased the point.  The problem, of course, is that we would differ on what those differences should be.  I think we should recognize the compromises that are inevitable, salute the work the subcommittee has done, endorse the statement, and then refrain from trying to highlight the differences rather than the admittedly high level of agreement.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker states that they have abstained from voting on the statement in the past because they did not find it useful in communicating policy decisions. They also mention that they have differences with the statement and would have phrased it differently. However, they also mention the importance of projecting an ability to agree and the need for compromise.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 42.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m opposed to this portion of the changes to the Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  My opposition centers on the extra sentence being added to the statement, which reads, “The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.”  In my view, this sentence is inappropriately backward looking.  A basic tenet of modern inflation targeting is that it is the inflation forecast that is critically important, not recent misses of inflation from target that were caused by unpredictable shocks that hit the economy.  Because this is a statement of longer-run goals, this sentence should appropriately reflect this basic tenet of inflation targeting.  A rewrite that would accomplish this would be simple:  “The Committee would be concerned if inflation were expected to run persistently above or below this objective.” I communicated my concerns to the communications subcommittee, but I was unable to persuade the subcommittee to change the language.  Because I regard this as a matter of fundamental importance for this Committee, I’m dissenting on the adoption of this statement as written.  Part of my concern is that this statement of longer-run goals is quasi-constitutional in nature and that language introduced today will likely be very persistent into the future.  I therefore think that it is even more important to get this language correct than it is for other Committee statements. I want to now point out three areas in which I see this new sentence as inconsistent with Committee statements and actual practice.  One is in the staff’s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.  A second is in the current Committee communication regarding the inflation outlook and future policy decisions.  And the third is in past Committee behavior during an era in which inflation was persistently higher than desired. Let me begin with the staff’s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.  The current version of Tealbook B, page 8, provides the Committee with results of an optimal control exercise that projects inflation through 2021.  The optimal control projections for inflation are below our 2 percent target until 2020; in addition, actual inflation has been below target for several years in the past.  Yet, at least under the assumptions behind the optimal control exercise, this is the very best policy that can be pursued by this Committee.  If the Committee adopted this approach to policy, then it would not be particularly concerned that inflation had been below target in the past.  That outcome would be chalked up to shocks that hit the economy in the past, and the Committee would take the effects of those shocks on board and map out a strategy to move inflation back to target over several years.  To me, this type of optimal policy calculation lays out a dichotomy compared with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals. Let me now turn to the current Committee communication.  The Committee’s official statements on monetary policy in recent quarters have stressed the idea that the Committee needs to be reasonably confident that inflation will return to target over the forecast horizon.  This is a forward-looking criterion that I think contrasts with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals. Finally, let me turn to the past behavior of the Committee.  During the period from 2003 to 2008, inflation routinely ran in excess of 2 percent.  Naturally, the Committee and the Chair at the time were constantly asked about this situation.  My general characterization of the response is that the Committee stressed that the factors that were keeping inflation relatively high were likely temporary, and that, under the policy in place at the time, the Committee expected inflation to return to lower, more normal levels.  Again, this was a forward-looking argument.  In the event, inflation did not continue to rise but instead moved lower, and an era of inflation misses on the high side ended.  This historical experience suggests to me behavior of the Committee that would be difficult to reconcile with the new sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals. In summary, putting the new sentence in the statement of longer-run goals this way will, in my opinion, put a burden on the Committee’s future communication as financial market participants seek to reconcile the new language with the reality that it must be the inflation forecast that really matters for the future direction of monetary policy. Let me stress before concluding that I support the remainder of the statement as written.  As many of you know, I worked closely with many of my colleagues on the Committee to help craft this statement during 2011 for adoption in January 2012.  This established an official inflation target for the United States, a longtime goal of former Chairman Bernanke.  I still very much support that goal as well as the statement other than the new sentence.  In particular, I support the addition of the word “symmetric,” because I have always felt that misses on either side of the inflation target are equally important.  My qualms today are solely about preserving the forward-looking nature of inflation targeting in the United States.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Bullard is opposed to the changes being made to the Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy. He disagrees with the addition of a sentence that he believes is backward-looking and not in line with modern inflation targeting principles. He argues that the sentence should instead focus on expected future inflation. He also points out inconsistencies between the proposed sentence and staff projections, current Committee communication, and past Committee behavior. He believes that the new language will burden future communication and argues for preserving the forward-looking nature of inflation targeting.


Passage number 43.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the statement on longer-run goals and thank the subcommittee for providing language that clarifies that our inflation goal is symmetric.  I’d like to believe that a symmetric goal was generally understood by the public, but there have been occasions when questions were raised about the Committee’s commitment to a symmetric goal, and this language removes any ambiguity. Our original longer-run goals document was adopted in 2012.  We have made only modest changes to that language, mostly of a clarifying nature.  I think it would be useful next year, and subsequently every five years, to conduct a more comprehensive review of the longer-run goals.  As President Mester discussed, the original document was a compromise to obtain agreement among participants on the Committee in 2012.  We chose to focus on the PCE rather than the CPI measure of inflation; to express the goal in terms of total, not core, inflation; and to adopt a 2 percent inflation target.  Over the past five years, we have generally undershot our inflation target while being stuck at the lower bound.  My view is that we should at least more fully consider the possibility that a 2 percent inflation target may unduly constrain monetary policy, especially in a world with low equilibrium real interest rates.  It is clear to me that we have underestimated the cost of hitting, and the difficulties in leaving, the effective lower bound.  We may very well not make any changes to what were in 2012 some difficult compromises, but I think a comprehensive review would be instructive even if we choose to make no substantive changes.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, is expressing support for a statement and proposing a review of longer-run goals, but he does not explicitly argue against anyone else's viewpoint or opinion.


Passage number 44.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’d like to thank the communications subcommittee for their hard work in finding consensus.  This is a welcome clarification of our price-stability objective.  Even though many of us have said in public that we view 2 percent as a symmetric target, I think adding the idea explicitly to the Committee’s formal statement of goals and strategy is an important communications tool to reinforce this concept with the public.  The proposed language is succinct and clear in describing the sensible features of the symmetric objective.  I strongly support the proposed addition.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans expresses support for the proposed addition and emphasizes the importance of clarifying the price-stability objective. There is no indication of any disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 45.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I don’t see a pressing need to modify the consensus statement, but I don’t have strong objections to the changes being proposed.  I would reiterate a point I’ve made in the past, which is that to serve the purpose of the statement in anchoring expectations regarding the conduct of monetary policy, the statement should not be frequently amended.  It should be seen as a statement of timeless principles.  I think somebody used the word “constitutional.”  I think that’s right.  In particular, we should avoid the appearance of opportunistic editing into driving policy expectations in one particular direction or another in the short run.  My limited enthusiasm for this change stems in part from the extent to which this verges on appearing that way. Another reason my enthusiasm is limited is that I don’t know of an economic model in which our implied objective function is symmetric, mathematically speaking, without taking a linear quadratic approximation, which essentially imposes symmetry, or without imposing symmetry a priori on a loss function that a policymaker is posited to have, as opposed to having the objective function derived from the utility function of the agency model.  Many of the reasons we view inflation above 2 percent as detrimental to the well-being of our country and our economy are distinct from the reasons we view inflation below 2 percent as detrimental to the economy, and there’s good reason to believe that inflation dynamics could be different above and below 2 percent.  So I’m not a big fan of the notion that our objectives are, strictly speaking, symmetric. I can live with the statement, however.  The sentence that’s inserted, by itself, doesn’t say our concerns are of equal magnitude on either side, and I prefer to think of the symmetry as a symmetry with respect to the sign of the concern on either side.  But as I said, I have no objection to the changes being proposed. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Lacker expresses his disagreement with the notion that the objectives regarding inflation are symmetric. He argues that inflation dynamics could be different above and below 2 percent and that the reasons for viewing inflation above and below 2 percent as detrimental to the economy are distinct. However, he also states that he has no objection to the changes being proposed, indicating some level of agreement.


Passage number 46.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Chair Yellen.  I’m probably newer to this than just about anybody around the table, so I had a number of questions as we went through it.  I agree and support the language in the statement.  I do think it anchors expectations. For me, as someone maybe coming at this with fresh eyes, it does appear forward looking because the statement overall is forward looking.  I think the key word in the sentence that Jim was referring to is “concerned.”  It doesn’t mean we feel the need to act.  It means we’d be concerned.  And I’ll speak for myself—if inflation runs persistently below or above 2 percent, I am concerned, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t expect it to return to the 2 percent objective. I think the statement adequately reflects my view.  When I talked to Loretta about the timing of this, I had a question—maybe because I’m a little thinner-skinned as a new person here and sensitive to what’s going on out there in the world on inflation—about whether this will be misinterpreted and taken to mean something other than what we intend.  But I am convinced that this is simply clarifying and making more explicit what had been an implicit basic consensus around this table.  So I support this language.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement and support for the language in the statement, stating that it adequately reflects their view. They also raise a concern about potential misinterpretation of the statement but ultimately express support for it.


Passage number 47.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, want to thank the subcommittee members and the staff for their work and for the inclusive manner in which they gathered input and considered various views.  I, too, think this document has served us well and, as President Lacker noted, changes to it require careful consideration. I support the changes to this statement but would offer a brief observation about the proposed clarification.  The choice of an inflation target represents our best judgment for fulfilling a congressional mandate to achieve price stability.  Such judgments necessitate not only a view on symmetry, but also on the magnitude of deviations.  My own view is that small deviations from 2 percent may not warrant concern even if they are persistent.  For example, it’s not clear to me that we should be terribly concerned if inflation were persistently 1.9 percent or 2.1 percent.  Such judgments, of course, must be made in the context of the economy’s performance and its outlook, as others have noted.  Deviations from 2 percent are less of a concern if inflation is expected to move toward 2 percent over time and inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Likewise, the cost of deviating from the 2 percent objective depends on what is happening with respect to employment and other economic conditions.  Inflation below 2 percent might be less of a concern than inflation above, for example, if unemployment is at or below the natural rate and the economy is growing at a sustainable pace.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. George expresses her support for the changes to the statement and also offers her own observation about the proposed clarification. However, she does not express any disagreement with the views of others or the overall consensus.


Passage number 48.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the changes to the statement, and I support the statement itself.  I have to say, though, that until I joined the Federal Reserve a few weeks ago, I always thought that 2 percent was a ceiling, not a target.  I heard what members said, but when I looked at the actions over the past few years, it appeared to me to be a ceiling.  I think that markets have short memories, maybe shorter memories than many people around this table, and I was guilty of that, too.  And so I support putting this in.  I think symmetry is sufficiently important to put in our constitutional document.  I would just encourage us all that we probably have to work even harder to communicate to markets why our actions are consistent with symmetry, especially in the near term, when we may well have to be raising rates when inflation may well be lower than target, and it is going to raise questions.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Very good.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Kashkari, expresses his support for the changes to the statement and the statement itself. He also acknowledges his previous misunderstanding of the 2 percent target and agrees that symmetry is important. There is no direct contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 49.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I also support the change in our statement on longer-run goals, and I thank the subcommittee for their work on this.  The modified language is very helpful—particularly at this time, when inflation expectations appear to be under some downward pressure—in clarifying that our inflation target is just that, not a ceiling but a target.  I also like the language underscoring that the Committee would be concerned about persistent one-sided misses.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MS. Brainard is expressing her support for the change in the statement on longer-run goals and thanking the subcommittee for their work. She also expresses her approval of the modified language clarifying the inflation target and emphasizing concern about persistent one-sided misses. Chair Yellen thanks her for her comments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 50.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the revised statement.  The statement makes it clear that our loss function is symmetric with regard to the 2 percent goal, not necessarily in every particular case, but on an ex ante basis.  Thus, 2 percent is not a ceiling, but a target.  Now, there is a more subtle question, that of how the statement will be read with respect to the so-called bygones issue.  Does “symmetric” mean we will want to make up for past shortfalls with offsetting or symmetric overruns.  I don’t think the statement speaks directly to that, and I don’t read the statement that way.  Symmetry to me is about the loss function, not a goal or a commitment to make up for past shortfalls. My own view is that we continue to run a bygones policy rather than a price-level targeting policy.  We’re not deliberately seeking to push inflation above 2 percent to offset for the years that we spent below 2 percent, but at the same time, we might have to run above 2 percent for a time if that’s what is required to push inflation expectations back up to our 2 percent objective.  And we would do that, of course, so we could better achieve our 2 percent objective over the longer run.  There’s that little subtlety that the statement doesn’t get at, and I think it’s just useful to restate this in terms of our still continuing to follow a bygones policy. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Let me add my own support for the proposed changes to the statement.  I always viewed our inflation objective as symmetric and considered 2 percent to be our target and not a ceiling, and I think the new language makes this clear.  As others have noted, it’s also consistent with previous communications and serves as a meaningful clarification of the FOMC’s views. Now, I’d like to proceed, as we have in the past, to first take a straw poll of the views of the entire Committee so that the minutes can record the strength of support for the statement among all participants.  But we will also need a formal vote by the members of the Committee to adopt the statement.  So let me start with a straw poll, and I would ask any of the participants to raise your hand if you support the statement.  [Show of hands]  Anyone opposed.  [Show of hands]  Okay.  One opposed.  Now we’re going to take a formal vote of the members to adopt the statement.  So, members only, all in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  And opposed.  [One aye] Okay.  As Stan noted, we will release the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy tomorrow at the same time as our policy statement.  This marks a departure from our typical practice of releasing the statement with the minutes.  An advantage of our typical approach is that the minutes can provide important context and rationale for any changes and thereby reduce the possibility that the revisions will be misinterpreted by the public.  This year, though, my monetary policy testimony before the Congress will occur earlier than normal and before the release of the minutes for this meeting.  Because the consensus statement appears in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, we need to accelerate its release.  But I do want to warn everyone that this timing will pose some communications challenges, particularly in light of the fact that we have the dissent that will be reported tomorrow. Some of you may want to discuss the consensus statement in public, or you may be asked about it by members of the press.  So I just want to remind everybody that, as always, you are free to share your own views.  But let me emphasize that you should not characterize the views of other participants or the Committee as a whole as reflected in this meeting’s discussion or other confidential interactions, and that doing so would be a violation of our program for security of FOMC information and our policy on external communications.  And on this particular topic, I do think that staying in line with our policies may prove to be quite tricky, as discussing your view could very naturally lead to contrasting your view with the views of others.  So I mention this because I would like you to consider your communications on this topic very carefully. With that, let’s go on to our next item, item 7.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The passage shows two different views on whether the Federal Reserve should follow a "bygones policy" or a "price-level targeting policy" in response to previous shortfalls in inflation. One person supports continuing the bygones policy, while another suggests that they might have to run above 2 percent for a time to push inflation expectations back up to their 2 percent objective.


Passage number 51.
 MR. EVANS.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. Both individuals are addressing each other respectfully.


Passage number 52.
 MR. EVANS.  I have a question.  In listening to your commentary, that reminds me that normally, once the minutes are out, there’s a paragraph or more that describe Committee discussions. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, there will be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans simply asks a question and Chair Yellen agrees with his statement.


Passage number 53.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes, that’s right, but part of the problem is, talking before the minutes come out means that you’re laying yourself bare. CHAIR YELLEN.  Exactly.  That’s right.  We will release this tomorrow.  President Bullard will have a sentence to explain his dissent.  When the blackout period ends, everybody’s free to comment.  Especially with the dissent, many of you may be asked, “Well, what’s that about.  What’s your view.” and so forth.  But the minutes won’t be out.  So it will be very natural, I think, to say things like, “Well, the Committee really thought X.  I agree with most people on the Committee.  We think this means blah, blah, blah.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are in agreement about the release of the minutes and the potential for discussion and interpretation of the dissenting opinion.


Passage number 54.
” MR. EVANS.  So is it fair to say that after the minutes are out, it seems less likely that we’d be running afoul. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, I don’t think you’d be running afoul.  You might say, “As the minutes explained, the Committee blah, blah, blah.”  And that’s fine.  It’s in this period before the minutes come out that I think we’re at risk.  So I’m just highlighting that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are in agreement that releasing information after the minutes are out is less likely to cause problems, but before the minutes are released, there may be a risk.


Passage number 55.
 MR. EVANS.  Good.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not suggest any contention or disagreement. It consists of polite conversation between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 56.
 MR. KAPLAN.  I’ll ask a question that I’m sure is out of order, but I will ask anyhow, and I’ll direct this maybe to President Bullard and the group.  I take it that there’s been enough conversation back and forth by everyone else around the table indicating that we do mean this to be forward looking.  That’s not enough to sway your thinking.  I normally wouldn’t ask, but I just want to ask because it strikes me that this coming out with a dissent is going to be very confusing to people.  I wouldn’t mind if we took a few extra minutes here, if you’re willing, to debate it or discuss it a little bit more.  It might be healthy—unless that’s going too far and it’s already been done. CHAIR YELLEN.  I agree with you.  But we have had some conversations about this.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a disagreement or contention about whether to proceed with a dissent, as Mr. Kaplan raises concerns about the potential confusion it may cause, while Chair Yellen agrees with him but also mentions that some conversations about this have already taken place.


Passage number 57.
 MR. BULLARD.  I think it’s done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward statement by Mr. Bullard.


Passage number 58.
 MR. KAPLAN.  You do.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any statements that indicate contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple acknowledgement of agreement or understanding.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 59.
 MR. BULLARD.  You know, I do feel very strongly about this.  I think it’s a constitutional document.  I think we could have said that if inflation is expected to go back to target, the Committee would be comfortable.  I gave examples of when we’ve done that in the past.  I gave examples taken from our own communications.  So my concern is that what we’re doing is setting up, inside a constitutional document, a challenge for future communication because I think, for instance, our rhetoric about being comfortable that inflation is going to return to target is going to be at odds with what’s now in the longer-run statement, which says that we’re uncomfortable if inflation has been below target persistently for a while. So I’m trying to highlight this.  I think what will happen is that, as you all have done here at the meeting, you’ll talk a lot about how you’re interpreting the phrase as forward looking, which is the way I think it needs to be interpreted. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows a disagreement between Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen about the inclusion of a certain clause in a constitutional document and its potential impact on future communication. Mr. Bullard expresses his concern that the clause could create inconsistency and challenge in future rhetoric about inflation targets, while Chair Yellen does not directly address or acknowledge his concerns.


Passage number 60.
 MR. FISCHER.  I’d just like to make two statements.  One is that “were running” is not the same as “had run,” and if the statement had said we would be concerned if inflation “had run” below 2 percent, then we would clearly be backward looking.  We were trying to get in an element that said past, present, and future, and that was where “were running” came from.  And as others have emphasized, and as I said in my opening statement, the fact that we are concerned does not imply a particular course of action, and so I applaud President Kaplan’s initiative, and I would have been very happy if it had led to unanimity. The second thing I’d like to say is that I’d like to thank the three other members of the communications subcommittee who spoke, in the order of John Williams, Loretta Mester, and Jay Powell.  This was a fairly long and intensive process.  I was sustained throughout by the opening remark by one of the members of the subcommittee:  “You should know,” she said [laughter], “that there is a body buried under every word in this statement.”  And I can testify that there are about 13 more bodies buried under there now.  And, finally, I would like to thank the members of the Committee, including Jim Bullard, for the fact that the discussion on how to modify this statement was conducted in a thoroughly collegial way.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Let’s then move along to our next item, item 7, which is “Financial Developments and Open Market Operations,” and I’d like to ask Simon to deliver the first part of the Desk briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 61.
 MR. FISCHER.  May I ask a question, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. It is a simple exchange between two individuals where one person asks a question and the other person gives permission to ask.


Passage number 62.
 MR. FISCHER.  What do you expect us to do with these facts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a simple inquiry or request for guidance.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 63.
 MR. POTTER.  I view our job as trying to report on what’s happened in markets and the expectations that market participants have.  One of the quandaries we had for some time was that there was quite a big difference between the market path and some of the expectations we were getting back from the people that we surveyed.  So one of the things we did was, we tried to change our questions to give them events to think about.  And that was to try to get at the notion we had had in our heads that some of the reasons that the market path looks different from the modal path or some of the other numbers we get back from them had something to do with the effective lower bound.  And what we found by changing the questions is that it was much easier to reconcile the market pricing with the expectations regarding the federal funds rate path that market participants have, but it leaves a big gap to try to explain how their modal path and the economic forecast that they show could support those expectations regarding the federal funds rate.  And, in my view, which I expressed, it’s something more to do with the rest of the world.  The other possibility is that markets have sensed a weakening that we can’t see in the data, and that’s in the financial market, and they’re basically giving a signal that U.S. growth will be much weaker in the first half of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses the view that the difference between the market path and the expectations from surveys has something to do with the effective lower bound, while also suggesting that the rest of the world or a weakening in the financial market could be other factors. This implies a lack of agreement or clarity on the reasons behind the divergence.


Passage number 64.
 MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  I’ll stop there. CHAIR YELLEN.  You’re welcome to continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer is saying that he will stop speaking, and Chair Yellen is welcoming him to continue if he wants to.


Passage number 65.
 MR. FISCHER.  Well, yes.  I think we all heard the earlier statement that more or less said that we’d better get on with the discussion. CHAIR YELLEN.  I see.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer's response indicates agreement with the previous statement, and Chair Yellen's response suggests acknowledgement or understanding of his comment.


Passage number 66.
 MR. FISCHER.  So I’m doing this in that spirit. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  We certainly have time for a little bit more conversation.  I did point out to people that we were starting late and so would need to be perhaps a little more concise than usual, but I did not mean to stifle discussion.  So, please, if you want to follow up, continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage shows a conversation between Mr. Fischer and Chair Yellen where they both agree to engage in further conversation and discussion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 67.
 MR. FISCHER.  The concern I have is that as you draw them out, you’re guiding them.  I have a slightly uneasy feeling that we’re getting these torrents of information about what the market participants believe, and we’re not getting torrents about what the staff believes, although we have the very valuable Tealbooks to use.  And I don’t know whether it’s healthy that we concentrate our briefings on what the markets are telling us rather than what we believe economic forces are pushing us to.  That’s not to ask you not to present this, but it’s to ask whether the deeper and deeper and the more complicated questionnaires you’re preparing are helping us do what we need to do in making our decisions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage shows a disagreement or contention between Mr. Fischer and the person he is addressing. Mr. Fischer expresses his concern about relying too heavily on information from market participants and suggests that the briefings should focus more on the staff's beliefs about economic forces.


Passage number 68.
 MR. POTTER.  Agreed.  As you look at the data, this is just one point for you to look at, and you have a lot of other information you can bring to bear on your decisions.  The only thing I’d say is, the history of markets forecasting these turning points is a little bit better than forecasters just looking at the backward-looking data that they have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Potter and the speaker seem to agree on the idea that the history of markets forecasting turning points is slightly better than forecasters solely relying on backward-looking data.


Passage number 69.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes, well, you know, the famous Samuelson statement—but I was told by somebody in the Treasury that it’s not that the markets forecast 9 of the past 5 recessions, it’s that they forecast 20 of the past 8.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply recounting a statement they were told by someone in the Treasury. There is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 70.
 MR. POTTER.  That is probably about right, and the staff forecast has done 0 of the past 9. [Laughter]  So you can make a choice.CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a lighthearted exchange with laughter between Mr. Potter and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 71.
 MR. BULLARD.  Maybe just to clarify in my own mind some of the information that is in this exhibit 2, bottom-right panel, could one of the things that has been going on—obviously, I know you said this in different ways—be that because, internationally, central banks are experimenting with negative rates, market participants are looking out there, and they are really thinking, “Oh, if something bad happened, the Committee here would go negative, and, therefore, we are going to lower the whole expected policy rate path.”  Is that what you are saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by MR. BULLARD to clarify his understanding.


Passage number 72.
 MR. POTTER.  No.  If you take out the 12 responses that have negative rates or push them to 13 basis points, you get an increase of 3 basis points in the 2017 and 2018 dots.  So that is not what I am saying.  The 30 percent probability of returning to the effective lower bound is not that different from the previous probability we had over two years.  It is over three years.  The thing I am trying to emphasize is that even if we take the expected path, which doesn’t return to the lower bound, they still see downside risks relative to their modal forecast.  And that’s hard to understand.  It could be the neutral rate.  It could be these global forces and a lot of other things that are driving it.  But it’s data driven.  I was surprised to see how much of what was a big gap we could reconcile by changing the questions.  And they didn’t get to see how their answers added up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their own observations and opinions without directly contradicting or arguing against anyone else.


Passage number 73.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes, okay. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen are simply acknowledging and agreeing with each other's statements.


Passage number 74.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I admit I am still digesting the analysis you just gave us, but I do think it’s very useful to have you try to explain what the market pricing is telling us.  For example, here is a different one.  On exhibit 2, the top right, you display the five-year, five-year inflation swap rates and how they have taken another leg down.  And I think you mentioned that the Board of Governors’ assessment of this is below 1½ percent.  It is extremely low.  Now, we’ve talked about this in the past, and I have been troubled by the fact that we kind of dismissed these movements, especially when they are associated with another leg down in the price of oil:  Well, there is just a high correlation between oil going down and all the volatility, and so this is really something else about market functioning.  But I don’t know what we know about that.  That’s a story, but I wonder about it.  And analysis like what you are talking about might shed light on whether markets actually believe that the FOMC is going to be unable to hit its 2 percent inflation objective in a world in which world demand is lower, oil supplies are higher, the price of energy is going down, prices of commodities are going down, and there is a lower equilibrium real interest rate.  I think it is extremely useful for your team to provide some commentary, at least, as to how market participants are thinking about that.  And I tend to think that these legs down are somewhat meaningful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is the speaker expressing appreciation for the analysis given and requesting further commentary on market participants' thoughts.


Passage number 75.
 MR. POTTER.  There’s definitely evidence that, when risk assets decline, the correlation that breakeven inflation has with oil goes up.  And, remember, it is hard for us to explain why inflation from 2020 to 2024 should be related to the oil price today.  We don’t have a good explanation for that.  It is starting to feed on itself, though, because everyone has seen that.  So the trades they are putting on are sort of based on that.  And it is not just in the United States; you see it in Europe and other parts of the world.  We were doing 30-minute correlations through the trade index, and you can see them really moving up across asset classes.  We don’t have a good explanation for that, and it could be something to do with how these assets are traded in the short run.  But if you look over a reasonable period of time, which is now six weeks, these are pretty large falls in risk assets as well as a large decline in the inflation compensation measures we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that there is evidence of a correlation between breakeven inflation and the decline of risk assets, but they do not have a good explanation for why this correlation exists. They also mention that this trend is observed globally.


Passage number 76.
 MR. EVANS.  And, historically, we have looked to measures like this, for example when we were simply looking at long-term Treasury rates quite a long time ago and saying, “They moved up, it must be inflationary pressures.”  These are part of the toolbox that we keep pointing to, and dismissing the movements when they are inconvenient but then bringing them back later on when they are moving up.  I think we need a better handle on that.  And I rely on your analysis to help us with that.  I appreciate that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and acknowledging their reliance on the analysis of the person they are speaking to.


Passage number 77.
 MR. POTTER.  I think the Board staff has also done a lot of good work on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges and appreciates the work done by the Board staff.


Passage number 78.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions.  [No response]  Okay.  I think Lorie is going to continue now with the second part of the Desk briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply describes a transition in the conversation without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 79.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a question, Lorie, on slide 19.  You focused on the average, but there’s a lot of dispersion in both of those charts, in terms of both timing and level.  Is that a problem.  Are people sort of clamoring for more guidance on when we are going to reduce the cap or what the level will be.  Or is that something that is not a market focus at all.  The reason why I am raising this, obviously, is that this is relevant to the discussion that we are going to have in a few minutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply raising a question and expressing their curiosity about the dispersion and whether people are seeking more guidance on reducing the cap or determining the level. They specifically mention that they are bringing it up because it is relevant to the upcoming discussion.


Passage number 80.
 MS. LOGAN.  In most of the discussions we had this round, it wasn’t a topic that came up because they were much more focused on the volatility that we are seeing in financial markets, and they assumed that there was some time for this decision to be made.  So we asked a lot about their framework and how things were trading in money markets.  But this wasn’t at the top of their minds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is describing the discussions had during a round, and there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 81.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So they’re not expecting anything from us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 82.
 MS. LOGAN.  You can see there are some market participants who expect the timing to be soon, but I don’t think it was a big focus.  The write-ups and commentary that were circulated certainly mentioned it as a possibility of being discussed with the minutes this round.  But, again, there were a lot of other issues in financial markets that dominated the discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply mentions that some market participants expect a certain timing, but she personally does not think it was a big focus. She also acknowledges that the topic was mentioned as a possibility but was not the main focus of the discussion.


Passage number 83.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions for Lorie.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, Gretchen Weinbach is going to provide us some comments to guide our discussion of the cap and the timing concerning it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward exchange of information and requests for further input.


Passage number 84.
 MS. WEINBACH.3  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will be referring to the exhibits titled “Reducing Aggregate Capacity of the ON RRP Facility” as I highlight key themes in the recent staff memo on this topic.  As Simon and Lorie noted, the implementation of December’s increase in the target range for the federal funds rate went smoothly.  In view of the Committee’s stated expectation that it will be appropriate to reduce the facility’s capacity “fairly soon” after the start of policy firming, you may want to consider when and how to reintroduce an aggregate cap on the facility. As noted in the first exhibit, our experience with policy implementation to date, both before and after liftoff, leaves us with two key takeaways that are relevant for calibrating the capacity of the ON RRP facility.  First, market confidence that the facility will have sufficient headroom over time seems to be important for interest rate control.  But there is little direct evidence we can bring to bear on the issue of exactly how large ON RRP headroom needs to be to support interest rate control in the future.  Having very elevated capacity of almost $2 trillion at liftoff may have contributed to the success of the initial policy firming by producing high confidence among market participants in the availability of the facility or by signaling that the Federal Reserve would do what it takes to control interest rates.  In the period ahead, the amount of sufficient headroom will likely be lower than that afforded by the current capacity setting, but it could also be higher than the amount—roughly $150 billion—that prevailed, on average, during the testing phase of ON RRP operations prior to liftoff. The second key takeaway is that demand for ON RRPs with the Federal Reserve could increase significantly over time.  Factors that might contribute to increased demand include changes in financial regulations for money funds and banks as well 3 The materials used by Ms. Weinbach are appended to this transcript (appendix 3). as a rise in the general level of U.S. interest rates, including the ON RRP offering rate, compared with those on some money market instruments or other assets.  Taken together, these factors suggest that there is meaningful uncertainty about the future demand for RRPs with the Federal Reserve and thus the usage of the ON RRP facility. As summarized in exhibit 2, the memo offered three illustrative options for reducing the aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility, keeping in mind the possibility that demand for RRPs with the Federal Reserve could grow over time.  It also discussed the high-level policy tradeoffs inherent in choosing among the options.  You could initially set a high cap, as in option 1, perhaps in the range of $800 billion or $1 trillion; a high cap would make it very unlikely that the cap would need to be increased over time.  You might prefer this option if you see substantial headroom as being important for rate control but are less concerned about surge risk and the Fed’s potential footprint in financial markets in the near term.  Even if you were quite concerned about surge risk and footprint issues over time, you might see setting an initial cap of $800 billion or even $1 trillion as a prudent first step in a process of reducing the cap over time. Alternatively, you might prefer to initially set a lower cap, as in the two other options, because you judge that the level of headroom sufficient for supporting interest rate control is unlikely to be more than several hundred billion dollars and because you want to mitigate surge risk in the near term.  If you also judge that it would be important to accommodate trend growth in demand for ON RRPs in order to maintain sufficient, but nonetheless limited, headroom, you might choose, as in option 2, to announce that you will increase the cap over time as necessary to maintain interest rate control.  Or, as in option 3, you might instead prefer to set a hard cap and make it clear that it will not be increased over time.  This approach might be preferred if you wished to limit the extent to which a very large ON RRP facility might alter the behavior of money funds and other institutional investors.  Of course, there are some caveats to these broad assessments that we noted in the memo. As noted at the top of exhibit 3, a related issue is the timing of a reduction in capacity—that is, what constitutes “fairly soon”.  If you judge rate control to be sufficient and likely to be sustained with lower capacity in the ON RRP facility, you might choose to reduce capacity as early as the March meeting.  Doing so might reduce your concerns about exposure to some risks, including possible surges in take-up, and perhaps also footprint-related issues regarding the Federal Reserve’s potential influence in financial markets.  Or you might want to wait longer, perhaps because you want to gain more experience with policy normalization or prefer to wait until some upcoming calendar events—such as March quarter-end and the April tax season—have passed. As noted in the middle panel, how to handle calendar effects on the demand for RRPs in the period ahead, such as at March quarter-end, is a somewhat separate issue.  We expect these effects will continue for some time and recommend that the Committee continue to provide sufficient RRPs at quarter-ends to alleviate the associated pressures in money markets.  Under any of the three capacity options just discussed, calendar effects could be accommodated. The bottom panel lists some considerations regarding your near-term communications about RRPs.  First, the minutes to this meeting will note that the topic of reducing the capacity of the ON RRP facility was discussed, which could help lay the groundwork for your future decision.  In addition, if you are inclined to accommodate quarter-end pressures by ensuring sufficient RRP capacity, the minutes could also convey that intention.  The decision about how to manage RRP capacity around March quarter-end can be deferred until the March FOMC meeting, as it will depend in part on the nature of the cap on ON RRPs in place at that time. Lastly, we note that the drafts of the domestic policy directive for January that are shown in Tealbook B eliminate the reference to term RRPs because the testing resolution cited in the December directive has expired; it provided authority for term RRPs at quarter-ends only in 2015.  If the Committee decides to offer term RRPs in March, the directive could be changed in March to indicate that. The final page in your exhibits lists the questions for discussion that were included in the cover note to the staff memo.  Thank you, we’d be happy to take your questions. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Gretchen.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 85.
  MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Actually, I have several questions, and maybe I’ll start with the ones that are more specific.  Is my understanding correct, Gretchen, that the way we have been doing term RRPs, at least in the testing phase, would be completely consistent with the SEC’s rules for liquidity for government-only money market funds.  The reason I ask that is, obviously, to the degree that we’re worried about surge or business model effects, if the term RRP actually is perfectly consistent with the external constraints that the money market funds would face, then our choosing to use term RRP really wouldn’t make that much of a difference in inhibiting any of those effects.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and information.


Passage number 86.
 MS. WEINBACH.  That’s right.  You have been using term RRP at quarter-ends, and that doesn’t come with those concerns.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply confirming that the term RRP is used at quarter-ends without any concerns.


Passage number 87.
 MR. POTTER.  Was your point that settlement is two plus zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information regarding contention or disagreement. It simply states the question asked by Mr. Potter.


Passage number 88.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement. The passage simply states that Mr. Tarullo agrees with something, without any opposing views mentioned.


Passage number 89.
 MR. POTTER.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states the name "Mr. Potter" in a neutral manner.


Passage number 90.
 MS. WEINBACH.  As far as I know, you’re right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The person agrees with the statement made by another person.


Passage number 91.
 MR. POTTER.  But it’s a quantity operation rather than a fixed-rate one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply providing information about the operation being discussed.


Passage number 92.
 MR. TARULLO.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
Explanation: The passage only states a response made by Mr. Tarullo without providing any additional information or context that would suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 93.
 MR. POTTER.  So suppose we run the operation at 9:30 in the morning, and there’s an event the night before.  The surge would come in, and the rate would change at that point because it’s a maximum bid rate, so that’s the maximum you can bid.  So for people who really wanted the money, what you’d see is very low rates being put in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining a hypothetical scenario and how the rate would change in that situation.


Passage number 94.
 MR. TARULLO.  I see.  So it might have some efficacy as an antisurge mechanism.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 95.
 MS. WEINBACH.  So far it hasn’t been intended to do that, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a statement and does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 96.
 MR. POTTER.  Well, when we first offered it, we had it at 10 basis points, so we were getting more demand.  The way it would do it is, if there was a surge, it’s got a price mechanism, which is natural.  Hitting the cap in the overnight RRP is a different type of event because we’re not expecting that to be hit.  So it has a different type of signal when you hit the cap in the overnight RRP.  Then we just say, “Here’s $X billion.  You can take as much as you like, and we’re going to allocate this by just going through the bids, awarding the price that clears.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the impact of different price mechanisms and how they are handled in the context of the overnight RRP market.


Passage number 97.
” MR. TARULLO.  That’s helpful.  My second question is—and you may not have the answer to this at your fingertips, but—do we know where nongovernment money market fund holdings are concentrated right now.  That is, in which countries, banks, other areas.  Because it’s not a trivial consideration in thinking about how concerned we should be over the next couple of quarters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for information and clarifying the importance of knowing the concentration of nongovernment money market fund holdings.


Passage number 98.
  MS. WEINBACH.  Right.  I don’t have a great breakdown of that, but I think a lot of the holders tend to be hedge funds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Ms. Weinbach about the ownership of a certain type of holders.


Passage number 99.
 MR. POTTER.  In the FR 2420, we can see that there are some very large French banks who are funding through the Eurodollar market.  Most of it looks like what’s called “luxury funding,” so it’s the arbitrage-type funding.  Japanese banks definitely have some other types of issues.  Then it’s Australian, Canadian, Norwegian—I don’t think they’re going to be greatly affected by this because they’re just arbing through into the interest on excess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It presents information about different banks and their funding methods without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 100.
 MR. TARULLO.  Okay, that’s helpful.  My last questions are about one of the factors that Gretchen noted in the reasons why demand may increase over time, which is regulation.  My first question is on the reference in the memo to some regulations affecting foreign agencies and branches being “in train.”  If I understand correctly the kind of regulations you were talking about, I wouldn’t have characterized them as “in train” so much as “under discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a conversation where Mr. Tarullo is seeking clarification on certain regulations mentioned in a memo.


Passage number 101.
” MS. WEINBACH.  Yes.  We subsequently questioned that wording, so I agree with your characterization.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Ms. Weinbach agrees with the characterization made by the other person.


Passage number 102.
 MR. TARULLO.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple statement or response.


Passage number 103.
  MS. WEINBACH.  The example there gave the nature of the kind of thing we had in mind.  There had been conversations of possible things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that the example provided aligns with what they had in mind.


Passage number 104.
 MR. TARULLO.  Okay.  And then, am I correct in drawing a distinction between the SEC regulations as they affect the decisions of money market funds, on the one hand, and the possibility, which I think is unlikely to be realized in the short term, of Europe changing its rules on how leverage ratios have to be reported, on the other hand.  But let’s stipulate, for a second, that that change might take place, thereby affecting how the branches of foreign banks think about the ON RRP.  Tell me if I’m missing something here, but it seems to me that those are somewhat different considerations because for the money market funds, their decision is being made with reference, among other things, to what they think we’re going to do.  That is, whether to shift from being a prime fund to a government-only fund may be dependent, in no small part, on whether they think there’s going to be another half a trillion or trillion dollars available for them to invest.  Whereas, if you are a bank and you’re just facing capital constraints, you’re going to have to adjust from where you are now as opposed to make a decision to start in some new line of business.  Is that a fair way of looking at it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 105.
 MS. WEINBACH.  I think so.  That’s right, that there would be some element of choice in the money fund conversion to appeal to investors, but taking into account, in some sense, the prevalence of the availability of the overnight RRP as an investment, whereas the other one is an unconditional change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating her opinion and acknowledging the existence of a choice for investors regarding the conversion of money funds.


Passage number 106.
 MR. POTTER.  I think for the money funds, they also don’t know what the institutional investors are going to do.  Suppose prime funds start posting much higher rates.  Will that attract some of that institutional money back in that’s scared about the regulatory changes.  We don’t know that.  That’s probably one of the biggest uncertainties in the money fund complex right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the potential attraction of institutional investors to prime funds.


Passage number 107.
  MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  That I get.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Further questions for Gretchen.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, why don’t we begin our go-round.  Oh, sorry.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are simply acknowledging each other and moving on to the next topic.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 108.
 MR. FISCHER.  Could I ask Simon and Lorie—you have this hint on page 2 of your very clear paper, which I’ll read to you, and perhaps you can explain it:  “The very elevated setting of the cap may have also conveyed the sense that the Committee is willing to do what it takes to control interest rates”—this in a context in which you’re explaining the importance of the cap.  And then it continues:  “Arguably, this effect could be achieved through other means.”  What are the other means.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Arguably, this effect could be achieved through other means" suggests that there is potential for alternative methods to achieve the same effect as the cap mentioned earlier in the passage. This implies a contrasting viewpoint or potential disagreement on the effectiveness or necessity of the cap.


Passage number 109.
 MS. LOGAN.  Different people may have had different means in mind.  One example could be, as in option 2, communicating timely adjustments to the cap to ensure it’s not binding over some medium-run horizon.  I think if there was full certainty that the cap was going to be adjusted such that it wouldn’t bind, that would give market participants a similar type of certainty as the high cap might be demonstrating.  There might be other options that people have in mind, but that’s the way I would have interpreted it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Logan is simply presenting an alternative option for ensuring that the cap is not binding over a medium-run horizon. She also mentions that there might be other options, but she is stating her own interpretation.


Passage number 110.
 MR. POTTER.  If the only thing that interested you was control of the federal funds rate, there were very many ways we could’ve done that.  We could’ve drained $2.4 trillion of reserves out of the system—it would’ve been quite painful, but we could’ve done it.  But our viewpoint was, there were a lot of other thoughts going into this, and Gretchen tried to go through some of those issues.  There’s a big issue of some of the trading in these markets.  There’s probably some bargaining surplus for people to agree about.  And by showing a determination to get the rate firmly in the range, we probably helped the people who are investing cash at that point rather than the people who wanted to get cash in and would much rather pay less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mainly discussing different options and considerations related to controlling the federal funds rate.


Passage number 111.
 MS. WEINBACH.  It’s mainly a general thought meant to capture the fact that there are other ways—including, as Lori said, “words,” or as Simon said, “tool adjustments”—that could be used to convey that the Federal Reserve is on the job and that there’s not only one way to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents different perspectives or ideas on ways to convey the message that the Federal Reserve is active.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 112.
 MR. FISCHER.  But some of that is in option 2, isn’t it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The phrase "But some of that is in option 2, isn't it?" indicates that Mr. Fischer is raising a point of disagreement or contention by questioning the inclusion of certain elements in option 2.


Passage number 113.
 MS. WEINBACH.  Yes.  Your communications about each of these options is an important feature in making these tradeoffs.  You can communicate about each one in pretty different ways, and that might alter the way you make those assessments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating that communication about different options can influence decision-making.


Passage number 114.
 MR. FISCHER.  Simon, just one last question.  I was thinking that I might be told, “Well, we could go out and do open market operations from the portfolio.”  Is that what you’re saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 115.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.  We could’ve built up a book of term TDF, term RRP, in a really classic way.  We’d just multiply the numbers we used to do by about a hundred or a thousand, and then we’d be there.  It just might be disruptive in the market for us to come in for $300 billion or $400 billion a day, something like that, and setting term rates.  One of the advantages of using the overnight RRP in this particular case—there are other issues with it—is that it zeroes in to support interest on excess reserves and doesn’t have us breaking a sweat each day to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 116.
 MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions.  [No response]  Okay.  If not, let’s begin the go-round.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not have any contention or disagreement. The speakers are simply discussing the start of the next round or phase without any opposing viewpoints or arguments being presented.


Passage number 117.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Liftoff occurred more smoothly than I anticipated.  With the exception of the end of the year, the utilization of the facility has been rather limited.  With the federal funds rate and the Eurodollar rate trading well above 25 basis points on most days, it is not surprising that prime money market funds are not making extensive use of the facility on most days.  Other short-term instruments of high quality are paying rates higher than the RRP rate.  It might be useful in future presentations to distinguish between prime and government-only funds, just to highlight that.  For the government-only funds, with more limited alternatives, the RRP facility is more frequently attractive, in part because short-term Treasury rates have been below the RRP rate, as was shown in Lorie’s chart 17. For many of the days since liftoff, the one- and three-month Treasury bills have traded below the RRP rate.  However, this has been a period complicated by liftoff, the end of the year, and significant financial turbulence.  If the one- and three-month Treasury bill rates start to trade consistently above the RRP rate, there should be much less incentive for government-only funds to make use of the facility.  I think it would be useful to observe how the use of the facility changes as these complicating factors diminish.  As a result, I’d prefer to not alter the capacity of the facility at this time and wait to make a decision on the capacity of the RRP facility until we have somewhat more experience with the facility under more normal circumstances. The primary use of the facility is likely to occur at quarter- and year-ends.  This is a manifestation of poorly designed European bank regulations that incent bank window-dressing.  The Basel III leverage ratio framework, as Governor Tarullo was referencing, requires a minimum capital calculation at quarter-end.  The United States requires averages of daily values throughout quarter for the variables that enter into the calculation of capital ratios used to meet capital requirements, whereas most E.U. nations use quarter-end values.  The United Kingdom has recently changed regulations to require the use of averages of daily, on-balance-sheet assets, but U.K. banks don’t need to comply until December 2017.  Not surprisingly, in the presence of these incentives, the main culprit in window-dressing is the behavior of foreign branches and agencies.  If one looks at H.8 weekly data, U.S. bank assets do not decline significantly at quarter-end, unlike foreign branches and agencies that show distinct decreases at quarter-end. If one examines money market fund data, roughly 30 percent of prime money market assets are liabilities of European banks.  However, at the end of a quarter, there’s a discernible decline in money market fund exposures to European banks but not a discernible drop to exposure to non-European banks.  This implies two possible responses to get at the root cause of seasonality.  First, encourage European colleagues to change reporting requirements.  Not only does window-dressing misrepresent the true position of banks to investors and regulators, but it is generating problems discernible in the United States.  Second, we should consider ways in which we in the United States can strongly discourage branches and agencies of European banks from dramatically downsizing at quarter-ends.  If European regulators want to perpetuate the misrepresentation of their banks’ balance sheets and capital cushions, let them do it in Europe, rather than in the branches and agencies they have located in the United States. An alternative strategy to reduce the dependence on an RRP facility would be to allow the RRP rate to move up more slowly than the IOER rate.  So far, the IOER appears to be the main mechanism for keeping the federal funds rate at roughly a 15 basis point discount.  Should that be maintained as we raise rates, more slowly raising the RRP rate will discourage the use of the RRP facility as short-term Treasury yields are more likely to be above the RRP rate. When we decide to make changes to the RRP facility, I would suggest that we start with option 1 and then potentially move to option 2.  Whether money market funds use overnight RRP or term RRP would seem to have little implication for the size of the Fed’s footprint, as Governor Tarullo was mentioning.  The most efficient way to discourage use of the RRP would be to get at the root cause of window-dressing and to make take-up of the RRP facility less attractive in relation to short-term Treasury rates.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is providing information and suggestions on how to potentially reduce the use of the RRP facility.


Passage number 118.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me begin by, again, commending Simon, Lorie, and their colleagues at the Desk for their expert preparation for, and precise execution of, the December rate rise, which has relieved us of a bunch of headaches we otherwise might have had following Christmas and even at this meeting.  And I’m glad we’re talking about the imposition of a limit on the ON RRP so quickly after liftoff. Having said that, I want to say that I share some of President Rosengren’s sense that it would be good to get a better idea of how things may normalize over the course of the next few months.  My only qualification to what President Rosengren said is that I would worry if, as my question to Gretchen earlier suggested, we saw in the process a migration of prime funds to be government-only money market funds potentially premised on an expectation of the availability of a very large cap, which would facilitate such a move.  That really is the dilemma that I see.  I would like to accommodate possible increases in demand associated with what the memo described as zero-lower-bound effects, but not to accommodate possible increases in demand that are associated with money market funds deciding that this is a good business model for them to move into, as opposed to simply reacting, at the end of quarters when FBOs are not doing as much activity as they normally do. I would actually not be averse to waiting a little longer on the basis of the best understanding we have that, as of now, there doesn’t seem to be much of a migration.  But I have to confess, I worry that when it starts, it could start pretty quickly, and some of that $700 billion in remaining assets referenced in the staff memo could move pretty quickly. When we do move, like President Rosengren, I’m inclined toward option 1, but I would say option 1 with an explicit suggestion that further periodic reductions in the cap will be forthcoming, because if we don’t have that, we might be sending the signal that it’s going to be a trillion indefinitely, at which point we might be providing incentives, rather than disincentives, for some of the things that I’ve been concerned with. What I most want to avoid is for us to impose a cap and then raise or remove it later.  It seems to me that would risk a little bit of a negative for FOMC credibility in managing interest rate increases, but it may also communicate to money managers that we will adjust the ON RRP to accommodate whatever demand does develop.  And, again, that wouldn’t be the signal that I would want to send.  Imposing a cap, with an expectation of lower caps to come, would signal a tapering of the program that should at least limit that incentive. Now, obviously, a lower initial cap would send a stronger signal, but were the possibility described in the staff memo of the increase in demand associated with the ELB effects to materialize, I suspect a majority, if not everyone, on this Committee would want the ability to set a hard floor for the federal funds rate by using more ON RRP.  That’s why, as I said, I would prefer to be a little bit more conservative in setting the cap in order to avoid the need to reverse later. Let’s see.  Eric made a number of these other points, so I won’t repeat them.  I think I’ll end there, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is mostly expressing agreement with President Rosengren's views and discussing their own concerns and preferences.


Passage number 119.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, want to thank the staff for the helpful memo.  Because we’ve said publicly that the aggregate capacity on the ON RRP facility would be temporarily elevated at liftoff and that we expected to reduce the capacity fairly soon after the first increase in the funds rate, I don’t think it’s too soon to consider how we want to approach this reduction in capacity. I view the main reason for the ON RRP facility is to give us better control of the interest rate.  By all accounts, operationally, liftoff was a success.  I agree with my colleagues.  The combination of our tools proved up to the task, and I thank the Desk and the Board staff that made that happen.  But as the staff memo assessing our control of interest rates says, it’s difficult to know the relative effects that the IOER, ON RRP, large aggregate cap on the ON RRP facility, and moving away from the lower bound had in bringing short-term interest rates up to the target.  Thus, how high a cap is needed to ensure interest rate control is not known with certainty at this point.  But we also have to consider some of the potential costs associated with the facility, especially if the cap on aggregate capacity remains large. As others have said, there’s a possibility during times of financial market stress that firms will turn to the facility instead of their private-sector counterparts and subtract liquidity from the market, thereby exacerbating stress on the markets.  Also, a large facility may lead, over time, to operational and structural changes in private-sector money markets.  That may affect the viability of the funds rate market over time or other parts of the private-sector funding market.  I think, because the Committee is currently studying what its longer-run operating framework should be, we wouldn’t want a decision we make today or pretty soon to, in effect, take an option off the table for our operating framework. Some of these cost-benefit considerations led the Committee to decide, as indicated in the normalization principles, that it would use the ON RRP facility only to the extent necessary to help control the funds rate, and that it would phase it out when the facility is no longer needed.  Those principles helped guide my thinking on the questions posed in the staff memo. Regarding an approach to scaling back the size of the facility, in general, I don’t think we should be moving the maximum size of the facility up or down at high frequency.  Admittedly, there are still some questions about what size of the facility is needed for interest rate control and what the demand on the ON RRPs will be, and the memo discusses, in a pretty in-depth way, some reasons to think that demand will be rising over time.  In addition, we’ve had only one rate increase, and we’ve experienced only one quarter-end since liftoff.  I think we should avoid being overly confident in our ability to raise short-term interest rates. Given these considerations, I think we should come to some determination of the appropriate size, conditional on our current estimates and expectations, and then use term RRPs to offset changes in demand that will result from calendar effects, like quarter-ends.  At some point, consistent with the normalization principles, we’ll determine that the facility is no longer needed, and we’ll have a plan for phasing out the facility, perhaps by reducing its size.  I think this puts me closest to the memo’s option 3, but I’m perhaps less dogmatic about never being willing to raise the cap, in view of some of the uncertainties about demand.  If it turns out that we’ve set the cap too low for adequate control of interest rates, we may indeed have to revisit the size, but I don’t think that should be our default intention.  I think we can use language similar to what’s in our normalization principles—indicate our plan, but also say that we would be prepared to make some adjustments, if necessary, in the interest of interest rate control. Given the take-up to date, the $400 billion to $600 billion aggregate cap in option 3 seems reasonable to me.  But because we’re very early in the normalization process, and our estimates of trend demand are not certain, I’m not fully confident in that size and would like to see more analysis supporting that.  I see some merit in waiting until after the March quarter-end to initiate a reduction in the cap to gain more experience during a period of potentially elevated demand. If the staff indicated that implementing another funds rate increase would be a very valuable experience in determining the appropriate size of the facility, then I wouldn’t necessarily be averse to that, but I think the communications reconciling this with our previous indication that we would reduce the size fairly soon after liftoff would have to be carefully done.  The minutes of this meeting will reveal that we’ve had this discussion, and, as the staff memo suggests, it could be used to indicate the Committee’s intentions with respect to the cap.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 120.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  A couple of comments before answering the questions.  The gist is willingness to begin with the end in mind, the ultimate objective for the ON RRP facility.  We actually decided on our objective in September 2014 when we announced that the Committee will phase it out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.  So how will we know when the facility is no longer needed to control the federal funds rate.  The staff memo focuses heavily on the short-run tactical question of what to do next with the overall cap, and they didn’t provide an analysis of this question of how to know when the facility is no longer needed to control the federal funds rate.  In fact, they haven’t proposed how we’re going to find out, either. We spent a lot of time discussing whether the overnight RRP facility was necessary to control the funds rate before liftoff, but at that time the one consideration that seemed to trump all others was the desire to avoid the embarrassment of raising the target range for the federal funds rate and interest rate on excess reserves and not having money market rates follow right along.  We used to refer to this as the “egg on the face” risk.  So we did it.  We raised our administrative rates, and market rates came right along as we predicted and hoped, and we didn’t get egg on our face.  So I think that we can think about the role of the overnight RRP facility without that dreadful fear trumping everything else and indicating, well, we have to have this program. Now, the question is, to what extent is the funds rate being held up by the interest rate on excess reserves as opposed to the overnight RRP rate.  The staff doesn’t know.  They were agnostic, or maybe they just couldn’t agree on it—they didn’t say one way or another.  The natural way to answer this question, it seems to me, is to do some tests.  We did some testing before in 2014 by varying the interest rate we paid on the overnight RRP facility.  I think we should do some tests again.  The memos don’t make any mention of changing the RP facility rate, and I find that surprising.  There is a lot of discussions of demand and how demand might rise over time.  Obviously, demand depends on the price, though, and surely it would vary. It seems plausible to me, looking at what’s happened since liftoff, that the funds rate doesn’t depend much on the RP facility rate.  That seem really plausible to me.  The fact that the funds rate fell below the RP facility rate at the end of the year suggests, as the staff indicated, that overnight RRPs at our facility are not a very good substitute for funds rate transactions due to the time of day the funds get returned.  It strikes me that we could learn more by moving the rate.  Now, President Rosengren suggested moving the facility rate less than we raised IOER when we raise interest rates.  I’m not sure we have to wait for a rate increase to do that.  I think we could undertake an experiment like that later this year. We’re talking about the funds rate, and our objective is to control the funds rate and keep the funds rate within the target.  The question is, could lowering the rate on the overnight RRP facility result in a decline in market RP rates.  That’s not obvious, because the market RP rates are above our facility rate now.  It could be that that spread is determined by the market, and that spread will remain constant, and the RP market rates will fall if we reduce the facility rate.  That could be.  But if that does happen, it’s not clear it should bother us, because our announced goal is to control the federal funds rate, and we used to not care about the RP rate.  We used to let the spread be determined by market, and the market set the spread at various rates at various times.  It was never a concern for the Committee.  So I think there’s an open question, and it would be useful to get the staff working on it.  I understand that the long-term framework project is going to be examining these and other questions presumably, but for us I think it’s important to remember that our objective is to phase out this facility if it’s no longer needed to keep the funds rate within the target, and I think we need to find out whether it’s needed or not and reduce the facility appropriately as we learn. For the questions, I would prefer option 3—a low hard cap—because I think it would more rapidly ramp down market expectations about the ongoing scale of the program in the future.  Quarter-end fluctuations have been a feature of money markets since—I want to say the beginning of time, but let’s say before the crisis.  And, again, they never really bothered the Committee because it never really made a difference for monetary conditions.  I don’t think we should change the parameters for quarter-end. For communications, I’d suggest that we say that we believe that the interest rate on excess reserves is able to carry most of the weight in controlling the funds rate, and that we’ll do some experimenting as we go forward to confirm this, and we expect to phase out the ON RRP program gradually as evidence accumulates that IOER is sufficient.  As for timing of putting a cap on it, March isn’t too soon for me, but I’ve heard other views around the table, so we’ll have to discuss that in the future.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Harker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 121.
 MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m in favor of being forward looking, but even then it seems a bit early to me to be making a decision on this matter.  For me, the overriding concern right now is maintaining control of the federal funds rate.  I believe it’s important that we maintain maximum flexibility until we’re well on our way toward policy normalization. Given the uncertainties about how demand for overnight RRP will develop and how gradually we will be normalizing policy, it seems to me that now is not the time to signal to markets that we will be reducing aggregate capacity for this facility.  So I prefer an approach that would have us implement a flexible cap once the fund rate target hits a certain level—say, for the sake of argument, 1 percent—rather than adhering to a date-dependent schedule.  At that time we should have a much clearer picture about the normal take-up of the facility, and we could be more confident about how gradually capacity can be reduced without unnecessarily imposing worries about headroom on participants. Now, if there is a strong view about setting an aggregate cap now, I prefer we set it at a very high level that would reassure markets about our continued willingness to support demand for overnight RRP in the early stages of policy normalization.  As for calendar-based pressures, I’d prefer that we use term RRPs to meet that demand.  If we proceed at this gradual pace and markets are settled in the use of the overnight facility, I believe our communication about reducing the capacity of the facility will just simply be that much easier.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Harker expresses his opinion and preferences on the matter, but does not directly disagree with any other speaker or point of view.


Passage number 122.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’d also like to commend the Board staff and New York for such excellent materials on the design and the implementation that prepared us for the programs that were put in place so that things would run so smoothly.  It’s really been a big help. The Committee has previously agreed that the ON RRP facility will be temporary.  I continue to support this approach, and this bears repeating in our announcements.  I’m inclined to favor option 1.  I think that reducing the cap from its current $2 trillion level down to the $1 trillion cap envisioned in option 1 would help remind the markets that our eventual goal for this temporary facility is to wind down the program.  At this point, like, I think, Governor Tarullo, I could support periodic reductions in the overnight RRP capacity from time to time.  I’m not a big fan of option 2, with the flexible adjustments.  I think we could move to the $1 trillion cap fairly quickly, within a few meetings, but there’s no need to rush toward a lower hard cap, as in option 3, until we’ve had experience with multiple rate hikes and have more information on the real size and effect of this market. Regarding end-of-quarter pressures, frankly, it’s not clear to me how important this issue really is.  During my time in the System, the federal funds rate has often traded away from target for a short period around quarter-end, sometimes spectacularly.  These short-term seasonal variations have not had any significant effect on achieving our policy goals, as near as I can tell, or the ultimate reliability of the monetary policy transmission mechanism itself.  I’m not saying there wasn’t pain for various financial participants, but quarter-end federal funds rate spikes did not leave an imprint on macrodata, as near as I can tell.  Knowledgeable market observers know that these seasonal effects exist, and they adjust their interpretations of rate movements accordingly. Finally, regarding communications, for now I think that we should reiterate that the facility is temporary, but that the timing and size of future reductions in the cap will depend on how the normalization process is proceeding.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily a statement of the speaker's own opinions and preferences.


Passage number 123.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Something that Presidents Lacker and Evans have now both said makes me want to ask the two of them a question.  Is one or both of you saying that you would be willing to accept some softness in the federal funds rate around the end of quarters, and that’s what you mean by not worrying too much about the window-dressing effects.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question to seek clarification from Presidents Lacker and Evans.


Passage number 124.
 MR. EVANS.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "MR. EVANS. Absolutely" as it is a simple response affirming something.


Passage number 125.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The word "yes" is not indicative of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 126.
 MR. TARULLO.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a statement from Mr. Tarullo and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 127.
 MR. LACKER.  It always happened, yes.  It always used to happen, and it was inconsequential.  What matters is longer-run rates, and they’re going to average through the quarter-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any clear contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker about a past occurrence and his opinion on what is important in the longer term.


Passage number 128.
 MR. EVANS.  Well, it would matter if it makes it into the two-year rate or the three-month rate or things like that, lending rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear indication of contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the importance of certain rates and lending rates without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 129.
 MR. TARULLO.  That also gets back to the issue of reporting requirements that President Rosengren raised that I should have but didn’t comment on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges a point that was raised but not addressed.


Passage number 130.
 MR. POTTER.  There is a very important difference from before the crisis.  Our balance sheet on the liabilities side was currency plus a little bit of reserves.  Now, it’s currency plus about $3 trillion of other liabilities which the system has to deal with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any clear contention or disagreement. It simply outlines a difference in the balance sheet before and after the crisis.


Passage number 131.
 MR. LACKER.  But we’re talking about what rates do.  It’s a question of whether you mind rates going 5 basis points, 10 basis points lower.  It’s the same question whether we have a giant balance sheet or a little one.  I don’t get it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing confusion and seeking clarification.


Passage number 132.
 MR. POTTER.  I don’t think it’s quite the same because of how many liabilities there are in the system.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Potter is expressing his opinion about the system and the number of liabilities it has, but there is no explicit disagreement or debate.


Passage number 133.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Are you talking about just the frictional cost of moving all that money around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for clarification.


Passage number 134.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.  It’s a different situation when you see the contraction.  It’s a much larger contraction that you see in the volumes in the money markets.  The people who are getting hurt by that are the people who are trying to invest.  It’s not the dealers, which used to be the other ones who were doing the window-dressing, or the large European banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Potter about the impact of contractions in the volumes of money markets on investors.


Passage number 135.
 MR. LACKER.  You’re talking about the dollar volume of people who are affected by a lower rate on quarter-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a statement from Mr. Lacker regarding the dollar volume of people affected by a lower rate on quarter-end.


Passage number 136.
 MR. POTTER.  That’s one version of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only presents one perspective or version of something, it doesn't indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 137.
 MR. LACKER.  And it might be different for a different sort of scale as people invest a different amount.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining that people may invest different amounts depending on the scale.


Passage number 138.
 MR. EVANS.  So it’s the maturity of their borrowing that we’re talking about.  A couple of days, or are they going to lock in a one-year rate because they show up on the wrong date right before the end of the quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification on the maturity of the borrowing and asking if the rate will be locked in for a couple of days or for one year.


Passage number 139.
 MR. POTTER.  There’s about $700 billion to $800 billion, which is overnight, plus some other terms.  So it’s quite a lot of that.  Some of that has just been produced by the size of our balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not appear to contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the amount of money and how it was produced.


Passage number 140.
 MR. EVANS.  So if they’re going to get a bad trade near the end of the quarter and they understand that this is the environment they face, then they’re going to start moving their money around earlier.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Evans.


Passage number 141.
 MR. POTTER.  I’m not explaining myself.  The money has to end up with the Federal Reserve somehow, and there are easier ways for it to end up.  The overnight RRP or term RRPs are ways for it to directly go there rather than go through some complicated structure in the financial system.  So it’s more of a plumbing issue with that much money moving around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining a process and suggesting that there are easier ways for the money to reach the Federal Reserve.


Passage number 142.
 MR. EVANS.  I scribbled down some notes as I was listening to President Lacker.  I was sympathetic to what he was saying.  For the longest time, the FOMC and the conduct of monetary policy has been about the funds rate.  And the New York Desk does a great job of telling us about how hard it is to implement that when the funds rate trades soft over a long period of time, how other market rates are affected.  But at the end of the day, it’s really the funds rate.  As we move closer to an environment in which we’re away from the effective lower bound, I think that’s going to be the most important thing.  We’ve ended up, because of the lower bound and all of our programs, having to discuss things at this meeting that normally took place at the 9:20 calls and things like that.  If they’re really as important for the transmission mechanism as maybe Simon is suggesting, I guess we need more information, because I don’t see it that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with President Lacker's views on the conduct of monetary policy and the importance of the funds rate. The speaker also acknowledges the need for more information regarding the suggested importance of other factors for the transmission mechanism.


Passage number 143.
 MR. POTTER.  Sorry.  There’s a market-functioning issue and a rate issue, I think. CHAIR YELLEN.  Lorie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is expressing his thoughts on a market-functioning issue and a rate issue, but there is no indication of any disagreement or contention between Mr. Potter and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 144.
 MS. LOGAN.  I just wanted to mention that, in the old framework, we did take actions to try to alleviate the quarter-end effects.  We just couldn’t do it because we were on the maintenance period.  I wanted to make it clear that, in the old framework, we were making a lot of decisions to try to adjust the level of reserves to smooth through the quarter-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker states that they made efforts to alleviate quarter-end effects in the old framework but were unable to do so due to being on the maintenance period. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this statement.


Passage number 145.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  You did, but you often didn’t completely offset it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that sometimes the speaker did not fully offset something.


Passage number 146.
 MS. LOGAN.  We weren’t able to.  But it was always a goal of the implementation path to try to offset those effects.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any clear contention or disagreement. It indicates that the goal was to offset certain effects, but it does not mention any conflicting views or differing opinions.


Passage number 147.
 MR. EVANS.  Sure.  But Jim Hamilton had a paper in the Journal of Political Economy many years ago about the spectacular, spectacular spikes in the funds rate that occurred, and I don’t know of any evidence that those spikes made their way into macrodata or things like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of Mr. Evans referring to a paper by Jim Hamilton and expressing uncertainty about any evidence regarding the impact of spikes in the funds rate on macrodata.


Passage number 148.
 MR. POTTER.  That’s correct.  They certainly didn’t and might not now, but there  the size of our balance sheet has a market-functioning aspect that could affect quarter-end trend behavior.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact about the market-functioning aspect of the balance sheet.


Passage number 149.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Could I ask another question of Simon.  No one really knew what the end-of-the-year rate was going to be going in.  So many things were new this time.  But if we systematically saw the rates drop to, say, zero if we did nothing, it would start leeching into those other rates, predictably at the end of every quarter and every year.  So we’d start trading soft instead of trading in the middle; presumably the arbitrage would get us to start being much closer to the floor before the end of the quarter and end of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain a contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the potential impact of dropping rates and how it may affect trading.


Passage number 150.
 MR. POTTER.  That’s possible.  I think the issue for many people is:   They have a lot of cash to invest, and they have a relationship that is not as robust on the quarter-end.  Where are they going to put that cash.  They want to invest on the quarter-end.  They will take action to make sure they can invest on the quarter-end if they think there’s less of the Federal Reserve balance sheet available, and that would lead to softness in rates.  It also leads to inefficient behavior because a lot of the cash they have to invest is coming from the size of our balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their perspective on the issue of people having cash to invest and the potential impact on rates and behavior.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 151.
 MR. LACKER.  To go back to your question, Governor Tarullo, this isn’t about market functioning, it’s a distributional issue—it’s who pays for the privilege of investing cash at quarter-end.  You’ve got a lot of cash around.  You can make a lot every other day of the quarter, but at quarter-end, you don’t have relationships.  You’ve set up relationships with foreign banks that are doing the arbitrage to IOER.  Part of what you pay for doing that is that on quarter-end, you don’t have relationships elsewhere to invest the cash.  To some extent, for us to defray that cost, for us to reduce the cost of having nowhere to invest your cash on quarter-end, we’re just making it easier for the foreign banks to do this arbitrage.  We’re just shifting costs around these players.  It’s less market functioning than just a distributional question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, disagrees with Governor Tarullo's perspective on the issue. Mr. Lacker argues that the issue is not about market functioning but rather a distributional issue and the shifting of costs among players.


Passage number 152.
 MS. LOGAN.  One last note is, what we’re seeing in unsecured markets is that it’s a day at month-end and quarter-end.  But for repo markets, if you look at the data, it takes multiple days for the balance sheets of some of those dealers to come down and then multiple days to build back up.  What we saw in September when we did the test in which we put the cap in and didn’t have the term is that the softness was not just on one day, it was several days in advance.  I suspect that if we didn’t provide it, we’d be talking about more than one day per month—we’d be talking about a couple of days, both before and after.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing information and sharing her suspicion based on the test conducted in September.


Passage number 153.
 MR. POTTER.  But you would distribute the softness over time, so the financial system would find a way of dealing with all of those reserves.  If they thought that it was going to be harder to invest on the quarter-end using the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet in a direct way, they would find a way to distribute that over the quarter CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Potter and Chair Yellen seem to be in agreement about the concept of distributing softness over time and finding ways to deal with reserves in the financial system.


Passage number 154.
 MR. FISCHER.  Can you tell us, what is the cost to the Federal Reserve of supplying the Federal Reserve paper that they want.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not involve any disagreement or contention. MR. FISCHER is asking a factual question about the cost of supplying Federal Reserve paper.


Passage number 155.
 MR. POTTER.  The overnight RRP offer rate right now is 25 basis points below the interest rate on excess reserves.  When we issue term, it’s probably going to be 3 basis points above.  If you look at it the other way, if you want to save a little bit of money at quarter-end, which I don’t think is of interest here, using the overnight RRP is a little bit cheaper because you don’t get it as a reserve balance as it finds its way back into the banking system to be a reserve balance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreement.


Passage number 156.
 MR. FISCHER.  Sorry, who’s “you”.  Who saves the money. CHAIR YELLEN.  We do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer is seeking clarification by asking who the pronoun "you" refers to, and Chair Yellen simply responds by saying "We do," indicating that it is their responsibility to save the money.


Passage number 157.
 MR. POTTER.  The U.S. taxpayer would, because we’d remit more to the Treasury.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not showcase any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the U.S. taxpayer would remit more money to the Treasury.


Passage number 158.
 MR. LACKER.  But were you asking about the operational costs, like how many people they have doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It is a simple clarification question about operational costs.


Passage number 159.
 MR. FISCHER.  No, not at all.  I was asking about the interest costs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker clearly states that there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 160.
 MR. LACKER.  It saves us money, because it saves reserves—IOER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact that saving reserves through IOER saves money.


Passage number 161.
 MR. POTTER.  Because what will happen is, if we don’t offer another type of liability to the financial system, that money has to get back to our balance sheet, and it will find a way of getting there.  At that point, it receives interest on excess reserves. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Potter and Chair Yellen seem to be in agreement about the potential consequences if another type of liability is not offered to the financial system.


Passage number 162.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support option 1, which is the high-cap option, but I want to align myself with comments by President Harker and President Evans, who have similar themes.  My preference is actually to have no cap at this point and to watch and wait during the next six months or so.  I’d consider what President Harker suggested, that you should have some idea about where the funds rate is before you start putting a cap on this facility.  I think we want maximum emphasis on rate control during this phase that we’re in right now.  I’m also encouraged that actual take-up seems to be quite low at this time, and so for this reason I don’t think we really need a cap right now.  I think it’s a little premature to put that on. Now, I agree, if the program grows to a substantially larger size, the Committee could at that point review the reasons for the expansion of the program.  One way we could proceed—this is just something to consider here—is to simply agree to a size of the program that would trigger further review, and possibly you could announce to the public that the Committee would review it at some point if the program got larger, but that wouldn’t be an official cap.  You’d just say that the Committee is going to look at this again if this thing starts to grow, because one thing that seems like it might happen in the future is that you’d remain with relatively small take-up, and you wouldn’t need a cap, and you wouldn’t get much growth in the program.  Now, I understand it may not go that way, but then we’d have a way to review that possibility.  So I’d actually be willing to go with the possibility of no cap indefinitely, depending on how the demand develops as we go forward.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, states his support for option 1 and suggests the possibility of having no cap on the program for the next six months. He also suggests reviewing the program if it grows substantially in the future. This is more of a discussion on options and preferences rather than a contention or disagreement.


Passage number 163.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me say, I think it’s great to have this discussion now when there’s no near-term problem to solve and no really urgent need to act.  Broadly speaking, the RRP is doing its job well with IOER.  I would say that it’s clear that reserves are going to remain superabundant for a number of years now, and that’s probably going to mean that we’re going to need the RRP, and we’ll be facing these issues for a number of years.  The place to which I would like to see this go in the medium term, two to three years, is more at the level of option 2, which is $300 million to $500 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the current situation and suggests a future direction without opposing or disagreeing with any other viewpoint.


Passage number 164.
  I would be comfortable— MR. TARULLO.  Billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage provided does not contain enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. Additionally, the sentence seems to be cut off abruptly after the word "billion," making it difficult to make a judgment.


Passage number 165.
 MR. POWELL.  Billion—thank you.  I would be comfortable starting with option 1 and saying explicitly that we expect to reduce this over time, as appropriate.  The problem with option 1, just putting the number out there and not saying that you expect to reduce it over time, is that you send a signal that you welcome, and perhaps even encourage, more funds.  But that would be perfectly acceptable in my view. In terms of when to start, I think it is tied up with the path of policy.  If the Committee is going to be in tightening mode as the year goes on, then it seems to me it would be useful to have one or two more rate increases in place to see how the federal funds rate behaves in space as it moves away from the lower bound.  If that’s not going to be the case, then it might well be appropriate and a useful signal to send as soon as the March meeting that you’re reducing the cap from $2 billion–plus to effectively $1 billion.  That might be a useful place to go. CHAIR YELLEN.  Trillion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 166.
 MR. TARULLO.  You’ve got to get your orders of magnitude right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any elements of contention or disagreement. It only states a statement or advice without any opposing or contradictory information.


Passage number 167.
  [Laughter] MR. POWELL.  Sorry.  Missed some zeros.  The memo asks about quarter-ends.  As far as quarter-ends go, I like using term RRP at quarter-ends.  It seems to work.  I’d say, keep doing what works.  Those are my comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange where Mr. Powell acknowledges his mistake and offers his opinion on using the term RRP at quarter-ends. Chair Yellen then thanks him for his comments.


Passage number 168.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I also would wait.  Just in view of the tone of the memo and the presentation, the New York staff don’t appear to have conviction yet on judgments about these market effects.  So my advice to them would be, do what you need to do to get conviction on these judgments, and that implies that it would be helpful if we had one or two more tightenings.  We’ll see when and how that happens.  But on the idea of doing experiments and other activities so that you can have more conviction about how much headroom you might need, it’s clear to me that, in terms of priorities, maintaining confidence that we can control the rate is paramount.  I do think we need to make clear that we’re not going to accommodate all private-sector choices.  We’re not here to do that.  We’re here to control the rate, and accommodating all private-sector choices is not why we’re doing this.  If I had to pick a choice to gravitate to, it would probably be the high end of the staff’s low flexible cap—in the middle, $500 billion or more.  But I don’t think I know enough to know, and it sounds like the staff don’t yet know quite enough to know.  But as soon as you do have more conviction and at the point we make this decision, I’ll be asking the staff for their recommendation on all these questions, and I probably won’t give a judgment until I get their recommendation.  That will probably be the approach I’ll take.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Kaplan expressing his opinion and perspective on the matter at hand.


Passage number 169.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, appreciate the staff’s work to characterize the challenging and important tradeoffs we face with the ON RRP facility in the future.  Having viewed this facility as essential to controllability of interest rates, especially at liftoff, my preference among the options discussed at this point would be to reduce the capacity of the facility as described in option 2, the low flexible cap, and I would lean toward the higher end of that range.  This option would maintain adequate headroom for markets to have confidence about the availability of the facility while credibly communicating our original intention that the capacity be elevated only temporarily at liftoff to support policy implementation, and that it would be appropriate to reduce the capacity fairly soon after liftoff. Regarding quarter-end pressures, it is not clear to me that we should react with this facility.  Missing our target funds rate on one or two days because of these pressures would not seem to have material policy implications, notwithstanding the counsel that Simon provided during our previous discussion.  But to the degree that such pressures proved persistent, I would not object to a temporary increase in the cap as proposed under the low flexible cap option or offering term RRPs. For communication, I would explain the change in the capacity of the facility as the result of a successful liftoff of the target funds rate from its effective lower bound.  And in the future, the capacity should be no greater than what is required to achieve an effective floor under money market rates.  I see such an approach as consistent with our stated intention of, in the longer run, holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively. Given our experience with successful liftoff, I believe it would be appropriate to reduce the capacity of the facility as early as our March meeting.  I would signal that intention in the minutes of this meeting.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing her own preferences and opinions, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention with anyone else.


Passage number 170.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In answer to the question of how to approach reducing aggregate capacity of the overnight reverse repo facility, I prefer to think a little beyond a single choice from the menu proposed.  I have the working assumption that the goal is to largely phase out the facility over time, in keeping with our 2014 statement on normalization principles and plans. At liftoff, I was in favor of prioritizing monetary control and fully supported the lifting of the cap.  However, I do have some concern that a decision to continue running a very large facility for a prolonged period entails nontrivial financial stability risk.  In addition, such a policy might incent or enable changes in money markets that might make it much more difficult to reduce or phase out the facility in the future. With these thoughts in mind, I favor thinking in terms of a sequence of steps or a strategy, if you will, for gradually reducing the footprint of the facility in a manner that places strong emphasis on monetary control.  As an illustration and illustration only, I envision a process that could go something like this.  Begin by implementing a high cap accompanied by communications to establish the expectation of a ratcheting down to an ultimate phaseout.  I think it would make sense to maintain that cap through at least the next rate increase as a conservative approach to managing monetary control risk.  Assuming things go well and the funds rate trades in the desired range, at the subsequent meeting we can move to a lower flexible cap.  It makes some sense to me to test the headroom effects following a meeting that does not involve the confounding effects of a rate increase.  If monetary control seems well established with a lower flexible cap, I see making a subsequent further step that’s not offered as an option in the memo—specifically, at the next rate increase, I’d prefer to leave the overnight reverse repo rate unchanged, thereby widening the spread between the IOER and reverse repo rates.  I think this step will be necessary to truly test how necessary the overnight reverse repo facility is to maintaining control over the funds rate.  Once we’ve tested the waters with a wider spread, we can evaluate next steps in terms of fixing the cap or implementing further increases in the spread and whether to phase out the program entirely or retain some residual facility.  The latter—some small but continuing overnight reverse repo operations—might be desirable as we work through the long-run framework questions and consider some of the regulatory and market changes noted in the staff memo. I offer these specifics as an example of what a longer-view strategy might look like.  I would certainly be open to other paths and options.  The important point is that we not think of the next move with the facility as a one-off decision.  We should have in mind what we intend to do over several steps down the road and communicate our plans to the market.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage expresses the author's preference and concerns regarding the reduction of the overnight reverse repo facility, but there is no explicit contention or disagreement.


Passage number 171.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 172.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The normalization strategy and principles that we laid out some time ago have worked according to plan, and I don’t see any signs in recent market behavior that would suggest any change in our approach.  But I emphasize here that by “approach,” I’m referring to both our September 2014 and our March 2015 communications that the ON RRP facility will be temporarily elevated at liftoff, but that the capacity will be reduced fairly soon after policy firming and that it’s a temporary program. The success in maintaining monetary control is a testament to the thorough testing of our normalization tools—a good example of practice makes perfect.  In light of this success, I would continue along the path we’ve laid out.  Our next step should be to start lowering the cap on the ON RRP facility to reduce financial stability risks associated with possible surges in demand.  I think option 1 provides for a prudent reduction that still should provide ample headroom to maintain monetary control.  When the appropriate time comes, I would be comfortable with reducing the cap to $800 billion or $1 trillion.  I think we can take this step fairly soon—in the language of our earlier communications, in the next few meetings.  Obviously, waiting until March quarter-end might be useful.  I don’t think we should necessarily wait until the next rate increase. I agree completely with Governors Tarullo and Powell that in making that step, we want to communicate that this is only a first step and not the end of a process, and that further decreases in the cap will be forthcoming.  I think that’s an important part of the communication regarding option 1.  Over time, we can lower the cap for the ON RRP facility further.  However, there’s no rush to take that step.  We should collect more information along the way to make sure that we’re on the right track.  Assuming all goes well, additional reductions would be warranted after we’ve observed market behavior following further rate hikes. In addition, as we lower the cap further, term RRPs could or should provide a good supplementary tool to deal with quarter-end spikes in demand, if needed.  In this regard, we’ve had a good discussion about whether that’s necessary or really important.  I do think that the term RRP tool has shown to be a pretty elegant solution to this issue.  Once we get to the point at which the cap is much smaller, using the term RRP seems to be a useful way to deal with quarter-end issues and spikes in demand. When we decide to make these adjustments, communicating clearly with the public that these are natural steps in the normalization strategy that we’ve already explained is going to be very important.  We want to convey that our approach has been successful, and that’s why we’re continuing to follow that in a well-designed strategy.  Importantly, communication we give following these changes should, as always, stress their technical nature and emphasize that monetary policy is focused on the setting of the federal funds rate and that all of these other things that are happening in the background are being done in support of monetary control and our other objectives.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mostly a statement of opinion and recommendation from Williams.


Passage number 173.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think the memos and the staff briefing on this discussion show that we have a lot more to learn about this program, and so I’m in the camp of many of you that there’s no rush.  Let’s learn more.  Let’s get more experience before we make any changes.  To me, it’s fundamental that we have a better view of the long-run operating framework.  That’s a pretty fundamental decision for the Committee.  And, for me, having more information about how this tool works and having a better view of the long-run operating framework will be important in informing the ultimate judgment of what this tool looks like.  If pushed today, I’d say I’m in favor of option 1 or option 2.  But waiting is probably my stronger preference.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 174.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Again, I want to extend my compliments to the staff on their execution of liftoff, which was really outstanding.  The control over rates has been as strong as any of us could have wished.  The strength of the monetary control so far can be ascribed in no small part to the floor that’s been provided by the ample capacity of the ON RRP.  And for this reason, I think it’s still premature to implement changes to the cap. Although the activity of the ON RRP has been quite close to pre-liftoff norms so far, it’s only six weeks since liftoff, and there’s still substantial uncertainty about how our rate control might evolve as normalization proceeds.  I’m particularly attentive to how both the activity of the ON RRP and the support for the funds rate provided by the ON RRP facility change as we move farther away from the effective lower bound.  For that reason, I prefer deferring changes to the ON RRP cap until normalization is well under way.  Indeed, this would seem to be pretty consonant with market expectations. Of the three options presented in the staff memo, I prefer setting a high cap as a first step, as outlined in option 1.  At the stage of normalization at which we find ourselves, as you can probably infer, my highest priority remains monetary control.  For that reason, I think option 1 has the best monetary control properties—certainly better than option 3, which would sacrifice control for a smaller footprint.  Compared with option 2, option 1 is both easier to explain and easier to implement, which I view as strong virtues in policymaking.  It’s not obvious that the cap in option 2 could be adjusted in as timely and accurate a manner as would be necessary to maintain the level of monetary control that I think is important. Nonetheless, I do think it’s helpful to remind market participants that the heightened capacity of the ON RRP is temporary in order to guard against a permanent change in the structure of money markets, which I would view as very undesirable.  A reflection of this discussion in the minutes should accomplish this goal.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 175.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Like everyone else, I’d like to congratulate the staff, both the New York Federal Reserve staff and the Board staff, on the work done and the quality of the paper we received, which is both thorough and interesting.  And, of course, I’d also like to congratulate them on the success of the operation of our new method of monetary control, which was faced with a pretty strong stress test in the first six weeks of its operation—at least the past three weeks of its operation—as the market seemed to be less than stable, and it didn’t seem to spread over to the use of the RRP facility.  One of the benefits of going very near the end is that everything that should be said has been said.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing congratulations and positive remarks about the work and success of the staff.


Passage number 176.
 MR. TARULLO.  Not everyone has said it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It only states that not everyone has said something without mentioning what that something is.


Passage number 177.
  [Laughter] MR. FISCHER.  It just remains to decide which of the excellent interventions to reference, and I reference President Evans’s approach, which is similar to what a lot of other people suggested. I don’t think, as many have said, that after six weeks, it’s a good time to start changing things.  A lot can happen, and we want to make sure that this facility and the way we’re operating it is really capable of doing what it’s done so far, and it’s only further experience that will be able to tell us that. I also have some sympathy for the view that it could be useful to retain a small facility at the end, but that’s an issue that we can discuss nearer the time.  What I’d like to see is what I think President Evans said, which is a move—most people say in the second quarter, I think it could be the end of the second quarter, possibly the third quarter—to option 1.  Then, as time goes by, and as we get more and more confident in our use of it, begin reducing the cap in a fairly steady way over the course of time and then phase it out, with the question of whether there should be some capacity left to carry out these operations. As we move to the hard cap, I do think that we’ll have to either accept the use of term RRP or allow ourselves not to hit the target federal funds rate on a couple of days in each quarter and possibly more at the end of the year.  But this is clearly something that’s working, and it seems to me there’s probably an interesting question as to what comes next, adjusting the RRP or stopping repurchases of maturing assets in the portfolio.  We haven’t talked about those two things together, and each of them could be regarded as capable of creating some noise in the system that we ought to find a way of coordinating.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  And, finally, Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is referencing President Evans's approach and expressing agreement with it, as well as considering other suggestions. They also mention some potential issues to discuss, but there is no clear disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 178.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Thank you for responding, Vice Chairman Dudley.  I think we decided that we would phase it out if it’s no longer needed.  It strikes me as inconsistent with the spirit of that decision to not take any steps to find out if it’s needed.  And it strikes me that it wouldn’t be that hard to do.  If we raised rates, if we raised the IOER rate a quarter point, like Eric said, raised the ON RRP rate 20 basis points, a 5 basis point increase in the spread, and the RRP rates stayed where they are in relation to IOER, we’d be able to say, “Look, we’re done,” and volume went down—that could easily happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their view and suggesting a way to find out if the measures are needed or not.


Passage number 179.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I’m not arguing against running the experiment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker clearly states that they are not arguing against running the experiment.


Passage number 180.
 MR. LACKER.  I misunderstood you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that Mr. Lacker misunderstood something, suggesting a lack of agreement or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 181.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But we first have to answer the question, what is the experiment generating in terms of information.  And will that information change your behavior in terms of how you use it.  If you decide that the cost of the experiment is high and it’s unlikely to change how you run the facilities, then it’s probably not worth running the experiment.  It might be if you decide that the cost to run the experiment is pretty low—in other words, that the staff can come up with a way of doing the experiment that’s not really hard to communicate to markets, and we don’t confuse people about what our intentions are or about how we’re ranking monetary control versus footprint versus financial stability.  That’s all I’m saying.  I’m not arguing against running the experiment.  I think we also need to think about the question, what are you going to gain from running the experiment, and how is it going to affect your behavior.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The author presents two different perspectives on whether or not running the experiment is worth it. One perspective argues that if the cost of the experiment is high and it is unlikely to change how the facilities are run, then it is not worth running. The other perspective suggests that if the cost is low and the experiment can be easily communicated to markets without confusion, then it might be worth running. This creates a disagreement or contention regarding the value and potential impact of running the experiment.


Passage number 182.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair, those are perfectly sensible principles.  I totally agree.  What’s at stake here is whether we have a facility or not.  What’s at stake here is a couple hundred billion dollars of money market fund allocations and where they go—whether they go to us or somewhere else.  I think that suggests that the stakes are quite enough to motivate some experiments.  I join you in urging the staff to bring us some plans for experimentation. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I think we’ve had a very good round of comment and discussion.  Let me join others in thanking the staff, first, for flawless execution of liftoff and, second, for an excellent memo.  I think we’ve had a rich discussion.  As usual, we’ll go off and contemplate what the appropriate next steps or options might be.  I think there is some degree of agreement—obviously not complete—but, as in the past, my guess is, we’ll go back and try to narrow options and respond to what we’ve heard and try to work our way forward to a decision about how to proceed.  I suggest we take a break.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Both Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen express agreement with each other's points and express a desire to continue working together to find the best solution.


Passage number 183.
 MR. FISCHER.  Do we need to ratify the open market operations. CHAIR YELLEN.  Oh, I’m sorry.  We do.  Thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  Before we break, we need to ratify open market operations.  Can I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer asks if they need to ratify the open market operations, and Chair Yellen confirms that they do, thanking him for reminding her. There is no disagreement between them.


Passage number 184.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Okay.  Let’s take a 20-minute break.  [Coffee break] CHAIR YELLEN.  Let’s resume.  Brian has something for you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The conversation appears to be proceeding smoothly with everyone in agreement on taking a break and resuming afterwards.


Passage number 185.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I apologize, but I misstated the name of the person proposed as associate economist by Vice Chairman Dudley.  The individual that Vice Chairman Dudley proposes is Jonathan McCarthy rather than James McAndrews.  Again, I apologize for this error.  I think the Chair would like to call for a vote on this nomination. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply correcting a mistake and then asking for a vote.


Passage number 186.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  And I assume without objection.  Okay.  Now let’s move on to our briefings on the “Economic and Financial Situation,” and today we’re going to start with Steve Kamin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply consists of a series of statements and actions being carried out smoothly.


Passage number 187.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Two quick questions.  David, on your inflation revisions, forgive me, what’s the takeaway from panel 9.  How do we look at this, and how do we use it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The person asking the question is seeking clarification and understanding.


Passage number 188.
 MR. WILCOX.  8 and 9 are components of an inflation monitor that we intend to introduce in the March Tealbook.  The first page of those exhibits is just going to show the evolution of our inflation forecasts from one Tealbook to the next and will overlay each successive forecast on top, so that if our forecast begins to drift away from what we had envisioned at the time of the December 2015 Tealbook, that will be completely evident. And 8 and 9 will look at the cumulative revision in the inflation forecast, putting a stake in the ground at the December 2015 Tealbook.  What they’ll do is decompose in the left-hand panel the projection for top-line PCE inflation and in the right-hand panel the projection for core PCE inflation.  The decomposition in the left-hand panel is just arithmetic.  All it does is take the top-line PCE price index and decompose our forecast error into the main categories that are listed there:  food, energy, and core.  In some sense, there’s no analytical content there.  It’s just relative importance weights and an arithmetic exercise of how much each component departed from our forecast. There is some economic content in the panel on the right-hand side because that’s based on rules of thumb that our sector analysts use, which in turn themselves are informed by model-based estimates.  What we’re trying to do is trace through the importance of changes in each of these factors for the projected behavior of core inflation.  The idea there in the right-hand panel is that what we’ll do is attempt to trace back revisions in our core PCE inflation forecast to one-level-more fundamental sources.  I’m sure that interpretations around the table will differ, probably in 19 different ways at least.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the components and purpose of an inflation monitor that they plan to introduce in the March Tealbook. They mention that there might be different interpretations around the table, but this does not imply disagreement or contention within the passage itself.


Passage number 189.
  That will double-count—   MR. TARULLO.  But there are only 17 of us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 190.
 MR. WILCOX.  —two of you.  I was onto that.  At least two of you will have different views.  [Laughter] One possible interpretation of this decomposition might be that if we’re able to trace the cumulative revision in our inflation forecast back to easily identifiable, earlier sources, like energy prices, the dollar feeding through import prices, or the pressure on economic activity—that is, the Phillips curve at work—that might not reveal any extent to which we’ve lost our handle on how the inflation mechanism is working, because those would be identifiable factors that we would understand the economic mechanism that’s at work. Now, there’s an “other” category, because it’s not going to work out in so tidy a manner.  At the moment, this “other” category is barely discernible, as we’ve only had one reading on the PCE monthly price index and one reading on the CPI since last time, but over time the “other” category will emerge, either to the upside or the downside.  My hope is that it will provide an interesting vehicle for discussion and analysis as to what’s going on, what the underlying story might be.  That’s the goal of this. The last piece of this inflation monitor will just be a panel—currently page 27 in your data sheets—that provides a roundup of a whole bunch of different measures of longer-term inflation expectations, which play a pretty key role in our inflation analysis.  If those begin to drift one direction or the other, that’s something that would capture our attention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a description of different interpretations and categories related to inflation forecasting.


Passage number 191.
 MR. KASHKARI.  The second quick question I had—maybe for David or Nellie, I’m not sure—is that in the risk scenarios I found it hard to reconcile that the China hard-landing scenario did not yield a recession, but the financial market turbulence did yield a recession.  It struck me that a China hard landing would trigger financial market instability, and if that’s really what’s going to trigger a recession, China could well be it.  I’m just curious if I’m off in how I’m thinking about it, or if the staff would think differently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kashkari is simply seeking clarification or confirmation on his understanding of the scenario.


Passage number 192.
 MR. KAMIN.  Let me start, because the international side was responsible for that part of the scenarios.  If you look at exhibit 2 of your international outlook materials, the red line in panel 5, which is U.S. GDP, falls on a four-quarter change basis to ½ percent.  I don’t have the actual quarterly numbers on me, but I’m pretty darn sure that that means a quarter or two of negative changes in real GDP.  In that sense, it probably is associated with at least a mild recession.  Just to compare that scenario with the financial turbulence scenario, in the China hard-landing scenario, the negative effects on the U.S. economy come mainly through trade channels—the rise in the dollar and the decline in foreign GDP.  Those have a very important and material effect on the U.S. economy, but all that being said, because the U.S. economy is not as open to international trade as other economies, the effect is not so great.  The China hard-landing scenario does also incorporate the disruptions to U.S. markets that do depress GDP, but obviously not as much as the financial turbulence scenario.  I’ll now pass the baton to my colleagues here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of different scenarios and their respective effects on the U.S. economy, there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 193.
 MR. WILCOX.  I would only add, I think we could probably easily, in some sense, concatenate the two scenarios and get something that’s more severe to the downside from the combination of both of the factors.  And I think it’s realistic to envision that the kind of financial turbulence that we have in that scenario would result from the China scenario.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement as none of the speakers are presenting opposing views or arguments. They are discussing the possibility of combining two scenarios and the potential consequences without expressing disagreement.


Passage number 194.
 MR. EVANS.  And that’s a pretty common type of additional exercise that you do with these, right, when you’re looking for an extra kick from spillovers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement asking for confirmation that additional exercise is commonly done to enhance the effects of spillovers.


Passage number 195.
 MS. LIANG.  I’ll add one more point.  When we were looking at the financial linkages between the United States and China, and the EMEs, most of the linkages are economic—trade and the dollar—so that’s where the biggest linkages in the scenario are, as you would expect.  The linkages between the financial institutions in the United States and China and the EMEs are pretty limited.  Your first scenario would not entail a lot of distress in the U.S. financial markets from this, but, clearly, that could be added. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker, did you have a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Liang is simply adding a point to the discussion, and Chair Yellen is asking President Lacker for his input.


Passage number 196.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, it was a two-hander.  Because it appears as if charts like number 9 might make more visits to the Committee, I wanted to follow up on President Kashkari’s question and ask something that I’ve wanted to ask you for a while.  You have apportioned this:  resource utilization, energy prices, and import prices.  In our standard models, we often think of monetary policy as related to inflation.  In fact, in the standard textbook models, an impulse from monetary policy affects both prices and, to the extent that there are monetary nonneutralities or something that gives rise to the Phillips curve, simultaneously real activity and real resource utilization.  I’m wondering how you want us to think about attributing inflation to resource utilization, when in the standard models it’s just a correlate of inflation.  We usually think about it in terms of monetary impulses affecting both—sometimes not real things, sometimes real things.  Is that clear.  Do you understand the question.  It’s a puzzle, more or less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking a question and seeking clarification on a concept.


Passage number 197.
 MR. WILCOX.  Well, this is quite a standard New Keynesian Phillips curve kind of framework.  Monetary policy is relevant because it influences the thrust of aggregate demand, and that influences, in turn, the level of resource utilization.  As well, monetary policy operates very importantly on inflation through the exchange rate and setting the terms of trade.  So monetary policy is very much present here through two different channels:  One is the thrust of economic activity, and the other is the import price channel.  Now, I don’t know what else I can say.  I’m looking back to Dave Reifschneider.  What would you add to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker presents their understanding of the standard New Keynesian Phillips curve framework and acknowledges the relevance of monetary policy in influencing aggregate demand, resource utilization, and inflation. They express uncertainty about what else they can say and defer to Dave Reifschneider for additional information.


Passage number 198.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I’d add two things.  One, there’s a third channel—expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply adding two additional points to the discussion.


Passage number 199.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only states that Mr. Wilcox agrees with something or affirms a statement, without any mention of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 200.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I would say your point is correct, in that some of the explanatory variables for inflation—say, resource utilization or marginal costs or something like that—are determined by monetary policy, but they’re determined by many other things as well.  And the accounting exercise that David was talking about isn’t trying to take everything back to every single ultimate cause, which would include what’s up with Chinese economic growth, what the European Central Bank’s monetary policy is, and yada, yada, yada.  It’s stopping at an earlier point than that.  Yes, it’s stopping at an earlier point, and it’s using some things that are clearly endogenous, like slack.  But in the accounting mechanisms, in the New Keynesian Phillips curve, they are direct drivers of inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the point made and further explains it by providing additional information and clarification.


Passage number 201.
 MR. LACKER.  So the puzzle is that this makes it seem as if it’s the case that if monetary policy did not affect real activity, it wouldn’t affect inflation, whereas in our models, that’s a case in which it does affect inflation.  That’s the puzzle for me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply stating that there is a puzzle or contradiction in the fact that in their models, monetary policy affects inflation even though it shouldn't theoretically affect real activity.


Passage number 202.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  There’s still the inflation expectations channel, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not presenting any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking if the "inflation expectations channel" still exists.


Passage number 203.
 MR. LACKER.  Forget expectations.  In the standard model, if the Phillips curve is vertical, it affects inflation, even though it doesn’t affect real activity. CHAIR YELLEN.  There’s an aggregate supply relationship in there, which is this Phillips curve mechanism between the level of utilization and inflation.  And according to their estimates, that relationship, at least at the moment, is, and has been, quite flat.  But in the world you’re talking about, the relationship could be quite steep.  The influence of utilization on inflation could be, in some world, very large, in which case monetary policy, when you incorporate that into a model, would mainly raise inflation and have very little effect on utilization.  That would be a vertical Phillips curve.  That’s not in any way the estimates that you are basing this on, but it could be, so I don’t think there’s any conceptual puzzle here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen are discussing the Phillips curve relationship between utilization and inflation, but Chair Yellen is acknowledging that the estimates for this relationship in the real world are quite flat, while Mr. Lacker is suggesting that in a different world the relationship could be quite steep. They are simply exploring different possibilities and scenarios, rather than disagreeing with each other.


Passage number 204.
 MR. WILCOX.  I don’t think so. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 205.
 MR. EVANS.  I think it’s a two-hander, because at least it’s on the same dashboard topic.  But another factor that could show up here—you mentioned the inflation expectations table, but, presumably, one thing that’s underlying this is, you’ve got your price-inflation Phillips curve with the additional transitory variables that show up here and other things.  But you’ve also got the inflation attractor, if I understand that right.  So part of the forecast, the last time I remember looking at it, was, you’ve got that at something like 1.8 percent, and it’s expected to go up at some point, possibly within the forecast horizon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about different factors and variables related to inflation expectations and forecasting.


Passage number 206.
 MR. WILCOX.  Beginning of 2018.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a time frame at the beginning of 2018.


Passage number 207.
 MR. EVANS.  So if that doesn’t happen, that would show up as one of these yellow factors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a hypothetical scenario.


Passage number 208.
 MR. WILCOX.  That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "That's right." It is a simple agreement or confirmation of a previous statement or fact.


Passage number 209.
 MR. EVANS.  Okay.  So to the extent that the yellow all of a sudden gets big, it is like other things are at work, and we might be behind.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing a possibility or speculation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 210.
 MR. WILCOX.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The word "Right" signifies that Mr. Wilcox disagrees with the previous statement. However, without further context, it is unclear what the disagreement is about.


Passage number 211.
  So if the yellow region begins to emerge, what we would do at that point is caucus among ourselves— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Break out the yellow region.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply describes a process of caucusing among a group of people if a certain condition is met.


Passage number 212.
 MR. WILCOX.  —engage in some analysis of the yellow region and see whether we had some readily attributable underlying factors there, or come back to the Committee and say, “Gee, we don’t know.  There is something at work in the inflation mechanism that we can’t square with our analytical framework.”  Now, there will be a lot of different analytical frameworks brought to the table.  And so what might be of concern in our framework might be understandable in others, but the goal here is to try to provide one metric where, applying our pretty mechanical rules of thumb, you’ll be able to keep score at home and see whether things are drifting away from the narrative that we had in place as of the time of the December 2015 projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the need for analysis and the possibility of different analytical frameworks being brought to the table, but there is no indication of disagreement.


Passage number 213.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit information or examples of contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen, followed by Chair Yellen asking for further questions.


Passage number 214.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just had a question about the jobs numbers on the Key Economic Indicators exhibit.  I guess you penciled in 238,000 for the three months in the first quarter of 2016 for nonfarm payrolls, and I notice the Tealbook had the year averaging more than 200,000.  I just wonder if I could get you to talk a little bit about where the risks on that part of the forecast are.  It seems high to me, but I’m willing to listen to explanations.  I think we’ve been telling a story that we expect job growth to slow down, but this really sounds like it’s still going to be a banner year in 2016.  I guess that’s my general feeling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing curiosity and seeking clarification, but he does not express disagreement or contradict any statements.


Passage number 215.
 MR. WASCHER.  We’re basically taking some signal from 2015.  The strong job growth and the modest pace of GDP growth has been a feature of the economy for a while, and we have those trends extending into 2016, particularly in the first half of the year.  And then over the second half, we have monthly employment increases slowing down to about 160,000 or so.  So, yes, it’s still good job growth with moderate GDP growth.  Again, that’s what we’ve been seeing. Now, I suppose I can see risks on both sides.  We’ve underpredicted job growth in the past, and so that might argue for a higher number, not a slowdown.  On the other hand, with the modest pace of GDP growth, and if you felt productivity was going to pick up toward a faster trend, you might expect a sharper slowing in job growth.  So I guess we view this as relatively balanced, a view reflected in our forecast of GDP growth.  The other risk I would note is that we see the balance of risks for real activity as weighted to the downside, and that might argue for thinking about the risk to employment growth as weighted to the downside.  But in view of our path for GDP growth, I think the risks of our employment forecasts seem reasonably balanced to me. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different perspectives and weighing the risks on both sides, but there is no explicit disagreement with any other party.


Passage number 216.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This is a financial stability question for Nellie.  One thing that has gotten my attention recently are media reports and commentary linking global equity market declines to the selling activity of sovereign wealth funds, particularly the sovereign wealth funds of oil- and gas-producing countries.  After looking into the issue, there seems to be some evidence for a reduction in holdings in foreign assets, but it seems much more difficult to determine if these reductions could be directly contributing to the declines in equity markets or indirectly influencing a risk-off environment by large investors more broadly.  So my question is, has the staff done any work on, or given any thought to, the potential role of sovereign wealth funds in the recent equity market declines and, maybe more broadly, the increasing correlation of oil and risk-asset markets—which seems to be a new development.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement and a question about whether the staff has done any work on the potential role of sovereign wealth funds in recent equity market declines and the correlation of oil and risk-asset markets.


Passage number 217.
 MS. LIANG.  Let me just say a couple things about sovereign wealth funds.  It is something we’re currently learning more about.  I would say that, six months ago, we thought of sovereign wealth funds like endowments:  They are private pools of capital.  They make investment decisions.  They might be big, and so they might affect asset prices, but they’re private pools of capital, generally not viewed as leveraged.  Market regulators would not be concerned about sovereign wealth funds.  It’s not pooled investment funds or investment for others.  I think what we’re seeing over the past six months to a year is that they aren’t really endowments, to the extent that they are parts of oil-producing countries, and the countries are using them to finance their deficits.  So, in some sense, they’re just a leveraged fund for a country, and to that extent they are of more interest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their changing understanding of sovereign wealth funds and how they are different from endowments.


Passage number 218.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Could make a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the passage. It seems that Mr. Lockhart is simply expressing his opinion or statement without any conflicting views.


Passage number 219.
 MS. LIANG.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: In this case, there isn't enough context given to determine if there is contention or disagreement. The passage only includes a name and a single-word response, so it is impossible to determine if there is any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 220.
 MR. LOCKHART.  One commentator, I thought, had a very interesting analysis.  He said that we’re experiencing an enormous margin call.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a statement from Mr. Lockhart, followed by him mentioning a commentator with an interesting analysis. This suggests the presence of different viewpoints or perspectives on the topic being discussed.


Passage number 221.
 MS. LIANG.  Yes.  That is the exact sentiment I was trying to express.  I think the main questions for financial stability are:  What kind of liabilities do they have.  How short are they.  How quickly do they need to meet these obligations.  And then the other piece would be, who are the other investors.  Are their sales offset by purchases by other investors.  So I’m giving you a sense of how we’re thinking about it.  We don’t have any answers to these questions.  The international community is very interested in learning more about sovereign wealth funds, but they are a very different kind of “private” financial institution, so the kind of proposals for regulations would be very different.  This would be a country. Globally, they’re about $7 trillion.  And just to put that into context, U.S. mutual funds have about $15 trillion.  And I think separately managed accounts—which is the way we’ve been thinking about them, like pension funds or insurers or endowments—are probably $9 trillion.  So they’re a big piece, but they’re not the whole piece.  We’ll probably be giving them a little bit more thought.  But that’s the state of play right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the main questions and considerations surrounding financial stability and sovereign wealth funds. There are no opposing viewpoints or arguments presented.


Passage number 222.
 MR. POTTER.  They mainly hold U.S. assets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "They mainly hold U.S. assets."


Passage number 223.
 MS. LIANG.  Yes, they like U.S. assets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Liang states that "Yes, they like U. S. assets," indicating agreement with the previous statement or question.


Passage number 224.
 MR. KAMIN.  If I could just add a couple of points.  As Nellie said, it is almost certainly the case that a lot of sovereign wealth funds are very intimately connected with their governments.  And so it’s quite plausible that over the past year or so, you’ve seen sales of sovereign wealth funds both to help finance governments that had been reliant on oil revenues and now need more cash and, secondly, perhaps even to basically finance reserve intervention.  A lot of times, the line between foreign exchange holdings and sovereign holdings is not very clear cut.  So probably both of those factors are at play, although to what extent is a little bit murky.  But I would view those as important background factors.  And then if you think about what’s happened with the plunge in equity prices more recently in the last couple of weeks, that seems to be triggered more by high-profile macroeconomic elements, such as in China.  You probably wouldn’t want to attribute that to any particular sea change in the portfolio behavior of the sovereign wealth funds themselves. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any further questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Then we have an opportunity for comments on financial stability, and let me start with Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about sovereign wealth funds and their potential role in financing governments and reserve intervention.


Passage number 225.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will be brief, in view of the number of topics we are discussing at this meeting.  The QS report notes that commercial real estate prices continued to rise through Q3, as shown in chart 1-10.  This continued upward trend in commercial real estate prices, driven by low interest rates and declining vacancy rates, is a scenario we ran in the tabletop exercise.  If this trend continues through year-end, rather than simply being a tabletop scenario, we will be looking at a possible commercial real estate bubble in real time.  This would seem to be the appropriate time to signal even more forcefully our concerns, through guidance, stress tests, and speeches, that supervisory tools are not sufficient.  I may be inclined to use monetary policy tools, perhaps raising the funds rate more rapidly than otherwise would be the case, even though I view that as a second-best solution.   Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 226.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just have two comments, briefly.  First of all, I just want to emphasize—and we’ve been talking about this—that the composition of the S&P 500 is today very different than that of the underlying U.S. economy.  Approximately 50 percent–plus of the S&P 500 are goods-producing companies, in terms of their profitability, and 40 percent–plus of S&P 500 earnings originate outside the United States.  This goods-producing exposure explains why the oil decline last year was enough to cause a decline in S&P earnings last year.  And S&P earnings this year, despite this oil wane, are expected to be $115 to $120.  If you take a 16-times multiple of that, you would get to $1,840 to $1,920 on the S&P.  And 16, in my career, and if you go through history, is a relatively full multiple.  It’s sort of in the range.  And so, right now, we are at 1,870, which is right in the middle of 1,840 to 1,920.  I think one of the parts of normalization is that the market is likely to find reasons to get to a more normal level of P/E.  I don’t think that is a bad thing, and I think that is part of this process.  It does not necessarily mean that the underlying U.S. economy is slowing.  It may turn out to mean that, but it says a lot more about the non–U.S. economy than it does about the U.S. economy, as the composition of the S&P is so dramatically different.  That has been increasing during our lifetimes, and people are used to thinking about it in the old way. The only other comment I’d make, and I have talked to Nellie about this, is on this issue of high-yield ownership in mutual fund form.  I know Nellie is working on this.  I think there is a natural mismatch between high-yield bonds, which by their nature trade these days very infrequently but are held in mutual fund form at a size that offer daily redemptions.  Third Avenue was indicative of it.  My fear would be, and we will talk about this later, that if oil did get down to $15 per barrel—which I think is not unreasonable—and high-yield spreads widen more, some of these reforms, such as swing pricing, may not really be sufficient to deal with the run that could occur.  I know this would require a change in law, but I hope we keep talking about the idea. If mutual funds are going to hold, in size, relatively illiquid assets—that is, if these assetscannot trade in size—I would love to see us revisit whether they should go to quarterly liquidity or longer or have the ability to gate put into their provisions.  And I do believe someday we’re going to make these changes.  I would prefer that a blowup did not cause us to make these reforms.  I know we have limited, not complete power in this, but I would hope we keep raising it. CHAIR YELLEN.  President George.

Passage number 227.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just wanted to make a brief comment about the low-for-long paper, which I found helpful.  I take the conclusions that there are no immediate or near-term problems regarding financial stability as some comfort.  But also, in connection with President Rosengren’s point:  When I look at things like CRE, I think that we’ll have to continue to watch the implications of our policy for various asset classes for fiscal policy effects and other macroeconomic effects over the long term to see how those are being affected. I wanted to make one specific point, as it relates to the effect of low rates on bank net interest margins.  I would add to that that the flattening of the yield curve—which has come from our policies, in conjunction with forward guidance that kept expectations of policy rates low—has played a role in compressing those margins for banks.  And I would point to some research by my staff that suggests that the flatter yield curve is actually more consequential than the level of short-term rates in affecting, particularly, community banks, and that, as we begin to normalize short-term rates, unless the yield curve moves, that could actually worsen their net interest margin position. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Brainard, did you want to comment.  [No comment indicated]  Okay.  If there are no further comments on financial stability, I think we’re ready to begin our economic go-round.  I hope we will be able to finish this before we break for the day, but we’ll see.

Passage number 246.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Since the December FOMC meeting, incoming data have significantly reduced our estimate of Q4 real GDP.  Sizable declines in stock and commodity prices have also raised the possibility of slower global growth.  Yet in light of these data, we saw surprising strength in payroll employment in December.  Which of these data portend the true underlying strength or weakness of the economy. Although incoming real data have been, on balance, weaker than expected, they are not of a magnitude that one would normally expect to cause such significant asset price movements, and much of the real data reflect what are likely to be temporary phenomena:  mild weather effects on service spending and a two-quarter inventory adjustment.  While official data reports from China may overstate actual economic activity, other independent evidence indicates limited direct trade effects, which are hard to reconcile with the observed large declines in stock indexes around the globe.  Similarly, the positive correlation between oil prices and stock indexes in countries that are large importers of oil and thus should benefit from lower oil prices is somewhat puzzling. Furthermore, while there have been some reductions in estimates of foreign growth by many forecasters, they are relatively modest compared with asset price movements.   With little fundamental economic data to explain such large asset price movements, a reasonable interpretation is to view asset price movements as a temporary exogenous net worth shock that is unlikely to have much of a permanent effect on the economy.  As a result, other than weaker near-term forecasts of data that reflect wealth effects, the Boston staff forecast has not changed materially.  As I do not have a good explanation for recent asset price movements, I must admit to some unease about my forecast, and, like the Tealbook, I view the downside risks to my forecast as being elevated relative to December. One source of my anxiety is whether the consumption-led economic growth over the next year will be as strong as forecast in the Tealbook or in my own forecast.  Current estimates regarding consumption in the fourth quarter were weaker than many earlier forecasts.  And over most of the recovery to date, actual consumption has tended to come in lower than expected, particularly when considering the gains that have been experienced in both disposable income and household net worth.  One possible explanation for this lower-than-expected growth in consumption is that consumers are not consuming as much of the disposable income freed up by recent declines in oil prices.  However, work done by the Boston staff that utilizes account-level transaction data that include every transaction from checking accounts, savings accounts, and linked credit cards for more than a half-million accounts finds that the marginal propensity to consume from the newly available real income that is generated by a gas price decline is 80 percent.  Similar results were found in a recent JPMorgan Chase Institute study based on data on Chase customer debit and credit cards.  Because the Boston model expects individuals to spend roughly 80 percent of savings from lower gas prices, this does not seem to account for the lower consumption. An alternative explanation for the consumption shortfall is that the income gains in this recovery have disproportionately accrued to high-income individuals with a lower marginal propensity to consume.  Work by the Boston Federal Reserve staff has found that a large fraction of households in middle- to lower-income deciles have current resources below recession levels, and that much of the income and wealth gains that we see in aggregate data have accrued to affluent households who tend to have a lower marginal propensity to consume.  This would imply less pent-up demand for consumption and may suggest that misses in consumption forecasts reflect compositional shifts in income and wealth that may be more persistent.  Thus, saving may remain high relative to aggregate disposable income and wealth. A third explanation is that consumers are still scarred by the experience of the Great Recession and thus will maintain higher precautionary savings.  This scarring may be exacerbated by recent, highly publicized declines in U.S. and global stock prices.  Anecdotally, I must say that the number of people commenting on their 401(k) plans, from the Federal Reserve lunchroom to audiences at my speeches around New England, has certainly gone up.  This scarring might indicate a greater reluctance to spend than is reflected in my current consumption forecast.  One piece of evidence that runs contrary to this, however, is that the most recent responses to the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers suggest little, if any, response to recent financial market developments. In summary, the downside risks to the economic outlook in my view are higher than in December.  I will be highly attentive to evidence that consumption growth may be slower than forecast.  In some sense, the canary in the consumer coal mine may be whether large purchases, such as car purchases, are postponed because of the recent financial turbulence.  Were the economy not to grow at potential, this would have implications for my desired path of interest rates, which I will discuss tomorrow.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing explanations for why consumption growth may be slower than forecasted, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 247.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Since our decision to begin normalizing interest rates in December, the news from the labor and output markets has continued to arrive in a familiar pattern:  a very strong labor market with disappointing real spending.  That pattern, which remains difficult to explain, has been complicated by the volatility in financial markets and by the continuing decline in the price of oil.  Thus, I am somewhat more uncertain about the trajectory of real economic activity and the inflation rate than I would be if all of the data were aligned.  This meeting is a time for watchful waiting to see how the uncertainties of the current situation resolve themselves over the coming months.  Although we should recognize that they may neither resolve themselves nor resolve themselves in a manner that reduces uncertainty about future inflation and growth. The news from the financial markets, both domestic and international, has been unsettling.  My sense is that this bout of volatility will subside as the volatility in August did and allow us to proceed more or less—probably a bit less—on the path I had predicted when filling in the December SEP, which was three increases in the federal funds rate in 2016.  However, there is more uncertainty and downside risk associated with that prediction than there was only six weeks ago.  That uncertainty arises from the possibility that the current asset market instability presages deeper weakness to come.  The inability so far of the Chinese authorities to clarify and communicate their exchange rate policies is one source of uncertainty—uncertainty that, in the case of China, is strengthened by concerns that economic growth may slow more sharply than the anticipated gradual decline from the vicinity of 7 percent to a somewhat lower rate over the next five years or so.  And there are some foreign economies whose growth performance has been better than expected.  That includes India and, to a lesser extent, some countries in the euro zone. There is another factor that has begun to receive attention, and we started talking about it in connection with the work on financial stability an hour or so ago:  the expected effect on asset prices of the beginning of the unwinding of the extremely accommodative monetary policies that central banks have put in place during the last seven to eight years.  Those policies were put in place in the expectation that doing so would lower interest rates and increase asset values, Tobin’s q in particular.  The lower interest rates and the increase in wealth would increase both investment and consumption through intertemporal substitution and wealth effects, and thereby increase aggregate demand. Well, the effect of the low interest rates on asset prices, especially equity prices, happened, but there was less effect on investment, in part because the housing market did not recover as rapidly as expected.  Markets have reason to believe that the period of extraordinary accommodation is now beginning to end, even though we have indicated that we will raise rates at a pace that is likely to be gradual.  The beginning of the slow process of normalization has increased the probability that equity prices, too, will begin to normalize, which means that the very high q will likely decline.  That is a reasonable expectation, especially because the economy has not grown as fast as markets must have expected when the Great Recession began. The outlook for inflation remains a concern.  I retain my belief that the basic logic of the Phillips curve will, in the medium term, assert itself.  And, indeed, the rate of compensation increase has moved up somewhat.  But we have continued to see further decreases in inflation, resulting from the continuing fall in oil prices and the ongoing effects of the appreciation of the dollar.  I continue to believe that the ongoing declines in oil prices and in the appreciation of the dollar are temporary, and that when they stop, we will, after a while, see actual inflation rising to our target rate of 2 percent.  But the recent behavior of the price of oil and the weaknesses in many foreign economies have further delayed the beginnings of that return.  This further delay in the increase in inflation, in conjunction with the increase in downside risks to both output and inflation, have increased my uncertainty about the outlook and led me to the view that the trajectory of rate increases may be flatter than I had expected in December. But there appear to be elements of herd behavior in the financial markets.  Steve Kamin referred to that in his presentation.  And we could see a stabilization or change in direction of those markets before the March meeting.  Of course, our views will also be informed by the rate at which employment increases.  Thus, the signal we will send by and following our decision tomorrow will be extremely important.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: There is contention or disagreement in this passage because Mr. Fischer expresses uncertainty and downside risk associated with his prediction of three increases in the federal funds rate in 2016. He also mentions that the current asset market instability may presage deeper weakness to come, which indicates a lack of agreement or consensus on the future direction of the economy.


Passage number 248.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My only two points on the economy are, I think, in agreement with what many of you have already said.  First, I agree that the baseline economic outlook hasn’t really changed much since December, though I was and remain somewhat less optimistic than the median participant on GDP growth and the degree to which inflation will turn toward the 2 percent target.  Second—and here I thought I was not going to be as much in agreement, but I think the first half-dozen of you roughly agree with what I am about to say—I think that the risks are now weighted to the downside, as compared with December.  At that time, I thought they were only modestly so, but I find them now decidedly weighted to the downside.  David, Dennis, Eric, Stan, and probably a few others of you have already mentioned some of them, so I won’t rehearse them in turn.  I did, though, want to emphasize one in particular.  I think the upside risks for the dollar and the associated downside risks facing the economy are rather greater than the Tealbook suggested and than I have heard to this point.  Some of that is because of my view on developments in China, and some of it is because of where I think the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank may go and the Bank of England may not go over the course of the next several meetings. On China, I think anybody who thinks they know what is going on there is fooling themselves right now.  I was struck, when Governor Fischer and I were in Basel two weeks ago, by the divergence between those who are mostly talking to the professionals and those who would actually talk to senior political leadership, obviously not in Basel but elsewhere.  There was a pretty big divergence in the perceptions that those two groups had, which suggested that there is still an effort within China to figure out where they want to go, and that there are political impetuses or constraints overlaid on the judgments that the professionals in the People’s Bank are making on a regular basis. I want to turn away from the economy as such for a second, to talk a bit about the monitoring mechanism for the components of inflation that David Wilcox introduced.  And I first want to thank the staff for taking the time and effort to try to develop such a mechanism.  In December, when the Committee concluded that it had reasonable confidence that inflation would return to the 2 percent target, the SEP medians for both core and headline inflation for 2016 were 1.6 percent.  Behind those projections was a narrative—to some degree explicit, to some degree implicit—about how those outcomes would be realized, such as through fading effects from energy prices, increasing effects from further reductions in the output gap, and—for some, perhaps—other factors such as the reemergence of significant increases in health-care costs. Some of us who have rather more hope than confidence that this is the path inflation will follow were particularly focused on the inclusion of language in the December statement indicating that “in light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.”  And I think that this is obviously what the staff is trying to help us do.  I would welcome efforts by Reserve Bank staff or others to create complementary mechanisms that will, in effect, impose some discipline on the statement of reasonable confidence that was made in December—reasonable confidence, with a trajectory and a narrative behind it.  And I think it’s important that we be testing that in real time, not necessarily because actual inflation may go up during that period.  I think there is every reason to believe that with the change in energy prices, even since December, that won’t happen.  But as the decomposition of the core inflation rate in David’s exhibit 9 shows, there is a way in which we can question ourselves on an ongoing basis as to whether what was expected to happen is in fact in the process of happening, or whether it isn’t happening, or something else has intervened in the interim.  And I think by doing that, some, like me, who were a little bit less than reasonably confident, might be made more so.  Or, contrariwise, those who were reasonably confident might have some grounds for questioning those assumptions.  I think it is important to have this discipline.  And, actually, Jim, it’s one of the reasons why I do think it’s important to look at the actual inflation numbers as well as expectations.  It’s in order to discipline the expectations, because the actuals help us test the basis on which prior expectations were formed to see if those have to be modified in the future.  The staff, too, I think, can help us isolate what’s going on underneath, particularly, the core numbers, and if not provide definitive answers, at least provoke a discussion among us that will enhance that self-discipline as we try to see whether the expected path of inflation will in fact track, fall short of, or even exceed what we put forth in the December SEP.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Tarullo is expressing his agreement with the statements made by other participants in the meeting. He also shares his own views on the risks to the economy and the monitoring mechanism for inflation, but there is no clear disagreement or contention present.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 249.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think I’m number 10, and I’m beginning to feel the pain that some of the Governors have talked about before, listening to so many people.  [Laughter]  Much has been said already, but still, I’ll try to spice it up and be nimble. In spite of the strong labor market data that we received, I continued to hear mostly downbeat assessments from my business contacts.  Also, the incoming data on spending have been disappointing.  My view is that GDP growth for the fourth quarter will come in close to the Tealbook’s meager projection of ½ percent, and financial market developments will add some further restraint to the economy.  These crosscurrents increase uncertainty over the outlooks for economic growth and inflation, and they make me nervous.  Nevertheless, I think it would be a mistake to overreact today to the softer spending data and financial volatility.  After all, last August and September, we found ourselves facing volatile financial markets and a disappointing slowing in job growth.  We responded with a well-timed pause in our policy plans and monitored how the uncertainty would play out.  Financial markets soon settled down, and the labor market improved markedly, giving the Committee the confidence necessary to take our first move toward normalization.  I see us in a similar situation today.  While uncertainty and the downside risks have risen in recent weeks, in my opinion, there’s not enough evidence yet to adjust the basic contours of the outlook, although I admit that December’s forecast does now seem a bit optimistic in light of intermeeting developments. With this as background, it’s not surprising that I heard a mixture of views from my business contacts and directors.  Along the same lines as President Lockhart’s comments, manufacturers with significant international exposures continue to face a very tough business environment.  Some are talking about a recession in manufacturing, notably those in steel and heavy machinery, and they see little relief in sight.  In contrast, the attendees at our December 30 manufacturing roundtable were somewhat more optimistic.  While they acknowledged that late 2015 was dismal, most were hopeful and expecting growth to pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.  They and other contacts pointed to domestic strength in autos, aerospace, consumer-facing product markets, and labor markets in general.  In light of these mixed views, I think we will just have to wait and see how it all plays out.  But the international headwinds are strong.  Even if the dollar stabilizes, as Governor Brainard was touching on, the trade-weighted dollar has risen 25 percent since the summer of 2014, and that’s a heavy lift for tradable goods sectors. One thing that seems clear is that financial conditions have tightened.  Both Discover Financial and Ford said it has become more difficult to sell asset-backed securities.  Financing is still available, but spreads are higher and market volatility makes the timing of deals problematic.  Other contacts noted that new issuance of high-yield debt has essentially shut down.  They report a similar contraction in the supply of leveraged loans.  Our contact at PayNet, a small business credit bureau, also noted that there was an abrupt pullback in small business lending in October and November.  He attributed this mostly to increased caution on the part of borrowers as opposed to supply-side developments.  The bottom line is that the credit environment has tightened by more than simply our 25 basis point move.  It is unclear how these conditions will weigh on cap-ex and other spending, but it seems difficult to imagine that business confidence has been unaffected.  These developments bear watching, but if the essential intent of our renormalization is to tighten financial conditions, then I think we’re ahead of schedule—and Governor Powell’s comments regarding federal funds equivalent increases seem relevant on this point. The news on inflation also suggests caution.  Our December statement indicated confidence that inflation would rise to target over the medium term.  Our communications have also pointed to developments that we are looking for to support that confidence, and I think the staff’s inflation dashboard ought to help us get at assessing those developments, too.  And I agree with Governor Tarullo’s comments there.  Stabilization in energy and import prices are prominent on the list, but both oil prices and the dollar have again moved in the wrong direction. We’ve also cited anchored expectations as a key inflation support.  I’ve been uncomfortable for a while with the continued low levels of inflation breakevens, and their recent further deterioration has only made matters worse.  The most benign interpretation is that these unusually low readings can be ignored as statistical noise or market anomalies.  Maybe this is right, but other measures, such as the Michigan survey’s longer-term inflation expectations, also are near 25-year lows.  To remain confident about inflation pressures being right around the corner, the Committee will have to continue to look through a lot of uncomfortable data developments. To sum up, my baseline forecast has not changed much since December, but the recent news beyond labor markets has been a sharp reminder that there continue to be large downside risks.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident when the speaker states that despite strong labor market data, they continue to hear downbeat assessments from business contacts and that the incoming data on spending has been disappointing. They also express nervousness and uncertainty over the outlook for economic growth and inflation. Additionally, the speaker acknowledges that there are mixed views from their business contacts, with some expressing concerns about a manufacturing recession while others are more optimistic about growth in certain sectors. The speaker also highlights that financial conditions have tightened and expresses caution about inflation pressures. Overall, the passage presents different perspectives and conflicting assessments of the current economic and financial situation.


Passage number 250.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have been surprised during the intermeeting period by the relative weakness in U.S. economic data other than those for labor markets, the selloff in global equity markets, and renewed declines in crude oil prices.  I took some comfort that the staff forecast has not been changed substantially in response to these developments, at least as measured by Q1 real GDP growth.  I thought that the staff’s explanations and expectations were reasonable, at least at this juncture.  Nevertheless, I think it’s appropriate to watch and wait at this time to see if the seeming weakness in economic growth in the second half of 2015 persists into the first half of 2016.  I’m also mindful of a topic that we’ve not mentioned today:  Q1 residual seasonality, which has plagued us in the last couple of years.  It’s possible you get another weaker-looking quarter now on that basis. Although the Eighth District continues to grow at a moderate pace, I’ve been concerned during the intermeeting period with anecdotes from District contacts.  Some companies reported substantial drop-offs in activity in December and into January.  I will be very interested to see whether the activity levels for these firms recover in the weeks ahead. I’ve heard a lot about the state of U.S. agriculture since the first of the year.  The U.S. agricultural sector is large.  It has been doing relatively well since the recession ended, a relative strong point in the economy, but many components of this sector were weaker in 2015 because of declines in many key commodity prices since the summer of 2014.  In the Eighth District, the outlook for the ag sector was considered weak during the October–November 2015 timeframe.  Since then, crude oil prices have renewed their decline, and many other commodity prices fell in sympathy.  Since the first of the year, many Eighth District farmers and bankers are looking at the likely 2016 prices with considerable trepidation.  On the basis of the discussions I have had, I expect a particularly weak year for agribusiness income.  I take this as an example of the effects of commodity price declines, which could be substantial beyond those coming directly from the renewed fall in crude oil prices. The renewed decline in crude oil prices since early November has also caused me to revisit my ideas about the state of U.S. medium- and longer-term inflation expectations.  As has been discussed here extensively, TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations over the medium term have fallen around 75 basis points since the summer of 2014, when crude oil began its recent fall.  I have argued that TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations are useful indicators of the state of markets on this dimension.  However, the high correlation between crude oil prices and market-based inflation expectations has been a puzzle.  As President Evans was just referring to, I have argued for a wait-and-see policy on this aspect of monetary policy over the past 18 months.  I thought that crude oil prices would likely stabilize and that, post-stabilization, market-based inflation expectations would return to more normal levels.  But the renewed decline in crude oil prices since November 2015, which again has pulled down inflation expectations, has led me to review this assumption.  I am now concerned that inflation expectations may be falling in the United States regardless of crude oil price developments, and that the Committee may have to place more emphasis on this factor than we have in the past 18 months.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing surprise at weak economic data but agrees with the staff forecast and acknowledges the need to watch and wait. They also express concerns about the agricultural sector and inflation expectations, but there is no direct disagreement with any other person or viewpoint.


Passage number 251.
 MR. POWELL.  I have one.  Do you want to wait a second to give people a chance to read it, or shall I launch in. 7 The materials used by Chair Yellen are appended to this transcript (appendix 7). CHAIR YELLEN.  Go ahead.

It is a conversation between Mr. Powell and Chair Yellen discussing the materials used by Chair Yellen, but there is no disagreement or contention expressed.


Passage number 252.
 MR. POWELL.  Focusing on the last sentence, I, too, believe that “the Committee’s concern should be focused primarily on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.”  So to say that that’s a basis for dissent is to say that that’s not what we believe this statement says.  I think what President Bullard is really saying is that the statement doesn’t sufficiently point in that direction.  The Committee does not have a different concern than the one that’s expressed here.  Do you see my point. CHAIR YELLEN.  I do see your point.  The problem is that the minutes will come out and will reflect the discussion we had on that, and I think they will indicate that the view of most of the Committee is not inconsistent with President Bullard’s view.  However these are not the minutes.  This is just a cover sheet for releasing this statement.  I think our view—maybe Governor Fischer, President Mester, or others want to speak about this—was that almost everything that’s in here was essentially in the previous minutes, and we vote on the minutes.  We didn’t want to get involved in writing a statement that would require a lot of editing and a vote.  So we’ve just included some background but are not trying to offer a full discussion, which will later appear in the minutes.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Powell and Chair Yellen express understanding and agreement with each other's points.


Passage number 253.
 MR. TARULLO.  I share Governor Powell’s concern, and, as you say, there would be a three-week period in which members of the public might have a misimpression of what the other 16 members of the FOMC—at least the other 9 members plus the other participants—thought they were voting for.  I wonder whether President Bullard might be amenable—it should be his language because it’s his statement—to a change in the formulation, which would at least allow people to infer that this is a difference of gradation rather than a binary issue.  I’m just suggesting this language, and, obviously, again, it’s President Bullard’s.  But if that last clause read “but believed the Committee’s language is not adequately focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal” or something like that, it might allow him to take his principal position while not leaving people with a false impression of where most of the rest of us are. CHAIR YELLEN.  Another possibility along those lines, if President Bullard is amenable, would be “but believed that the statement should more clearly express that it is primarily focused.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a suggestion being made by Mr. Tarullo and Chair Yellen for a possible change in language to address a concern raised by Governor Powell.


Passage number 254.
” MR. BULLARD.  Yes, I’d be open to either Governor Tarullo’s language or the language that you just gave.  I think insufficient focus is my main concern, and I wanted to force that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard expresses his willingness to consider both Governor Tarullo's language and the language presented by the other person, indicating openness to different perspectives. His main concern is described as a lack of sufficient focus, which is not inherently contradictory to the ideas presented by the others.


Passage number 255.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I like the Chair’s language of “express” because, when you characterized your view, it was really about what that sentence said in terms of “were running” versus “expected.”  So I think “express” focuses on how it’s more of a language issue than something more. CHAIR YELLEN.  Would that language, then, be acceptable to you, President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing a specific language choice and its focus on a particular aspect.


Passage number 256.
   MR. BULLARD.  It sounded acceptable. CHAIR YELLEN.  It is acceptable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage. Both individuals, Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen, appear to agree on the acceptability of something without expressing any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 257.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  I’m not sure exactly what it is, but it sounded good.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Let me read that language to you:  “Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed that the statement should more clearly express that it is primarily focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard agrees with the committee's inflation goal but suggests that the statement should express it more clearly.


Passage number 258.
” MR. BULLARD.  That’s perfectly acceptable to me. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard agrees with Chair Yellen's statement, expressing his acceptance.


Passage number 259.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is not provided.


Passage number 260.
 WILLIAMS.  That’s fine. CHAIR YELLEN.  Loretta, are you okay with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement present in the passage. Loretta's response is not provided, so there is no evidence of contention.


Passage number 261.
 MS. MESTER.  Yes. CHAIR YELLEN.  Is everybody okay with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 262.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 263.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is addressing Chair Yellen, and she responds affirmatively.


Passage number 264.
 MR. LACKER.  Did it say “should more clearly express that it is”.  Is that what you said. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen are in agreement.


Passage number 265.
 MR. LACKER.  Should it be “the Committee”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any information that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a statement or question by Mr. Lacker without providing any context or opposing views.


Passage number 266.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage because "MR" does not provide enough context to determine if disagreement or contention is present.


Passage number 267.
 WILLIAMS.  No, it’s the statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that "No, it’s the statement." without any contradictory opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 268.
 MS. BRAINARD.  The statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The passage does not directly provide any information about contention or disagreement.


Passage number 269.
 MR. FISCHER.  It’s about the consensus statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that the topic is about the consensus statement without providing any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 270.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I need more information to accurately answer your question. Could you please provide me with the passage you are referring to?


Passage number 271.
 WILLIAMS.  About the statement of the Committee. CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or indication of contention or disagreement between Williams and Yellen.


Passage number 272.
  “The statement is primarily focused”— MR. LACKER.  You mean the statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply presents a statement and does not involve any conflicting opinions or perspectives.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 273.
 MS. MESTER.  You could say “but believed that the statement should more clearly express.” PARTICIPANTS.  Yes. CHAIR YELLEN.  That “it is,” or “the Committee is”.  That “it is primarily focused”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Mester believes that the statement should more clearly express something, but the participants and Chair Yellen are suggesting alternative statements.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 274.
 MS. MESTER.  That “the Committee is primarily focused.” CHAIR YELLEN.  So maybe it should be “the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. MS. Mester's statement indicates that the committee is primarily focused, while CHAIR YELLEN implies that it might not be the case and suggests a different wording for the statement.


Passage number 275.
” MS. MESTER.  Right. CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with Chair Yellen's statement.


Passage number 276.
  Let’s try that again:  “the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed that the statement should more clearly express that the Committee is primarily”— MR. LACKER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 277.
 MS. MESTER.  Right.

Passage number 279.
 WILLIAMS.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or indications of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 280.
 MR. EVANS.  You’re starting to talk about Committee actions at that point. PARTICIPANTS.  It’s the statement. CHAIR YELLEN.  “But believed that the statement should more clearly express that”—what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants are simply referring to the statement and Chair Yellen is clarifying what part of the statement they are discussing.


Passage number 281.
—“the Committee is primarily focused” or— MR. LOCKHART.  “That the Committee’s primary focus be on expected future deviations.

Passage number 284.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair, could we try the passive voice, because it avoids that.  “It should more clearly express a focus on” or “a primary focus on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a suggestion made by Mr. Lacker to use the passive voice to avoid a certain issue, without any opposing viewpoints being expressed.


Passage number 285.
” MR. POWELL.  Dan’s language avoided this whole mess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions Dan's language as a way to avoid a messy situation.


Passage number 286.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it is not provided.


Passage number 287.
 WILLIAMS.  Yes.  We were good before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 288.
 MR. POWELL.  “But believed the Committee’s language is not adequately,” or maybe “the statement language is not adequately focused on expected future deviations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is expressing the belief that the Committee's language is not adequately focused on expected future deviations, but it is not contradicting or disputing any specific viewpoint.


Passage number 289.
” VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  How about “sufficiently” rather than “adequately”. CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 290.
  “That the statement language is not”— MR. POWELL.  —“sufficiently” or “adequately focused on expected”—et cetera.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is interrupted by Mr. Powell, but there is no explicit disagreement or opposition.

 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 292.
 WILLIAMS.  It’s his view, so Jim.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states Williams has a specific viewpoint. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 293.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes, it’s Jim’s, in the end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There doesn't seem to be any contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply confirms that the ownership belongs to Jim.


Passage number 294.
   MR. EVANS.  Well, he’s characterizing the difference between how he sees it and the Committee’s so he’s in effect also characterizing the Committee’s view by saying it this way. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Let’s try this, and this obviously requires President Bullard’s consent:  “Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee’s inflation goal is symmetric, but believed the statement language is not sufficiently focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are discussing a potential change in wording and seeking President Bullard's consent.


Passage number 295.
” MR. BULLARD.  Yes, I agree with that. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage shows agreement between Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 296.
 MS. MESTER.  Can I offer one thought.  Could you say “the amended language,” because you’re not wanting to reopen the whole statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting an alternative wording for clarity and to avoid potential complications.


Passage number 297.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Without any context or specific passage provided, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 298.
 WILLIAMS.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: There is contention or disagreement in the passage because the speaker's response indicates a disagreement or differing opinion from the previous statement or speaker.


Passage number 299.
 MR. BULLARD.  That’s a good addition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard's statement is seen as positive and agreeable.


Passage number 300.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes, “the amended language.” CHAIR YELLEN.  “But believed the amended language is not sufficiently focused.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. Fischer and Chair Yellen agree that the amended language is not sufficiently focused, but Mr. Fischer adds that he believes it.


Passage number 301.
” MR. BULLARD.  Right. CHAIR YELLEN.  Is everybody content.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage suggests that everyone is content, indicating agreement.


Passage number 302.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 303.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes, thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any assertion or statement that could indicate contention or disagreement. It seems to be a polite response indicating gratitude.


Passage number 304.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Good.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Thank you very much, and thank you, President Bullard, for working with us on this. We’ll now return to the economic go-round with a few speakers left, and we’re going to start with President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of polite exchanges and expressions of gratitude, indicating agreement and cooperation.


Passage number 305.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The 10th District economy continues to grow at a modest pace, with weakness in commodity prices and a stronger dollar weighing on sectors like agriculture, energy, and manufacturing.  District manufacturing activity has now contracted in 9 out of the past 10 months, and prices of all major crops grown in the District are at or very near their 12-month lows and considerably below prices three years ago.  Concerns at District energy companies also have risen, as oil prices fell further below breakeven levels, hedges continued to roll off, and financing to the sector tightened.  In our fourth-quarter energy survey, more than 80 percent of respondents now expect a large increase in defaults and bankruptcies this year for those oil and gas companies with exceptionally high debt levels. Other than those in these sectors, District contacts remain relatively upbeat about the outlook for 2016, primarily in construction and retail, travel, and leisure.  One District contact in the nonprofit sector noted for the first time that charitable giving is up and the demand for food and shelter services has declined. My outlook for the national economy is little changed since our December meeting.  I expect moderate economic growth this year as temporary weakness from the fourth quarter of last year dissipates.  Consumption and labor market gains continue to be the primary sources of strength in my forecast.  Fundamentals remain supportive for consumption.  Debt service ratios remain low, household wealth remains at high levels, saving rates are higher, gasoline prices are low, house prices are rising, and the labor market continues to improve.  However, if households pull back amid the current market volatility and other uncertainties, as highlighted yesterday in terms of downside risks, then this year would likely see only modest economic growth. I note that confidence among the top third of income earners from the University of Michigan survey has been slipping for several months and is now about equal to the rising confidence of middle-income households, a somewhat unusual occurrence that likely reflects the volatility in financial markets.  Still, the empirical evidence suggests to me that households make only modest adjustments to their spending in response to higher uncertainty, and that these kinds of developments don’t necessarily translate into weaker consumption growth. In terms of the labor market, continued improvements seem likely to support economic growth.  In December, the level of activity component of my staff’s labor market index went above its long-run average for the first time since the crisis.  While my forecast of the unemployment rate depends on continued improvement in the labor market, I expect some lower job growth numbers in the next few months, in light of how strong we assessed the release in December to be.  A number of sectors saw December job gains at or near the tops of the ranges seen over the previous 12 months, so I won’t be surprised to see payroll growth below what we’ve seen over the past few months. Finally, I expect that the decline in oil prices and dollar effects will continue to be a headwind for inflation, a headwind that has proven to be more persistent than fleeting and appears to be affecting five-year, five-year-ahead breakevens.  While the stability of survey-based longer-term inflation expectations is reassuring, longer-term inflation expectations bear watching.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly provides information and analysis about the state of the 10th District economy and the outlook for the national economy.


Passage number 306.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Good morning.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Ninth District economy is growing moderately but unevenly, and employment is strong in the District overall.  In the Twin Cities, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in November was 3.2 percent—pretty strong.  Our business contacts continue to report difficulty finding skilled and specialized workers.  However, the strong dollar is weighing on exports of manufacturers and farmers, and low commodity prices are reducing incomes and activity in the oil, mining, and ag sectors. Let me offer two anecdotes from the region that I think the Committee may find interesting.  First of all, we have the Bakken oil field, and some of our contacts there expressed a great deal of optimism that prices are going to rebound quickly.  When pushed, there wasn’t a lot of analysis underlying that optimism.  I would call it more of a hope.  But it’s a good reminder that not all market participants adjust immediately when prices move in a painful direction for them.  The adjustment can take time before they fully embrace it. The second anecdote I’ll offer is that I’m pleased to report that I was able to get a mortgage.  [Laughter]  I went through the whole process, from soup to nuts.  I was concerned when Chairman Bernanke famously was turned down for a refinance, so I thought, what hope did I have.  But I’ve got to tell you something:  It is a painful process.  I went through it like anybody else.  The amount of documentation that I had to provide was shocking to me.  So the good news is, the mortgage market is open.  The good news also is, the banks are taking the new regulatory environment very seriously, but it’s not for the faint of heart. The national economic picture is similarly mixed.  Concerns about China’s economic growth outlook and policy decisions and about other global risks, as we’ve noted, have destabilized financial markets.  As of last night, the S&P is down, I think, 7 percent since the start of the year.  Volatility has risen, credit spreads have widened considerably, and longer-run market-based measures of inflation expectations have fallen to new lows. As we discussed yesterday, financial markets can be leading indicators.  We have to consider the possibility that these developments are signaling higher odds of an economic downturn, especially one that’s accompanied by low inflation.  The U.S. economy does show substantial underlying strength, especially in the labor market, so it’s far from certain that the international volatility we see is going to directly affect us. In summary, I share the Tealbook’s baseline outlook for gradual improvement in the economy, but uncertainty has risen.  We don’t know how hard a landing China will have, we don’t know how effectively China’s policymakers will deal with that landing, and we don’t know how events in China will spill over to the United States.  So I feel that we must be prepared to respond to a wide range of potential outcomes, including those downside scenarios.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of observations and statements made by Mr. Kashkari about the Ninth District economy, the mortgage market, and the national economic picture.


Passage number 307.
 MR. EVANS.  In the chart Thomas presented with the probabilities on the excess bond premium, it looks like there were a couple of spikes in 2002 and 2004.  I think the 2002 is probably Enron, WorldCom, and all of that, but what about 2004.  It gets up to about 40 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply questioning the reason behind a spike in the excess bond premium in 2004.


Passage number 308.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Yes, I think the salient point is, of course, that these are somewhat noisy indicators of recessions, so there are false positives in here as well.  The excess bond premium is constructed from literally a very large universe of outstanding corporate bonds, so there may be particular factors like corporate governance scandals.  More recently, you may wonder what role, for example, energy firms are playing in driving that particular variable, and that was the intention of then moving to the red line.  Now, the red line, too, gives you some movement, as you point out, especially in late 2002.  If I recall correctly, that period actually wasn’t an NBER recession but saw substantial financial stresses in many areas.  It’s clear that when you base this indicator on financial variables, you may get a false positive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing various factors that may affect the accuracy of certain indicators and acknowledges the possibility of false positives.


Passage number 309.
 MR. EVANS.  But nobody remembers the headline in 2004 that is likely responsible for that little spike.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting or opposing viewpoints. It simply mentions a headline from 2004 that may have caused a small increase in something, without implying any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 310.
 MR. LACKER.  The increase in rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the fact that there was an increase in rates.


Passage number 311.
 MR. EVANS.  Well, it could be.  It’s too early for the conundrum to have 10-year rates drop out.  Okay. Sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty and apologizing for possibly misunderstanding something.


Passage number 312.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Yes, I would be surprised.  Again, this thing is constructed on the basis of the expected excess returns on holding corporate bonds over Treasury securities.  So I don’t know whether they responded very strongly to the tightening. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Laubach and Chair Yellen seem to be discussing and sharing their thoughts on the same topic without any apparent disagreement.


Passage number 313.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just want to understand your presentation.  In this panel on the middle left, “Probability of Recession in 2016:H1,” what I’m understanding is that the Tealbook says 1 percent, and then these other charts, though, are six months ahead.  So you’re talking about the second half of 2016.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and understanding of a presentation.


Passage number 314.
 MR. LAUBACH.  No.  The calculations on the right are the probability of being in recession either already now or within the next six months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the calculations on the right.


Passage number 315.
 MR. BULLARD.  Does that mean the recession would begin then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple question and does not express any conflicting viewpoints or opinions.


Passage number 316.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "Exactly" simply confirms agreement without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 317.
 MR. BULLARD.  So it could begin in July, and then that would be okay, according to the model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that starting in July would be acceptable according to the model.


Passage number 318.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Yes.  I have to confess that I’m not quite sure whether we picked the window of January to June or February to July, but it was one of the two.  But if, say, you were thinking a recession might begin later in the year, in the late fall or something like that, it would not be captured in these regressions.  They ask about now or in the next six months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Laubach is simply expressing uncertainty about the specific timeframe chosen for the analysis and discussing the limitations of the regressions in capturing future events like a recession starting later in the year.


Passage number 319.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So these three charts, the recession probability charts, are meant to be comparable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the three charts are meant to be comparable.


Passage number 320.
 MR. LAUBACH.  As much as possible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or ideas that would indicate contention or disagreement. It appears to be a neutral statement introducing a speaker or participant named Mr. Laubach.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 321.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  And the Tealbook is wildly lower than the other probabilities.  So explain that to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that the Tealbook is "wildly lower" than the other probabilities, indicating a difference of opinion or contention between the Tealbook and the other sources.


Passage number 322.
 MR. LAUBACH.  The Tealbook is not actually shown.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that the Tealbook is not shown, without expressing any contradictory viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 323.
 MR. WILCOX.  What are you referring to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks for clarification or more information about a certain topic.


Passage number 324.
 MR. BULLARD.  FRB/US.  Sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage provided is simply a statement of a speaker's name and a reference to a research model (FRB/US). There is no explicit disagreement or contention present in this statement.


Passage number 325.
  MR. WILCOX.  Just to create a little space here, that’s different from the Tealbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: The passage only mentions two different things, the "space" and the "Tealbook," without any indication of disagreement or contention between them.


Passage number 326.
 MR. BULLARD.  I know.  Sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply acknowledges the speaker's apology for an unknown reason. There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 327.
 MR. WILCOX.  Just for clarity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement of fact or a request for clarification.


Passage number 328.
 MR. BULLARD.  I stand corrected.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging that they were mistaken and giving the floor to someone else to speak.


Passage number 329.
 MR. LAUBACH.  The FRB/US number is based on stochastic simulations, and it’s computing the probability, the number of draws or the percentage of draws for which you get a decline in real GDP in both Q1 and Q2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a statement explaining the methodology behind the FRB/US number.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 330.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, another question would be the unconditional probability of going into recession at any particular date, and FRB/US would seem to have a very low number for that, whereas the other models would have something like 10 or 15 percent all of the time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The statement indicates that there is a difference in the probability estimates for going into a recession between FRB/US and other models. While FRB/US has a low number for the probability, the other models have 10 or 15 percent, suggesting a disparity or contention in their predictions.


Passage number 331.
 MR. LAUBACH.  I think this is a fair point that these models may have different steady-state probabilities of going into recession.  That is right.  Now, in the case of FRB/US, my guess—so please take it with a grain of salt—would be that it takes a lot of signal from the strong labor market data.  That’s really what’s keeping it out of recession.  But that’s a guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply acknowledging the possibility of different models having different probabilities of going into a recession. The speaker then provides their own guess, but clarifies that it is not a definitive statement and should be taken with caution.


Passage number 332.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there other questions.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Bullard thanks someone (presumably Chair Yellen) and asks if there are any other questions, to which President Kaplan may or may not respond.


Passage number 333.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have one question.  On the red line, are you looking at absolute levels, or are you looking at the degree of change from a point in time.  So, for example, I noticed you’re looking at equity prices and other things.  You’re not looking at absolute valuation levels, but you’re looking at the delta.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is clarifying a technical aspect of the analysis being discussed.


Passage number 334.
 MR. LAUBACH.  You’re taking a bunch of variables that include the VIX.  It includes spreads.  I’m actually looking for help from Eric Engstrom, who assisted me in that.  Could you speak about exactly how the stock market is fitting into it.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking for assistance and clarification on how the stock market is fitting into the variables being discussed.


Passage number 335.
 MR. ENGSTROM.  There are actually both level and change variables in the regression.  There’s a six-month change in the stock market as well as a stock market valuation level, like a P/E ratio, and there are credit spread levels and volatility measures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that there are both level and change variables in the regression, providing examples of each.


Passage number 336.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The first speaker, Mr. Kaplan, expresses gratitude, and Chair Yellen responds by acknowledging his statement.


Passage number 337.
 MR. LACKER.  Simple question:  How many models did you estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asked by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 338.
 MR. LAUBACH.  For this year.  For the right panel.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. It simply states a statement made by Mr. Laubach.


Passage number 339.
 MR. LACKER.  You’re showing us two.  How many did you estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question and does not involve conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 340.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Exactly these two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states "Exactly these two," without any indication of conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 341.
 MR. LACKER.  No more.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting or opposing viewpoints. It simply states that Mr. Lacker has no additional information.


Passage number 342.
 MR. LAUBACH.  I do not know how many more models the staff is estimating, but when I asked colleagues, like Eric, to help me put this briefing together, we did not engage in a laborious search.  This is certainly an area that many folks across divisions here at the Board are working on, but, no, we did not engage in a particular search.  The reason I thought these two would be interesting is because we wanted to present something that was using financial variables in order to get at the question “Should you draw a very different view from the financial information.”  And I deliberately wanted to draw a stark contrast in the sense that you could easily imagine estimating models in which you throw in both nonfinancial and financial variables, and the factor model in the left-hand panel is a bit of that nature. Again, for contrast, I wanted to focus exclusively on financial variables.  Then we thought that two obvious starting points would be, one, just an agnostic thing, which is the red line,  for which we drew on a bunch of headline variables that you would normally look at in order to get an overall view of financial conditions.  Then the other one, the excess bond premium, is simply quite interesting because of the work that has been done by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek documenting that it is a surprisingly strong predictor of future real GDP growth.  Those were just two candidates that came to my mind, but I’m not claiming that they are representative of a larger universe of things that the staff has looked at. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there further questions for Thomas.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, let’s begin our go-round and start with President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their thoughts and choices on which models to use and is explaining their reasoning behind it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 343.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  We need more time to assess the direct effect of recent financial market volatility on the economic outlook and inflation and, more important, to determine whether the volatility is signaling underlying weakness that is not yet evident in the data. It is disappointing that the real GDP growth forecast for last quarter has been revised down.  I am concerned that we also may be revising down estimates of first-quarter real GDP growth.  If we are growing slower than potential, then the median path of the federal funds rate in the December SEP may prove to be too steep.  As I highlighted yesterday, I believe the downside risks to the outlook are elevated relative to December.  With consumption being an important component of real GDP that could disappoint. I would also add that if both actual as well as expected inflation are important determinants of actions to be taken in March, it is unlikely that we will have much in the way of evidence of higher core or total PCE inflation by that time.  In light of the recent declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar, the Tealbook expects that total PCE inflation for the first quarter of 2016 will be negative, and that core PCE inflation will be 1.2 percent in Q1.  In fact, the Tealbook forecast does not have core inflation showing signs of accelerating until next year.  If this forecast proves correct, the inflation data will not provide evidence of approaching our 2 percent goal for quite some time.  We have plenty of data yet to be received before the next meeting.  Nonetheless, in view of recent events, we should be reinforcing the idea that the median SEP is a forecast, not a promise, and that we remain data dependent. I greatly prefer the new sentence substituted in the second paragraph of alternative B to the previous version of alternative B.  It appropriately highlights that we are monitoring recent events for implications on the outlook and the risks to the outlook.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker (Mr. Rosengren) expresses concern about the downside risks to the economic outlook and inflation, while also highlighting the need for more time to assess the impact of recent financial market volatility. This suggests a level of disagreement or difference in opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 344.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B in the version with the revised wording at the end of the second paragraph.  This gives the right combination of concern over recent developments and calmness in deciding how to appraise them and how to react to them at later meetings.  Although a lot has happened so far in January, this is not the time to change course.  We continue to be faced by the combination of a strong labor market and disappointing real spending, with the recent addition to the mixture of considerable financial market volatility.  We’re not expected to change the federal funds rate at this meeting.  And, at least in this regard, we should not disappoint expectations.  Rather, we should, in the words of alt-B, closely monitor “global economic and financial developments” and assess “their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.” Our discussions yesterday and today started from the current combination of a labor market that has performed relatively well and that must be near maximum sustainable employment, and, at the same time, the staff’s forecast of PCE inflation for 2016 that is only 0.7 percent, with even the forecast of the core PCE inflation at 1.3 percent.  The discussion yesterday went on to detail the background to this situation:  the large depreciation of the dollar; the ongoing declines in the price of oil; the recent declines in asset and commodity prices; and the fears, particularly of asset market participants, that China’s economic growth may decline more rapidly than the official predictions, and that the exchange rate of the renminbi may depreciate more than the authority’s pronouncements about it would suggest.  There was concern over Japan, which may want a weaker exchange rate, and the euro zone, which makes no bones about that. Aside from the market volatility, these are not especially new facts.  Nonetheless, like the markets, the FOMC was in a distinctly less optimistic mood yesterday than it had been only six weeks ago.  It was striking that the basic view about inflation that had obtained among many of us until now—that inflation has been held down by temporary factors, especially declines in the price of oil and the appreciation of the dollar—appeared to be losing ground.  Simply put, the view I thought I heard from some of you was that we’ve been surprised too often by low inflation, and that we should accept low inflation as a better description of the underlying state of the economy than the view that inflation is low primarily because of temporary factors. I do not believe that.  True, we have continually been surprised by oil price declines.  So has almost everyone, including the Saudis.  That does not mean that the temporary oil price declines and their consequences are not a major factor underlying the behavior of prices.  Similarly, the appreciation of the dollar has had an influence on even core PCE prices.  Among the consequences of declines in the price of oil is the decline in expected inflation.  Those who worry about inflation losing its expected-inflation anchor need, at present, to look no further than the behavior of the price of oil.  Those who ask why core PCE inflation is 1.3 percent rather than closer to the target of 2 percent will find that a significant share of that 0.7 percent gap is taken up by the influence of oil prices and the appreciating exchange rate on core inflation.  Now, one may well ask why movements in energy prices are correlated with expected inflation and core PCE inflation, and everyone is asking.  There are explanations for both these phenomena, but there is a clear need for further research on these topics.  And I’m sure that WE9, which is Wilcox exhibit 9, marks a good start in getting an answer to that question. Where would we be if we accept, as I do, the view that inflation will gradually rise to its 2 percent target if labor markets continue to be strong, with unemployment remaining close to the natural rate.  We would essentially remain with the forecast we had last month, which is close to this month’s Tealbook forecast.  We would continue with our approach of gradual increases in the federal funds rate at a rate that depends on incoming data and without any commitment to a fixed number of increases per period. What if that view turns out to be wrong and the labor market starts weakening and the unemployment rate moves up in a sustained way.  I think it’s premature to start talking seriously about that possibility now, but it is not premature for the staff to start researching that situation and possible courses of action to deal with it.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. While the speaker supports alternative B, there is disagreement about the current state of inflation and whether low inflation is due to temporary factors or is a better description of the underlying state of the economy. The speaker argues that low inflation is primarily due to temporary factors, while others believe that it is a more fundamental issue.


Passage number 345.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the substance of alternative B.  As regards the statement language, the objective should be to position the Committee as agnostic about a March policy action but to be careful not to rule out March.  While I have some sympathy with the alternative A language that the Committee sees risks “tilted slightly to the downside,” I think the better communication strategy is to avoid explicitly making that declaration.  To shift the risk assessment to the downside at this meeting would signal, in my opinion, that a rate increase at the March meeting is quite unlikely, and I think it is too early to make such a call. Regarding the notion in the new alternative B language of omitting an explicit balance-of-risks assessment, yesterday I heard quite a number of comments that the balance of risk may have tilted to the downside.  I think this presents a tricky communication situation.  Avoiding an explicit assessment of risk will be noticed and give rise to lots of commentary.  It is a departure from past practice.  It could also be taken as a signal regarding March.  So, all things considered, I am leaning, after thinking about it over the weekend, toward just sticking with the language in the memo on alternative language circulated on January 20 premising that it’s simply too early, and it’s premature to make an adjustment to the downside in the Committee’s official stance on the balance of risk. I have a couple of more comments.  Strict adherence to data dependence makes us, to an extent, tethered to the data calendar.  I can imagine incoming data leading up to the March meeting that continue the run of ambiguous signals.  We have two more employment reports before the March meeting.  A soft reading on the labor market, along with weakness in the spending data, could give pause. I commented in the economic go-round that inflation data are likely to be messy through the middle of the year.  The February CPI data will arrive on the second day of our March meeting.  Although, as I said, I’m not ready to send any signal that a rate increase in March is off the table, I am anticipating that a rate move in March could feel premature and unsupported by evidence.  If that’s the situation, I expect I will be comfortable waiting until April for more data that confirm, I hope, that the outlook is holding up.  In some respects, I think it would be a healthy departure to move in April to reinforce that every meeting of this first phase of normalization is live.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is primarily focused on the author's thoughts and opinions on the language and decision-making process for a potential rate increase in March.


Passage number 346.
 MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Consistent with my economic forecast, I support alternative B for this meeting.  Labor markets have continued to improve, and inflation is likely to be held back by energy prices and dollar appreciation over the near term.  But survey-based measures of inflation expectations have remained steady, and I expect that oil prices and the dollar will stabilize in the months ahead. Monetary policy—and I think it’s important to remind myself—remains accommodative, and a cautious approach seems appropriate in view of the economic and political uncertainties that we face.  I’ve advocated a gradual normalization of policy that is data dependent, and the current data and forecasts suggest to me that no change in our policy stance is warranted at this meeting.  While my own view is that the risks to the economy are largely balanced or slightly to the downside, I’m fine with the proposed language in paragraph 2. There’s a large and growing divergence of the federal funds rate path in both the Tealbook forecast and the central tendency in the SEPs from the implied funds rate path from the financial markets.  Looking ahead to our next few meetings, we may find ourselves in a situation in which the labor market continues to be relatively strong while realized inflation runs at a slow pace.  My own view is that such a scenario would call into question the suggested path of our normalization.  Fortunately, I believe we take care in the statement to say that our policy decisions are data dependent.  However, in the event that there is ongoing tension between our employment and inflation goals, we may need to provide more guidance about how these tensions will be resolved and what that implies for the future course of monetary policy.  Personally, I would need to see convincing evidence that inflation is once again moving toward target, and that is unlikely to occur this quarter.  In any event, on account of the disconnect between the policy rate path we have in mind and the policy rate path expected by financial markets, it’s important to think about what we would have to see to choose to resume our rate increases.  Lastly, I’d just reiterate a comment I made a few meetings ago, which President Bullard referred to yesterday—Q1 GDP data are notoriously difficult to interpret due to seasonal adjustments.  And I encourage the Committee to take that with—I don’t know if it’ll be a block of salt or a grain.  Let’s call it a cube of salt.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 347.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Financial conditions have tightened considerably since we last met, and market-based measures of inflation expectations have taken another sizable step down.  Equity prices have fallen roughly 7 percent, and credit spreads have widened.  The trade-weighted real exchange rate appreciated a further 3 percent, bringing the total real effective appreciation to 20 percent, roughly 1 percent a month since the summer of 2014.  As noted earlier, the financial tightening in this period is roughly equivalent to two additional hikes in the federal funds rate. Over the course of the movements in the exchange rate and oil prices, we have repeatedly noted their transitory nature and stated our willingness to look through them.  As I discussed yesterday, the factors holding down inflation have proven to be persistent and appear to be related to global forces that are also persistent.  In particular, it would be unwise to dismiss the fluctuations in China’s financial markets as either one-offs or unlikely to perturb global markets sufficiently to matter for the U.S. outlook. As China changes the composition of its economic growth trajectory, it is having material effects on commodity producers, which are being amplified in countries whose growth was accompanied by rapid increases in debt.  China is also undertaking a notable shift in its exchange rate regime, a departure from earlier financial crises, when it hardened rather than loosened its commitment to a peg.  As China adjusts its exchange rate and attempts to work off large imbalances in its financial markets, this could lead to periodic bouts of volatility with possible amplification associated with post-crisis changes in financial market functioning. Eighteen months of repeated step-downs in oil prices and step-ups in the exchange rate risk exerting a disinflationary force in the medium-term framework in which we are making policy.  These may well have important implications for policy when they are accompanied by a significant deterioration in measures of market-based inflation expectations, as we’ve seen, and some hints of softening in survey-based measures.  From where we sit today, in light of the extent of deterioration we’ve seen to an inflation outlook that was already raising concerns and to measures of inflation expectations, I think it’s unlikely that we would see a set of data that would give me enough reassurance in the intermeeting period to justify an increase in the federal funds rate in March. What would it take to reverse that judgment.  To raise rates and still be confident in progress toward our inflation objective, we would need to see those forces abate at least somewhat and evidence that inflation is moving back toward our goal, along with some firming of expectations.  I would want to see a constellation of data indicating progress on actual and expected inflation, some combination of an inflection on the exchange rate and oil prices that’s durable, a firming in core inflation, and an improvement on market-based measures of inflation expectations.  In view of the current balance of risks, to act without hard evidence that inflation is moving toward our goal threatens to undermine the credibility of our inflation target. My views on policy are importantly shaped by the very limited room we have to cushion shocks on the downside using conventional tools.  In contrast, if we were to see an unexpected acceleration in inflation, we have ample room and experience using conventional tools to adjust policy in a manner that is not disruptive.  Interestingly, other advanced-economy central banks have taken note of recent developments and suggested they may warrant adjustments in their path of policy. In our discussions yesterday and today, I heard around the table a strong sense that recent developments pose downside risks to the outlook for inflation and activity.  If this is, in fact, a widely held view among those on the Committee, I think it would be helpful to shape market expectations that the path of policy is sensitive to recent negative developments.  I recognize there are risks to reacting both too much and too little, but I believe we can strike the appropriate balance, signaling we are actively engaged and prepared to adjust the path of the policy rate in tune with financial and economic conditions without appearing to lurch or suggesting greater alarm than is warranted.  If we do not do so, we risk seeing further financial tightening due to expectations of divergence and further deterioration in inflation expectations. I can support alternative B.  I would find it difficult to support language that continued to describe the risks to activity and inflation as balanced.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an analysis of current financial conditions and expressing their cautious stance on raising interest rates. They also mention the views of other central banks and suggest the need for a balanced approach to policy.


Passage number 348.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  Yesterday Governor Fischer stated some interesting financial-stability concerns related to equity market pricing and changes in the federal funds rate.  Because I favor continued strong accommodation, I want to clarify my views on those particular concerns. After the Lehman Brothers crisis, the financial crisis, and the deep recession that followed, a big output gap emerged, $11 trillion of net worth was destroyed, and risk aversion increased very strongly.  In that context, monetary policy accommodation was required to facilitate as quick a return to trend economic growth and a closing of the output gap as necessary. I viewed that as a fundamental improvement that supported equity prices throughout that time and a reduction in risk aversion.  I view so much of that period as a fundamental improvement that supported equity prices.  As we get closer to closing the gap, then renormalization, I think, properly gets that back.  Anyway, that’s my view regarding why policy accommodation continues to be appropriate, even in the presence of those concerns. We made it clear in December that future policy would be data dependent.  To me, data dependence reflects not just the baseline outlook relative to our dual-mandate goals, but also the uncertainties and balance of risks surrounding that outlook.  As I noted yesterday, while I’ve not changed my baseline much, the developments since our December meeting have raised uncertainties and shaded the risks further to the downside.  In addition, financial conditions appear to have already tightened in response to the increase in uncertainty and risks.  So, for me, data dependence and appropriate risk management dictate that we do not raise rates today, and that we communicate this reasoning for the decision to the public.  Alternative B accomplishes this.  Before we move again, we should be confident that economic growth and inflation have successfully weathered the latest round of downside shocks.  It could be well into the second half of the year before I have that confidence.  I think we need confirmation that our above-trend outlook for economic growth is still on track to drive continued labor market improvement.  That is an important channel for many of our inflation projections to rise to trend.  My December SEP submission envisioned only two quarter-point rate increases in 2016.  For me, this slow pace of renormalization—or even less—still seems appropriate. I support the new last sentence in paragraph 2.  We need to carefully assess the balance of risks.  In this environment, risk-management arguments weigh more strongly for further delay. Let me quickly repeat my risk-management views.  It’s a new year, and we have new Committee members.  I’ll be very brief, and they’re very similar to what Governor Brainard and others have mentioned.  We continue to be in a special policy environment because of the lower bound.  Our move of 25 basis points in December doesn’t give us enough headroom to use conventional policy to address any meaningful downside shock to economic growth or inflation, but we still can easily raise rates to address upside surprises.  Accordingly, even if the baseline outlook does not change, increases in uncertainty and downside risks generate asymmetric expected policy losses, and risk-management considerations still tell us that this asymmetry should be addressed with accommodative and perhaps looser monetary policy. Finally, I’ll note that, in paragraph 1, when we’re talking about inflation expectation measures, we still, for survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations, simply say that they’re little changed on balance.  In your own comments, Madam Chair, you mentioned that they’re at near-historic lows for the Michigan survey.  It would be useful, perhaps, to add that, although challenging.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, last time, we did say they had edged down, and I think, in reflection of that, we agree they’re low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any clear contention or disagreement. It is primarily a statement of the speaker's views and explanations.


Passage number 349.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The response from Chair Yellen shows gratitude and acknowledgement towards President Bullard.


Passage number 350.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Chair Yellen.  I support alternative B with the language as revised.  In my communication after this meeting, I intend to emphasize that current monetary policy remains accommodative; that any action we take will be data dependent; that there is no predetermined path—or, as President Lockhart said, we are agnostic on the path, and I like that language—and that we will not be, for lack of a better term, Calvinistic in our actions [laughter]; and that any future removal of accommodation will be done only gradually.  I will do everything I can to avoid getting pinned down into predicting the number of moves that we might make in 2016. I will also, though, emphasize that there are three segments that are distinctive but interrelated:  first, U.S. economic developments, which are obviously GDP, unemployment, and inflation; second, non-U.S. economic developments, which have obviously weakened; and, third, global financial market developments, which have clearly tightened.  I will emphasize that the S&P, as I said yesterday, is not the same as the U.S. economy, although it is affected by it.  It is also heavily affected by non-U.S. developments and global financial developments.  In 2016 or in this part of it, we will have to be patient, and I will talk about that in assessing the ramifications on underlying U.S. economic conditions of the weakness we are seeing so far in non-U.S. economic activity as well as global financial developments. While I’ve said before and I do believe that normalization would be desirable because of the potential distortions that excessive accommodation has on asset allocation, investment, and hiring, I don’t believe we can force normalization, and we really do have to be data dependent.  The prospect of normalization has caused markets and risky assets to undergo a revaluation.  There is now a greater focus on fundamentals and possibly a gradual return to more traditional asset allocation.  I actually think both of those developments are not a bad thing if they don’t go too far.  In that vein, I’m going to be particularly focused in the next few months on S&P earnings forecasts, which, right now, as I mentioned yesterday, are $115 to $120.  I will feel much better if forecasts stay in that range.  I’ll obviously be looking at high-yield and investment-grade credit spreads, and I’ll be looking at the 10-year Treasury. In addition, I’ll be continuing to try to assess the effect of three key secular, apart from cyclical, trends.  The first one is aging demographics in the United States, China, Japan, and Europe, which negatively affect labor participation rates and are expected to have further negative effects on those participation rates in the future, reduce potential GDP, and have a negative effect on r*.  The second secular trend is China, where there’s overcapacity and a transition to a more service-based economy is likely to take many years.  The world is going to have to get used to slower rates of Chinese economic growth, and this is going to happen over a very long period.  The third secular trend I’m focused on and am trying to continue to understand and assess is the end of the so-called debt supercycle.  That is, it is tougher for countries, including the United States, to boost their economic growth in the future by using leverage.  I think the prospect of removal of central bank accommodation even gradually will likely create greater focus on these secular trends.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses their support for alternative B with some revised language and discusses various factors they will be considering in their decision-making process.


Passage number 351.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support making no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting, as in alternative B.  In my view, the most likely outcome continues to be that the economy will evolve in a way that warrants a gradually rising path of policy rates over time, although there are risks associated with that outlook.  I view alternative B as consistent with my view on the economy, and I think that policy remains pretty well calibrated to the economic outlook.  In my view, I don’t think we have accumulated enough evidence to conclude that the medium-run outlook or the risks associated with the outlook have changed in a material way that necessitates giving a signal about a change in our policy course. The proposed change to the description of our inflation outlook acknowledges the further decline in oil prices and that inflation will remain low in the near term but, at the same time, indicates that, over time, inflation is expected to move back once the effects of energy price declines dissipate.  As I discussed yesterday, if energy prices continue to fall, we’ll need to reconsider that language, but today I’m comfortable with the proposed language in alternative B. Given the intermeeting developments in financial markets, I do think it’s appropriate to indicate we’re monitoring economic and financial developments closely and assessing their implications for the medium-run outlook.  This is consistent with past communications that our monetary policy decisions are going to be data dependent. Regarding the balance of risks, I note that in September, in a similar period of high market volatility, we did not change the balance of risks but indicated we were monitoring developments abroad.  I see today’s situation as somewhat analogous and would have preferred we not change our balance-of-risks assessment, because of the potential that that change might alter expectations further about our March decision.  And I would like us to remain data dependent with respect to our decision at that meeting, in which we’ll have new projections, and at subsequent meetings.  Now, it is true that we’re monitoring developments and assessing their implications for the outlook and the balance of risks associated with the outlook.  My concern is not with the truth of the statement but with the signal that would send about our policy rate path for the period ahead.  That said, I’m prepared to accept that statement as written in the revision of alternative B. Finally, I do understand it’s important to show that the Committee is aware and cognizant of economic and financial market developments, and I understand that we need to signal that in the statement.  But at times like this, when we’ve seen a lot of volatility in the markets, it’s easy to signal that we’re focused on the short run.  Of course, as the people around the table have said, in view of the lags with which policy affects the economy, we need to be thinking about the medium-run outlook.  And I don’t think we should use our statements to encourage short-run thinking.  Again, that said, I’m supportive of alternative B and the revision that was made.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for alternative B and providing their views on the economy and monetary policy. They also express some concerns and considerations, but there is no explicit disagreement or contention with the statements made.


Passage number 352.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I won’t attempt a comprehensive review.  I’ll just make a couple of observations.  First, I’ve heard a lot of discussion about downside risks.  Obviously, it’s the topic of the day here.  But I’m also struck that it’s very unclear whether global developments are going to affect our economic growth prospects materially.  When financial markets move significantly, like they have, without an immediately discernible deterioration in economic fundamentals, we often find ourselves striving to write a statement that shows we’re paying attention without adding to market pessimism unduly.  I think the new language proposed for the end of paragraph 2 strikes as reasonable a balance as possible. Now, of those two concerns you commented on, Madam Chair, the risk of distorting or biasing market participants’ outlook is, for me, more pressing.  People take our assessments of economic conditions very seriously, I think.  They accord a lot of skill and ability to us in our capacity to sift through the data and make a judgment about economic prospects.  And I think there have been times in the recent past when our actions and statements have had an influence on broad market beliefs about economic prospects.  So at times like this, we should be really cautious about altering our assessment of the economic outlook as well as the policy outlook. I’d also point out that this phrase “balance of risks” has been used commonly in our discussions yesterday and today in the sense of where outcomes are likely to fall in terms of economic growth and inflation.  The origin of that language in our statement is as an explicit signal of the likelihood of the direction of the next move.  So while you might be attracted to one formulation under one interpretation of “balance of risks,” I think we should be cautious because it has this broader connotation of putting down a marker about which direction the next likely move is going to be. I want to comment on one other aspect of the language.  This might be odd to bring up here, considering the tenor of things.  But I would point out that, in paragraph 1, we say that “a range of . . . labor market indicators . . . points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.”  We should think about that going forward if things play out the way the Tealbook suggests.  I argued yesterday that underutilization is statistically indistinguishable from zero now, and I think that word is going to be increasingly problematic as we go forward.  Paragraph 1 of alternative C contains what I believe to be more appropriate language.  There, it says that a range of labor market indicators “points to some additional increase in utilization of labor resources,” without judging what “full” or “underutilization” is.  That concludes my comments, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making observations and offering their opinion on certain language used in the statement.


Passage number 353.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as an appropriate pause after the first rate hike in several years.  Although volatility in financial markets has already made the path of the funds rate less certain this year than in December, I continue to anticipate moderate economic growth and rising inflation, with further removal of accommodation this year being appropriate. My confidence in that forecast, however, will depend on judging between now and March the signal of various risks and uncertainties that have been well highlighted at this meeting.  In light of that background, I support the revised language in paragraph 2.  It is what I consider to be an honest assessment on the part of the Committee about the risks.  I would also add that I had a similar comment to President Lacker’s as it relates to how we characterize additional declines in underutilization, versus increases in utilization as described in alternative C. I hope we’ll consider that as we go forward.CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MS. GEORGE is expressing support for alternative B and the revised language in paragraph 2, and she also agrees with President Lacker's comment. There is no indication of disagreement or controversy.


Passage number 354.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  Both the weaker inflation picture and the likely increase to downside risks suggest to me that the Committee can and should proceed cautiously.  As I mentioned yesterday, there are several story lines underlying the recent market weakness, and I think that the Committee will need some time to understand whether markets have overreacted. As for the language, I support the revised language in the statement.  The Committee, in my view, has to navigate between two risks.  Saying that “risks remain balanced” no longer seems right to me, and I think it also risks suggesting that the Committee is committed to a preset path.  At the same time, it seems premature to me to say that they are skewed to the downside; I also think that could send too much of a signal.  So I think that the proposed language navigates between these two risks and suggests that the Committee takes note of potential downside risks, is watching developments carefully, and will react appropriately.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Powell expresses his support for alternative B and shares his views on the language in the statement. There is no explicit contention or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 355.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I agree that, as the Chair noted, it’s important to show that we recognize downside risks but do so without appearing to panic or sending a negative signal that could further increase volatility.  I think alternative B strikes that balance appropriately, so I support alternative B. As we’ve talked about, there are risks to any outlook, and we have to be prepared to respond if the economy evolves in ways we may not expect.  Like others, I am particularly concerned about downside risks here.  I’ve been thinking about what we’re seeing in the markets, and it’s hard to tell signal from noise.  One piece of data that has stuck with me, as I read in the Tealbook, is that we estimate the Chinese have spent about $400 billion defending their currency.  That struck me as pretty revealing that they must be concerned.  So while we don’t have great visibility into what’s happening in China, we do now, I believe, know that they are legitimately concerned. I think alternative B is the right approach, and I’m concerned about what actions we would consider taking if these financial market developments actually did affect our economy.  As others have noted, if things are better than we expect, we have a lot more room to react, and we’ve got plenty of levers.  If things are worse than expected, what would we do.  I’d be very interested in the staff’s analysis of what some of those options could be if these things evolve in ways that we hope they don’t.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses agreement with the Chair's point and supports alternative B. They also express concern about downside risks and lack of visibility into China's situation. There is no clear disagreement or contention expressed in the passage.


Passage number 356.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Yesterday I said that my baseline expectations, while less optimistic than those of the Committee as a whole, hadn’t changed too much since December, but that I thought the risks had moved from modestly to decidedly weighted to the downside.  The remarks that a couple of you made yesterday afternoon suggested, I think, the valid point that the weight of the downside risks may itself have affected baseline expectations.  I think I actually heard all but a few participants take one or both of those perspectives, and the second seems to me an interesting one.  But, to me, the more important point was that all but a few people did seem to regard risks as having shifted to the downside.  And there, just to be clear, I agree with Jeff that that doesn’t mean it should be a signal of what the next interest rate move is, but that it’s an honest appraisal of where the economy stands right now. I said in December that I didn’t have reasonable confidence that inflation would rise to 2 percent.  Nothing since then has increased my confidence.  To the contrary, a few more doubts have crept in.  Looking at the Committee’s median expectation—this in the December SEP—of a 1.6 percent increase in both headline and core inflation, I think it’s important, as I said yesterday, to make as close a real-time evaluation as possible of the degree to which actual inflation is tracking those expectations.  We’ve already seen in this Tealbook that the path expected in December has been pushed out a couple of quarters.  It remains to be seen whether the slope of the path itself will hold after those couple of quarters.  The staff’s monitoring mechanism, as explained yesterday by David Wilcox, will help answer this question.  This will be in line with my recurring call for some evidence that expectations derived from models or past correlations are actually being realized before we take policy steps based on them. As to the statement, alternative A captures my views better than alternative B, certainly, in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, though I must confess that the subtlety of the difference in the last sentence of paragraph 3 somewhat eludes me.  So I may be missing something.  Indeed, I think the views of the Committee as expressed yesterday suggest support for at least the weak version of the last sentence of paragraph 2 of alt-A with respect to downside risks, but I hear many participants reluctant to articulate what, as someone said, is a true statement, because of the tactical reasons of what kind of signaling that may indicate about where we are going. Personally, like Lael, I’d be quite surprised if it was appropriate in March to increase rates further, but one never knows.  As the policy actions in alt-A and alt-B are, I think, identical—in fact, I know the policy actions are identical, but I just don’t understand that difference in phraseology in paragraph 3—I can certainly go along with alt-B, including the more agnostic version of the last sentence of paragraph 2.  But I must confess that I do so a little bit reluctantly on the basis of past experience where, just to be direct about it, some participants take agnostic language and then try to go out and shape expectations of how many rate increases that’s going to indicate over the next year.  I hope, as President Kaplan urged, we don’t do that going forward. I wanted to end with a point that I’ve made before, but I wanted to make it again.  On the concept of normalization, I resist the notion that whatever we’re engaged in is a normalization process, because that suggests there is a “normal” for monetary policy.  It’s not a matter of getting the body temperature back to 98.6.  What is appropriate policy is going to depend on what the circumstances are that we face.  And, while some regarded having zero interest rates as abnormal, suggesting that we needed to get off of it as soon as possible, I think we see in the results that it was entirely appropriate, in view of external conditions, to be at zero.  I would also say that the very good r* discussion we had a few meetings ago should have reinforced the idea that, at some level, we don’t really know quite what “normal” is, and that “normal” changes over time.  So that doesn’t affect how one thinks about actual rate increases, but I think it does, in public communications, sometimes affect people because it suggests that there is this obvious goal.  We may say we’re data dependent, but we’re going to get to that goal.  We’re going to normalize, meaning “get back to the normal level.”  Maybe a few of us actually believe that, but I don’t think most of us, including some who use that term, actually mean that.  I think they really are making judgments as to what’s appropriate in what circumstances.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is summarizing the views expressed by various participants and expressing agreement with them. There is no disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 357.
 MR. FISCHER.  May I say something. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Governor Fischer is simply asking for permission to speak, and Chair Yellen allows him to do so.


Passage number 358.
 MR. FISCHER.  Well, I understand what you say, Governor Tarullo, but I will continue to use the word “normalization.”  I don’t think a zero interest rate is a normal situation.  It hasn’t been historically, and I’d rather be in a situation in which you can move both ways as needed.  Of course, that is not to say that zero was wrong when we were at zero.  And, if I may continue—President Evans, I didn’t say anything critical of QE or policies followed up to 2015 or 2016.  I was just trying to explain why, as we come out of zero, we might expect stock prices to adjust because the capitalization factor is rising.  That’s all I was saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer is expressing his personal opinion about interest rates and stock prices, but he does not directly disagree with anyone else's statements.


Passage number 359.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of polite conversation and does not indicate any contention or disagreement between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 360.
 MR. BULLARD.  On Governor Tarullo’s comments on normalization, I’d be willing to use a different word if you wanted to.  But “tightening,” I think, is contrary to some of the things that we’re saying, because we’re saying that policy remains accommodative.  And if you say, “Well, every time you raise rates, you’re tightening,” I’m not sure that the Committee is really there.  Even taking into account the r* discussion, I think we still believe we’ve got an accommodative policy.  I struggled a little bit to describe the situation, but I thought “normalization” was maybe a good term.  I’d be happy to switch to something else, but I think the idea was to not be saying that we’re tightening in a situation in which people think the economy is certainly not at the level that it’s been historically.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply expressing a willingness to use a different word than "normalization" if necessary, but also explaining their belief that the current policy is accommodative rather than tightening.


Passage number 361.
 MR. TARULLO.  Well, I wasn’t trying to suggest any particular formulation, Jim.  One could say “removal of accommodation” or whatever.  I actually, though, think Governor Fischer made my point, even though he was rebutting it [laughter], that zero was appropriate for those conditions, and what will be appropriate in the future will depend on what the conditions are, both cyclical and secular.  That’s really the only point that I was trying to make, and, as I say, I know you, certainly—and, I suspect, others—have not had in mind that there’s some interest rate that we’re going to end at.  You’re taking the data and your assessment of the economy as we go.  But I have read more than one account in which people have said, “They’re normalizing to get to a particular rate,” and the rate is the one that they find in the SEP.  And we just don’t know that yet.  Now, that’s really my only point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Tarullo is explaining his point of view on interest rate normalization. He is not expressing disagreement or contention with anyone. He mentions Governor Fischer's rebuttal to his point, but it is presented in a lighthearted manner with laughter. Overall, there is no clear disagreement or contention in this passage.


Passage number 362.
 MR. EVANS.  Madam Chair, could I say something. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no disagreement or contention in the passage. Both Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen are having a conversation and there is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 363.
 MR. EVANS.  I’m confused by this.  I thought we had work streams that use the term “renormalization process.” CHAIR YELLEN.  We do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans expresses confusion about the term "renormalization process," and Chair Yellen confirms that they do have work streams that use that term.


Passage number 364.
 MR. TARULLO.  It’s not my work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo is simply stating that the work being discussed is not his own.


Passage number 365.
  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  Well, okay.  But as a Committee, I’ve seen documents in which we refer to this as renormalization, and there have been periods when Chairman Bernanke certainly had strong preferences for certain types of terminology as opposed to others.  I just assumed that, on most occasions, it would be okay to use the official language.  I don’t think I disagree with the substance of what you’re saying, though.  I agree with you that we have to be clear about it.  We all have our viewpoints of where we’re headed. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there have been different terminologies used in the past, but ultimately agrees with the need for clarity.


Passage number 366.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 367.
 WILLIAMS.  Am I next. CHAIR YELLEN.  You are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "You are" is a simple acknowledgement or affirmation of Williams being next in line for something.


Passage number 368.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is not presenting any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 369.
 WILLIAMS.  Number 15.  All right.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First of all, I want to correct something in my response to Governor Tarullo’s question to me at the end of my remarks during the economic go-round, when I was talking about the composition effects.  He asked me if these papers are available.  They’ve actually been available for years on our website.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of clarification by Williams, correcting an error in his previous response.


Passage number 370.
 MR. TARULLO.  These are the same papers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement presenting information without any disagreement or contention. It is a simple statement of fact.


Passage number 371.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Without any specific context or passage provided, it is not possible to accurately determine the presence of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 372.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I do think we face a tricky communications problem at this meeting.  As I see it, we have four objectives.  First, we want to keep our options open in terms of what we do at the March meeting.  Second, we want to acknowledge the ongoing international financial market developments because they are noteworthy and do, if sustained, have significant implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy.  Third, we don’t want to show so much concern about the outlook that we exacerbate market participants’ fears about the global outlook, making the bad outcome more likely.  Language that showed great anxiety on our part might make households and businesses more skittish.  Fourth, we don’t want to create an impression that monetary policy will necessarily respond to short-term movements in financial asset prices.  In other words, there’s no “Fed put.”  At the same time, financial conditions do matter because they do affect the outlook for economic growth and inflation. My own view is that the risks to the outlook may have tilted slightly to the downside, but I think you can make the case that it is premature to reach that conclusion.  We just don’t know whether the tightening of financial market conditions will be sustained and what the effect will be on the economy’s performance.  To me, the alternative B formulation says that we’re mulling it over and we haven’t reached a firm conclusion yet.  March is still open as to whether we will or won’t raise the federal funds rate target.  It depends on the data, broadly defined.  And when I say “broadly defined,” I mean that it includes global and financial market developments.  So I think alternative B strikes the right balance. That said, I think the March meeting is going to be very consequential.  If we do tighten, it will tend to crystalize the idea that we’re doing four rate hikes this year, and it may contradict our saying we’re data dependent.  People may start to say, “Oh, they’re on a mechanical path of every quarter.”  Sitting here, not knowing where we’re going to be in March, I guess my inclination is that the bar to tightening in March is a little high.  I need to see a positive reason to tighten in March, as opposed to a strong reason not to tighten in March.  So the bar there is a little higher than it was before, because it will be quite consequential in terms of how markets would react to a March tightening.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Well, I think we’ve had a good round of discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses a different viewpoint from other participants, stating that they believe the risks to the economic outlook may have tilted slightly to the downside and that the bar for tightening in March is higher. They also express concern about the potential negative market reactions to a March tightening.


Passage number 373.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, Thomas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Laubach addresses Chair Yellen politely, and Chair Yellen acknowledges him.


Passage number 374.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Excuse me.  President George brought to my attention that, unfortunately, there is a tiny typo in alternative B.  In particular, in paragraph 2, the second line, if you’ll squint, you’ll see that the “s” in the word “adjustments” is struck.  I believe that is not intended.  So it should stay plural—“with gradual adjustments,” as opposed to “with gradual adjustment.”  I apologize for that mistake. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I hope, without objection, we can accept that change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply pointing out a typo and suggesting a correction. The response from Chair Yellen indicates an acceptance of the suggested change.


Passage number 375.
 MR. TARULLO.  Clearly, President George doesn’t have President Williams’s eye problems.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Keen eye.  Thank you for catching that. I think we’ve had a very good discussion, and all of us recognize that threading that needle today is difficult.  The outside commentary, I think, indicates they think we have a hard problem, and, although there are some qualms about the language in alternative B, I think I’ve heard broad-based support around the table for alternative B as written.  So I would like to ask Brian to get us ready for the vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a lighthearted moment followed by Chair Yellen expressing that she has heard broad-based support for the proposal.


Passage number 376.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Okay.  This vote will be on the statement for alternative B that appears on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s briefing materials, with the correction of the typo that was just noted.  It will also be on the directive to the Desk as it appears in the implementation note on pages 10 and 11 of those briefing materials. Chair Yellen  Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard  Yes President Bullard Yes Governor Fischer Yes President George Yes President Mester  Yes Governor Powell  Yes President Rosengren Yes Governor Tarullo  Yes CHAIR YELLEN.  Very good.  And I would note that, unlike at our December meeting, there’s no need for the Board to vote on actions pertaining to interest on excess reserves or the discount rate, as we’re leaving those unchanged. Let’s see.  I think at this point, we’re going to have a further discussion on fan charts.  But I think we could take a break for coffee for 20 minutes and reward ourselves for all that we have accomplished.  [Laughter] [Coffee break] CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Thanks, everybody.  There’s one last item on the agenda, and that pertains to the possibility of adding fan charts to the Summary of Economic Projections. Let me start off by again thanking the subcommittee on communications and the staff who worked with the subcommittee  We have had a number of discussions over the years about fan charts, and I’m pleased that the subcommittee has put forward what I think is a sensible proposal for moving forward.  Let me turn it over to Stan to begin our discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage consists of a list of individuals agreeing with a statement and a chair expressing gratitude. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 377.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The subcommittee on communications indicated last summer that we’d come back to this Committee with a proposal for the use of fan charts in the SEP after doing some work with the staff on possible approaches to the construction of the fan charts.  We’ve examined a number of options, and our memo to the Committee on January 11 provided a specific proposal for simple fan charts.  We do not claim that these fan charts are a critical advance, but we do think they offer a real improvement in our communications.  Todd Clark from Cleveland is going to provide the specifics of the proposal, but, before that, let me make a couple of points. First, in past Committee discussions of fan charts, there’s been a fair amount of support for the idea that they would be a useful addition to our communications.  They’d help to communicate that our projections are subject to considerable uncertainty and so help make it clear that policy will depend on incoming data and their implications for the economic outlook.  In addition, a comparison of the fan charts with the existing SEP chart showing the range of participants’ projections will help make it clear to the public that the differences in view across participants regarding the economic outlook are not that large relative to the uncertainty regarding the projections—information that should avoid the sense, which may arise from time to time, that Committee participants are in sharp disagreement. Second, in past discussions, a fair number of you have indicated either that you are not confident that the fan charts will be understood by the public or that you would prefer more sophisticated fan charts that could convey a more complex message to the public.  Well, these two sets of concerns point in opposite directions, of course, and our proposal is a compromise—that is to say, the more complicated it is, the less likely it is to be understood by the public, and you have to get somewhere on that spectrum. For those of you who are concerned that fan charts will not be well understood, we’ve aimed to keep the fan charts simple and based them on information that is, for the most part, already included in the SEP and so more likely to be comprehensible to the public.  I’d note that a table in the staff memos that you received showed that many advanced-economy central banks use fan charts, suggesting by revealed preference that they view them as a useful communication tool, which is something my conversations with foreign central bankers have confirmed. For those of you who’d like a more sophisticated approach, I’d urge you to take this first step.  At least for now, let’s keep the fan charts simple so that we’re confident that we can successfully explain them to the public.  Simple fan charts like those we’ve proposed are also low cost, which improves the cost-benefit calculation.  Among those costs is how much work the person looking at them has to do to understand them.  And, like all parts of our communications apparatus, they can be enhanced over time.  Indeed, the experience of the Bank of England, which has produced increasingly sophisticated fan charts, shows how such an incremental approach can work to deliver more informative fan charts over time.  In short, we should not let the best be the enemy of the good—our motto for the day.  [Laughter] Let me summarize by saying I was aware yesterday that I thanked the members of the subcommittee for all of the work they had done.  I also need to thank the staff associated with the subcommittee—which includes Todd, Bill English, Glenn Rudebusch, Stacey Tevlin, Ellen Meade, and probably others I’ve omitted—for the hard work they have done with regard to both the consensus statement and this work on fan charts.  Todd, would you please take over and provide the details.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily discusses the proposal for the use of fan charts and addresses concerns and considerations from different perspectives.


Passage number 378.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Your comment on press conferences adjusts my question a little bit.  We use the word “public,” but I can’t remember any of my public ever asking me about the SEPs per se.  Do we have any “click on” data as to how many people actually read the SEPs and therefore would see these fan charts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 379.
 MR. CLARK.  Do we track that.  I don’t know if we track that. CHAIR YELLEN.  I don’t know that we track it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The committee members, Mr. Clark and Chair Yellen, express uncertainty about whether a certain aspect is tracked or not.


Passage number 380.
 MR. LOCKHART.  In some of the Reserve Banks, we track what happens on our website.  I’m sure we must be doing something like that here.  Do we know how many people actually ever read this stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question and statement about tracking website activity.


Passage number 381.
 MR. WILCOX.  Of course, one purpose would be to use them at the press conference, so it wouldn’t just be through the website.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention in the passage. It simply states that one purpose of using them would be for the press conference in addition to the website.


Passage number 382.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Yes, and I acknowledge that. CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s why I mentioned it because, as you propose this, we’re talking about one additional figure that would be buried deep in the SEP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 383.
 MR. CLARK.  Right.  It would appear in the “Uncertainty and Risks” section.  It would be figure 4, following the first figure, which presents the median and the range of views; figure 2, on the funds rate; and figure 3, showing the histogram.  Figure 4 would be covered in the section on uncertainty and risks. CHAIR YELLEN.  Right.  That’s why I thought I would mention that if this change is adopted, we would modify the figure that I distribute at the press conference, which does get a lot of immediate attention.  At present, it shows the median, the range, and the central tendency.  We would include the fan charts in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 384.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I think that’s quite relevant.  That’s pushing information out.  This contrasts with just posting it and having someone click on it and read it.  But my question preceded your comment, really, in thinking about it.  Do we know who the public is for this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion and asking a question.


Passage number 385.
 MR. POTTER.  Certainly, people in markets look at this incredibly closely.  That’s one version of the public.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is simply stating that people in markets closely follow this aspect.


Passage number 386.
 MS. SMITH.  And the media.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "media" does not imply any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


Passage number 387.
 MR. EVANS.  Are you asking whether you can measure whether someone clicks on a figure.  Because the SEPs are in the minutes, right. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are simply clarifying a question and confirming an understanding.


Passage number 388.
  MR. EVANS.  Well, the minutes get downloaded all of the time.  Could you separate SEP views from the minutes generally. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thomas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans is seeking clarification from Chair Yellen about separating SEP views from the minutes, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflict between them.


Passage number 389.
 MR. LAUBACH.  The projection materials are, of course, published at the time of the press conference.  So for three weeks, the public will pick up, in particular, the dot plot from that place.  That’s where you’d find it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the projection materials being published and where the public can find them. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 390.
 MR. EVANS.  I get questions at every speech about the SEPs because I regularly try to inform people about the dot plot, just to share different perspectives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans mentions that he gets questions about the SEPs (Summary of Economic Projections) because he tries to inform people about the dot plot to share different perspectives. This indicates that he is open to sharing information and encouraging different viewpoints, rather than engaging in contention.


Passage number 391.
 MR. CLARK.  I don’t know about downloads, but in some of the public commentary, from the financial press and the economists, there is a tendency to focus on the range of views and confuse that with uncertainty.  To the extent that people pay attention to the fan charts, they would help clarify that this is the uncertainty—what you’re looking at is the range of views, and, in most cases, the disagreement in views is fairly small in relation to the uncertainty.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is explaining that while there may be a range of views on a topic, the actual disagreement among those views is relatively small compared to the overall uncertainty.


Passage number 392.
 MR. LOCKHART.  I’ll hold the reason why I’m asking until my comments in the go-round. CHAIR YELLEN.  Sure.  Are there other questions for Todd before we go to comments.  Okay.  Then let’s go to comments and start with President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lockhart states that he will explain later why he is asking a question, and Chair Yellen agrees and moves on to other questions and comments. There is a smooth transition without any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 393.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First, I want to thank Todd Clark, Bill English, and the rest of the staff supporting the communications subcommittee for their work on this topic.  In some sense, the simple approach to fan charts being proposed belies the great deal of effort and analysis that went into coming up with the proposal. I’m going to tip my hand:  I personally see a lot of value in the SEPs, and I think adding the fan charts will be a very useful enhancement.  We are somewhat behind other central banks. Most of them publish some type of fan chart.  And, in the interest of transparency, I think the FOMC should convey to the public that there’s considerable uncertainty associated with our projections, just as it is true that there’s considerable uncertainty associated with private-sector and other central bank forecasts.  To me, we’re living in uncertain times.  It seems like an important omission in the SEP not to include something about the uncertainty in an accessible way.  It would help the public avoid confusing dispersion in the SEP forecasts with the uncertainty surrounding the outlook.  Sometimes when I go out and talk, I know even I point to dispersion as a proxy for uncertainty, and it’s because we have little else to point to in the SEP.  But, of course, this is misleading because, as Todd and Governor Fischer pointed out, the dispersion is actually pretty modest compared with the uncertainty associated with the projections.  A subtler benefit, which was noted by Governor Fischer, is that, over discussions even in the Committee, one of the criticisms of the SEP in the past has been that it tends to emphasize the differences across participants rather than convey a sense of the consensus view.  If we show the relatively wide uncertainty bands, I think it will help put the dispersion into better context. Since last summer, the subcommittee and the staff have evaluated a number of approaches to fan charts.  Some of them were suggested to us by FOMC participants, and these included the subjective approach that Todd mentioned.  Going in, I had some sympathy for the subjective approach.  But as we worked through it, I became convinced that, at this time, the simple approach would be preferable.  We considered a number of different ways of thinking about the subjective approach, which would involve either participants providing their own confidence bands or, for participants who would feel uncomfortable doing that, having the staff map their qualitative assessments of risks and uncertainties that are already in the SEP into confidence bands using historical root mean squared errors.  But, in the end, we concluded that this would be somewhat complicated to explain to the public.  And if most responses ended up being based on historical root mean squared errors anyway, then the resulting fan charts would look very similar to the simple ones in the proposal. Going in—I’m coming clean here—I had some concerns about providing an error band surrounding the funds rate projection, because it would further blur the distinction that the funds rate projection is an assessment of appropriate policy and not a forecast.  On the other hand, the fan chart would be a very simple way to convey the message that there’s uncertainty associated with the appropriate policy rate path because the outlook is uncertain, and that the policy rate path in the SEP is not a commitment because it’s appropriate for policy to respond to shocks that materially change the outlook.  So I became convinced that the benefit of providing the confidence band surrounding that funds rate projection was real.  I also became convinced that we could handle, with appropriate wording in the exhibit and in the SEP text, the conceptual issue of the SEP reporting the appropriate, not necessarily the expected, policy rate path. Finally, no feasible approach to fan charts is perfect.  I think we have to keep in mind that the goal of this project is to better communicate with the public.  Currently, the SEP might be leading the public to underestimate both the degree of uncertainty associated with our projections and the data dependence of our policy rate path.  The proposed approach, while imperfect, would alleviate these problems in a way that would be simple to implement and simple to explain.  I support the proposal to add these fan charts to our next SEP submission in March, and I hope others on the Committee will, too.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses their personal opinion and explains their reasoning, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 394.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I know that a lot of work has preceded this recommendation, so thanks to Todd Clark, Bill English, and others, as well as the subcommittee for your good efforts. I realize that this is not a highly ambitious proposal.  In my mind, it’s one to use pictures to make an already made and simple point to an audience that largely already knows it.  I recently read the claim that more than half of brain activity is processing the visual, so maybe that’s just the reason to go ahead and do this.  Nonetheless, I remain a bit of a skeptic of this communication tool, and let me explain why.  I don’t see how presenting historical error bands derived from both internal and outside forecasts associated with our SEP medians provides useful additional information to our policy communication.  The message that there is substantial inherent uncertainty associated with our forecast is already conveyed in the minutes.  In a world where every FOMC move is scrutinized for profound meaning, there is some risk that the historical forecast accuracy bands will be construed as reflecting how the Committee is viewing the risks to the outlook as of the SEP publication.  And this, of course, isn’t the case. As proposed, the error bands will likely show a nonnegligible chance that the economy will be near or in recession within the time frame of the forecast period.  The error bands will always show a significant chance that inflation will persistently deviate from our 2 percent objective.  This could be interpreted as weak commitment to achieving our inflation target.  If economic growth or inflation was to seem to be on a path that is materially off the median projection path, we know that such a deviation would likely trigger a mitigating policy response. Now, I acknowledge that many of these concerns about interpretation of the error bands are treated in the proposed appendix.  A careful reading of the appendix should clarify what the fan charts say and what they don’t say.  But I’m not sure we should expect a careful reading of the appendix to inform the less familiar reader of the SEP, and the reader who understands the fan charts at first glance already knows what we’re trying to convey.  So I’m not sure I see how emphasizing the inherent uncertainty of economic forecasts, which is a very broad assertion, serves a clear purpose in our communications design.  It seems like a lot of effort to dissuade people from attaching any significance to our forecast. As I said, I know the addition of the fan charts is not intended or expected to be a major communications move, but I’m not sure I see the payoff as greater than the problems that might be caused.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses skepticism and disagreement with the proposal to add fan charts to the communication tool. He argues that the charts may be misinterpreted and cause problems in conveying the desired message.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 395.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks to Todd, Bill, and others for all of the work that went into this.  I’m also not enormously supportive of this proposal, although I do have sympathy with the underlying spirit of the proposal, which is to remind the public that any forecast is subject to very large uncertainty bands.  But I believe the text that accompanies the SEP already does that. It’s worth noting that people have made a lot of references to other central banks.  The other central banks that do present fan charts when they display their forecasts are generally using either consensus forecasts or staff forecasts.  They’re actual forecasts.  The SEP is quite different; it, obviously, is not a forecast.  It’s a scatterplot of individual member projections.  The median isn’t comparable to a consensus forecast.  I think there is important information content in seeing the range of differences among Committee participants and the median.  And most of the people who care deeply about the SEP put a lot of time and resources into understanding the nature of the information that’s being provided.  By contrast, as I think was said previously, it’s not obvious what additional information content superimposing errors from other forecasts provides. The discomfort is particularly acute with regard to the projected path of the policy rate, due both to the asymmetry associated with the effective lower bound and to the fact that this is a policy instrument over which the Committee has some control rather than an exogenous economic variable.  But I also have concerns even on some of the economic variables.  For instance, if I think about inflation right now and I just read some of the text in the most recent SEP surrounding members’ views about the distribution of uncertainty, I think it would be skewed to the downside, whereas these bands, as I understand it, would be, by construction, symmetric. Again, I do see the value of the underlying desire here to remind everybody how much uncertainty there is regarding our projections.  Perhaps we should spend a bit of time on subjective probabilities.  It does sound like a lot of work, but maybe before going in this direction, we should at least see further work on what that would look like, because it might be a better representation of additional information to provide to the public.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Ms. Brainard, expresses disagreement with the proposal but also acknowledges the value of reminding the public of the uncertainty in projections. She does not think that the proposed method, using fan charts, is the best way to provide additional information.


Passage number 396.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First of all, I also appreciate the work of the communications subcommittee and the staff on this subject, which I think is a complicated subject for the Committee. I do support the proposal as laid out by the communications subcommittee.  I consider it very important to represent uncertainty when we’re communicating to the public.  I agree with President Lockhart that maybe a picture is worth a thousand words.  I’m uncomfortable with either the staff here at this meeting or us communicating anything to the public without putting something around the median projection that shows the amount of uncertainty, because, in general, the public tends to underappreciate the amount of uncertainty associated with economic outlooks.  You can say in words that, okay, this is very uncertain.  They might add ½ percent and subtract ½ percent when they should be adding 6 percent and subtracting 6 percent.  So I think it’s very important to make moves in this direction.   Now, I understand that any construction of uncertainty bands will have some inconsistencies.  I think the subcommittee has taken an expedient approach here to get a first pass.  We could do more later, depending on our experience with it if we use it at the March meeting.  The Committee has done a good job of making the tradeoffs and thinking carefully about this. I do think it gets us closer to meeting an international standard on this dimension.  I agree that we don’t have a consensus forecast.  I would like to work toward that.  I’ve proposed that in the past for this Committee.  I understand that it’s a hard thing for us to do, but that shouldn’t preclude us from trying to represent the uncertainty about our projections.  So I think it’s an improvement. I also agree with Governor Brainard that maybe we should look at the possibility of a subjective probability in the future.  I’m not sure everyone will like it, because you do have to answer questions about upper and lower bounds and about what you think can happen.  That’s not the easiest thing to do, and it would make more work for all of us and all of our staffs.  But maybe that would be a truer representation within the SEP context of the uncertainty that’s surrounding those kinds of projections.  With that, I do support the proposal.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, expresses his support for the proposal and agrees with the need to represent uncertainty when communicating to the public. He also agrees with the idea of using subjective probability in the future. There is no mention of any disagreement with other committee members or staff.


Passage number 397.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I started off thinking I don’t have a strong opinion about the inclusion of fan charts in the SEP.  I guess the idea that they don’t do any harm would make them sort of okay.  I have to admit that Governor Brainard’s comments about the symmetry of the bands surrounding the projection is something I need to think carefully about.  If that were to get in the way of our commentary about how we see the balance of risks as skewed in one direction and if, all of a sudden, people get confused about our comments about the balance of risks compared with this fan chart, the visual, that would be a concern. I tended to think, coming in, that for the knowledgeable reader, the fan charts are a reasonable way of illustrating the uncertainties already presented in table 2 of the SEP, in which we give error bands.  And I agree with the recommendation to construct them using the median projections and the historical root mean squared errors for a range of public and private forecasts, as we already do in table 2.  Simple is best.  I certainly take that point.  But the thing that does make me nervous is a technical point.  There’s a difference between reporting error bands in the table and putting it in a chart where we’re giving a composite hypothesis–type of projection, and I think that can be misleading.  I have concerns that less knowledgeable readers may view any outcome that falls within the fan as being equally likely.  Now, I expressed that to my staff, and they made fun of me because any line is zero probability.  They’re all sort of the same.  But if you tried to construct some composite hypothesis and do some counting, the ones closest to the median would be higher likelihood than the ones farther apart.  But you look at the fan, and it seems as though they both had that interpretation. I would support conveying in some way that outcomes closer to the median are more likely than those toward the edges of the fan.  To the knowledgeable readers, that sounds silly, but to the ones whom I’m worried about, maybe not.  One way would be to note this in the explanatory text.  Another way would be to show multiple probability bands, as some other central banks do, using the same methods that you do.  I think this is manageable without any added work.  It would just be shading a little bit differently, with exactly the same calculations but 30 percent—whatever the choices would be.  Maybe that would help. Given our expected knowledgeable readership for this communications vehicle, I’m reasonably fine with the proposal, although, as I say, Governor Brainard’s comments about the risk assessment—or my interpretation of them—do make me a little nervous.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing personal opinions and concerns, but there is no clear disagreement or contention with the proposal being discussed.


Passage number 398.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you.  I support the proposed changes.  And I’ll just observe that, in my first meeting, I’m getting a sense of the complexity that the subcommittee on communications is dealing with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses support for the proposed changes and acknowledges the complexity of the subcommittee's task.


Passage number 399.
 MR. TARULLO.  You ain’t seen nothing yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain explicit contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Tarullo implying that there are more surprising or significant things to come.


Passage number 400.
  [Laughter] MR. KASHKARI.  But you have my great admiration, for, as you all are trying to balance the various tradeoffs, there are no easy answers.  I’ll just offer my observation with humility because I’m sure you’ve thought about these things before.  The only concern I have is that I can envision a time when we may want to use forward policy guidance and we do not want to show such wide ranges on the expected outlook for the federal funds rate, and this could then be constraining in such a scenario.  So I like Stan’s suggestion to start simple and maybe add complexity over time.  And if there was a way to embody the Committee’s actual outlook of uncertainty, that may be helpful so that we’re not constraining ourselves in the future. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It presents Mr. Kashkari's observation and suggestion, with Chair Yellen thanking him afterward. There is a mention of potential concerns and suggestions for improvement, but no explicit disagreement or contention.


Passage number 401.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I would like to add my support for the proposal.  The addition of fan charts would pictorially emphasize uncertainty regarding macroeconomic projections and hence for the path of the policy rate.  It would also show that the uncertainty associated with the forecast is much greater than the dispersion of participants’ views, which I think may be less well understood than some other things. I’m also pleased that the subcommittee has taken a minimalist approach here, keeping it simple and avoiding difficult methodological and communications issues that lurk if one tries to do too much.  So I do think that this approach is the most straightforward one to implement and the least likely to leave the public confused.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Powell expresses his support for the proposal and agrees with the approach taken by the subcommittee.


Passage number 402.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it is incomplete.


Passage number 403.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, support the proposal.  Actually, Governor Brainard laid out the challenges on this matter that we discussed at length.  As Todd and President Mester mentioned, we went back and forth on issues related to the various approaches that we could try to get at subjective assessments of the risks, those concerning the effective lower bound, and many of the other issues that have been brought up.  In the end, what we’re trying to accomplish here is something very simple, at least as a first step, and that is to get the point of data dependence out there as clearly as possible.  Basically, you look at the median in the SEP, and it says you raise rates n times during a certain period, and all of the attention in the media and the markets is on the number n.  The idea here is to say, “Yes, we think there’s an appropriate policy rate path, but that’s going to depend on what happens with economic growth, what happens with unemployment, and what happens with inflation.”  That’s what any good policy strategy would have, and the path of policy will depend on economic circumstances, either up or down.  That’s really all we’re accomplishing with this proposal, in my personal view. This issue of bringing in subjective views is really important because we do already have in the SEP a description of people’s assessment of the risks both in terms of the magnitude and in terms of the direction.  Here we basically are punting on that and saying this is only describing the normal historical relationship, and the SEP would still contain the discussion of whether the current circumstances are different from the past 20 years.  Now, I think the idea of trying to collect better subjective information or something that could be quantitative about the assessment of the magnitude and the direction of the risks is an important step forward. I do struggle with how to aggregate subjective views.  We got to the median as a way to capture the center of the participants, but then, when you look over the history of the SEP, you’ll see that there’s a wide divergence of views about both the magnitude and the direction of the risks relative to history.  It’s rare that we all—all 19, using David Wilcox’s number of views, or whatever number of views there are in this room—agree that the risks are to one side or the other or where they are.  I think how to say “Here’s a median forecast, and then here’s a median assessment of the risks” actually doesn’t work, because often it may be five or six people in the Committee who think the risks are to the downside.  So the median, of course, would be neutral. We do need to think about how to capture this information more effectively, and we couldn’t figure it out, at least so far.  This baby step, if you will, is to try to have both—the historical pattern of uncertainty along with the verbal description of the risks. In the end, I agree with President Bullard about the long-run goal I still hold to—maybe we’re the two left—that a consensus forecast and a way of representing the consensus views on the risks would be a great place to land at the end.  I know that’s been really hard in the past.  I know the staff cringes whenever I even say the term “consensus forecast.”  I can see Dave Reifschneider and David Wilcox not appreciating my perspective on this, but I do think the median forecast has already helped a bit to show that this may not be a terrible representation of the center of the Committee.  And I think maybe further work that we do in terms of describing the uncertainty will help us down the road toward what I think is the right ultimate goal, which is to have some way of representing quantitatively the views of the Committee.  But, again, I support this first baby step, at least, on that longer road.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It consists of the speaker expressing their support for a proposal and discussing their perspective on the issue at hand.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 404.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I certainly see some benefit of adding fan charts to the SEP as proposed.  The fan charts would emphasize that the SEP numbers just comprise a modal forecast, one of many possible outcomes.  The charts would also emphasize that at longer time horizons, the level of uncertainty is very high.  So I am willing to go along with this proposal.  That said, I do have some concerns that I want to share with the Committee.  The first one is, because the widths of the fan charts are based on historical experience and are unconditional, they’re not really very informative.  They don’t take into consideration where you actually are on the business cycle and in terms of all of the other factors that are influencing the outcome.  They’re also going to change very slowly over time.  Each quarter, you’re going to publish a fan chart that looks essentially just like the fan chart from the last quarter.  So they don’t really contain a lot of information beyond the first time you put them out. The second concern is that I’m a little bit less convinced than others about this difficulty of doing subjective histograms based on what people think about uncertainty, because we actually do this in our surveys of the primary dealers and the buy-side participants, and they seem able to construct these histograms.  I guess I find it a little odd that we’re asking others to construct histograms, but we say ourselves that we can’t do it.  If you were asked that question at the press conference, Madam Chair, I wonder how you would answer that. The third concern is what President Kashkari raised.  I think when we’re at the effective lower bound and issuing forward guidance with a commitment, I don’t know what the fan chart for the federal funds rate means in that context.  I think it’s very odd to have this wide fan chart for the federal funds rate when we’re actually saying something that contradicts that.  Another issue I have with the fan chart for the federal funds rate is, let’s say we’re at the lower bound, should the fan chart go below zero or not.  That’s actually pretty tricky.  If you think it should go below zero, you’re tacitly conceding that our target federal funds rate could go negative.  If you don’t put it below zero, you’re essentially tacitly communicating that negative interest rates aren’t on the table.  So I feel that where you draw that lower bound on the federal funds rate chart is not completely irrelevant in terms of how we communicate.  Obviously, in the appendix, you can explain why you’ve done it the way you’ve done it, but whether people will read the appendix and fully appreciate that is a question. In terms of the histograms, I feel much more strongly about the federal funds rate projections than those for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.  I think the biggest difficulties with these fan charts lie in the federal funds rate, as opposed to the real economic variables.  I also think the federal funds rate is more germane to us, because this is something we actually actively control.  So I guess I would like to see us try to do a dry run of histograms for the federal funds rate to see what they look like and how they compare with fan charts that were done on the root-mean-squared-error basis.  I’d just like to see what they looked like.  If they were better, then we could move to that approach, and if not, we could discard them. CHAIR YELLEN.  Would anybody else like to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses some concerns and disagreements with the proposal to add fan charts to the SEP. They question the usefulness and informativeness of the charts, express skepticism about the difficulty of constructing subjective histograms, raise concerns about the fan chart for the federal funds rate and its implications, and suggest trying alternate approaches.


Passage number 405.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange between Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 406.
 MR. LACKER.  I support the idea of fan charts.  I just want to talk about forward guidance and commitment.  I don’t think we’ve ever provided forward guidance with commitment.  We’ve been very careful to word our forward guidance as a prediction about what our future selves will do.  In that instance, I think a fan chart is perfectly appropriate.  In fact, the fan chart would provide a great way to signal when we do choose to provide forward guidance with commitment, because then we would omit the fan. CHAIR YELLEN.  Would anyone—Todd, Stan, or anyone on the subcommittee—like to comment further on the issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Lacker supports the idea of fan charts, but he disagrees with providing forward guidance with commitment. He believes that the forward guidance should be worded as a prediction about future actions instead of making a commitment. This disagreement is highlighted by his statement that a fan chart would be appropriate when there is no commitment, but it would be omitted when forward guidance with commitment is provided.


Passage number 407.
 MR. CLARK.  One intermediate approach could be to add the funds rate to the set of questions that the Committee is asked their subjective views on, but not quantify it.  You’re currently asked whether the risk is balanced, to the upside, or to the downside for economic growth and inflation.  We don’t ask about the funds rate, so adding the funds rate to that set of questions could be a vehicle for providing the fan chart as the historical stuff and still have this discussion of our subjective views.  When the two are out of line, we would say they’re out of line:  This is the Committee’s judgment, and this is the historical stuff.  So it could be an intermediate way of not requiring people to provide a probability distribution for the funds rate but still give us a subjective way of communicating, for example, forward guidance having implications or the lower bound having implications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing a potential approach for adding the funds rate to a set of questions the Committee is asked without quantifying it. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 408.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess I’d also be interested in seeing people’s subjective assessment of the federal funds rate path even if we didn’t actually share it with the public.  It’s useful information for the Committee, in my opinion. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the personal opinion of the speaker.


Passage number 409.
 MR. FISCHER.  Well, the comments are very interesting, and most of them are things we thought about in the course of trying to figure out what to recommend.  The staff that was working with us, and probably the whole staff, is incredibly inventive, and you can get charts that reflect bias or direction of the risk, downward or upward.  You could also ask people for their distributions using histograms, as Bill Dudley suggests.  I’ve also heard people say that it’s an illusion to think the dealers are filling in those forms; they have a staff who fills in the forms for them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses various ideas and suggestions regarding charts and forms.


Passage number 410.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It’s usually the desk economist who sits at the fixed-income trading desk who does those forms, typically.  Their backgrounds aren’t that dissimilar to our backgrounds. CHAIR YELLEN.  Some of our backgrounds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply providing information about who usually fills out certain forms and mentions that their backgrounds are similar. The response from Chair Yellen does not indicate disagreement or contention either.


Passage number 411.
 MR. FISCHER.  Some of our backgrounds.  But I do suggest that we go ahead with this, and that we really take into account the questions that have arisen and that we reflect.  We’ll come back to it in about six months’ time and ask you to fill in two other questionnaires:  One will ask you things about what we might want to put into the next one, and the other will ask about what comments you have on what we’ve done.  We’ll see if we can get better the next time we revise it, which would be somewhere down the road.  That’s the request I’d make. With regard to Dennis Lockhart’s question, how many hits this will get.  Well, I think once the Chair is talking about it, the answer is “It’s millions,” particularly if it’s the Chair’s press conferences and if the media wants to pick that up.  I exaggerate with “millions” probably, but it’ll get a lot of attention, and then we can seek to improve it. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 412.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Yes.  I was reflecting on Bill Dudley’s last comment and the reality that March is going to be a very complicated time for policy, regardless.  I wonder whether it might be possible to leave off the federal funds rate initially and give some further thought to it, because right now, you’ve made a pretty consequential decision to cut off the federal funds rate at the effective lower bound, so that’s an important message that we would be conveying to the market.  Maybe that’s what we want to do, but I wonder, if this is not essential for March, whether you might want to phase it and do your economic variables in March and give further thought to the federal funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply reflecting on a previous comment and offering a suggestion for further consideration.


Passage number 413.
 MR. CLARK.  If I can clarify something, the current chart for the current target of the funds rate is not actually cut off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage does not contain any statements or indications of contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact about the current chart for the current target of the funds rate.


Passage number 414.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Oh, I’m just looking at this picture.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they are looking at a picture.


Passage number 415.
 MR. CLARK.  It looks like it is, but it’s not—Bill can correct me if I’m wrong.  On the basis of the rise in rates in December and the future path with historical accuracy, we get very close to zero, but we are above zero.  And then the text, in the mad rush to get things out, didn’t get fully revised to go from the previous SEP to that SEP.  So it is really close to zero, and we describe in the text that we think we would impose zero.  But in that chart, we don’t actually have to impose zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply providing an explanation and clarifying some information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 416.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage does not provide enough context to determine the specific content of the disagreement or contention, but it suggests that there is some form of disagreement or contention involving Vice Chairman Dudley.


Passage number 417.
  But if the path came down, then— MR. CLARK.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a hypothetical situation.


Passage number 418.
  If the path came down again— MR. ENGLISH.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The phrase "If the path came down again" is a conditional statement that does not involve any disagreement or contention. It simply states a hypothetical situation without indicating any conflicting opinions or opposing arguments.


Passage number 419.
  If the Committee was to choose to not truncate and allow the bottom of that fan chart to go below zero— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It’s a consequential decision either way, though.  That’s the problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments. It acknowledges that choosing to truncate or not truncate the fan chart has consequences, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 420.
 MS. BRAINARD.  It’s consequential.  Do we really need to add that to the set of decisions. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think doing it in two phases is pretty difficult and hard to communicate.  So I do worry about introducing the first three, and then, at some later date, adding the federal funds rate.  But I think the issue of whether the band potentially goes below zero is important.  Did the subcommittee have a strong view that it should not go below zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Brainard expresses concern about adding the federal funds rate at a later date, while Chair Yellen expresses worry about potentially lowering the band below zero.


Passage number 421.
 MR. WILCOX.  Can I just make a clarifying point.  I think a literal interpretation of these bands is that, without any elaboration, they would imply that there’s a 15 percent probability that the funds rate could be open to that interpretation—a 15 percent probability that the funds rate could go above or below the band.  Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is asking for clarification and confirmation of a specific interpretation of a concept. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 422.
 MR. CLARK.  Yes, that is correct.  In the example sketched in the appendix to the memo, the SEP would have text saying, “We would choose to cut this off at zero.  The Committee has not previously set the target for the federal funds rate below zero,” and leave it at that.  Now, it would be possible to go further and address that point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining a possible approach or suggestion.


Passage number 423.
 MR. FISCHER.  You could add a sentence saying that, without any commitment either way as to whether, in the future, the FOMC might or might not go outside this range. CHAIR YELLEN.  And the FOMC has taken quantitative easing measures, which could be interpreted as essentially the response when it would call for a below-zero rate.  Presumably, you could clarify some of that in the verbal description in the appendix.  Governor Tarullo, do you want to say something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants are discussing a potential addition to a statement and how it could be clarified in the verbal description.


Passage number 424.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’m waiting to see which direction we’re headed here.  CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo is expressing uncertainty while waiting for more information, and Chair Yellen does not express any disagreement or contradict his statement.


Passage number 425.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes, I have just a thought on this.  The Committee has discussed the possibility of a negative policy rate during the past five years.  We kicked it around, there are pros and cons, but the Committee never came down and actually did that.  So I think that, at this point, you probably would cut it off, saying the Committee has not done that up to now.  We reserve the right, of course, to do that in the future. CHAIR YELLEN.  But, presumably, the text would indicate that this is a convention and has no significance in terms of the Committee’s policy options or intentions, that you’ve used a mechanical approach.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about the Committee's past considerations of a negative policy rate and the possibility of using it in the future. Both Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen agree on these points.


Passage number 426.
 MR. CLARK.  The other option, which I don’t think the Committee would want to do, would be to follow the approach of the central banks that publish policy rate fan charts.  Two of them, the Norges Bank and the Riksbank, just publish a fan that’s plus or minus root mean squared errors.  It goes below zero, and then, in the text, they say that this does not reflect asymmetries in the policy rate or constraints associated with the lower bound that we think may apply.  I don’t know if the Committee would desire that, but there is some precedent. CHAIR YELLEN.  Did you consider that approach.  Because that that might be a reasonable alternative.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are discussing and considering alternative options, but there is no conflict or disagreement between them.


Passage number 427.
 MR. KAPLAN.  I must admit listening to this, I am troubled about the federal funds rate, because I do think it is dramatically and completely different than forecasting exogenous factors.  Forecasting the federal funds rate is basically, what do I predict I might do, and all of you around this table will do, in reaction to exogenous factors.  My concern is, we’re in an extremely sensitive period here in the next three to six months.  I don’t want to gum up the works, but it certainly seems to me, the risk/reward of getting this wrong is definitely asymmetrical.  I would rather do a dry run, give the Committee a chance to look at sample charts on the federal funds rate in March, and have another bite at this.  I’m sensitive to all the work that’s been done and how difficult it is to get a consensus, but the risks associated with this strike me as so asymmetrical.  This is such a critical measure and one that we’re in control of.  I do think it is different than forecasting exogenous factors. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  President Bullard, go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kaplan shares his concerns and suggestions, and Chair Yellen responds by acknowledging his input.


Passage number 428.
 MR. BULLARD.  To respond to President Kaplan, sure, we control the funds rate, but we’re also reacting to the other data.  So if the other data come in in an extreme way, then you’re going to choose a different value for the funds rate.  This is representing that kind of uncertainty, which I thought was the point of this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is agreeing with President Kaplan's statement and further explaining the process of controlling the funds rate.


Passage number 429.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Except it’s different from every other factor because it’s a decision that we actually will make here.  Better yet, voters rotate.  You have a lot of other factors that we all, again, as a group are in control of.  It’s a different kind of factor to me.  I’m not saying it should be treated differently, but I’d want to make sure we had a conviction around the table before we did this. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kaplan is expressing his personal opinion and concerns about a decision, but he doesn't directly disagree with anyone or argue against a specific point.


Passage number 430.
 MR. FISCHER.  Rob, the forecasters are forecasting, and some of them—very few—forecast the federal funds rate.  But they forecast short-term rates that are very close to the federal funds rate, and they are aware of all of the factors you’ve mentioned—there’s rotation on this Committee, et cetera.  Yet they produce forecasts, and those forecasts will be the basis of the root mean squared errors that we use.  So I see that it’s different. As you were talking, I was reflecting on an obituary yesterday in the New York Times for a guy called Marvin Minsky, who was a computer-thinking founder who said he made the critical breakthrough when he persuaded his colleagues that human beings think like machines think, or that machines think like human beings think.  And here we are—we’re thinking in a particular way.  We’re predictable.  It might not look like it, but we are, and I don’t see what the huge difference is.  We react to the environment, we react to each other, and we’re probably fairly predictable, if we’re good at it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Fischer, is acknowledging that forecasters produce forecasts and that these forecasts are used as the basis for calculating root mean squared errors. He also reflects on the predictability of human behavior. The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 431.
 MR. KAPLAN.  I guess I’m responding to the fact that this was done by the subcommittee on communications, which means this is more about communication than anything else, and I’m coming at it from that point of view.  We may have conviction in this room, but as it is a PR communication issue, I think some good points have been raised.  To me, as we’re not under pressure to do this, I just want to make sure we’re comfortable.  This is a process point I’m raising.  You may be right and probably are, but I don’t want to create a self-inflicted wound, how’s that. CHAIR YELLEN.  I hear you.  Governor Tarullo, did you want to weigh in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any disagreement or contention. Mr. Kaplan is expressing his point of view and raising a process-related concern, but he is not arguing or contradicting anyone else's statements. Chair Yellen simply acknowledges and hears Mr. Kaplan's point before moving on to ask for Governor Tarullo's input.


Passage number 432.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’d like to associate myself with President Kaplan’s position. CHAIR YELLEN.  Does anybody else want to weigh in.  I think some good points have been raised that require a bit of thought.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Tarullo expresses agreement with President Kaplan's position, and Chair Yellen acknowledges the raised points that need further consideration. There is no indication of contention or disagreement among the speakers.


Passage number 433.
 MR. FISCHER.  Madam Chair, they’ve had a bit of thought.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, they have.  Well, I think what I’d like to do is take a straw poll and get a sense of where the Committee is.  We normally decide these matters by taking straw polls of all participants, and I’d like to get a sense of the overall view and the level of concern about this.  Perhaps rather than utterly decide every detail about how we’re going to go forward, after seeing what the straw vote looks like, we could sit down and talk again with the members of the subcommittee and the staff about whether there are some changes we can make in the approach, and, in particular, what I present in the press conference, which is going to be important, and we haven’t quite decided that.  Maybe some changes are appropriate or some thought needs to go into that.  But I’d like to take a straw poll.  Can I see how many people would like to go forward with implementing the approach that the subcommittee has recommended.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting taking a straw poll to gather the overall view and level of concern about a certain approach, and is open to making changes or considering different options based on the poll results.


Passage number 434.
  MR. TARULLO.  Madam Chair, I’m sorry.  Could you state what the other position will be. CHAIR YELLEN.  That you would not want to proceed with this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The second speaker is asking for clarification on the position being referred to by the first speaker.


Passage number 435.
 MR. TARULLO.  At this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Mr. Tarullo is speaking without any clear indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 436.
  MR. HARKER.  Yes, at this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Harker agrees or acknowledges something.


Passage number 437.
 MS. BRAINARD.  In March. CHAIR YELLEN.  At this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Ms. Brainard simply states a time, and Chair Yellen agrees with her without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 438.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Although I think it’s March versus potentially later, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It states a personal opinion about something without conflicting with any other viewpoint.


Passage number 439.
 MS. BRAINARD.  That’s right. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, maybe we should take that as a separate question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 440.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay. CHAIR YELLEN.  Why don’t we take the timing as separate question—whether we go forward in March, which is a consequential meeting, obviously, or we wait until a later time to move forward with this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about discussing the timing of a potential action.


Passage number 441.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Madam Chair, I think the issue that was raised was that there are some questions to wrestle with.  And I think some people prefer to wrestle with those questions and answer them definitively, with the presumption that they’ll probably move affirmatively, versus just deciding now to move forward in March.  That seems to be the real question.  I didn’t get a strong sense that people are opposed to this, but I think there are some questions that people feel they really want to make sure are answered correctly, versus just going ahead with this proposal in March.  Those do seem to be the two choices as I hear them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there are some questions to be addressed and states that some individuals prefer to definitively answer those questions before moving forward, while others are inclined to proceed in March. The speaker does not indicate any opposing viewpoints or conflicts between individuals.


Passage number 442.
 MR. EVANS.  I agree with Bill. CHAIR YELLEN.  You’re okay with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen express agreement with each other's statements.


Passage number 443.
 MR. KAPLAN.  I think it captures the discussion. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So let me, then, first ask, how many people would like to go ahead in March to implement the proposal the subcommittee has recommended.  At least one alternative, which I’ll next ask about, is, how many people are favorably inclined toward going ahead but feel we should wait until a later date and sort out some of the questions on how we would approach this.  So, first, how many people would like to simply go ahead in March as proposed.  [Show of hands]  Okay.  How many people are supportive of this approach in introducing fan charts but would like to wait to think through some of the questions that have been raised, such as, on the symmetry issue, should fan charts go below zero as well as should we necessarily include a funds rate fan chart.  I would think through, perhaps a little bit more carefully, exactly what I would present at the press conference, versus what would go into the SEP when it’s published in the minutes.  I’d like to see how many people would prefer to wait and think this through a bit more.  [Show of hands]  Okay. And then, finally, is there anybody who thinks that this is just a bad idea—that we should not add fan charts and be done with this.  Because we have considered this on many previous occasions.  I would really not be willing to ask the subcommittee, which has done a huge amount of work and thought through a lot of issues, to go back and try to formulate a totally new proposal.  Ironing out a few details is one thing I would be inclined to ask the subcommittee to do, but going back and considering a significantly different approach, I wouldn’t.  How many people would just like to can this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a discussion where different opinions are being gathered.


Passage number 444.
  [Show of hands] MR. LOCKHART.  I have to be consistent with what I said earlier, so I’ll put my finger up. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I guess I see a sufficient amount of discomfort with simply forging ahead with this in March to feel comfortable concluding that we should do that.  And I would suggest that we sit down and discuss the issues that have been raised and how we might address them, and then we can return with a revised proposal on how we’re going to do that. GOVERNOR FISCHER.  What did he put it up for. CHAIR YELLEN.  To can it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individuals are participating in a show of hands to indicate their agreement or disagreement with a proposal, and the chairperson suggests further discussion and revision of the proposal based on the level of discomfort expressed. There is no direct opposition or conflict expressed.


Passage number 445.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If I could just interject one final thing.  I think this issue about whether we’re potentially willing to entertain a negative federal funds rate is important to this discussion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any specific conflicting viewpoints or arguments. It simply refers to the importance of discussing whether negative federal funds rates are a possibility.


Passage number 446.
  In other words, you can’t do it just as a communication issue unless you actually know— MR. ROSENGREN.  The answer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers are stating the same point without contradicting each other.


Passage number 447.
  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  —what people think about that possibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a simple response to a statement, indicating amusement or agreement. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 448.
 MR. FISCHER.  Bill, I don’t think that’s true.  You can simply make a statement that there has been no decision on this issue, and they haven’t been used in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Fischer disagrees with the statement made by Bill and expresses his belief that it is not true.


Passage number 449.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But if the Committee felt that this is something that just was ruled off the table, that could inform what kind of fan chart one would want to show for the federal funds rate, versus if the Committee decided this is something that’s very definitely potentially on the table, that could inform a different decision on the fan charts.  That’s all I’m saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that the different decisions made by the Committee would inform the choice of fan charts.


Passage number 450.
 MR. FISCHER.  We can draw a chart that is under specified assumptions, which we will say do not represent a Committee decision. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, but you are proposing cutting it off at zero.  Your proposal that you have on the table is to cut it off at zero.  If we’re not going to do that, maybe we should think it through, come back to the Committee, and let them know how we would propose to handle it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are simply discussing and proposing different ideas and options.


Passage number 451.
 MR. FISCHER.  Well, I don’t want to continue this discussion, but the fact is, as David said, that we’re showing 70 percent confidence intervals.  And there is a 90 percent confidence interval that you could also draw, which would probably go below.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement describing the statistical confidence intervals being shown.


Passage number 452.
 MR. POTTER.  I don’t think there are parts of the band that are feasible when you do that.  It’s not feasible to get to minus 3 or minus 4, so that will be one issue.  There’s a mass point somewhere, and that would be the true lower bound, and you can’t go past there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining that certain parts of the band are not feasible and there is a limit to how far one can go.


Passage number 453.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Because of currency, you’re saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions currency without taking a stance or presenting conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 454.
 MR. POTTER.  Currency, or it’s not effective.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the topic of currency effectiveness without any conflicting opinions or opposing views.


Passage number 455.
 MR. LACKER.  Tangential. CHAIR YELLEN.  But wouldn’t showing it going below that feasible lower bound simply say that conditions could materialize that would—historically, starting from a different level of the funds rate—have prompted a very large response that would take the funds rate below a meaningful lower bound, wherever it is, and you’re illustrating that the Committee would have a number of options that could come into play.  It may not be feasible to take the funds rate to minus 2, but further QE or other things certainly are feasible.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 456.
 MS. MESTER.  I don’t want to belabor this, but one of the principles when we went into this and when we got to the proposal was the simplicity, right.  It was important that this be a simple thing.  I may be mischaracterizing it, but the reason we said we’ll truncate at zero is precisely because we didn’t want to signal anything about future policy decisions and we had a history that said we had never gone below zero.  We thought that we could easily say that in words, and that, the first time we showed the fan charts, those points could be said very simply and we could take all this into consideration that we’ve just gone through about the tradeoffs and how we have QE that might get us below zero.  The whole premise of this was, we need a simple way to communicate that there’s uncertainty regarding these forecasts, it’s bigger than the dispersion typically in the SEP, and our policy will be data dependent and respond to economic shocks to the economy.  So that was the thought process about exactly why we truncated at zero, saying, “Because we’ve never been below zero, we’re truncating this chart at zero.  Of course, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, we’re not—.”  That was kind of the thought process.  I just wanted to let you know the history of that. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, an approach might be to clarify that in the appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about the thought process behind a decision, with no conflicting opinions or arguments presented.


Passage number 457.
 MS. MESTER.  Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Mester's statement appears to be stating a fact or confirming something that was previously said.


Passage number 458.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, that might be a simple solution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there does not appear to be contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement suggests that the proposed solution is simple.


Passage number 459.
 MS. MESTER.  Right.  When you talk at the press conference, presumably the first time you show these, you’re going to want to have some words associated with them, because, unfortunately, the chart that you currently show at the press conference looks like a fan chart even though it’s dispersion.  And so you’re going to want to have some words associated with that, and in those words you can say this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement regarding the need for words to be associated with a chart.


Passage number 460.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Disagreement versus uncertainty. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Would it be acceptable to the subcommittee to think through some of this, respond to some of these comments, and come back to the Committee.  It may just be a matter of clarifying some of the language in the appendix or perhaps waiting until June to go forward with this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is suggesting taking some time to think through and clarify certain aspects before moving forward, but there is no evident disagreement or contention.


Passage number 461.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes, I think it would be.  We’ll find a subcommittee that will deal with it.
