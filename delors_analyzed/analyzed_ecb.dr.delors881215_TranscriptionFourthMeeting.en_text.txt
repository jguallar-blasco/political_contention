****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 1.
“~™  COMMITTEE FOR THE STUDY OF 15th December 1988 ECONOMIC AND MONETARY UNION  Meeting on 13th December 1988 (BIS, Room E)  Mr. E. Hoffmeyer (First tape 857 - 899)  There for the first time the word of subsidiarity appears on  p.- 5, the second to last indent, the last word. Of course, I understand  e your argument that you are using the. principle of least resistance and that the requirements for the monetary system are rather strong, rather high.  You put very strong demands on that, whereas on the fiscal side you  introduce this principle of subsidiarity which means that you let the Heads  of State get along with the impression that this can be managed in one way  or another, whereas in the monetary field you have very strict rules. I  think that it should be explained in a little more detail. Secondly, I  think that when you then come to the conclusions, i.e. on p. 10 and the conclusions regarding fiscal policy on p. 14, we have to specify exactly  , what the requirements in the monetary field and in the fiscal field are. In the monetary field there are three requirements: firstly, according to what  is described here, we have to have one currency, that means you have to  © abolish national currencies$ secondly, you have to have one central bank, this means that you have to change all the national laws on central banks;  and thirdly, you have to have decisions by majority. These are very strong  requests on the various countries. When you look at what you really imply  under the second field, i.e. fiscal policy, it is also very far-reaching  because you have five points that I have found in the text. Firstly, you  have to have a system for rules and budgetary policy, i.e. you have to have  . Lines on the amount of deficit, we have to have this system, but more’ than  that you have, secondly, to harmonise the welfare system and that is a very far-reaching thing, because that means, for instance, that unemployment,  relief, etc. should be harmonised between countries. Thirdly, you have to  harmonise the tax system - that is also here in the report. Fourthly, you  -2-  have to harmonise the wage policy - that is also said here. Fifthly, you have to have a system of transfers. I think that even though you don't propose a formal system under this second point, you have to be very clear in the conclusions, you have to formulate these conclusions in five points, because this is very far-reaching and I don't think that when you mention it in various places in the text, when you summarise it to put it before the Heads of State how far-reaching these demands are. It is for clarification, because politicians often only read summaries. You have to  be very clear about what the demands are. Prof. N.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning the use of the principle of subsidiarity in fiscal policy compared to the strict rules in the monetary field. They argue that there needs to be more detail and clarity on the requirements for both fields.


Passage number 2.
 Thygesen (1117 - 1138)  Mr. President, contrary to two people who have already spoken, I am happy with the balance of the report. Indeed, my main concern with it is that it makes the demands on other policies too stringent, rather more stringent than I think they are. I think there are three reasons why there has to be a certain imbalance between the monetary and economic parts of our report. Firstly, a principle of subsidiarity itself. In the monetary area, given some of the decisions that have already been taken, a degree of financial integration that we can foresee, a high degree of centralisation of decision-making is required to make for efficient policies. There are some arguments in favour of that centralisation, which do not apply to a Similar degree to the fiscal area where both welfare considerations and allocative concerns dictate a much higher degree of national sovereign decision-making. So there is certainly a clear difference in degree between the different kinds of policies. The second reason is a simple one that this 1s a Committee, Governor Doyle referred to that, largely of central bankers and it would be strange if it did not emphasise primarily the area in which it has expertise. The third reason is, and that was touched upon by our President, that economic union is not in itself a very well defined concept, unless you begin to discuss it in the context of monetary union, then some things begin to emerge - the accompanying policies, requirements on other policies. For those three reasons I think there has to be a certain imbalance in the report and that discussion of the monetary union  has to come before the economic union. I join Prof. Lamfalussy on that  point.  -3- M. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their satisfaction with the balance of the report and is providing reasons for why there may be an imbalance between the monetary and economic parts. The speaker also agrees with Prof. Lamfalussy on the order in which the discussion of monetary union and economic union should occur.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 3.
 de Larosiére (1287 - 1300)  Mr. Chairman, to go along with Gov. Doyle, it seems to me that at the end of p. 5 we might add the following: "For the economic and monetary union form two integral parts of a single whole". I suppose Mr. Doyle will accept that. You could add: “it is for reasons of expositional clarity that in the following sections the distinction is drawn between them and that the first section is devoted to monetary union". But I would even go as far as adding - but the intertwining of these two concepts is so narrow that we we will have to be very precise in the rest of the report on the way to interlock parallel progress on those two matters, because if we do not do  it the monetary union alone would break down. ... Mr. M.F.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests adding additional wording to clarify the relationship between economic and monetary union, but also notes that if not done accurately, the monetary union alone could fail. This indicates that there is a disagreement or concern about how to approach and prioritize the two concepts.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 4.
 Doyle (1301 - 1302)  Mr. Chairman, I had underlined the word “only'" in the last sentence and put a question mark against it because that was what was  bothering me. M. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Chairman, expresses disagreement or doubt regarding the usage of the word "only" in the last sentence. They highlight this by underlining the word and placing a question mark against it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 5.
 de Larosiére (1305 - 1318) (Interpretation)  Here Mr. Chairman I have a question on p. 6. We read at the beginning of the page: "A monetary union describes a single currency area, 1.e@. an area in which one money serves as a means of payment, unit of account and store of value ...''. I wonder whether it would not also be true to say that a monetary union may allow for the coexistence of several national currencies whose relative parity values would be fixed and interconnected. It seems to me in other words that here, when thinking about the ultimate stage of monetary union, one over-emphasises this idea of the single currency, whereas it seems to me that even if one has several  currencies closely interlinked one would have almost all the . components  of such a union. I have a little difficulty with this one-money concept. M. A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker is questioning and suggesting an alternative perspective on the concept of a monetary union. They argue that a monetary union could still exist even if multiple national currencies are used, as long as their values are fixed and interconnected. They express disagreement with the idea of a single currency being the defining characteristic of a monetary union.


Passage number 6.
 Lamfalussy (1324 - 1336) (Interpretation)  Yes, I would like to emphasise this too. What is very interesting  in this part is that it clearly shows that monetary union is not a finite  - 4-  whole, which once you have reached it no further progress is possible. In the first para. one ought to give this idea. In the ultimate stage of monetary union, of course, you are going to have a single money, but one should also indicate that one first has to go through a preliminary door, and this is represented by interlocking of the currencies and then further progress can be made and part of this section does describe the need for further progression, it is just a matter of presentation. No, it is not only a matter of presentation, but it means that you can deal with this concept of single money separately and that is very important. One might  perhaps add the word "ultimately" - ultimately one money.  Dr. W.F.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct contention or disagreement. It is primarily discussing the concept of monetary union and the progression towards a single currency. The speaker is providing their own interpretation and perspective on the topic, but there is no explicit disagreement or conflicting viewpoints present.


Passage number 7.
 Duisenberg (1350 - 1371)  I have really the same point as M. de Larosiére and therefore I think that this para. is a little bit too one-sided. Monetary union means I think two things: irrevocably locked exchange rates and one monetary policy. Those are the two elements. Irrevocably locked exchange rates can mean the transition to one currency, but it is not necessary, so it is a technical appearance and I think that has to be made clear, because the draft as it is now represents the introduction of one currency as_ an essential element and I don't think it is essential. Deriving from that it is a plea to already introduce a common currency, so to say to gain experience and to get used to it, and therefore if you say from the outset that it is not essential then you can also not place the emphasis on the necessity of introducing one currency. It may be thought by some advisable to do so, but it is not technically necessary. I think it is much more realistic to place more emphasis on increased policy co-ordination, intensified policy co-ordination, firstly, maybe by consensus’ and ultimately by decisions actually being taken, perhaps by majority decisions, But that is much more important, it seems to me, than what I  regard as the gimmick to move to one currency in an early stage. M. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker agrees with M. de Larosiére's view that monetary union means irrevocably locked exchange rates and one monetary policy. However, the speaker disagrees with the draft which emphasizes the introduction of one currency as an essential element of monetary union. They argue that one currency is not technically necessary and that policy coordination is more important.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 8.
 de Larosiére (1394 - 1405) (Interpretation) I rather agree with M. Boyer. We have to put the three Werner  points to the top and then indicate that common policy will follow, because  you cannot achieve these things without a common policy. The wording at the  end of p. 6: "The essential macro-economic measures laying the foundations of a single currency ..."' is not very good because it is very much more than laying the foundations - it already is monetary union. If you agree we could start by giving these three points of the Werner definition and then have this more flexible form of wording as to the possibility of ultimately reaching the single money. There will be other things that will have to be corrected, e.g. in p. 6: “Secondly, it requires the introduction of the policy which will eventually replace national currencies." This will have to be rephrased more conditionally in order to reflect what has emerged in  this discussion here. M. A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker disagrees with the wording on page 6 and suggests a more flexible form of wording. They also disagree with the wording on page 6 regarding the introduction of a policy to replace national currencies, suggesting it should be rephrased more conditionally.


Passage number 9.
 Lamfalussy (1405 - 1409) (Interpretation)  A single money is indispensable only if the interlocking of the exchange rates is not credible and one can say that this will not _ be entirely credible politically if there is no single money. But that comes  later. The Chairman (Second tape 000 - 31) (Interpretation)  From this morning's discussion I conclude that what we have at the top of p. 7 might be used as a wide definition of monetary union, that we shall attach more conditionality to this idea of single money. I would like us to say a word about the other two important points - apart from any other points you may have - one monetary policy and one exchange rate  policy, the two major points in this chapter. Mr. M.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The Chairman is summarizing the discussion and suggesting that they should focus on the two important points of monetary policy and exchange rate policy.


Passage number 10.
 Boyer (280 - 327) (Interpretation)  Firstly, an editorial remark: “the result that the Community as a whole will be much less open'’. Here one runs the risk of giving the impression of the Community moving in such a direction as to establish fortress Europe and closing in on itself. I would suggest that we eliminate these words. Let us say simply that the Community will be less sensitive to outside financial shocks - it is just a matter of wording. A change in relations with the outside world is not a fact that one is more closed  within oneself. Then the other remark about the advantages and drawbacks.  -~6-  One ought to put this at the beginning, but after having given the definition- give the definition first, consequences for monetary policy and then advantages and drawbacks. As far as those are concerned, I think one might simply go back to literature, there is quite a lot that has' been written about the pros andcons - in the report of Mr. Gros and Mr. Thygesen a great deal is said about the advantages and drawbacks. There is a decrease in uncertainties, a decrease in the cost of transactions, probably lower interest rates in each of our countries than if there were exchange risks. Then, and it is here that we get back to the single market, the competitive devaluations are eliminated, as a pre-condition in order to accept the rules of the game governing the single market. If you are going to go in for competitive devaluations then the single act won't work and then there is always more and more of a’ feeling of rejection against the inflationary model of devaluation. It is something that one agrees can be rejected. Those are the advantages. As for the drawbacks there is a problem of symmetry - I don't know whether we want to refer to it or not, perhaps, not in order not to complicate matters. This is a serious problem. The system is not in balance just now, but I am not going to belabour this point. The main drawback is the one that you find here. You do away with exchange rates which are an instrument for bringing back equilibrium. This  would come after the definition and the advantages and drawbacks. M. A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely making editorial suggestions and discussing the advantages and drawbacks of a certain topic.


Passage number 11.
 Lamfalussy (492 - 510) (Interpretation)  Perhaps I can try and explain what is meant here, or we could ask the rapporteurs. I read it as follows: monetary union, then there may be differences emerging between the regions for all kinds of reasons - structural, demographic reasons, etc. When you have balance-of-payments statistics which are kept regularly, you have two different currencies, you have the possibility of fluctuation, then these basic differences have a visible impact on statistics and on exchange rates and are therefore very fast indicators of an incipient disequilibrium. If on the other hand, you have a situation with a single money, where the balances of payments are calculated, or rather guessed at, a year or two after the event, as an indicator of disequilibrium you only have unemployment or the gradual grinding to a halt of economic activity in a region and it is a much slower  indicator.  M. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the potential differences and impacts between regions in a monetary union versus a single currency situation. They are presenting an interpretation and explaining their perspective on the matter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 12.
 de Larosiére (535 - 559) (Interpretation)  We can say that what disappears is the immediate constraint imposed by the exchange markets. But we also have to go into this matter of Statistics in some depth. Contrary to Mr. Boyer, I doubt very much that you can record all transactions when they cross a border, because one is trying after all to cut through red tape and to do away with so much recording, and if you are going to do it again for statistical reasons, where is the advantage. Then, of course, you can reach a ridiculous level that has been reached in Belgium, where the Flemish and the Walloons are still arguing about their relative position as to the balance of payments. Nobody really knows - not even the Governor. The margin of uncertainty is so great as between Belgium and Luxembourg - no even worse between the Flemish and the Walloons. What about the United States. The argument about the two deficits may also one day concern one of the countries of the Community. To what extent would have that have an impact on the external position of the Community, etc. It will have an impact on the economic policy of the Community and we will have to talk about the trade deficit, etc. one cannot ignore all of these things. I don't think that it will be possible to do  away with a discussion on balance of payments. Mr. E.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker opposes Mr. Boyer's argument and doubts that all transactions can be recorded for statistical purposes. They also mention the ongoing argument between the Flemish and the Walloons about their balance of payments, suggesting a contentious issue.


Passage number 13.
 Hoffmeyer (610 - 619)  May I repeat on the summary question: could one follow the same presentation as on p. 7 where you have the Werner Report in three indents, Saying: what is the summary, the summary is either locked exchange rates or one currency - that is one point. The second point is that we have to have one central bank, this means that we have to change the central bank acts of the various countries. The third point is that you have to have this decision-making procedure, probably by a majority. These three conclusions,  I think should stand out explicitly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking if they can repeat a summary question and then stating their own opinion on the matter.


Passage number 14.
 The Chairman (647 - 692) (Interpretation) Can we move on to economic union, the subject of all our  concerns. What is the structure. Firstly, mention of the single market,  dismounting of barriers, setting-up of a minimum of harmonisation and - 8 -  implementation of a European policy in respect of competition; secondly, one can no longer use exchange rate adjustments in order to offset disequilibria and then one moves onto what will have to be discussed in depth this afternoon - other economic measures. It is that which will have to be discussed. Firstly, co-ordination between fiscal policies. In theory the problem is well-known - what constraints, what consistency between budgetary guidelines and monetary guidelines, the system for financial transfers - we haven't gone very far there yet. I said earlier on what the package approved by the Community amounted to, but is that enough. It is not only a matter of financial transfers, but it is also a matter of how the resources are going to be used. Finally, the authors of the report thought, without perhaps being clear enough, that a European fiscal framework was necessary. Personally I translate this as follows: the major structures of compulsory withholding taxes of various kinds will have to be very similar in our various countries. If you look at tax levied on private income, corporate tax on wages and salaries, it will be very difficult to have an economic union if the differences are too great between our various countries, as at present. Hence, the Community authorities tried to come up with - not a uniform system - but a framework and the Community budget would then play the role of an instrument which would encourage or control. This will hopefully produce some answers to what was said at the beginning, namely that the economic union had to be described in as much detail as the monetary union. Mr. Thygesen said that we have invested a lot of work already in monetary union, there are vast volumes that deal with this, but we have very little about economic union, just a reminder of certain historical experiences - custom union, Zollverein - but those were very different in nature from what is being attempted here and aimed at very different objectives from those which have been defined in connection with ‘the Single Act. This is something entirely new and different from the  historical precedence. Mr. M.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It discusses various aspects of economic union and the need for coordination and harmonization, but there is no clear conflict between different perspectives or ideas presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 15.
 Boyer (755 - 819) (Interpretation)  I think the problem of economic union cannot be tackled by examining all the aspects of the economic policy of a country or a group of countries, because we would lose our way. The most practical way of  tackling this is to say, what are the instruments which should be used at  -9-  the Community level and what are the instruments that can be used by the individual countries themselves. Countries with a discipline of more fixed exchange rates, I think that what can be done by the individual countries will be to handle very classical, conventional instruments of supply policy, their markets will have to become more flexible, they ought to be able to organise their expenses and their tax systems, taking into account the movement of labour and other resources in order to give incentives for Saving, etc. Do you add the possibility that each country may still have a free hand in developing its territory, its land. That is very important, well yes it is not so important for us to recall the classical factors of development in each country, but there continue to be certain things that will fall to the countries and what we have to do inthe report is to indicate what can be done at the Community level, since one will have given up the exchange rates. What will one be able to do at the Community level, in order to eliminate or reduce the differences between member countries. Monetary policy is eliminated, what is left is fiscal policy or the constraints will come from monetary aspects. I think that a central bank system will find it very difficult to give up the capability of saying the maximum deficit a country can accept is so much and for financing the deficit we will take this or that form. One will have to fix some limits to the deficit and to its funding, this being said there may be efforts at harmonisation. There the British position, which says let us do this not by agreeing on an initial compromise but let us let things move and let us see how these things will develop. Except for the harmonisation of tax levied on capital profits, the exchange rate discipline will apply considerable constraint on certain fiscal elements. A deficit must be fixed, its funding and what is left to the Community. Regional policy and the implementation of the 1992 package to the elimination of the movement of persons’ and capital, one accepts that this movement will take place and one wishes to facilitate it and what is left after that. Only regional policy. The whole of the economic policy that can be talked about at the end will be the Community's regional policy - we haven't discussed this because we need reports, documentation. Governor Doyle has given us a first report, ... additional report. The subject is very difficult. Funds will be limited in view of the -fact that there is growing reticence to pay tax in various countries. There will be even less enthusiasm if the tax collected will go  to a neighbouring country and one will have to find certain ideas as to how - 10 -  best to use limited funds in order to encourage growth. I don't think there is very much more to be said. There is monetary policy, you do without it. There is fiscal policy full of constraints, the only thing that is left is regional policy and there one will have to give a few ideas but they aren't  sO numerous. M. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the problem of economic union cannot be solved by examining all aspects of economic policy, but instead should focus on what can be done at the Community level and what can be done by individual countries. However, the speaker mentions the British position of allowing things to develop without agreeing on an initial compromise. This implies a different approach to tackling the problem of economic union.


Passage number 16.
 de Larosiére (1012 - 1034) (Interpretation)  A few ideas come to mind after this very interesting discussion. First idea: quite apart from structural problems, the economic and monetary union must not be subject to abuse or misuse, I should not imagine that this or that country may derive any undue advantages by abusing the others, for instance, applying no fiscal controls at all in order to get its citizens to benefit from better organised policies pursued elsewhere. It seems to me that the greatest protection against this happening will be guidelines in respect of fiscal policy. Then you have a_ second set of problems, these are the structural problems. One has to explain that if one removes the exchange rate instrument, those countries which structural difficulties, where productivity is less, if they are deprived of the exchange rate instrument this will mean additional problems for them. One has to explain why this is so, it is not very easy to explain this. Then one will have to explain that an appropriate long-term structural policy  might help, perhaps, allowing a longer period of transition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 17.
 The Chairman (1034 - 1044) (Interpretation)  That is good, that makes for clarification. It is very much in line with what others have said. As President Pohl said, in respect of Part III we shall have to be less technical and clearer and emphasise the basic ideas - the principle of subsidiarity, the fact that monetary union must certainly not benefit the least stringent, you need rules, and thirdly, there are countries with structural weaknesses and the _ single market enhances the risk of disequilibrium and you must combat this by  means of appropriate policies. These are, perhaps, the three basic ideas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is mainly discussing the need for clarification and emphasizing certain principles and ideas.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 18.
 - 1] - The Chairman (1093 - 1115) (Interpretation)  We haven't. For the time being a subject to an indepth discussion as to the regional policies, by that we refer to everything that can be done at the Community level over and above efforts undertaken by the various countries in order to improve the infrastructure. If we don't discuss this now we will have to discuss this in January or February. As a key. idea we retain in order to simplify the text here, after all you have said that this skeleton is too technical and the strong points, the basic ideas must appear more clearly. For this chapter I would suggest the following major ideas. Firstly, some countries will not be able to use the exchange rate instruments to correct disequilibria, therefore a certain discipline must be imposed on them in order to prevent them from relaxing their policies and then one must given them the means to improve their economic performance. This would be the basic thrust and then we will add information, once we will have had time to think about regional policy instruments. Nevertheless, the secretaries have posed another problem, for instance, the possibility of having a European Fiscal Framework. President Pohl is still with us and I would like to make the most of this and move on to institutional aspects and should we have a Treaty or not, i.e. p. 14  onwards. Herrn K.O.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be seen in the phrase "some countries will not be able to use exchange rate instruments to correct disequilibria, therefore a certain discipline must be imposed on them" suggesting a disagreement on how to handle countries that cannot use exchange rate instruments.


This passage was too long for model to process: Passsage number19
  In order to avoid misunderstandings, I want to explain a little more.  Firstly, I fully agree with what has been said.  I think any European central bank system has to be included ina framework, as has been said here in this skeleton, and I have no objections to using that as an introduction, that one has to see the European monetary institution as part of the European decision-making process, there is no doubt about that.  As far as the Bundesbank law is concerned, Robin, it says that the Bundesbank has to support the economic policy of the Government as long as this does not conflict with its prior responsibility to safeguard the currency.  The formulation is very vague.  What I think we should avoid is to begin a discussion of all the details of a European central bank system.  I think that has to be left to official inter-governmental negotiations, because  that has to be a legal, binding Treaty and we can make recommendations,  - 12 -  suggestions, and I am fully prepared if you want to go into more detail, point by point, I am open to that.  But at this stage, and taking into account the political situation and several statements made by Prime Ministers, etc. , I think it would be more realistic to say, if you want to have an economic and monetary union you have to be aware that that needs a certain legal and institutional framework.  For economic union you have made this proposal for an economic policy centre, and I have not referred to that; as far as monetary union is concerned, you need the framework for a European central bank system.  We cannot draft all the details of such a statute, but if you want to ask a group of experts to negotiate a_ statute for a European central bank system, and this is our recommendation to you, it should be done on the following lines.  It should include the following features.  That 1s my suggestion, if you think it is more advisable for all the reasons you mentioned to go more into detail, I am fully prepared to discuss that, but then we have to discuss it point by point and we will easily, very soon, reach a point where we recognise that we have very different conceptions on how such an institution should be organised, to whom it should report.  For instance, if you say it should report to the Council of Ministers, I would never propose that, I would never’ subscribe to such a recommendation because it is not consistent with our basic philosophy in this area.  I would have less problems if you could agree to say this institution should report to a committee of the European Parliament, for instance, something like the Federal Reserve System where the Chairman of the Fed has to report to Congress.  In Germany I don't have to report either to the Government or to the Parliament, in other countries it is different.  So that is a very very difficult question.  Another question is, for instance, where should the seat of that institution be - should it be in London, Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg or where.  We don't have to answer that question, we can’t answer it, we don't have to answer it fortunately.  It is a political decision.  If we tell the Heads of State and governments, look, if you want the monetary union you will reach a point, and maybe you will reach it earlier than most people expected, where the exchange rates are rather inflexible maybe even locked, § even irrevocably locked, and when you have that you need a central bank system  and if you want a central bank system you have to answer this kind of  question.  I don't think we have to say more.   -~ 13 - Mr.  W.  Duisenberg (1423 -1450)  I feel very attracted by this list of guiding principles as I see it, which should govern an eventual central bank or Federal central banking law.  I work under a law which was proposed by a government and approved by parliament and not by the then also existing central bank, but of course the then existing central bank had some advisory role to play in it - that is maybe also our role.  Ultimately, I have no illusion that the outcome, if there is an outcome, will be the outcome of negotiations between governments and approved in the present structure by national parliaments in Europe.  That is one thing.  On a few of the items here I would also need more time to study it.  If I may make three comments.  The fourth line, "a commitment to regulate the amount of money in circulation and of credit", that is the major goal for the central bank, as said here.  In my bank law it says a commitment to stabilise the value of money and the value of money is both internal - price stability - and external - the exchange rate.  Instruments to do that are regulating the amount of money that comes under the heading “instruments to achieve that goal".  But the first goal, and this is also in the skeleton report, is price stability or more generally speaking the value of money: internally price stability, externally the exchange rate.  Then there are various instruments to use.  One instrument is not mentioned here and one could think of including that, that is the legal ownership and the task to manage the foreign currency reserves, or the foreign exchange reserves, of the Community - that is one thing one might want to add to leave no ambiguity there.  My second point, which I would also want to add in this list of guiding principles, is that this federation of central banks or central bank should be charged with banking supervision at the Community level - that is one thing I would like to add.  The last line ~ the seat of the institution - I would be inclined to say  "comma Amsterdam" . . . . _ _ Mr.  E.

 Hoffmeyer (1451 - 1457)  I could agree on this, because I think it is much better than the skeleton report which I think is much too detailed. I think one should express very clearly that there are political decisions that have to be  taken under these issues and then one could presume or mention that it  - 14 -  would be natural for the Committee of Governors to be asked to fill out the  basic political decisions that might be taken by the Heads of State. Herrn K.O.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their opinion and stating their preference for a less detailed report.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 21.
 Pohl (1469 - 1484)  May I respond to that for a minute because that is such an important point. What I am saying, Jacques, is only that I myself will not recommend to the Council such a proposition. If there would be a political decision, I have to follow it, that is the only thing. I am not saying that you cannot envisage a European central bank system which has to report to the Council of Ministers} you can envisage a European central bank system which would be guided by the Council of Ministers - I wouldn't like it, but it can be envisaged. But this is not our decision, we cannot take that decision, we can make recommendations and I would not recommend it. I would Say it. should be independent. Frankly speaking I thought this list would be more acceptable to the group than the other one, because the other one looks very much like the Bundesbank law with this Council (... That is why I immediately said I preferred your version ...). What you said, Wim, on price stability, they said on p. 15 the "mandate of the system must be to maintain the stability of money as the prime objective of the Community's monetary policy". I like that language but it sounds very tutonic so I thought that I would make it a little more acceptable to the rest of the group. (... I would need non-inflationary growth, here ...) Maybe we should  make it a little more stability oriented. Mr. W.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. This is evident from phrases such as "I wouldn't like it," "I would not recommend it," and "Maybe we should make it a little more stability oriented." These statements indicate differing opinions and possible disagreement among the speakers.


Passage number 22.
 Duisenberg (1484 - 1488)  I have to publish, according to my law, an Annual Report to the shareholders - there is only one —- but the’ shareholder does not have the right to approve or disapprove of it. He can only take note of it and that  is some form of accountability. M. A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they are required to publish an Annual Report and that the shareholder does not have the power to approve or disapprove of it. There is no conflicting viewpoint or contradiction presented.


Passage number 23.
 Lamfalussy (1489 - 1501)  I think also that accountability somehow has to appear at the Same time as independence in the monetary policy decision. Secondly, I  think I wholeheartedly agree with Wim Duisenberg that the external function  - 15 -  has to be put in somewhere, I am not quite sure how that will be handled because of course there you do not have the same kind of clearness of tradition of independence, but clearly you cannot bypass the whole question of the exchange rate role in the reserve holding exchange rate determination vis-a-vis the rest of the world. I think that has to appear and also again the prudential function, although that may or may not be watered down so that you could leave place for some sort of two-tier system, that also exists in some places. I think a central bank cannot be  excluded from some sort of prudential responsibly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own thoughts and opinions on the topic of accountability and independence in monetary policy decision-making, the external function of a central bank, and the inclusion of a prudential function. They mention some uncertainties and potential challenges, but there is no explicit disagreement or conflict being portrayed.


Passage number 24.
 The Chairman (1679 - 1708) (Interpretation)  Let us suppose that economic union, we boil this down to the points raised by Miguel Boyer, a centre for economic policy decisions would fix the fiscal constraints, would implement joint policies based on the Community budget and would define the policy mix, which already poses a problem of collusion with the monetary authority. But let us assume that this is what is done here. The question that then arises is is an ECOFIN Council of Ministers which meets 8 times a year in a position to accomplish this task in view of the way in which it operates. If this is not so, it will either hand over this responsibility to the European Commission or it will set up an appropriate body under its authority, under its aegis. Whatever the system used it will be accountable to the European Parliament. The European Parliament can bring to nothing the consistency between monetary and economic policies by rejecting the budget, for instance. It has joint decision powers as far as the budget is concerned and this is the problem. I think that the Council of Ministers of Finance, in view of the way in which it works, cannot play this role otherwise one would have to go beyond our mandate and tackle a more fundamental question. If more decisions are made at Community level, should there not be a Council of Ministers every 2 weeks at Brussels to make the decisions. If this is not so decided then one must give more power to the Commission so that, under the control of the Council of Ministers, it could play this role. It is very difficult to put this in writing, but that is the problem. Suddenly one finds that one goes beyond the mandate that was given us and starts thinking about the future of the Community institutions in the long term.  Do we really wish to open that Pandora's box. With the risk of having the  - 16 -  kind of discussion at a European summit that I am used to, where some Head of State starts talking about the beautiful future of the institutions and others get very annoyed. That is how the question is before us. One can of  course think about this for a little longer. Mr. M.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is raising questions and expressing concerns about the ability of the ECOFIN Council of Ministers to accomplish the task at hand, and suggesting alternative solutions. They also express hesitation about potentially opening up a larger discussion about the future of the Community institutions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 25.
 Boyer (1708 - 1739) (Interpretation)  Mr. Chairman, I think that one ought perhaps look a little more closely at the type of decision that has to be made: every year the limits of fiscal deficits that each country could go to, how these deficits would be funded, and then the problem of fund transfer and the heading of regional policy. The limits to be imposed on fiscal deficits will derive from monetary policy considerations and it may very well be that recommendations emerge from the central bank system. To preserve exchange rates, etc., to control the growth of the money supply, central banks wiil in practice define that the limits should not be exceeded in terms of budget deficits. So I don't think that you need a body to meet once a_ year to talk about deficits and limits. This will be a by-product of the Community monetary policy, no, it is far more complicated than that. If one talks only about financial transfers, a country which is below the average in terms of GDP per capita, this country will receive transfers not only by virtue of the regional policy but other policies and also the common agricultural policy and the percentage may be 3, 4 or even 5% of GDP. Therefore there is a constitutional problem, because the European Parliament is party to the approval or not of the Community budget and even if it all boils down to the very simple things that you have mentioned, nevertheless, the convergence procedure must be strengthened because it is not working well. The convergence procedure is as though you celebrated High Mass while having lost your faith already. But there is the problem of  fiscal deficit, compatible with monetary policy. Then there is the problem  of the Community budget some of which will be used for regional transfers.  An increase in the Community budget and the growing complexity of the Community budget will probably require a more elaborate system for the  setting-up of this budget.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The author expresses disagreement with the idea of a body meeting once a year to discuss deficits and limits, stating that it will be a by-product of the Community monetary policy. They also criticize the effectiveness of the convergence procedure and suggest that it needs to be strengthened.


Passage number 26.
  - 17 -  The Chairman (1826 - 1829) (Interpretation)  Let me put a question to you, do you want us to try to put in writing what I said earlier on, so that we would not have such a vague text but something which would be more outspoken. The centre for economic policy  decisions would become a centre for the co-ordination of economic policies.  Mr. E.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a suggestion or proposal by the speaker to clarify and make the text more explicit.


Passage number 27.
 Hoffmeyer (1830 - 1840)  One should be very precise about what should be achieved and I think one could start with that. I mentioned five points on p. 14 and you can have other things, there should be for one thing a system of rules. on budgetary policy, some kind of harmonisation of the welfare system, some kind of harmonisation of the tax system, some kind of harmonisation of cost policy and there should be a transfer system. If you start with that and say this has to be accomplished otherwise the monetary union cannot be achieved. The way in which you accomplish that is saying what the Heads of State may decide, institutional framework is not easy to prescribe. This I think is a fair position because it is hornet's nest, as you describe it, and it may then be better to leave it, but make it a condition that these  things are accomplished - that I think is a major point.  Mr. J.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing their opinion on what should be achieved for the monetary union and suggesting some points that need to be accomplished.
