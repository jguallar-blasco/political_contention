Passage number 1.
Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on January 24–25, 2012 January 24 Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  I’d like to start by recognizing our colleague, Larry Slifman, who is at his last meeting before his planned retirement. Larry is still fairly junior, having been on the Board staff almost 42 years.  [Laughter]  He has attended 183 FOMC meetings over 30 years.  At one day per meeting, that’s almost exactly six months of FOMC meetings.  [Laughter] Larry has shown great economic insight but has also excelled in mentoring others in the art of presenting complex material to the Board in the clearest and most logical manner. Larry, those of us around the table and many predecessors have benefited greatly from your dedicated service. Congratulations and best wishes for the next phase.  Thank you very much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is solely focused on recognizing Larry Slifman's retirement and expressing appreciation for his service.


Passage number 2.
  [Applause] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’d like to welcome, of course, President Lacker, President Lockhart, President Pianalto, and President Williams to the FOMC.  We will have a formal organizational part of the meeting a little bit later this morning, but I thought it would be useful first to begin with our special topic, which we’re looking forward to.  The topic is the role of financial conditions in economic recovery:  lending and leverage.  This was a highly favored pick of FOMC participants when we polled you last year about what you would like to talk about.  I particularly want to thank Glenn Rudebusch in San Francisco for organizing this session and acknowledge the presenters, John Duca from Dallas, Andrew Haughwout from New York, and Daniel Cooper from Boston.  Let me call on John.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is a simple introduction to a meeting topic and acknowledgment of individuals involved in organizing and presenting on that topic.


Passage number 3.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you all very much for a very interesting presentation. The floor is open for questions, comments, or reactions.  Would anyone like to begin.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is a polite invitation for questions, comments, or reactions, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 4.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think each of these presentations was really very interesting and timely, and there’s a lot to think about here, particularly in the fact that they’re not all consistent with each other.  Interestingly enough, in John’s presentation, he points us to the possibility that tax, financial, and regulatory changes would be affecting the sensitivity of consumption to household wealth, and we see something that looks significant in that story in exhibit 7 of his presentation.  I have to say that as I looked at this, it sounded rather plausible, in fact, because we are having some difficulties explaining consumption growth recently when some of the underlying fundamentals like household wealth and real disposable income aren’t supporting what we see.  The notion that there are these underlying regulatory issues going on sounded as if it was on the right path, and I was even tempted to add that there could be something else going on having to do with the general convenience factor in terms of  refinancing. It was the case that in the upturn, it was very easy to do a refi.  You could meet your mortgage broker on a Saturday in a parking lot and get it done within hours, and now there seem to be these inordinate obstacles. While John’s story sounded quite plausible, we then get to the Boston presentation where we’re told that the data showed that the standard relationship linking consumption to income and net worth stays as it has stayed historically, and that we’re not seeing real statistically significant differences between owners and renters or between levered and nonlevered households.  Is there a way to reconcile these stories.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Ms. Raskin notes that the presentations are not consistent with each other, specifically mentioning John's presentation which suggests that tax, financial, and regulatory changes are affecting consumption, while the Boston presentation states that the standard relationship between consumption and income/net worth remains consistent. This disagreement between the presentations creates contention.


Passage number 5.
 MR. DUCA.  That’s an excellent question.  If the ratios of consumption to income and wealth to income were stable, then one could estimate an equation like Daniel’s over a period where the relationship held in first differences.  The problem is that that relationship is not stable if one uses a definition of income that excludes the income from assets.  Personal disposable income includes capital gains on stocks and housing, as well as income from dividends and interest, and as a result, in consumption equations and consumption functions, if one includes a measure of income with property income and puts in wealth, one in a sense is double-counting wealth.  If one takes out property income, you see a big change, bigger swings in consumption to income.  For example, the blue line shows what happens if you include property income—not much movement.  The red line shows bigger swings, and because the relationships are not stable, if one properly measures income, in our opinion, then one needs a more detailed approach.  That’s why we break out income into the different components, and that’s why we test for these other factors. I would like to add that a lot of people have found that it is important to disaggregate wealth.  For example, Rick Mishkin’s paper with J. R. Kearl demonstrated a long time ago that debt has a bigger effect on consumption per dollar than does, let’s say, a rise in stock wealth, and there are a lot of other models out there that do that.  We look at things a littlebit differently.  We estimate over a long period because there are several things going on.  We want to sort out what’s the effect of swings in credit availability, stock wealth, and housing wealth.  If you look at a narrow time frame, there are too many things moving together, so it’s hard to disentangle that.  I’m sorry for the long answer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 6.
 MR. COOPER. Basically, the point of what we’re doing is, we’re trying to address whether the consumption forecast has been and is too optimistic based on some unknown factor, and the conclusion is that unknown factor doesn’t really seem to be there.  We’re not really trying to get into a debate about whether there’s a credit crunch or not, although one of the advantages of looking at the microdata is that, to the extent something is going on and you believe that there is some credit channel, you really should see it when you’re breaking out the households into high-debt or low-debt households or homeowners versus renters; we just don’t see that there. The other thing I’d add—and I don’t really want to get into a debate about the data—is that a lot of the aggregate analysis I present holds up with alternative definitions of income.  If you use labor income in the regressions that I have with the microdata, the results are very similar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

The passage is explaining the purpose of the analysis and stating the author's observations and conclusions based on the data. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 7.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information given in the passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 8.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I want to follow up on Governor Raskin’s question.  First, Dan used a definition of deleveraging.  I’m just curious whether the definition that he used would be one that you would use, because the term is used differently in the literature.  I think, actually, in this case it does matter because some people use deleveraging to mean that it is policy-invariant—that is, that we just have to wait for the passage of time for people to pay down the debt.  Using that definition, Dan draws the policy implication that it’s not just a case of waiting for time to go on, but actually there may be things that policy could do to affect some of thefundamentals.  Second, he drew a little bit more of a policy context than the other presentations.  Would you agree that if a lot of it is explained by some of the fundamentals—either disaggregated or not disaggregated—that is something policy can do something about, or would you be more comfortable thinking of it as policy-invariant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren questions whether the definition of deleveraging that Dan used aligns with his own understanding and how it is used in the literature. This suggests a difference in opinion or interpretation. Additionally, Mr. Rosengren raises the question of whether policy can do something about the factors that contribute to deleveraging, indicating a potential difference in beliefs or perspectives on the role of policy.


Passage number 9.
 MR. DUCA.  One of the things that we have found is that debt has a large effect on consumption.  The estimated effects really haven’t changed much if you estimate through, let’s say, 2007 versus, let’s say, 2010 or 2011.  In that sense, the effects may not be all that different, but they’re large.  And the disaggregated approach has the advantage of taking into account that a debt overhang can have a damping effect on consumption that lasts for a long time.  That’s why we prefer that. With respect to write-offs and looking into this whole issue of write-downs of underwater mortgages, I haven’t done enough on that to really hazard a guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing findings and preferences related to debt and consumption, without presenting conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 10.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT.  I would say that I have a slightly different definition of deleveraging than the one that Daniel uses, and essentially what I said in the presentation is that when household asset values change or net worth changes, that could induce households to change their repayment behavior through means other than foreclosure.  They may choose to accelerate payments on their mortgage or choose to pay down their credit card balances as a reaction to a change in asset values.  Now, I believe that Daniel would not consider that deleveraging because asset values are a fundamental, but in my presentation I referred to that as deleveraging.  That’s a slight difference in the definition, which might bring a little more consistency between our two presentations.  That said, looking forward, in both our views I would believe, the path of asset values and net worth of households is going to be important in determining how much future debt paydown we see. I’m not sure whether it has direct policyrelevance right now, but it may be a cautionary note in thinking about how consumption and saving are going to evolve in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging a slight difference in definition but states that it might bring more consistency between their presentations. They also mention that both of their views agree on the importance of asset values and net worth in determining future debt paydown.


Passage number 11.
 MR. COOPER.  I don’t really have a whole lot to add to that other than to say that Andy’s and my definitions are somewhat similar to the extent we’re looking for people who are actively deleveraging or actively choosing to pay down debt beyond what’s going on with foreclosures and default and other things.  One point, though, is that you can actually get shifts in the debt-to-asset ratio without any effect on consumption.  For example, someone with sufficient assets could choose to use some of their assets to pay down their debt just through a balance sheet reshuffling without having any particular change in the consumption.  I would not consider that deleveraging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply Mr. Cooper adding his thoughts and opinions on the topic without contradicting or challenging what was previously said.


Passage number 12.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Not enough information is provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 13.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a couple of broad questions for you to react to.  First, assuming that you save to achieve wealth rather than saving for its own sake, the level of interest rates might affect what you see as your appropriate level of savings.  Obviously, if real rates are low, you need to save more to achieve your net worth objectives. How do you think the low level of real interest rates should affect the outlook given your work in this subject.  That’s my question number one.  The second question is income distribution has changed pretty dramatically over the last couple of decades, and you could imagine a situation in which the individuals who are accruing income could be behaving very differently than those who are actually getting squeezed in terms of income growth.  When I looked at what you presented, that was all mushed together, and there was no income distribution channel.  I’d like to get your thoughts on that.  And then finally, I want to amplify what President Rosengren asked.  Daniel’s comments that there was no independent deleveraging effect seemed to have a pretty strong  implication for the outlook.  But John and Andrew, I didn’t really get that same sense of what the outlook implications of your findings were.  If you could just expand on that, that would be helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It consists of multiple questions and requests for clarification or expansion on certain ideas or findings.


Passage number 14.
 MR. DUCA.  If one estimates these sorts of models using levels and some details, one typically finds that housing wealth has had a bigger effect on consumption as one moves forward in time.  You can see this in the aggregate data.  You can even see it in some disaggregated studies.  Even Daniel’s 2009 study showed that when you estimate a framework that I would find a little more amenable to something in levels, you do see this. Wealth effects are usually drawn out.  They’re not a one-time thing, and using first differences really obscures how wealth can affect things. In terms of real rates, the effects tend to be pretty limited.  We do find that changes in car loan rates have big, short-term effects, and we do try to control for that.  We don’t include any data on income distribution.  It’s hard to do that with aggregate data.  Some other people have been looking into that, but it’s a little difficult because of our federal data system.  We haven’t had consistent data on consumption and consumer spending at the state level over long periods of time, but it is something that my coauthors, Muellbauer and Murphy, and I are thinking about and looking into.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and explaining different findings and limitations in the research.


Passage number 15.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Maybe I’ll chime in with a couple of observations.  First of all, on the question about saving, one important thing to keep in mind is that for many households the way they save is by paying down debt, and so the notion that the real rate has a relatively simple effect on the way people think about saving is a little bit misleading, as you’re well aware.  We do observe some changes in that saving behavior in the form of debt paydown over this time period.  Second, the consumer credit panel data that we’re using don’t have any information on consumer income, and so I’m not able to say anything direct about that.  However, some of thecharts in exhibit 6 give some indication of the differences across different groups in the economy.  For instance, younger households seem to be behaving quite differently from older households; they are continuing to pay down debt, whereas older households are increasing their balances. It will be nice to have some better income data at the individual level and a big sample to be able to get at some of these questions a little more closely.  Finally, on the outlook, what I would take away as the bottom line from my presentation is that the outlook for asset prices and net worth of households is going to be very important in determining the path of borrowing and likely consumption going forward.  That’s a hard thing to get a handle on—what’s going to happen to house prices in the next five years—but I think it’s very important.  We have a large pool of underwater borrowers and large flows into and out of unemployment—these are situations that may have big effects, in my view, on the outlook for consumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is simply a series of observations and statements made by Mr. Haughwout.


Passage number 16.
 MR. COOPER.  I’m going to go in reverse order because I want to agree with what Andrew just said.  As I said in my talk, the outlook for net worth and income really is what’s going to drive what’s going on.  To the extent that falling asset prices are going to have an effect, it could be a place that policy could intervene in terms of trying to help people, if that’s what you’re looking to do.  The other thing I wanted to comment on is a lot of people save not only by paying down debt, but also by building equity in their house.  I don’t have the exact statistics here, but for the vast majority of the people who are in the lower part of the wealth distribution, their wealth is all in housing. To the extent that even with low interest rates people can’t get into new housing because of credit problems or something else, there’s a market failure that potentially has to be addressed to get housing demand back up.  Another channel through which consumption has been bolstered a bit in the past through low interest rates is refinancing. If people are underwater—as Andrew pointed out—and now don’t have the income or whatever toget approved for refinancing, that may be restraining a bit people’s freeing up cash flow for other spending purposes.  Finally, in terms of the income distribution, I touched on that a little bit in terms of the amount of housing wealth they have. I’ve done a little bit of related work while doing this analysis, and basically if you look across the income distribution, you also don’t really see major effects.  But again, the PSID doesn’t have the really high end of the income distribution.  It’s a representative sample, but it’s not like the SCF. The PSID doesn’t oversample the wealthy. It has a poverty sample, but those households tend not to have much housing wealth.  The income distribution is important, but one of the reasons it’s important is because a lot of those people usually save in terms of housing and through potentially paying down debt or building equity in their house.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing additional information and commenting on points made by Andrew.


Passage number 17.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. This is because the passage only mentions "President Williams" without providing any context or statements that could suggest disagreement or contention.


Passage number 18.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 19.
 WILLIAMS.  I found all three presentations very useful, and I like the fact that you used different data and different methods of looking at the same set of issues.  That was very informative. I have a couple questions.  The first one —for all three of you—is how do you see your work fitting in with other research that argues that leverage was an important reason both for the severity of the Great Recession and for the sluggishness of the recovery. I’m thinking particularly of the work by Mian, Rao, and Sufi.  They take county-level data and assess the importance of leverage on consumption, and they find that consumption has been much weaker in counties that had many high-leverage households, using the cross-section across counties. This effect causes a significant reduction in aggregate demand the past few years. Again, the question is:  How do you see your research or your work relating to that kind of research.  My second question—and this may be more for Dave Reifschneider, so wake up, Dave [laughter]—I was really struck by one of the summary statements in Daniel’s presentation that the standard relationship linking consumption, income, and net worth should continue to be a reasonable predictor of household spending, and that there’s little evidence that this didn’t hold.  And I was just curious from the point of view of FRB/US—which I see as having these standard relationships between consumption, income, and net worth—whether the model predictions for consumption over the past few years track actual consumption reasonably well or whether there were big residuals. I’m using FRB/US as a typical model of consumption.  Those are my questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply asking questions and seeking clarification on how the research presented relates to other existing research and models. There is no evident disagreement or contention.


Passage number 20.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Maybe I’ll start by speaking a little bit to the previous literature and Mian, Rao, and Sufi, in particular.  I take that paper to be quite consistent in several ways with my presentation.  First of all, as you point out, they find significant evidence of household paydown of debt outside of the foreclosure process.  They have a similar data set to the one that we’re using.  It’s not quite as good—only 80 percent as good, which is good—and so they’re able to take out the effects of foreclosures on debt declines and get a sense of how much debt payoff there has been.  They find a significant amount, which, again, is consistent with my notion of deleveraging, although slightly different from Daniel’s.  They also find a relatively large effect of debt overhang, if you will, on consumption during the Great Recession and through 2009.  I find the analysis broadly convincing, although they use an instrumental variables approach and I’m not 100 percent convinced about the instrument—but I say that about every instrument, I think. It’s fair to say that their analysis is quite consistent with our results, and I would agree generally speaking with their approach to the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging the previous literature and agrees with the findings and approach of the authors mentioned. They also mention some slight differences in their own analysis but overall find it convincing and consistent with their own results.


Passage number 21.
   MR. COOPER.  I don’t really agree that the Mian and Sufi work is consistent with what we do.  Their main thesis is that consumption drops the most in the counties that had the greatest run-up in debt between 2002 and 2006, and they attribute this to deleveraging.  Some of it is a definitional difference, that there’s a run-up and a rundown on debt, and that’s it. But the biggest difference is that they don’t have individual-level data.  They don’t know anything about the individual’s net worth or income or anything else.  As a result, they can’t really distinguish between changes in consumption due to debt and changes in consumption due to net worth.  My interpretation of their results is that a lot of what’s going on is changes in net worth.  Also—and I’ve done this with the consumer credit panel—they find a correlation basically between changes in debt and big drops in employment and big drops subsequently in consumption.  It turns out that places that have big run-ups in debt also had incredibly big drops in residential investment.  To the extent that you believe that there is a multiplier effect, construction workers who get laid off can’t go to the local Applebee’s to buy dinner as frequently, and that in turn cuts down on the income of the waitresses, and it becomes circular.  There’s a potential for a lot of that to be going on, and that’s not something that they can address.  Also, I would agree with Andrew that I find the instrument a bit suspect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It consists of one individual's opinion and interpretation of the Mian and Sufi work, as well as some additional thoughts and concerns they have regarding the limitations of the data and methodology used.


Passage number 22.
 MR. DUCA.  I would like to comment on the breakdown in wealth.  FRB/US breaks wealth down into stock wealth and other wealth.  The other wealth basically includes other assets and then takes into account debt.  Part of the reason for that is that there is a difference in the effects.  Stock wealth has less effect than the other components in FRB/US. Our findings use a three-way breakdown.  It’s a little different, but it’s consistent with the idea that we do see in the data—and a lot of people have found this when you look through the history—that there is a difference in the sensitivities of consumption to the different components of wealth.  Our results   are generally consistent with that notion. Mian and Sufi’s results seem reasonable for autos, but I get a little suspicious about using credit card data to track non-auto retail sales because, as we all know, the payment system and payment media have shifted.  I wonder to what extent the increased use of debit cards and electronic payments has perhaps caused their estimates of the fall in retail sales to be a little low. Nevertheless, their results are consistent with a long history of work showing that debt does have a more potent effect on consumption than asset holdings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is acknowledging and discussing different approaches to analyzing wealth and consumption, but there is no direct disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 23.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Maybe I could chime in on one more thing.  One of the benefits and one of the things I liked about the Mian, Rao, and Sufi paper is just what John pointed to as a weakness, that is, the MasterCard data.  What I like is that those data exclude mortgage payments, which are probably 30 to 40 percent of homeowners’ income.  If you’re not defaulting, then that payment is going to be roughly stable.  You probably have a fixed-rate mortgage, and your payment is the same every month.  They’re able to take that out of, if you will, the voluntary consumption bundle and look at things like groceries and restaurant meals— somewhat more discretionary expenditure.  I thought that that was a value, and I do believe that those data incorporate debit card transactions on MasterCard debit cards.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 24.
 MR. DUCA.  Then I stand corrected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Duca, states that they stand corrected, suggesting that they agree with something that was previously mentioned or proven.


Passage number 25.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Well, I’m not sure about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the passage, Mr. Haughwout expresses uncertainty regarding the statement but does not explicitly disagree or contend with it.


Passage number 26.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. On the question about FRB/US, let me answer with FRB/US, EDO, and a number of other staff models because they all tell similar sorts of stories.  FRB/US has an aggregate relationship.  Consumption is related to an estimate of permanent income, which is disaggregated.  It’s also related to wealth, which used to be disaggregated, but these days we just use total household net worth because we haven’t been able to reliably estimate a difference between the two components.  And then there are other cyclical factors that come in.  That equation went way off during the recession, in 2009 and 2010, but since then it has come back on track in the sense that according to the model, there are no longer negative shocks—it’s still tracking back to what would be its longer-run level.  EDO saw a similar pattern.  However, when EDO looks at the unusual weakness in consumption, it parses the data and looks at the pattern of investment and things like that, and it says, “Oh, there was a big adverse shock to risk premiums that hit the economy, and that explains it.” That shock has faded away some. Then if you look at a simpler reduced-form consumption forecast equation—for example, one that the staff uses to prepare the judgmental forecast—it was also off a lot during 2009–10, and it’s now coming back on track. One way of looking at all of those models is to conclude that something funny seemed to happen during the middle of the recession, but now the equations are looking okay.  So, whatever happened, it was transitory. That may be the right conclusion, but I’d throw out a couple of caveats to that.  First, if you’re using aggregate data, the aggregate data are still, in real time, subject to major measurement changes. Income, consumption, and wealth could all be revised a whole lot, which means that the statement “they’re all back on track now” is still open to question.  Three or four years from now, we’ll be able to say that with more confidence, once the tax data are folded in.  The second point is that—again, just focusing on aggregate data—if you did rolling estimates of the coefficients in the models, then you’d say, “Well, they’re not shifting around too much, those look pretty stable.” But rolling estimates of those coefficients can nonetheless send out-of-sample forecasts really whipping up and down in a way that would be very material for the forecast. There’s a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what that aggregate relationship actually is, even using revised data.   And the third point I’d make is that when we talk about these fundamentals, we need to keep in mind how they may be affected by things such as financial innovations and changes in credit availability.  When we take housing wealth—a fundamental—and condition on it, we also have to keep in mind that housing prices went way up, and ask what role did financial innovations have to do with that. What role did tightening down on credit and the demise of subprime lending have to do with bringing house prices down.  Finally, when you are working with aggregate data, there is a tremendous simultaneity problem. Income really isn’t in some sense a fundamental, and wealth in the aggregate isn’t a fundamental.  It’s all part of a system that’s very complicated, and teasing out leverage and credit effects is very difficult. That’s not a critique on what anybody did.  It’s just a problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily a discussion of various models and their findings, along with some caveats and considerations.


Passage number 27.
 MR. DUCA.  I’d like to add something to what Dave just said.  In some of our work we’ve actually tried to track the downpayment constraints facing first-time homeowners, and it appears that credit standards were, in fact, weakened quite a bit during the subprime boom, and then they got tightened.  So in a certain sense, we may have had a failed financial innovation.  These are time-series data going back to the late 1970s through 2009.  That just supports Dave’s point that when we look at these balance sheet effects, they’re really tracking, to some extent, the structural transmission mechanism of all the things that are hitting the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is a statement providing additional information and supporting a previous point, without expressing any opposing views.


Passage number 28.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 29.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I would like to ask a couple of definitional questions that I am sure the economists around the table know but I don’t.  The first question relates to the broader concept of saving and whether pensions are factored into the saving rate for society—not the personal saving rate but the broader saving rate.  Then, how does  the anticipation of pension income or recent fears about Social Security being there or not being there factor into a consumer’s thought process about wealth and net worth.  Any answer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is potential disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, acknowledges that he does not have knowledge on certain economic concepts and asks for clarification. This suggests that there may be differing viewpoints or interpretations on how pensions and anticipation of pension income affect the broader saving rate and consumer thinking about wealth and net worth. The response to his questions could potentially lead to conflicting perspectives or arguments.


Passage number 30.
 MR. DUCA.  Well, the anticipation of changes in Social Security is a real tough one because obviously, the issue of how to deal with the funding of these liabilities hasn’t been addressed.  That is a very important question, and I think we will have to monitor the spending behavior of the elderly and of their children.  Corporate contributions to defined benefit plans are incorporated into the saving data, but it is imperfect.  We have a lot of shifts in the form of pensions as well, and there is also a lot of uncertainty, depending on whether or not your company is declaring bankruptcy, like the airline I am going to be flying back home on.  It is a thorny issue.  Perhaps Dave may have something to add.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing various factors and uncertainties related to Social Security and pensions. The mention of Dave possibly having something to add suggests a continuation or further discussion of the topic, rather than disagreement.


Passage number 31.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Using up a lifeline, is that what we’re doing here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This statement does not involve contention or disagreement. The speaker is making a statement and questioning whether they are using up a lifeline in a situation. There is no indication of any disagreement or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 32.
  [Laughter] MR. COOPER.  I don’t know enough about the NIPA definition.  For what I was doing, wealth in the PSID doesn’t include any defined benefit plan anticipation.  But theories based on consumers being forward-looking in their consumption decisions should be based on their anticipations of pensions, and if they don’t think their retirement is going to be there, perhaps they are going to be ratcheting back their consumption and saving more now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Mr. Cooper about his lack of knowledge regarding the NIPA definition and his opinion on theories based on consumers' forward-looking consumption decisions.


Passage number 33.
 MR. LOCKHART.  The simpler question, then, is do you define stocks and bonds as illiquid because they are in accounts that cannot be easily tapped.  Because the reality of most stock and bond holdings is they are practically as liquid as pulling down a cash balance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Lockhart, explaining that stocks and bonds can be considered illiquid because they cannot be easily accessed, but in reality, they can be just as easily converted into cash.


Passage number 34.
 MR. DUCA.  My coauthor from Great Britain uses that term to basically mean assets that are subject to capital gains and capital losses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement of fact or clarification without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 35.
 MR. LOCKHART.  One more question, if I may, and it’s related maybe a little bit to Vice Chairman Dudley’s question on income distribution.  In a recent reading—I don’t know ifit’s true or not—I read that 40 percent of aggregate consumption is attributable to the top 10 percent of income.  That would suggest to me, if that is true, that the growth in consumption is largely going to be driven by the behavior of the relative few in society.  And, therefore, we ought to be focusing on how that top 10 percent or top 20 percent thinks about wealth, future income prospects, and so forth.  Now, first, is the assertion correct.  And then, how do you factor that into your thinking about the broad question of the growth in consumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a statistic and expressing their opinion based on that statistic.


Passage number 36.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT. I can’t speak to whether the assertion is correct, although I am certain that some qualitative fact like that is true—that a large proportion of consumption comes from a relatively small proportion of high-income earners.  One thing I would point out is that the biggest declines in asset values over the past several years have been in housing, and homeownership is, of course, quite concentrated at the very top of the income distribution.  In other words, at the top of the income distribution people are very likely to own homes.  And, thus, these high-income individuals are likely to have sustained significant reductions in their housing wealth in the past five years.  They are probably less likely, though, to have mortgage debt, or substantial amounts of mortgage debt, against that housing, so that there may not be such a debt overhang. It is more of a pure wealth effect possibly, and that would potentially affect their consumption going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While there is some speculation and uncertainty due to the use of words like "probably" and "possibly," there is no direct contention or disagreement being expressed in this passage.


Passage number 37.
 MR. WILCOX.  On the issue of pension funds, the pension fund itself is attributed to the household sector, so a contribution from an employer into the pension fund is treated as part of personal income.  For reasons that are going to seem very confusing, but it makes sense once you have been thinking about it for a long time [laughter], because pension funds are already in the personal sector when the pension fund pays out a benefit, it is a payment within the personal sector, so that is not treated as part of personal income.  The income, as far as the national  income accounts are concerned, took place when the employer made the contribution into the fund.  That got it into the personal sector.  Thereafter, it stays in the personal sector.  Interest and dividend income is attributed to the household sector, so that counts as part of personal income.  I think the comment earlier was right on, which is that theory tells us that households ought to be taking a long-horizon look at the assets that will be provided out of those pension funds in terms of determining their permanent income prospects and, hence, the level of consumption that is appropriate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining how pension funds are treated in the national income accounts and how they are considered as part of personal income. The mention of confusion and laughter seems to be lighthearted and not indicative of disagreement.


Passage number 38.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. Continuing on the NIPA Jeopardy questions, as we often say internally [laughter], your conjecture that upper-income households account for a disproportionate share of total consumption is correct.  Whether it is exactly the number you just cited, I’m not sure, but that number sounded reasonable to me.  The other thing I would point out is that part of the reason why the SCF oversamples the rich is because they account for a disproportionate share of the total wealth in the economy, a disproportionate share of consumption, and so forth.  It is important to get good information on that, so we try to do that.  Second, in thinking about what that means, we also have to keep in mind that—and this was alluded to a second ago—those upper-income people are the least likely to be affected by any kind of credit constraint or things like that.  They are the ones most likely to be financial planners, so their behavior is likely to be more like a classic optimizing household than, say, someone in the bottom 20 percent of the distribution who is more likely to be liquidity constrained.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is providing additional information and explaining a point.


Passage number 39.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It only shows gratitude.


Passage number 40.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage only mentions President Kocherlakota without providing any further information or context, so it is not possible to determine if there is any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 41.
MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a comment and a question.  The comment I would make is on exhibit 11 on page 7 of John’s presentation.  John, you expressed some confidence that these ratios were starting to stabilize, especially the consumer debt-to-income ratio was starting to stabilize. Looking at the time-series plots, I’m not sure where I should draw that confidence.  It looks like, for example, the mortgage debt-to-income ratio is still quite elevated compared with where it was in 1996 or so when housing prices started to rise very rapidly.  The consumer debt-to-income ratio also seems maybe not as elevated but relatively elevated. I looked at these pictures, and I was more concerned than comforted by them.  That is my comment. The question, I guess, is for Daniel.  You made the statement that the linkage between fundamentals and consumption looks the same post-2007 as pre-2007.  The one fundamental that is missing from the regressions—and this is something that Vice Chairman Dudley emphasized in his comments, too—is the real interest rate.  The literature I have seen on household consumption typically includes the real interest rate as an explanatory variable.  This is not just an academic comment in the sense that what we are trying to do is push down on that real interest rate, and we have been somewhat successful on that.  The real interest rates are much lower now than they were in 2007.  But that doesn’t seem to have materialized, and your own results seem to show this: It doesn’t seem to have shown up in the kind of faster consumption growth we would like to see because otherwise you would have picked that up as, “Hey, my regressions are different in 2007 than they were before that.” One question is why you didn’t include the real interest rate as an explanatory variable.  And then, couldn’t we see something about leverage as being a reason why consumption doesn’t seem to be as responsive to the real interest rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 42.
 MR. DUCA.  Why don’t I address the first question. I distinguish between the two—and perhaps you may have misheard me, or maybe I misspoke.  I said mortgage debt is likely to decline further, reflecting persistent problems. I noted that the rate of decline seemed to have been a little slower of late, and I think we all know that, to some extent, that is the end of the robo-signing. But when we look at consumer debt to income, we have seen the nonrevolving component of consumer installment credit rising for quite some time.  Consistent with the loan officer surveys, we are seeing an upturn in willingness to lend—a continuing easing of credit standards for consumer loans.  We are also seeing consumer loan delinquency rates falling to very low levels.  And if we look at the financial obligations ratio material that the Board staff put together, we see that the financial obligations have really fallen as a share of income to levels that are more sustainable, shall we say. I couch these things with “likely.” “Likely,” in my mind, doesn’t mean I am all that confident.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It primarily presents a series of observations and statements about mortgage debt, consumer debt, and credit standards. There is no conflict or argument expressed in the passage.


Passage number 43.
 MR. COOPER. To address your question on the interest rates, the regressions include year fixed effects, so that is going to absorb any of that.  Typically, in the consumption models, we only use the real risk-free rate or something that is going to pick up all the variation in that.  It probably would be interesting to the extent you had data on the interest rate faced by the individual consumer in terms of their ability to borrow or lend, and that might get some interesting cross-sectional variation there. I will say that the year fixed effects are very constant over time if you just plot them.  As to why there isn’t more of a consumption jump from low interest rates, I don’t want to hypothesize too much on that.  One thing that people have suggested is that perhaps some of the people on the margin where it really matters are the ones who are constrained, and they can’t refinance their house to take advantage of the cash flow.  But   just averaging across all households, you are really not seeing much of an effect, whereas I think that it may be there for some people, for sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation and discussing potential factors that might contribute to the lack of a consumption jump from low interest rates.


Passage number 44.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 45.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question about the implications of the findings on the saving rate.  John, at the end of your presentation you gave us two scenarios affecting the saving rate, and the Tealbook forecasts that the saving rate will increase to around 5 percent and then decline to the current rate of about 4 percent.  Are the saving rates that are forecast in the Tealbook consistent with the findings of all three of these studies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No contention or disagreement. The passage is simply stating a question and requesting clarification. There is no indication of conflicting opinions or debate.


Passage number 46.
 MR. DUCA.  I would say our work is consistent with the Tealbook insofar as we are not seeing all that much movement.  However, a lot depends on what is going to happen with consumer credit availability and how well we can track that, as well as what is going on with mortgages.  The other thing I would mention—and I agree completely with what Dave said before—there is a lot of measurement error. The saving rate is a reflection of income, which is measured with error, as well as spending, which is measured with error, and sometimes they compound each other.  I think it is broadly consistent.  A lot depends on what happens with lending conditions, to some extent, and what happens with the housing market, and those are pretty unknown.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct contention or disagreement.


Passage number 47.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT. I will briefly say it is broadly consistent with the view that emerges from my presentation, in the sense that we expect that household paydowns of mortgage debt are going to continue.  They have been quite substantial over the past several years, likely to continue, and that is going to show up as saving.  But, again, much depends, as John said, on the outlook for house prices.  A big jump in house prices could change consumers’ calculus on those issues.  But assuming a relatively slow change in either direction in house prices, we would expect to see more mortgage paydowns as households try to rebalance their balance sheets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is giving their perspective on the topic and acknowledging that there is a possibility for a change in consumers' behavior depending on house prices. However, they state that assuming relatively slow changes in house prices, they expect to see more mortgage paydowns.


Passage number 48.
 MR. COOPER.  I don’t really have a whole lot to add to that.  I think that the saving rate is based on the past.  If there are no major fundamental factors impacting consumption, based on my analysis, the saving rate is going to continue on a similar trend to where it is now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering their own analysis and stating that the saving rate will continue on a similar trend if there are no major factors affecting consumption. There is no contradicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 49.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. PIANALTO is simply expressing gratitude or acknowledgement.


Passage number 50.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 51.
 MR. BULLARD. First of all, let me just say I love this work, and it gave me a lot of perspective on these issues. I just have one question.  We have been talking about definitions of deleveraging and, I want to talk about default for a second.  The general story I have in my mind—and it could be wrong—would be that households are very optimistic about the future, and because of that, they took on a lot of debt because they are trying to smooth consumption between today and tomorrow.  That is why you get the run-up in debt.  Then, tomorrow comes, and income and wealth aren’t as high as they thought, so you’ve got debt overhang.  One reaction to that is to say, “I’m going to reduce my consumption today and pay off this debt.” Another reaction to it is to say, “I’m going to consume what I want today, and I’m not going to pay back my debt.” I don’t see why default can’t be considered one part of the deleveraging story.  You guys, as I interpret it—and maybe I have it wrong—did not want to go in that direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard is simply posing a question and expressing his interpretation of the matter at hand.


Passage number 52.
 MR. DUCA.  Let me touch on the issue of permanent income.  We actually do try to control for permanent income and use forecasts of income, and the like, to try to control for swings there.  We don’t see quite that much going on there.  In most of our work we find that for   house prices, for example, that in controlling for expectations of future house prices that the main driver seems to be credit standards that, in turn, fuel price expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their method of controlling for permanent income and mentioning their findings regarding the main driver of house prices.


Passage number 53.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT. I don’t have any objection to thinking about defaulting on debts as a form of deleveraging.  It is clearly a way that households can get debt off of their credit reports and off of their balance sheets.  But it does come at a price, just as the other form of deleveraging—actively paying down debt—comes at the price probably of sacrificing consumption today.  It is quite likely that a default on a debt today will come at the price of access to credit in the future.  Research at the Board indicates that that future could be quite a while before your credit score recovers to the extent that you will be able to get credit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses the different ways of deleveraging and acknowledges the potential consequences of defaulting on debt.


Passage number 54.
 MR. BULLARD. The household would make a decision about how badly they need access to credit markets in the future against the benefits of just defaulting today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply pointing out that the household needs to consider the importance of having access to credit markets in the future and weigh it against the potential advantage of defaulting on their obligations.


Passage number 55.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Exactly.  There is one other dimension and that is that in many states, particularly judicial states, the process for foreclosure is quite long and lengthening.  Therefore, the amount of time between the last payment I make on my mortgage and the time when I actually have to move is extending.  It is kind of rent-free.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is describing a situation where the process for foreclosure is long and getting longer, which means they have more time between their last mortgage payment and when they have to move out. This is portrayed as a positive aspect as it allows them to live "rent-free" for a longer period.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 56.
 MR. BULLARD. That is changing the calculus to some degree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The phrase "That is changing the calculus to some degree" indicates a difference in perspective or opinion. It suggests that there is a disagreement or differing interpretation regarding how things are changing.


Passage number 57.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT. It changes the calculus to some extent.  But I would still say that there is still a substantial cost embedded in default, and that is reduced access to credit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a statement of opinion and there is no explicit disagreement or contention in the passage. It is simply stating that default has a substantial cost in terms of reduced access to credit.


Passage number 58.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay. Do I have it right in my head that this is a big issue because the default part of it is a big chunk of the mortgage debt coming down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply stating his understanding of the situation.


Passage number 59.
 MR. HAUGHWOUT.  That’s right.  There is no question that defaults have been very important in removing debts from household liabilities over the past three to five years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 60.
 MR. COOPER. Default could be part of the story, if you wanted to think about it that way. I agree with a lot of what Andrew is saying.  But the story you describe, if you want to abstract a bit from potential future hits on your credit, is not really going to impact your consumption today.  If you are just wiping away your debt, your point is you are just going to go on consuming as you are.  That shouldn’t really have an impact on consumption.  And, really, what I was trying to get at is a definition of deleveraging where you are trying to find something abnormal that is impacting consumption beyond the normal net worth and income channels.  Again, if you wipe away debt, that is going to show up through a change in your net worth.  I don’t really think that the story you’re telling has much of an effect on consumption.  And, yes, I agree, it also comes at a price.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with Andrew on many points but is offering a different perspective on the impact of debt on consumption.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 61.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would like to ask a quick methodological question, probably more to Dave and David.  The way that Mr. Cooper approached the question was to say, “We have a null hypothesis, which is the standard model, and we are going to test whether these bells and whistles are statistically significant in a classical hypothesis testing sense.” Obviously, that is the way we usually do inference.  But suppose your objective is to minimize the mean squared error of your forecast, which is a little bit different.  Wouldn’t the right approach be—and I am asking this in terms of how you think about this—to look at, on the one hand, the improvement in the in-sample forecast brought about by a more complex model penalized by the number of extra parameters and some information criteria.  And isn’t that the way you should think about it.  Or do you instead use some kind of Occam’s razor and stick with the smallest statistically valid model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in this passage. 

The speaker is suggesting a different approach to hypothesis testing than the one suggested by Mr. Cooper. They argue that instead of testing for statistical significance, one should consider the improvement in in-sample forecast brought about by a more complex model, penalized by the number of extra parameters and some information criteria. This disagreement suggests a contention in the passage.


Passage number 62.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. We had a debate recently on consumption and leverage, part of which, I think, involved exactly the question you are raising. I would say you never know what  the true model is.  Occam’s razor is good, but it is a complicated world—you know lots of things matter.  So it is really good to look at a variety of models with a variety of channels and ask yourself, what am I learning from this.  Probably never put zero weight on any of those models, although some of them might get a pretty low weight.  Another methodological thing when you think about a model—if you are doing things right—is, if you have tuned it to in-sample data, then you really should penalize it for that sort of overfitting.  Maybe a good way to do that is to try to evaluate these things as close as you can get to an out-of-sample, real-time forecasting environment.  Try not to cheat by looking at the results and then going back.  That is very hard to do, but we aspire to doing that, taking that kind of a Bayesian broad approach.  We don’t always get there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different approaches to modeling and acknowledging the complexities of the real world. They emphasize the importance of considering multiple models and evaluating them in a rigorous, unbiased manner.


Passage number 63.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much, presenters and organizers, for a very useful discussion.  Thank you for the comments from folks around the table.

Now, item 5, we are going to turn to authorizations for Desk operations, and I want to call on Brian to briefly describe what we are voting on here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 72.
 MR. SACK.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At its first meeting each year, the Committee reviews the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations and the set of guidelines that govern foreign currency transactions. With regards to domestic open market operations, I recommend that the authorization be renewed with one change.  Specifically, the authorization currently allows the New York Fed to undertake securities loans on an overnight basis.  This restriction causes difficulties when there are differences in the holiday calendars of the Federal Reserve and the markets in which the New York Fed operates.  This discrepancy can create operational challenges for our counterparties and reduced participation in our operations around these dates.  To address this issue, I am requesting that the authorization be altered to allow the New York Fed to lend securities on an overnight basis as determined by the trading conventions of the market in which it is operating.  The specific change requested was described in the memo sent to the Committee ahead of this meeting. In addition to this change, I would also like to update the Committee on several items related to the domestic authorization. First, the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues remains suspended.  The System Open Market Account still contains significant holdings of agency debt and agency MBS, and the Desk continues to conduct transactions in agency MBS as part of the reinvestment strategy decided by the Committee. Second, the current authorization allows the Desk to transact in agency MBS for the SOMA through agents such as asset managers and custodian banks.  The Desk has expanded the range of activities it is able to conduct in agency MBS, and it currently does not use outside agents for any trading activity.  Nevertheless, some external services are still needed for a variety of clearing, settlement, custodial, and analytical activities. Third, the resolution authorizing the New York Fed to conduct small-scale reverse repurchase agreement operations remains active.  The Desk continues to conduct such operations for testing purposes, which is useful in part because the counterparty list continues to expand.  It is likely that the Desk will want to engage in small-scale testing for other types of operations, such as MBS sales, as they approach, which would require the FOMC to approve additional resolutions. Lastly, I would like to note an item that will likely come before the Committee for authorization at an upcoming meeting.  Last January, I mentioned that the New York Fed at some point would seek authorization on a proposed policy to address the occurrence of daylight overdrafts in foreign central bank accounts by providing intraday liquidity through daylight repurchase agreements.  We continue to work out specific details around the proposed procedures.  Once those details are settled, I will review this proposal with the Committee and ask for a change to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations that would allow these transactions with our foreign central bank customers. Let me now turn to foreign currency operations.  For those operations, the Desk operates under the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations. I recommend all three of these be renewed without amendment.  Please note that the vote to reaffirm these documents will include approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is the speaker, Mr. Sack, providing an update and recommendations to the Committee.


Passage number 73.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Brian.  [No response]All right.  Well, we have two votes.  The first is to approve the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations with the amendment that Brian described.  Are there any objections.  [No response]  Seeing none.  The second vote is to approve, without amendment, the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.  Are there objections.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 74.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I respectfully would like to oppose the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive.  This is the position I and my immediate predecessor have taken every three years since 1997. These are the foundations for foreign exchange operations.  Foreign exchange operations—interventions by central banks—have become exceedingly rare in recent years, and for good reason, largely reflecting a sense of futility. If these operations are sterilized but not followed by supporting policy actions, then they are likely to fail to the detriment of the credibility of the central bank. If they are sterilized but followed by supporting operations, they are essentially compromising the independence of the central bank that has had to cooperate with the Treasury and its lead in these operations.  If they are not sterilized, we obviously could have bought U.S. Treasury securities instead, the difference being we are taking on foreign exchange risk to the detriment of the U.S. taxpayer. I believe that, given the history of the past decade or two with foreign exchange operations, we should consider approaching the Administration and seeking to take steps to wind down and dismantle this infrastructure and back away from this central banking practice.  In the meantime, I would like very respectfully use this triennial opportunity to register my hope for better policy by voting against the Foreign Exchange Authorization and Foreign Currency Directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage shows a clear disagreement or opposition to the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses his dissent by providing reasons for his opposition and suggesting that the practice of foreign exchange operations be dismantled.


Passage number 75.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, President Lacker.  You are opposing the first two and not the third. Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the person being addressed (President Lacker) is opposing the first two but not the third, without expressing any disagreement towards their stance.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 76.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The use of "Yes" indicates that there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 77.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Are there other objections. [No response]  Seeing none, the authorizations are approved.  Item 6 is the Program for the Security of FOMC Information.  This was circulated with the agenda for the meeting.  We are not proposing any changes to the program.  We are simply voting to reaffirm the existing program. Are there any objections to doing so. [No response]  All right.  Thank you. I would like to begin item 7, which is the possible adoption of a statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy, and we will see how long it takes to go through it.  I am going to turn to Governor Yellen in just a couple of minutes in her role as the head of the subcommittee to make some introductory remarks, but I would like to make a few of my own quickly. First, we all owe a great deal of thanks to Janet’s subcommittee, including President Evans, President Plosser, and Governor Raskin, for all of their efforts, as well as the whole Committee for their willingness to work in a collaborative way to develop this principle. I personally think the document is a good one.  At least at a high level, it identifies the elements of FOMC policy that have been implicit for a long time, and now will be made, I hope, more explicit.  At the same time, it is a sufficiently flexible document to allow for innovation as we move forward.  It is, of course, also a product of a very long effort, and I would cite FOMC debates.  In a way, this vote is a response to Governor Duke who wanted never to discuss these issues again, [laughter] and we hope maybe to accommodate her.  The FOMC has beendiscussing these issues for at least 15 years or more, and many of us around the table have worked on the academic research and the central banking analysis that has contributed to this, including me, of course. It is important to be clear about what this is. In my view, this statement does not reflect, and should not be represented as, a change in the underlying policy approach of the FOMC.  Our approach has stabilized into one in which we provide a firm anchor for inflation and inflation expectations in the longer term, which in turn gives us flexibility to offset short-term economic shocks.  Because stable inflation and inflation expectations both support a healthy economy in the longer term and improve our ability to respond to short-run shocks, we can say that the two sides of the dual mandate are generally complementary. At the same time, this document is explicit in saying that in the short run, the inflation and employment objectives can conflict, which is evidenced by our many recent debates around the table about whether further actions to promote employment create risks of higher inflation.  In those situations, as the document says, we take a balanced approach that is informed by our knowledge of the economy’s dynamics, the outlook, and the size and expected persistence of the deviations of our objectives from their desired levels.  Again, I do not want to interpret this statement as a change in the underlying policy approach, and I hope that people will not interpret it as such in their public comments. What this is trying to do is increase our transparency and our accountability by making our communication clearer to the public.  There is a lot of evidence that communication and transparency are valuable to monetary policy in the long term.  In that respect, I don’t think of this as simply a short-term document or an opportunistic document.  But of course this is a particularly important time for us to focus on communication.  Our normal policy instrument— the target for the federal funds rate—is not available, at least for the easing direction.  We are using new and unfamiliar policy tools, and in this environment it is particularly important that we explain what we are doing and help shape expectations for future policy.  I think this statement is not to be taken in isolation.  Instead, it is part of a broad range of enhancements to our communication, including the press conferences, the projections, and other steps that may yet come. I recognize that releasing this statement is not without risks, market and political probably, but I do believe that once the markets and the public adjust and understand what we are trying to achieve here that we will be able to make policy more effective and more transparent as well. Let me turn now to Governor Yellen, the chair of the subcommittee, who I will ask to make a couple of introductory remarks of her own, and then to move the document.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 78.
 MS. YELLEN.2  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At the November FOMC meeting, you encouraged the subcommittee on communications to formulate a consensus statement regarding the Committee’s longer-run goals and policy strategy.  Over subsequent weeks, our subcommittee prepared an initial draft, engaged in informal consultations, presented a revised draft for discussion at the December FOMC meeting, and then made further editing adjustments over the past few weeks. I am deeply grateful to the members of the subcommittee—namely, Governor Raskin, President Evans, and President Plosser—for their remarkable perseverance and collegiality throughout these consultations and revisions.  I am very pleased that our subcommittee is now able to present a draft statement that succeeds in specifying a numerical inflation goal in a context that firmly underscores the Committee’s commitment to fostering both parts of the dual mandate. As the Chairman noted, the FOMC has had a sequence of many discussions over the past two decades about potential approaches for clarifying its longer-run goals and strategy.  Thus, I 2 The materials used by Ms. Yellen are appended to this transcript (appendix 2).  believe that our formal consideration of this statement today marks a truly momentous occasion in the history of the FOMC.  The issuance of such a statement by the central bank of the world’s largest economy is a notable step in the history of central banking.  I would like, therefore, to make a few remarks about the significance of the consensus statement before proposing it for adoption. First, I want to emphasize my agreement with the Chairman that this statement does not represent a change in how we conduct monetary policy.  Rather, its purpose is to enhance the clarity and transparency of the rationale for our policy decisions.  In fact, as Governor Raskin noted at our December meeting, a key element of the statement itself is the expression of the Committee’s commitment to strive to explain our policy decisions as clearly as possible. In doing so, we recognize that clear and transparent central bank communications facilitate well-informed decisionmaking by households and businesses, reduce economic and financial uncertainty, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhance our accountability to the public. Second, this statement has been designed as an overarching set of principles that is intended to withstand the test of time.  For that reason, our subcommittee has engaged in intensive editing sessions and extensive consultations to identify how these principles can be expressed in a way that garners the broadest possible support from Committee participants.  Of course, the composition of the Committee itself will slowly evolve over time, but we certainly hope that over the years and even decades to come, future Committee participants will also find these principles to be very reasonable and appropriate. Moreover, the breadth of the Committee’s support will be very important in the process of disseminating these principles to the public.  After all, the diversity of this Committee is one  of its fundamental strengths, and in light of that diversity, the public can be assured that these principles are grounded in careful consideration and broad consensus among a group of Committee participants who have a wide range of backgrounds and areas of expertise, as well as markedly distinct views about the structural characteristics of the economy and the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy. Of course, reaching a broad consensus means that the final statement will never match exactly the ideal wording that any single one of us might have chosen.  Moreover, as Governor Tarullo noted at the December meeting, any single page of text, no matter how carefully crafted, necessarily involves some subtleties and nuances that will remain open to interpretation, and there won’t be any Supreme Court to adjudicate differences that could arise about how to apply these principles in the context of any given monetary policy decision.  Nonetheless, even recognizing those inherent limitations of a consensus statement, our subcommittee believes that this initiative will be very helpful for the Committee’s decisionmaking as well as for our communication to the public.  In effect, the Committee will need to continue to engage in essentially the same consensus-building process that we always follow.  But at least all of us will have the same 2 percent inflation goal in mind when we have those discussions around the FOMC table, and on occasions where inflation deviates from that goal, the public will clearly understand our intention to bring inflation back to that goal over time, rather than wondering whether the Committee might allow inflation to drive upward indefinitely, as occurred in the 1970s, or engage in opportunistic disinflation. Moreover, as with any set of principles, the interpretation of a given phrase becomes increasingly settled over time in light of the actual policy decisions that the Committee makes under various circumstances.  I’m not a constitutional lawyer, but my impression is that pastprecedents have a very similar role in the decisionmaking processes of the U.S. Supreme Court.  For example, I believe that our decisions over the past few years have clearly demonstrated the Committee’s commitment to follow a balanced approach in promoting both aspects of our dual mandate, and our decisions going forward will provide further insights to the public and to future Committee participants about the meaning of the phrase “balanced approach” in our consensus statement. Indeed, this is one of several senses in which the consensus statement needs to be a living and breathing document.  The statement itself indicates that the Committee intends to reaffirm these principles at each organizational meeting, but we will need to go well beyond that to ensure that this document isn’t effectively dropped into the file cabinet and quickly forgotten.  For example, we should ensure that the staff throughout the Federal Reserve System becomes familiar with these principles, and we will need to use a wide array of communications tools to highlight and explain these principles to the general public, not just an initial publicity blitz, but through ongoing efforts in speeches, media interviews, academic conferences, and other initiatives. The statement also indicates that the Committee will make adjustments to these principles as appropriate.  In our discussion at the December meeting, we all agreed that there should be a high bar for such adjustments, again, roughly similar to making an amendment to a constitution.  However, I’m certainly envisioning that over time, we should plan to engage in further discussions and consensus-building regarding the contours of the Committee’s policy strategy, and it might well be the case that we can identify further principles that garner a very broad consensus of the Committee.  President Kocherlakota raised this idea in November when he referred to certain compelling features of the Committee’s loss functions, as I recall, symmetry and quasi-concavity.  But there may be other complementary approaches to consensus building,  such as considering the use of simple rules as policy benchmarks or even considering the principles that the Committee follows in responding to certain types of shocks, such as a transitory spike in oil prices.  At any rate, this is another sense in which the consensus statement can and should be a living and breathing document rather than just being tucked away in our file cabinets.  I would now like to move the consensus statement for adoption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is discussing the process of creating a consensus statement and emphasizes the importance of clarity and transparency in monetary policy decision making.


Passage number 79.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: To determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage, the actual passage needs to be provided. Please provide the passage in question for further analysis.


Passage number 80.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I’m now going to open the floor for comments, discussion, or questions.  I don’t think we need a full go-round because we’ve discussed these issues at great length, but I don’t want to inhibit anybody who would like to make a comment or raise an issue.  In particular, the floor is also open for proposed amendments, whether substantive or purely editorial.  Let me be clear that, given the nature of this document, it needs to have very broad-based support to be effective.  For that reason I think both substantive changes to the document or the ultimate adoption require a very high supermajority—essentially a very broad consensus.  Let me now open the floor.  Is there anyone who’d like to raise a question or propose an amendment.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply announces that the floor is open for comments, discussion, questions, and proposed amendments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 81.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’m having difficulty putting together your characterization of the statement, Mr. Chairman, with Governor Yellen’s characterization of the statement.  You seem to indicate that it was basically setting down as best we could what we think we currently do within this Committee. I think Governor Yellen used the term “momentous” and indicated a broad agenda that would follow from this statement, and I’m wondering if you could comment in a little more detail on how you see the significance of this statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo expresses his difficulty in reconciling the Chairman's characterization of the statement with Governor Yellen's characterization. He points out the difference between viewing the statement as a reflection of current beliefs within the Committee (Chairman's view) and seeing it as a momentous statement with a broad agenda (Governor Yellen's view). This indicates contention and disagreement between the two individuals.


Passage number 82.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Sure. I view this basically as a communication device. That being said, while not representing a change in our policy, it will be a vehicle by which we  can continue the conversation and make sure we clarify among ourselves what we agree on and what we don’t agree on.  Governor Yellen can speak for herself, but this certainly does not represent a change in the weights on our objectives. It does not represent a change in the basic approach to our policy.  It will be a vehicle for discussions in the future about how best to conduct policy.  Of course, we’ll have those anyway, but I view this—and I would like it to be represented by everyone as much as possible—as primarily a communications device and not some break in our approach to policy.  Governor Yellen, would you like to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is an explanation and clarification of the speaker's views on a particular issue.


Passage number 83.
 MS. YELLEN. I certainly agree with what you said and didn’t intend to convey a different view.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Yellen explicitly states her agreement and clarifies that she didn't intend to convey a different view.


Passage number 84.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "President Bullard" by itself does not indicate any conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 85.
 MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to go on the record as saying I very much support this statement.  I think it’s the culmination of a lot of long discussions around this table for many years, and in my view, this is not very different from what I would think of as a textbook statement on what flexible inflation targeting is.  I do not see it as an appreciable change in how the Committee actually behaves going forward.  We’ll still have many debates and many arguments about when to tighten and when not to tighten, when to ease and when not to ease. I do think it helps the Fed catch up to other central banks, which have run ahead of the Fed on this issue for quite a long time now, and I very much support the statement.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, expresses his support for a statement and believes it is a culmination of previous discussions, aligns with his understanding of flexible inflation targeting, and does not see it as a significant change in the committee's behavior. He also mentions that the statement helps the Fed catch up with other central banks.


Passage number 86.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 87.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly support the consensus statement.  The point I want to make, though, for this to be most effective, it’s really important that we’re all very parsimonious and prudent about how we talk about this consensus statement so that we don’t create confusion. As you said, the goal was clarity, transparency, and  accountability.  The best way to achieve that is to let you be pretty much center stage in talking about this.  If there are 17 different interpretations of what this consensus statement means, that’s very much going to undercut the value of it.  So in my view, you should have the center stage on this one.  The rest of us should serve as the Greek chorus supporting you as our main protagonist.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 88.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses gratitude.


Passage number 89.
 MR. LACKER.  I wanted to register my support for this.  Any one of us could write far more than this about monetary policy.  The resulting 17 documents might not overlap in their entirety, but this is, in my mind, a superb encapsulation of a set of consensus views—where we do overlap, where we do agree—and I see it bringing us together in our discussions going forward.  I very much support it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the passage, Mr. Lacker expresses his support for the 17 documents and states that he sees it as a way to bring them together in their discussions going forward. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 90.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other comments.  Governor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you" and the phrase "Other comments" are neutral and don't express any disagreement or contention. The word "Governor" appears to be a separate comment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 91.
 MR. TARULLO.  I should state for the record why I can’t support the document, and because it comes down to the same thing I’ve said before, I won’t say it at great length. I think the document has made vagueness a virtue to an excessive degree, and there’s a nontrivial risk that what comes out of this will actually be more of a cacophony than a clarification. I hope that doesn’t happen, and it may not happen, but when I compare it with what I think the benefits of the statement will be, I don’t think that a case has been made.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo expresses his disagreement by stating that he cannot support the document and gives reasons for his disagreement, mentioning that the document is excessively vague and may result in more confusion rather than clarification. He contrasts his opinion with the potential benefits of the document and concludes that a convincing case has not been made.


Passage number 92.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Other comments. [No response] All right. If there are no other comments, I propose to ask for a show of hands.  Let me explain that the records of the FOMC in the minutes will note both the outcome of the broad straw poll and the vote as the FOMC.  Because it is an official action, we should have an FOMC vote as a subset of the vote of participants.  And, again, we are looking here not for a simple majority, but for very broad-based support.  Let me ask: Of all participants, who supports the statement as it stands. [Show of hands] Opposed.  [No response]  Abstention.  [Show of hands] We have 16 in favor, and we have one abstention.  Thank you all.  Thank you to the subcommittee.  This is a very important step.  Again, we should all be cautious in not over-interpreting this document, and we want to give some time to the public to absorb the consequences.  But I do believe this will be an important step for the FOMC and will help us improve our communication and our accountability going forward. Thank you for that.   Shall we have lunch. Lunch is available now.  Why don’t we take 30 minutes for lunch, and let’s recommence at 12:45.  Thank you all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of procedural statements and expressions of gratitude.


Passage number 93.
 [Lunch recess] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Why don’t we recommence. We’re now up to item 8 on the agenda, financial developments and open market operations. Let me ask Brian Sack to make the presentation. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 94.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Questions for Brian.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply consists of a thank you message and a request for questions directed towards Brian.


Passage number 95.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, with respect to panel 4 on page 2, I want to make sure I’m correctly drawing two inferences.  One, which I think you came close to saying, is that the ECB’s new facility for the banks has, in all likelihood, facilitated purchases by the banks of sovereigns from their or the euro zone countries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a request for clarification and confirmation.


Passage number 96.
  MR. SACK.  I think that’s correct or, alternatively, has prevented them from selling securities at the pace they may have.  We do think that the LTRO is a large part of the explanation for the performance of the sovereign debt shown in the panel 4.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating Mr. Sack's opinion about the impact of LTRO on the performance of sovereign debt.


Passage number 97.
 MR. TARULLO.  Right, and the second, which is a negative inference, is that the fact that these are two-year rates suggests that anything beyond the LTRO period has not fundamentally been affected over the course of the past couple of months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states two observations made by Mr. Tarullo.


Passage number 98.
 MR. SACK.  That’s right.  You’ve not seen the narrowing of yield spreads in, say, 10-year securities or essentially any securities beyond the horizon of the LTRO to the extent that we’ve seen it at the short end of the curve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of fact about the narrowing of yield spreads in certain securities.


Passage number 99.
 MR. TARULLO. Putting those two inferences together, improvement, such as it is, is near-term and probably substantially if not totally because of the LTRO.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states two inferences and suggests that the improvement is likely due to LTRO.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 100.
 MR. SACK. We do think that the improvement at the short end of the sovereign debt markets has been largely attributable to the LTRO, and that it hasn’t backstopped the entire yield curve as effectively.  You can actually raise questions about whether it will continue to backstop the short end of the curve as effectively as it has so far, given the reasons I cited in the briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, is expressing doubt about whether the LTRO (Long-Term Refinancing Operation) will continue to be as effective in supporting the short end of the yield curve.


Passage number 101.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude.


Passage number 102.
 MR. KAMIN.  Governor Tarullo, if I can just add onto that.  I broadly agree with everything Brian said.  I think that, less for Italy than for other countries, there have been some much more muted downward movements in 10-year spreads for other sovereign areas, a little bit for Italy and a little bit more for Spain and some others.  So it’s possible that the effects of the LTRO in providing more liquidity, and in some sense improving the broader tone of investor sentiment, may have had some knock-on effects to longer maturities as well, not working mechanically through the wherewithal to purchase, but just through broader sentiment.  But the  issue really is the durability of that sentiment.  If some future shocks develop, the demand for the longer-term securities might just as easily turn south again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is agreement in the passage. Both Mr. Kamin and Governor Tarullo broadly agree on the effects of the LTRO in providing more liquidity and improving investor sentiment.


Passage number 103.
 MR. TARULLO. But I guess, Steve, the implicit question behind the questions I was asking Brian is:  Has investor sentiment with respect to the probability of repayment of a bond by Italy or Spain 5 to 10 years hence changed at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question asked to clarify the topic of conversation.


Passage number 104.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, by that metric it’s minutely smaller, but I think in broad terms, most people recognize that nothing fundamental has changed, consistent with Brian’s statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Both parties seem to be in agreement that nothing fundamental has changed.


Passage number 105.
 MR. SACK.  Yes.  To the extent there is some improvement farther out the curve, my point was just that it’s an order of magnitude different.  Ten-year Spanish yield spreads to German debt have narrowed 30 basis points since the previous FOMC, whereas you can see the short end has actually narrowed several hundred basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express contention or disagreement. It simply presents a comparison between the narrowing of ten-year Spanish yield spreads to German debt and the narrowing of the short end.


Passage number 106.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement indicated in the passage. It only mentions the title "President Kocherlakota" without providing any further context or information.


Passage number 107.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I wanted to ask about the same chart that Governor Tarullo was talking about.  I guess I don’t understand the mechanism involved.  If I’m a Spanish bank, I’m now able to borrow more cheaply at a three-year horizon from the ECB.  Why does that make me more willing to buy Spanish debt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, is expressing his lack of understanding and seeking clarification about the mechanism involved in a financial situation.


Passage number 108.
 MR. SACK. The story as told by market participants is now you’re assured that you will have that funding for three years.  It allows you to buy the debt, hold it to maturity, and if there’s no default, of course, earn the carry.  You could ask why that is so powerful when the ECB was doing one-year LTROs and presumably would maintain these fixed-rate full-allotment offerings as long as there were liquidity strains in the market. That’s one reason why we’re somewhat surprised by just how powerful the three-year LTROs seem to be.  But that’s the story of market participants—the assurance that the funding will be there over the term of the sovereign debt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing surprise and seeking to understand why the three-year LTROs are so powerful, but there is no clear disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 109.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. "Vice Chairman" is a title or position rather than a statement that can be agreed or disagreed with.


Passage number 110.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. If I could just interject, part of this is that from the banks’ perspective, they’re already dead if their sovereign goes down the tubes.  If they buy that debt and earn a positive spread, their chances of survival increase. It’s sort of a doubling down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is providing an explanation or perspective on the situation without contradicting or arguing against any other point.


Passage number 111.
 MR. TARULLO. It’s still providing zero capital.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that something is still providing zero capital.


Passage number 112.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I see.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states that the person named "Mr. Kocherlakota" understands or agrees with something.


Passage number 113.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it only mentions "President Fisher" without providing any further information or context to suggest disagreement.


Passage number 114.
 MR. FISHER.  Brian, I’m just wondering, as we go forward, about the informational value of the dealers’ opinion of our policy actions. I’m not surprised to see your first four slides in exhibit 3.  They reflect largely the Fed-speak of particular principals at this table uttered shortly before the dealer survey.  This is maybe not a statement but more of a question.  As we move forward with our own projections and the SEP exercise, I’m just wondering whether or not—expecting that the dealer surveys will probably reflect more what they’ve gleaned, which is the purpose of the exercise on the SEP—they are actually imparting useful information.  That’s a question maybe not to be answered now, but just something to observe as we go forward.  The correlation here between reflecting what’s been said by speakers that have a vote in this go-round and others and what we see in these four charts is not the least bit surprising.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  

Explanation: The passage is not expressing any disagreement or contention. It is a statement of questioning and observation about the informational value of dealers' opinions on policy actions.


Passage number 115.
 MR. SACK.  I would completely agree that FOMC communications are a very important factor shaping the market’s expectations.  I think that’s to be expected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker agrees that FOMC communications have a significant impact on the market's expectations.


Passage number 116.
 MR. FISHER.  It’s more confirmation than imparting new information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement made by Mr. Fisher and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 117.
 MR. SACK.  Right, and of course, this survey doesn’t at all get into how they arrive at these expectations, what pieces of information they’re using, and what they’re ignoring.  Obviously the information that has been provided to market participants is changing with the decisions that you’re making.  That will all be reflected in this. I’m working under the assumption that it’s still useful for policymakers to understand at the policy meeting exactly what is priced in the markets and what the market participants’ views are. That’s our intention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their intention to provide policymakers with information about market participants' views and what is priced in the markets.


Passage number 118.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. "Thank you" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply an expression of gratitude.


Passage number 119.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the statement "President Williams." This is a neutral statement that simply refers to a person's title or position without expressing any contradictory views or opinions.


Passage number 120.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: Without knowing the full passage or context, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 121.
 WILLIAMS.  I have a question about figure 12, Estimated Effect of SOMA Balance Sheet on Term Premium. As the footnote says, the effect comes from the way we model it.  As I understand how that model works, the effect on the term premium is declining in the forecast period because, as we’re getting closer and closer to exit, the markets are looking forward at the expected size of our balance sheet in the future. My question is:  Do you have an idea of market participants’ views on what this chart would look like in terms of the effects of our balance sheet policies both currently and going forward over the next couple of years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and asking for market participants' views.


Passage number 122.
 MR. SACK. We’ve used the dealer survey on occasion to ask about the effects of different balance sheet programs. I think collectively those responses indicate that the market believes the balance sheet programs have sizable effects. Generally speaking, the calibration has probably been close to but a bit larger than what we’ve typically found in internal work.  But we have not asked about the persistence or the dynamics of how they unwind over time.  We don’t know that part.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the use of a dealer survey and the findings it has provided so far. They acknowledge that the market believes the balance sheet programs have significant effects but state that they haven't delved into the persistence or dynamics of how they unwind over time. There is no disagreement or opposing viewpoint expressed.


Passage number 123.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The passage only states the name "President Plosser" without providing any further information or context to indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 124.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I have three questions for Brian.  First, just as a mechanical matter— looking at table 18, exhibit 3—you have 635 MBS transactions to get to $98 billion.  Tell me a little bit about the mechanics.  Obviously they’re small lots, but why does it work out that we have to do it in such small pieces. It seems a lot relative to other operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is simply seeking clarification on the mechanics of the MBS transactions.


Passage number 125.
  MR. SACK.  Right.  They’re very different in nature.  Remember, when we do Treasury operations, whether sales or purchases, we run them as discrete operations over FedTrade.  We have all 21 dealers participating, and it has that structure of a very discrete, large operation.  When we do MBS purchases, we transact differently.  We transact over a private trading system called Tradeweb, and we’re more of a participant trading in the market the way a number of other participants trade. Now, that process still involves a competitive process across dealers.  We put out an interest in buying securities, we receive quotes from four dealers, and we choose the best one.  It’s still competitive, but it’s done in a more continuous way, analogous to secondary market trading of other market participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 126.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  The two more substantive questions relate to my understanding about the LTRO.  This is partly related to President Kocherlakota’s question.  My understanding is we don’t really know who bought these government securities.  Is there evidence on the balance sheets of the Spanish banks or the other European banks that they’ve actually increased their holdings of the sovereign debt. Can we match it up in some way. Is there really data on that or not, or is this just speculation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and information about the LTRO and whether there is evidence to support the increase in holdings of government securities by Spanish banks and other European banks.


Passage number 127.
 MR. SACK. We cannot, but the ECB included some charts and text in its monthly bulletin that showed that the participation of individual banks was actually correlated with the funding needs that they face over the next three years. They were arguing that they thought that this was evidence that the LTRO was being used, to some degree at least, as a pre-funding mechanism to address the rollover issue that I was highlighting in panel 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply describing an argument made by the ECB about the correlation between individual banks' participation in the LTRO and their funding needs.


Passage number 128.
 MR. PLOSSER. It’s sort of indirect though, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply presents a statement made by Mr. Plosser without any indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 129.
 MR. REEVE. It’s very indirect on what the banks then did with those funds.  We, in fact, do not really have any information on whether or not specific banks have increased their purchases, either of their own country’s sovereign bonds or other euro-area bonds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Reeve, is stating that they do not have information on whether specific banks have increased their purchases of sovereign bonds. This implies a lack of agreement on the matter.


Passage number 130.
 MR. PLOSSER.  So it’s still a bit speculative as to how tight this link is between the funding and what has happened to these spreads, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser is simply stating that the link between funding and the spreads is still uncertain or speculative.


Passage number 131.
 MR. SACK.  Yes, absolutely.  We should not underestimate the importance of the LTRO for the assurance on the bank funding side.  I think taking that tail risk out of the market was extremely important.  But I think the question is the extent to which it supports the sovereigns or will continue.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states the importance of the LTRO for bank funding and poses a question regarding its support for sovereigns.


Passage number 132.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Right.  That’s really the link I was trying to get at. Going back to yields, I have one more question that I guess is related.  I asked this question last time, and I just want to hear your view.  One of the clear implications from the sovereign debt crisis and what’s been going on in Europe over the past six months has been a degree to which there has been a flight to quality, to the U.S. dollar.  Some of the reduction in yields on U.S. Treasuries, I suspect, has something to do with shifting risks and flights to safety.  Do you have any sense about how to tease that out from other things that are going on in the shorter-term debt markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question and request for an opinion from the speaker.


Passage number 133.
 MR. SACK. It’s certainly very difficult.  Market participants certainly talk about a flight-to-quality effect.  We think it’s there, but it’s hard to calibrate. It’s not showing up in some of the measures we looked at in the past—like the on-the-run premium or swap spreads.  It’s not a flight to absolute liquidity or the most liquid assets, but it could still be a flight into the safest assets—Treasury securities.  Maybe the most relevant information are measures of the term premium.  I think this flight to quality or this investor preference relative to risk would be reflected in the term premium—that is, how much expected return the investor is willing to giveup to hold a risk-free asset.  And it is true the term premium has moved down a lot and is at extremely low levels. One measure of the Kim-Wright term premiums that the Board’s staff uses is at minus 50 basis points, so investors are actually giving up expected return to hold Treasury securities. It’s not clear that the timing of that exactly corresponds with European stresses, but from a bigger picture it is consistent with the story that investors really are seeking the safety of Treasury securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the difficulty in measuring the flight-to-quality effect and explaining their belief that it may be reflected in measures of the term premium. They also mention that the term premium has moved down to low levels, indicating a preference for the safety of Treasury securities.


Passage number 134.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  Great.  Thank you very much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is expressing gratitude or appreciation for something.


Passage number 135.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is because the phrase "President Lockhart" simply states someone's position or title without providing any information that can lead to a disagreement or contention.


Passage number 136.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On exhibit 1, I’m just trying to anticipate what could happen.  Overall you seem to be painting an improved and relatively encouraging picture.  The LTRO is at its limit, is it not, or close to its limit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 137.
 MR. SACK.  No, it’s not.  As I mentioned in the briefing, they will conduct a second three-year LTRO in late February, and the amount of activity is expected to go up notably among market participants.  And they’re not at their limit because the banks have collateral that can be used to borrow from the ECB.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact about the expected increase in activity among market participants and the availability of collateral for borrowing from the ECB. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 138.
 MR. LOCKHART. Then if you look at the maturities in exhibit 2, that looks relatively manageable it would seem to me with an LTRO backstop and markets getting more comfortable.  Even if it’s slightly front-loaded, it’s still spread well, and it’s pretty manageable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their view that the maturities in exhibit 2 seem relatively manageable, supported by the presence of an LTRO backstop and an increasing comfort in the markets. They mention that even if the maturities are slightly front-loaded, they are still spread well and considered manageable.


Passage number 139.
 MR. SACK. That’s correct. That’s the right interpretation, that the LTRO has been used heavily, could be used further given the availability of collateral, and in that regard can be used to offset these maturing debt payments and assure the banks that they have funding.  Let me just mention quickly, as I noted in my briefing text, the expansion of the collateral that the ECB accepts. That was equally as important perhaps as extending the horizon of the LTRO from oneyear to three years.  That meaningfully increased the capacity of banks to borrow.  And so in a jurisdiction where collateral is becoming a more binding constraint, this is a very important constraint to loosen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is agreement and no contention in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the interpretation that the LTRO has been used heavily and can be used further to offset maturing debt payments. They also agree on the importance of the expansion of collateral accepted by the ECB.


Passage number 140.
 MR. LOCKHART. Are there any rating events that are in the relative near term that could go badly in some way and throw this improving picture off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The question asked by Mr. Lockhart is seeking information and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 141.
 MR. SACK. The market navigated through the S&P downgrades, which I think were the most meaningful ratings threat in the near term. Regarding sovereign debt, many of the countries are still on negative watch from S&P as well as from other agencies.  So we certainly can’t rule out additional ratings downgrades.  Now, it might be useful to talk for a minute about what that means exactly. If there are ratings downgrades, we never know exactly how markets will react.  We never know the extent to which there is mandate-driven selling by investors, and it is not easy to judge how much pressure it would put on markets broadly.  What it probably won’t do is significantly impair the ability of banks to use the ECB to help fund those securities.  The ECB has loosened its ratings requirements, and it accepts sovereign debt down to a BBB-rating, which means that there is room for downgrades and this debt will still be eligible as collateral to the ECB.  And the ECB has shown, in exceptional cases, it is willing to even suspend that requirement.  I think the big picture here is we could see more ratings actions.  It shouldn’t affect the ability to use the ECB to help fund these securities, but it could have other market consequences that are hard to judge.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the potential for ratings downgrades and the potential consequences but does not express any contradictory viewpoints.


Passage number 142.
 MR. LOCKHART.  And one final question, if I may.  How important in this is the negotiation over the haircuts of the Greek debt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. The question is a straightforward inquiry about the importance of negotiating the haircuts of the Greek debt.


Passage number 143.
 MR. SACK. I think it is a wildcard—a significant near-term risk event.  The negotiations seemed to get far enough along that they were debating over a final few details.  And one could   wonder if it would really be worth letting the whole thing unravel based on those details. I think there is still a good chance they will get to a PSI agreement and will proceed.  If they do not get to a PSI agreement, though, it raises a lot of questions about what happens next.  If collective action clauses are put into the securities and are used at the default event, it would trigger the CDS.  And it is hard to predict just how damaging that would be to markets.  It is certainly a risk that many market participants are worried about, but it is hard to anticipate exactly what would happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, the speaker is expressing their own thoughts and opinions about a specific situation. They mention the various possibilities and potential outcomes, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement with any other party.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 144.
 MR. REEVE.  If I could just add on to that, President Lockhart.  There is a very near-term risk that Greece could default as soon as March, if this deal doesn’t go through and does not get near-universal participation on the part of the private creditors, which seems a rather high hurdle to achieve.  But even if that PSI deal does go through, the prospects for Greece still are full of tremendous risk over the next couple of years because they require another very substantial financing package from the European Union and presumably the IMF as well.  And yesterday the EU finance ministers said that they have no intention of increasing the size of that package that they had agreed on in October.  By our reckoning, Greece just doesn’t quite get there with that amount of funds.  They are going to need more.  It has got to come from somewhere. So we have both very acute near-term stresses related to the Greek deal, but also some longer-term ones.  As a final point, there have been two exceptions to this improvement in market sentiment in Europe since December.  One is Greece, of course, and the other is Portugal.  And we have started to see some contagion from what is happening with the Greece PSI deal now starting to rattle investors who are holding Portuguese debt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention and disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Reeve, is highlighting the risks and challenges facing Greece and suggesting that the current deal may not be sufficient to address their financial needs. He also mentions the lack of intention to increase the financing package by the EU finance ministers. This suggests a difference of opinion or disagreement regarding the adequacy of the current measures in place to address the Greek debt crisis.


Passage number 145.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman, did you have an intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 146.
VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I agree with Brian.  This has been a positive development.  There are two negatives to note.  One, more and more of the borrowing of these banks is being done on a collateralized basis rather than uncollateralized basis. There is a question of all of the collateral being encumbered.  And, two, the banks are not dealing with one another; they are using the ECB as the intermediary.  So the private-market functioning is definitely not working.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents both agreement and disagreement. The author agrees with Brian's statement that this development has been positive. However, they then point out two negatives, suggesting disagreement or concern regarding the increasing collateralized borrowing, potential encumbrance of collateral, and reliance on the ECB as an intermediary instead of direct banking interactions.


Passage number 147.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but there is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement regarding President Bullard.


Passage number 148.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to talk a little bit about exhibit 3, chart 14:  Probability Distribution of First Increase in Federal Funds Target Rate. I don’t know about the rest of you; I found this a little bit disturbing.  If I am interpreting this correctly, and maybe I’m not, this has the December survey showing no probability of the funds rate being raised after the first half of 2014, and then it shows all this probability spilling out in the January survey.  I want an explanation of what the source of that is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's confusion and request for clarification.


Passage number 149.
 MR. SACK.  Right.  In the December survey, when we asked this question, we had 10 quarterly buckets, and the last bucket was Q2 of 2014.  What happened was most of the mass was in that last bucket, so you should interpret that high bar as the cumulative probability of being either in the first half of 2014 or beyond, because our question didn’t go out far enough.  In this survey, we extended it to 2016.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply explaining the methodology of a survey and the extension of the time frame for the survey. There is no clear indication of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 150.
 MR. BULLARD.  It is kind of hard to tell how much the probability has really changed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their observation about the difficulty in determining the change in probability.


Passage number 151.
 MR. SACK.  Right.  You can only tell essentially by looking at the bars before then.  Clearly, the probabilities assigned to 2013 came down, so the probability of being in 2014 or beyond went up, but we don’t know exactly when. It’s a problem when you don’t actually have enough buckets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining that without enough specific categories or "buckets" to assign probabilities to, it is difficult to determine exactly when a certain event occurred.


Passage number 152.
  MR. BULLARD.  Maybe in the future we should have like a 10-year horizon.  [Laughter]  Between December and January, what do you think is the source of putting less probability sooner and more probability later.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard suggests considering a 10-year horizon in the future, and his question in the second part is open-ended, seeking opinions or thoughts. The laughter after his comment suggests a light-hearted tone, rather than any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 153.
 MR. SACK. It is interesting that when you look at markets you have risk assets moving higher.  We could question whether that optimism is warranted or not, but you have it showing up. But rates didn’t move up, and we can see from panel 11 that policy expectations actually got nudged out some.  I don’t know exactly what the source is.  I do think there has been increased discussion of both asset purchase programs and the use of rate guidance to push expectations out.  Perhaps markets have been reading those signals as suggesting that the FOMC is going to be very patient, even though at the same time they are getting more optimistic in other ways.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely discussing observations and speculations about market behavior and policy expectations.


Passage number 154.
 MR. BULLARD. I thought maybe the Committee had stuck with the mid-2013 language and that was sort of holding market expectations in a little bit. There was maybe more discussion of adjusting it, but I’m not really sure that the discussion on that really changed, because the discussion by participants here seemed to be that we are going to have to do something sooner or later about the calendar date.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply stating his thoughts and observations about the Committee's discussion on adjusting the mid-2013 language. He is unsure if the discussion actually changed anything.


Passage number 155.
 MR. SACK. Right.  Well, I think there is a general sense in markets that the mid-2013 language will be adjusted and will be pushed out, and that the changes in the SEP make this meeting an opportune time to do that.  And perhaps because the Committee has decided to communicate about the funds rate path and, as I said, because some members have been discussing asset purchase programs, expectations were nudged out.  Of course, this is not a large revision to policy expectations; they were nudged out, but fairly modestly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any specific statement of disagreement or contention. The speaker is simply discussing the general sense in markets and the expectations of policy adjustments.


Passage number 156.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide any information about the presence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 157.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given statement, "President Kocherlakota," does not present any disagreement or contention, as it simply states the position held by President Kocherlakota without any conflicting information.


Passage number 158.
MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  I had a quick question, which I should have interjected as a two-hander.  Brian, you mentioned that the term premium is down 50 basis points.  That is, I assume, the nominal term premium.  Do you have an estimate available for the real term premium.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Kocherlakota is simply asking a question for clarification.


Passage number 159.
 MR. SACK.  I don’t have one on my fingertips, but I can venture a guess that a lot of the downward movement has been in the real term premium, because we know that real forward rates have fallen pretty meaningfully over this same period that the term premium measures have declined.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Sack, is stating that he does not have specific data immediately available but is offering a possibility based on his knowledge that real forward rates have fallen.


Passage number 160.
 MS. LIANG. In the asset valuation package, there are estimates of the Treasury term premium, both nominal and real estimates.  And we have three estimates—from the Board staff, New York, and San Francisco.  The nominal term premium estimates run—if I look at the Board staff estimates—about 50 basis points, as Brian said, and the real is just a little bit negative. One of the models is a little more negative, but they are roughly similar.  The nominal is where the big changes have been in the past year or so, reflecting in part safe-haven considerations and in part maybe SOMA.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the different estimates of the Treasury term premium.


Passage number 161.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, Nellie.  All right. If there are no other questions, we need to vote to ratify domestic open market operations from the December meeting.  Any objections.  [No response]  Hearing no objections, we will move on now to item 9, economic and financial situation, and I will call on Eric Engen to introduce the staff presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply asks if there are any objections and when no response is heard, they proceed with the next item on the agenda.


Passage number 162.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much for that presentation.  The floor is open.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you very much for that presentation" suggests appreciation, while "The floor is open" implies that people are invited to speak or share their views. Lastly, "President Plosser" seems to be a reference to an individual rather than a source of disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 163.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tealbook’s forecasts in general seem to be on the weak side relative both to the SEP projections as well as some private forecasters.  One aspect of the difference that struck me was business fixed investment, and I would like to get some clarification on it.  In our business outlook survey, the diffusion index for prospective capital expenditures actually doubled from 10 to 20 in January.  I would also note that in the SPF—the Survey of Professional Forecasters—the projections for business fixed investment in 2012 are in the neighborhood of 5.8 or 6 percent, while the staff’s forecast is just barely over 2 percent.  And, indeed, the slowdown in business investment from 2011 to 2012 is actually knocking something like ½ percentage point off your forecasted GDP growth.  What I would like is some insight as to what is knocking you down from 7½ percent, or whatever it is this year, to 2 percent in 2011. Is it add factors. Is it uncertainty.  What’s feeding through in your projections for business fixed investment.  That seems to be a very important part of the forecast, so I would like some elaboration on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation:
In this passage, Mr. Plosser is expressing his disagreement with the Tealbook's forecasts for business fixed investment. He points out that the Tealbook's forecast is lower than other projections from the SEP and private forecasters. He asks for clarification and elaboration on the factors that are leading to the lower forecasted growth in business fixed investment. Therefore, there is a clear disagreement or contention in this passage.


Passage number 164.
 MR. ENGEN.  There are two parts of that.  First, on equipment and software, in the recent data, we have seen a slowdown that is consistent with what we had been anticipating for the fourth and the first quarter.  Moreover, we have also seen that although business sentiment measures have improved since the fall, they are still below what they were a year ago, and our judgment is that the uncertainty about Europe and about the overall economy having prevailed for a while has led to somewhat damped expectations for the path for E&S expenditures.  On nonresidential investment, there are two parts to that.  We see drilling and mining structures continuing to rise briskly with higher oil prices and other energy prices, as well as with the new and profitable technologies that they are using.  We did see some bounce-up in nonresidential structures outside of drilling and mining in the middle of last year.  We think that that is primarily transitory, due to some expiring provisions for tax credits for some types of power industries.  And so when we look at the fundamentals in that sector of vacancy rates, restrained credit, and other things like that, we think that we will return to the slow and subdued level of nonresidential investment outside of drilling and mining that we saw earlier last year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It mainly discusses different factors influencing equipment and software expenditures and nonresidential investment, and provides an analysis based on available data and the speaker's judgment.


Passage number 165.
 MR. WILCOX.  If I might just add, you are correct, President Plosser, that the business investment forecast is taking about ½ percentage point off GDP growth this year compared with last year.  That is unrevised from the December Tealbook, so our projection in this regard is just as it was in December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any assertion or statement that could be interpreted as contentious or disagreeable. It is simply providing information from a previous report without any contradictory or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 166.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "President Fisher" does not provide any information or context for there to be contention or disagreement. It simply refers to a person without mentioning anything about their actions, beliefs, or opinions that could cause dispute.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 167.
 MR. FISHER.  I wanted to talk about Europe for just a second because in your presentation we talked about spreads, particularly on Spain and Italy, and we talked about the French banks.  For reasons that may be peculiar to me, I continue to worry about the French primary fiscal deficit and developments that might occur during the course of an election year.  Do we have concerns about France, or am I alone at this table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that Mr. Fisher is expressing his concerns about the French primary fiscal deficit and potential developments during an election year. He asks if anyone else at the table shares his concerns, implying that there may be disagreement or differing opinions among the individuals present.


Passage number 168.
 MR. REEVE.  No, I don’t think you are alone.  We are actually fairly concerned about all of the fiscal adjustment programs that are in place in Europe, not just in France.  Now, France’s may be at more risk, I suppose, because of the election.  But with the exception of Germany,which is going to overshoot its target for 2011, the rest of them look likely that they will miss it, although in some cases, like Italy, by a small margin. Italy didn’t have much of an adjustment to do between 2010 and 2011, but it has an absolutely massive adjustment to do next year and the following year.  And Spain, which missed its target by at least 2 percent of GDP in 2011, is almost surely going to have to negotiate a revision to its target for 2012, especially in light of the deterioration in the outlook for economic growth. My own preference would be that the whole constellation of fiscal targets would be renegotiated at the European Commission level, with new targets that are a little friendlier to economic growth and not quite so “damn the torpedoes, full steam ahead.” But of course Spain’s initial reaction to missing its target was to announce another 1½ percent of structural cuts.  There is a fine balance around going too far, and the key test will of course be how markets respond to these developments as they unfold.  But, clearly, the whole fiscal situation is one of the main, if not the main, factor that is underpinning our very weak outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their concern about fiscal adjustment programs in Europe and suggesting potential revisions to targets for economic growth.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 169.
 MR. FISHER.  On the domestic side of the presentation, we referred to a faster snapback scenario.  On the European and the foreign side, the only alternative scenario is basically severe stress or it could be worse than we think.  There is that asymmetry.  Although I would like to hear of happier scenarios, my concern is that the big issue that could drop could be France, and I would urge us to continue to be mindful of the risk that that presents, particularly given what is happening politically in France.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher expresses concern about the potential economic situation in France, while also expressing a desire to hear more positive scenarios.


Passage number 170.
 MR. REEVE.  I agree that we are much more worried about the downside risks than we are about upside risks.  In December, we did do an upside scenario in the Tealbook.  We fully admit that we could be surprised in the other direction.  And some of the calming of financial markets and a few little upticks in some recent indicators suggest there may be some upside   potential to the outlook, but nothing sounding very strong to us to make us change our basic outlook going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there might be some potential for upside surprises but states that it is not strong enough to change their overall outlook.


Passage number 171.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This phrase is a polite expression of gratitude and does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 172.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context about President Lacker, so it is impossible to determine if there is any contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 173.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The fixed net asset value of our money market funds, as you know, provides this inefficient, overly large incentive to avoid realized losses on a fund and to get your money out early and run.  I take it the SEC’s proposals are unlikely to include floating net asset value, and I’d appreciate the staff’s assessment of the likelihood that the measures they are likely to propose will buffer the money market funds from the run-like catastrophe that we saw in ’08.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker, expressing his understanding and opinion on the SEC's proposals regarding money market funds.


Passage number 174.
 MR. GALLIN.  It looks likely that their opening bid on the size of the capital buffers is not going to be particularly large.  We don’t know exactly what they are going to propose.  It will be out fairly soon.  There is the potential for the rules, if they were actually implemented, to make a meaningful dent in the runability on funds. It depends really on the implementation and, in particular, on how the potential holdback provisions are linked to the capital buffers.  If they are well designed and integrated well, you could have a meaningful fix to the situation.  However, we have to wait to see what proposed rule they actually come out with, and then we have to wait to see what happens with the comments, and we have to wait to see what actually gets implemented.  There is a real chance that what would come out would be watered down and not be effective.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing potential outcomes and uncertainties regarding the proposed rules and their implementation.


Passage number 175.
 MR. TARULLO.  Josh, Jeff, it is probably worth adding that there has been a very big shift in the lobbying center of gravity on this over the past few months.  The hardliners in the money market fund industries who were saying “no changes at all” have gained a bit of theascendancy and knocked out the entities that were trying to forge a compromise. I would actually be slightly darker than Josh on the prospects for something meaningful getting out of the SEC.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It merely states a shift in lobbying dynamics and expresses a slightly pessimistic view on the prospects for a meaningful outcome from the SEC.


Passage number 176.
 MR. FISHER.  Including ad hominem attacks against Eric Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. It only mentions that ad hominem attacks have been made against Eric Rosengren without expressing any opinion or stance on the matter.


Passage number 177.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  He is not the only one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that Mr. Tarullo is not the only person, which is not a conflicting statement.


Passage number 178.
 MR. LACKER.  On the side of darkness, letters from Jerry Hawke are darkening my inbox these days, as I mentioned to many of you.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply expressing that they have been receiving letters from Jerry Hawke which they find to be troubling or negative.


Passage number 179.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage only mentions the title "President Kocherlakota" without any additional information or context. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 180.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a question about the liability structure of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  The picture on exhibit 12 gives a good snapshot in time, but I am interested in trends in the liability structure.  Has there been a decrease or an increase in the dependence on short-term funding over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 181.
 MR. GALLIN.  In the QS report, we actually had some time series on this on page 6.  The trends have been roughly flat over the past few years.  The more traditional bank-like holding companies—Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, and Citi—have a little bit more of a decline in their reliance on short-term funding, but nothing much for Goldman and Morgan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting information from a report about the trends in reliance on short-term funding for different bank-like holding companies.


Passage number 182.
 MS. LIANG.  Can I add just one thing to that.  Their ratios have been pretty flat.  Since the crisis, their assets have shrunk quite a bit.  That is opposed to the deposits, which have been increasing at the bank holding companies, and so their reliance on other types of short-term, nondeposit funding have fallen.  Relative to independents, like MF Global or Jeffries, for example, these are actually quite a bit lower. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would have more capital and more long-term debt relative to the independents.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the ratios and financial situations of different banks without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 183.
 MR. LACKER.  Two hands.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that there are two hands, without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 184.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the phrase "two-hander" without further context. The term "two-hander" typically refers to a play or movie scene that involves only two characters, but it does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement between the characters.


Passage number 185.
 MR. LACKER. I know in the case of Bank of America, the asset side is very different as well with respect to liquidity management. You talked about the time-series change and their position.  My understanding is that their liquidity buffers have substantially strengthened at some of the larger firms, if you take into account the assets they hold.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their understanding of the situation regarding Bank of America's liquidity buffers.


Passage number 186.
 MR. GALLIN.  If you net short-term investments against short-term liabilities, for instance, dependence ratios have come down a lot for some banks.  I have looked at Y9C data, which are not the perfect kind of data that a bank supervisor could look at.  I always am a little nervous about netting out these big, broad categories that may not be perfectly maturity matched, but the supervisors presumably would have the data to look at that in more detail and more appropriately.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mainly expressing the speaker's hesitation and uncertainty about using certain data for analysis.


Passage number 187.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, for one thing, they are holding a lot of reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the entity holding a lot of reserves.


Passage number 188.
 MR. GALLIN.  That’s true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "That's true" implies agreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 189.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement addressing a person.


Passage number 190.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You have a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that "You have a two-hander," without any conflicting or opposing ideas.


Passage number 191.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Well, I had another question.  I’m always glad to yield the floor to President Lacker.  He always has such interesting things to say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses a positive opinion of President Lacker.


Passage number 192.
 MR. LACKER. I will yield the remainder of my time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is willingly giving up his remaining time to another person.


Passage number 193.
  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  My question is about the “Lost Decade” scenario.  The thing I found puzzling about that scenario is that we had continued downward drift in inflation throughout that.  You could imagine a lost-decade scenario that would be maybe slightly different than the one that staff programmed up, one with so much supply-side damage that actually you are going to end up with increases in inflation alongside increases in unemployment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question and comment made by MR. KOCHERLAKOTA regarding the "Lost Decade" scenario.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 194.
 MR. ENGEN.  Yes.  There is, as I noted, some supply-side damage involved in this scenario in terms of lower participation rates, a higher NAIRU, and lower potential, but not enough to get the kind of result that you were mentioning.  A Tealbook alternative that I didn’t highlight here that may have had a little more of what you are talking about was the “Greater Supply-Side Damage.” It continued with the weak economy, but with greater supply-side damage that policymakers are slow to recognize.  In that different scenario, you then can get a boost in inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges some supply-side damage but disagrees that it would result in the outcome mentioned by the other person. They also suggest an alternative scenario with "greater supply-side damage" that policymakers are slow to recognize, indicating a difference in opinion or perspective.


Passage number 195.
  MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  What would be your thoughts on what would be happening to inflation expectations.  If you look at this dotted line in exhibit 3, it is just heading downward.  How would inflation expectations be reacting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking for the other person's thoughts or opinion on how inflation expectations would be reacting based on a visual representation provided.


Passage number 196.
 MR. ENGEN. We assumed that inflation expectations are anchored.  It is one of the things that keeps inflation from dropping further. If it was the case that you also had a big drop in inflation expectations, then clearly inflation could fall quite a bit further.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a hypothetical situation and making a logical deduction from it.


Passage number 197.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 


Explanation: The quoted passage does not present any information or opinions that would suggest contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 198.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 199.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I was listening to the SEP presentation from Joyce, a question occurred to me that relates to the strategic framework statement that we just adopted.  I don’t know if it’s fair game to point this out—you might want to wave it off for another time—but the Committee just adopted what I think is a terrific framework statement about how we conduct policy in line with how we have been doing it.  And I certainly agree with President Lacker that if 17 of us were going to write down one of these statements it would take different forms.  But I think that we found a pretty good intersection of our views.  But looking at exhibit 1, our forecast for the unemployment rate exhibits a long period of substantial deviations above what everybody’s long-run sustainable unemployment rate is, and yet the core PCE inflation forecast has absolutely no overshooting whatsoever embodied in everyone’s forecast.  Then, on top of that, we have the federal funds rate projections that we will be presenting at the press conference tomorrow, and those indicate some people’s tightening begins this year, and then as we proceed more indicate tightening.  A question, particularly if you were to bring out the strategic framework at the press conference, would be:  How is it that we interpret this as a balanced approach to dealing with these substantial deviations.  This could be a defining characteristic of how we portray balanced approach.  I don’t know if anybody has given thought to that.  I didn’t expect this exactly until I saw the projections.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is asking a question and expressing uncertainty about how to interpret certain projections and forecasts.


Passage number 200.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think it is something we ought to talk about.  The issue you raise is very legitimate. I will let people speak for themselves, probably tomorrow, but I suppose one argument would be that, if you believe that we are out of tools, that would be one explanation.  But if you think we have effective tools, then it is hard to explain that path.  Is that okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of someone expressing their thoughts and opinions on a topic and considering different perspectives.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 201.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in the passage. The use of the word "Yes" indicates that there is disagreement or opposition to something previously mentioned.


Passage number 202.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions Governor Duke without mentioning any specific action or statement that would imply contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 203.
 MS. DUKE.  Mine is just a question.  The Tealbook forecast seems to be way outside of what the central tendency and even in a couple of cases the range, which seems unusual to me. Is this unusual, happening from time to time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

There is contention in the passage because the speaker mentions that the Tealbook forecast is way outside of what is considered usual according to the central tendency and range. This implies a disagreement or discrepancy between the Tealbook forecast and what is expected or typical.


Passage number 204.
 MS. ZICKLER.  I think that they are usually a little bit closer than this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not demonstrate any contention or disagreement. It simply states an opinion about a situation.


Passage number 205.
   MR. WILCOX.  I think this is a little unusual.  I wanted to come back as well to the question of our relationship to outside forecasters, too.  We are a little more pessimistic, though not much more pessimistic.  The Blue Chip consensus projection, for example, of the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 is 8.0, and we are at 8.2.  This is within a pretty narrow range, given the width of our confidence interval.  I would say, yes, we are on the pessimistic side of the center of gravity of opinion, and probably this is a little unusual in terms of our relative position compared with Committee participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that their projection for the unemployment rate is slightly higher than the consensus projection, but acknowledges that it is still within a narrow range. There is no dispute or argument taking place.


Passage number 206.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 207.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 208.
 MR. PLOSSER. I have a two-hander because I want to follow up on the question I asked when we started this off. I wanted to come back to investment because I think investment plays an important role in this somewhat weaker forecast.  I didn’t quite get an answer to the question.  Given where the private sector is on the forecast for business fixed investment, I’m trying to figure out how much of your lower forecast is add factors or judgment calls relative to your investment equations.  Can you give me some sense about how those two things affect your forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Plosser is expressing disagreement about not receiving a satisfactory answer to his question and is seeking clarification on the factors affecting the forecast.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 209.
 MR. ENGEN. Certainly there is some judgment in it in the following sense.  When we think about how much we’ve marked down the forecast relative to last June, some of that is direct. As Trevor showed, there is the effect of the exchange value of the dollar on exports.  Some of that is indirect in the sense that we saw that measures of sentiment both for businesses and households went down.  They’ve recovered some, but they’re still pretty subdued.  Risk premiums have risen, and how much to attribute that to more transitory factors and how much is going to weigh on the forecast for a while is always a judgment.  How much of that was directly  related to Europe and how much was other factors as well as how much has weighed specifically on the investment is hard to parse exactly.  But even though businesses in the past couple of years have invested at a fast rate in order to build back up their capital stock to a certain degree, it is the case that we think some of this uncertainty and subdued sentiment going forward will weigh on it.  Some other surveys on capital expenditures that we have looked at, for example those that ask firms what their thinking is on this, indicate that uncertainty and the difficulty in planning long-term projects is part of it, but I can’t give you an exact amount from our forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker mentions that the amount of risk premiums and the factors contributing to it (such as Europe) are difficult to determine exactly. This suggests that there may be disagreement or uncertainty among experts or economists regarding these factors and their impact on the forecast.


Passage number 210.
 MR. WILCOX.  For what it’s worth, we’re running a little ahead of our preferred staff model.  We’re not add-factoring down the E&S projection to get a lower forecast.  We think we’re taking a small bet that there is still a little bit of pent-up demand for replacement of aging equipment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 211.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in Mr. Plosser's statement; he is simply expressing gratitude.


Passage number 212.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 213.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to talk about exhibit 11 at the bottom, Conditional Value at Risk.  I want to get clarification on what this is showing.  I would say that this is a high reading; what does it mean. In particular, what are the units here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply requesting clarification and seeking more information about exhibit 11.


Passage number 214.
 MR. GALLIN.  The way I showed the CoVaR—Conditional Value at Risk—is an index, but if I hadn’t indexed it, it would show a dollar amount that the financial system could lose in an extreme but plausible event—for example, a 5 percent tail event loss to the financial system, conditional on an extreme stress event at a specific firm. Again, in that case it’s operationalized with the 5 percent extreme event for a specific firm. It is done firm by firm—the note at the bottom says which banks it is for—and it’s added up for that and then indexed.  It’s a high reading, which suggests that there’s a fair bit of systemic risk right now in the system.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation of how the CoVaR index is calculated and stating that it indicates a high level of systemic risk in the financial system.


Passage number 215.
  MR. BULLARD. What I’d like to know is how much the dollar value is. But also, we actually had an event in 2008 and 2009, so what does it mean when this thing peaks.  Does that match up with actual loss to the financial system during that period or is that not what’s going on here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing curiosity and seeking clarification about the relationship between the peak value mentioned and the actual loss suffered by the financial system during the 2008-2009 event.


Passage number 216.
 MR. GALLIN.  The amount was on the order of something like $150, $250 billion.  There’s a conceptual idea of measuring the risk to the system from a distress at an institution, but you have to operationalize it, and here we have done it with a 5 percent tail.  And compared with what happened in 2008, we’re not doing it at 1 percent tail or a 0.1 percent tail or wherever you think that event actually occurred.  There’s also a question of over what amount of time the loss is being incurred, and in this it’s a fairly short amount of time, like a week or a month.  Of course, over the financial crisis as a whole, the losses were enormous over a longer period of time. The $150, $200 billion that this would look like if it were not indexed may not seem like a large number, but actually the reason I indexed it was because of all of these subtleties of how you interpret it.  I didn’t want that to interfere with the main idea, which is that it has come down some as things like the VIX have come in, but it is still pretty high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 217.
 MR. BULLARD.  I think it’s a potentially useful tool, and I want to get the interpretation clear so we know what we’re looking at when we look at it.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bullard expresses his opinion about a tool and discusses the need for clear interpretation, but there is no opposition or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 218.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given text "Governor Tarullo" does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. It is simply a title or a reference to a specific person.


Passage number 219.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to come back to the question that Betsy addressed to Eric and David on the gap between the Committee’s projections and the staff projections.  I have two somewhat related questions.  One puts you in a bit of a difficult situation.  From your point of view, what has the Committee got wrong or what is it missing as a group.  The answer to that may be informed by the second question, if you could reveal a bit of   your internal deliberations.  That is, you’ve got, in the best Fed tradition, your projection plus something substantially more optimistic and something substantially more pessimistic.  But as you were actually putting this Tealbook together, what was the nature of the actual debate, as opposed to the hypothetical debate, between a lost decade and a really robust snapback that I don’t get the sense many of you actually anticipate.  And maybe the answer would help inform a bit that first question of why the gap—specifically whether your debate was really between where you ended up and where we as a group ended up, or was your debate actually of a different nature with a somewhat more pessimistic but not lost-decade-like possibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and more information about the Committee's projections and internal deliberations.


Passage number 220.
 MR. ENGEN.  Do you want me to take a first stab.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply includes a question and a request for clarification or instruction.


Passage number 221.
 MR. WILCOX.  I’ll have something, too.  You stab, and then I’ll stab.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a statement of agreement between two individuals about participating in an activity.


Passage number 222.
  [Laughter] MR. ENGEN. It certainly was the case that we were wrestling with how to interpret the incoming data.  Our perception is, yes, that some of the data—labor market, production, and even residential construction—were a little bit better than we expected, and so we were wrestling with the question of whether we were missing a little bit more of a stronger recovery than what we built in.  Part of what we settled on was that the perception that some of the news has been better was right, but we did need to see that for our forecast. To try to illustrate that, the staff has a suite of factor models, which is a way of interpreting a whole bunch of data.  If you go back to October, those models were saying we should be writing down maybe a recession or very, very low GDP growth.  We discounted those at the time.  We needed to see the improvement in the data, which those factor models have shown, to get to where we are at this point.  In the near term, there are also some special factors, particularly defense spending.  That took ½ percentage point out of Q4 and another ¼ percentage point out of Q1.  That’s very much off the general perception radar screens, but we had to go with that.  Thinking more about the medium term, we  would view it as unchanged, and in some ways one of the reasons I presented the faster snapback is that it seems a little more plausible than it did, say, in October when it was harder to put that scenario out and think about, “Well, okay, how could we get there.”  Maybe we are down-reading a little bit too much. A better outcome seems a little more plausible. I would say, in that sense, we are wrestling with this problem of interpreting the data.  Maybe we could be a little bit higher, even though, as we noted, there are some big downside risks out there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the interpretation of data and the consideration of different factors in the forecasting process.


Passage number 223.
 MR. WILCOX.  I agree with all the considerations that Eric mentioned.  Let me add a few other observations coming from the perspective of somebody who presided over the wrestling.  We struggled with a number of issues, and based on different calls, we could have put a weaker forecast on the table or we could have put a slightly brighter forecast on the table. On the downside, I think it would have been quite plausible for us not to adjust our attenuation assumptions that we featured in the Tealbook box.  We rethought our treatment of the very negative news about income that we had gotten from the BEA.  In the December Tealbook we told you we had attenuated our response to that.  We went back, took yet another look, and boosted our consumption spending judgmentally a couple more tenths over the next year or two on the theory that Eric laid out before having to do with mismeasurement.  We are still very concerned about the potential consequences of the European situation.  I don’t think we have substantial new information since the previous Tealbook, but there would be plenty of reason to draw a more negative inference about the implications of the European situation for the United States.  The third thing I would point to is that, at the moment, we’ve got a substantial tension between the gap in resource utilization that’s implied by the output gap and the unemployment rate gap.  Our output gap is substantially wider than the unemployment rate gap.  We’ve taken the view that we don’t measure either one perfectly.  We put most of our eggs in the  unemployment rate gap basket. If we had the unemployment rate gap coming back into line with the output gap, we’d have an unemployment rate that would be two- or three-tenths higher at the end of the projection period from what we have.  Those are some of the factors that we wrestled with that could have led to a darker outcome than the one that we arrived at. On the brighter side, if I were trying to build the case for a stronger outlook, I think I and many of my colleagues on the staff would have built that case around the decline in the unemployment rate and some encouraging signals from the labor market.  We didn’t choose to go there because we think the preponderance of indicators at this point still counsels caution. Eric showed the quite striking fact that employment gains over the most recent three-month period are about 150,000, exactly the same as in the preceding three-month period.  One can look at a number of the other indicators of hiring and layoff and so forth, and we think most of those other indicators are pointing to, yes, an improvement, but one of more limited scope than is suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate. Those are some of the issues that we wrestled with on the upside and the downside.  Now, to be honest, I don’t know why it is that you all differ from us.  You give us topline aggregates.  We show you all the homework.  You’ve got our worksheets in detail that probably you and I both find excruciating.  I can’t really inform what lies behind your thinking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct contention or disagreement. It provides different perspectives and observations from different individuals, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument.


Passage number 224.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given phrase "Governor Raskin" does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. It simply states the title of a governor without presenting any conflicting opinions or contrasting viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 225.
 MS. RASKIN.  To follow up on that, I wonder whether the other potential difference could arise from the idea that when we do projections, we’re doing them under what we view to be appropriate monetary policy prescriptions.  There is the real possibility that what you guys are doing is making assumptions—and in this case you put those assumptions in footnote 1—but what the Committee is doing is, in essence, putting together projections and then saying to   ourselves, “Well, what do we think appropriate monetary policy would be.”  Some people then may have different views as to what appropriate monetary policy is, and that appropriate monetary policy is going to affect what your numbers look like.  To some extent, the projections that we are doing are projections that aren’t necessarily ones that we think are going to occur, but ones that we think would occur under appropriate monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker suggests that there may be a difference in projections between the individuals mentioned (possibly the speaker and the Committee) due to differing views on what constitutes appropriate monetary policy. This difference in views may lead to differing projections and explanations for the numbers.


Passage number 226.
 MR. WILCOX.  I think that’s right.  You’re positing a normative statement about the right monetary policy, and we’re trying to drive our projection off a positive statement of what monetary policy would be indicated by a particular rule, which is estimated off your typical behavior in the past.  This is what we call the outcome-based rule.  So we’re positing that your funds rate policy will follow the pattern dictated by that particular rule and then conditioning the rest of the forecast on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wilcox is simply clarifying and explaining the different aspects of the discussion.


Passage number 227.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But I think Governor Raskin’s idea would have the people with the strong growth forecast having more accommodation in place relative to the outcome-based rule.  Well, we can test that hypothesis and see if that’s true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 228.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 229.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes, to follow up on this discussion, Governor Raskin is exactly right, that the exercise is somewhat different for the policymakers than it is for the staff, and I do think that’s an important consideration.  There is literature on this, and you can check it out.  The other thing we have to keep in mind is how much uncertainty there is around any forecast, especially if you’re talking several years out, but really even if you’re talking one year out.  The amount of uncertainty is actually usually understated around this table.  The confidence bands are gigantic. The idea that there’s a lot of difference between a forecast of 2.2 versus 2.7 is not serious.  The   amount of uncertainty is huge, and those two numbers are not very different.  That’s a consideration when we’re talking about this issue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging and agreeing with another person's point, and then offering additional thoughts and information on the topic.


Passage number 230.
 MR. WILCOX.  I agree with President Bullard’s observation entirely, and in fact, we show confidence intervals, which are based on FRB/US stochastic simulations, on page 82 of the Tealbook, and they’re very wide.  They’re quite wide for the current quarter.  We spend a lot of time on what’s called “nowcasting,” which is trying to determine the initial condition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions agreement and provides additional information on confidence intervals.


Passage number 231.
 MR. ENGEN. I should add that both the faster snapback and the lost decade are essentially within the 70 percent confidence band, even though they have been characterized as markedly different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing additional information and clarifying that both outcomes, the faster snapback and the lost decade, fall within the 70 percent confidence band.


Passage number 232.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This wasn’t the reconciliation I was hoping for.  [Laughter] Any other questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing disappointment followed by humor.


Passage number 233.
 [No response] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I want to broach a question about the projections with participants.  In our minutes for the December meeting we said not only that we would provide quantitative information about our expectations of rates in the future, but we also said we’d provide qualitative information about balance sheet policies.  And my concern is that the SEP question was probably inadequate to elicit much information; basically we asked you if you agreed with the Tealbook.  The Tealbook baseline has no additional purchases, so that people who agree with the Tealbook could include people who would never undertake further purchases or could include people who are quite willing to undertake further purchases if the situation was worse than the mode. For purposes of the minutes and so on and based on many conversations around the table and bilaterally, I’d like to suggest three short statements that I believe characterize our views, and I would like to see if you are comfortable in using them as a qualitative description on thissubject. The first, I think, is uncontroversial: “There is a diversity of views on the Committee [laughter] about the potential efficacy and desirability of additional asset purchases.” The second one is perhaps more controversial.  I would say: “Most participants would set a fairly high bar on further purchases if the economy continues to improve, but are prepared to take further balance sheet measures if it is judged that employment is not making sufficient progress toward our assessment of the maximum level or if inflation shows signs of persisting below its mandate-consistent rate.” So I’m saying that most participants would be prepared.  It’s pretty qualified.  And then the third one, which I think also is not so controversial, is that many people observed that the balance sheet should be linked to federal funds rate policy according to the principles we described last June in our minutes.  I don’t want to get into an extended discussion.  I’m perfectly prepared to drop this, but I was hoping to get a little bit more substance for the purposes of the minutes in particular.  Reaction. Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no explicit contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 234.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. The one question I have is on the words “fairly high bar.”  Is that going to be taken as changing where the Committee is headed. You could use different language like “does not expect if the economy were to continue to improve.” That would be a little bit less forward leaning.  “Fairly high bar” means there’s an impediment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply questioning the meaning and implications of the phrase "fairly high bar" and suggesting an alternative wording that may be less forward leaning.


Passage number 235.
 MR. BERNANKE.  “Does not expect” I think is probably more negative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Bernanke, is expressing his expectation but does not convey disagreement or opposition towards any other viewpoint.


Passage number 236.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I’d just like us to think about that language, because right now the market basically has about a 55 percent probability of further asset purchases, which is actually helping to keep financial conditions more accommodative.  If we say something that suggested that we’re significantly further away from that expectation, we’re going to essentially de facto tighten financial conditions, which I would argue our forecast doesn’t call for.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is a statement about the potential impact of a change in language on financial conditions.


Passage number 237.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m not trying to change market expectations here, and if it’s in the minutes, of course, it will have to be approved by the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating that they do not have an intention to change market expectations and if something is mentioned in the minutes, it will need to be approved by the Committee.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 238.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would just raise a question about whether the “fairly high bar” is really quite the right characterization.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, the speaker questions whether the term "fairly high bar" accurately describes the situation. This implies a disagreement or contention with the existing characterization.


Passage number 239.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do others have reactions.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Do others have reactions" is simply posing a question and does not express any contradictory viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 240.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Yes, I’m maybe on the other side of the sentence from Vice Chairman Dudley in being slightly concerned about characterizing the majority being “prepared.”  Could we not say “would consider” or something that signals that there would be deliberations around this in the future, and that minds are not closed, but not go so far as to say “prepared.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: There is disagreement between Mr. Lockhart and Vice Chairman Dudley about the use of the word "prepared" to describe the majority. Mr. Lockhart suggests using a phrase like "would consider" instead, indicating that there may be deliberations in the future and that minds are not closed.


Passage number 241.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I was trying to balance the “fairly high bar.” Forget the first part about the bar and just say, “Most participants would consider further purchases of the economy if employment is not making sufficient progress,” something like that. PARTICIPANTS.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply suggesting a different way to phrase a statement without expressing any disagreement with the original statement.


Passage number 242.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the given passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 243.
 MR. FISHER.  I do think that’s an improvement.  This goes back to the question I asked Brian.  I think the reason that the market is expecting further accommodation through greater asset purchases is because that’s been expressed.  The Vice Chairman of this Committee has expressed it, the Vice Chair of the Board, and some others at the table.  That was the Fed-speak I referred to.  These are powerful voices.  They condition markets.  I’m a little concerned we may be reading into the dealer survey or “market expectations” hints that individuals, albeit important individuals of this Committee, have been giving the marketplace.  I think the refinement that Dennis suggests is better.  Obviously, all of us would consider whether we are for it or against it.   It’s more encompassing and accurate.  I would agree with the amendment President Lockhart put to the sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the suggestion made by Dennis and the amendment proposed by President Lockhart.


Passage number 244.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I don’t think this is fruitful to continue now, but we’ll see what we can do in the minutes to get something people are comfortable with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the situation at hand and suggesting a course of action for the future.


Passage number 245.
 MR. EVANS.  Mr. Chairman, could we perhaps opine on that tomorrow during the policy go-round.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a suggestion to discuss a topic at a later time.


Passage number 246.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That would be fine.  That’s a good point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both statements express agreement and approval.


Passage number 247.
 MR. EVANS. Get a better survey of what everybody’s thoughts about forward guidance through the minutes, at least.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 248.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Remember we’re not here trying to come to a Committee decision, obviously.  We’re just trying to get a bit of a feel of what people’s stances are.  Anyway, it will be an improvement if people will comment on that in the go-round.  That will give us a little bit better sense, we can record that in the minutes, and we will have made our promise to give some information about that.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing the intention to gather information and opinions from individuals involved in a discussion or meeting.


Passage number 249.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I ask David just a quick question.  Why did the Tealbook not assume another round of asset purchases.  I’d like to understand the thought process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and more information about the thought process behind the decision of not assuming another round of asset purchases.


Passage number 250.
 MR. WILCOX.  Designing our monetary policy assumptions is always a delicate task, which we try to undertake with some sensitivity to staying as much as possible out of the way of prejudging Committee actions, and it would probably overly dignify it to call it art, but it was our judgment that the more judicious approach was to assume, until further guidance from the Committee, no further asset purchases as the most neutral, bland, beige approach that we could take.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply describes the cautious approach taken by Mr. Wilcox in designing monetary policy assumptions.


Passage number 251.
VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But saying that doesn’t mean that the staff is somehow opposed to further asset purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage simply states that the staff is not opposed to further asset purchases. There is no indication of disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 252.
 MR. WILCOX.  What we have attempted to do as a regular standard operating procedure is to drive the funds rate trajectory, as I was discussing earlier, off the outcome-based rule and to leave existing portfolio policies in place, and that has been our standard practice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply explains the standard practice of driving the funds rate trajectory and keeping existing portfolio policies in place.


Passage number 253.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So there is no signal in that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The sentence expresses a statement without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 254.
 MR. WILCOX.  No.  It is by design intended to try to be as signal-less as possible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that something is intentionally designed to have minimal signals. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 255.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Fair enough.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The phrase "fair enough" does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is often used as a way to acknowledge and accept a statement or point made by someone else.


Passage number 256.
 MR. ENGLISH. I’d point out we did send a memo to the Committee that said you could do a $500 billion MBS purchase program, and if you did, here are the effects of that on financial conditions and on the economy.  There’s an addition problem that can be done that yields what the effect of that would look like.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English is simply stating that a memo was sent to the Committee regarding a potential MBS purchase program and its effects, including an additional problem that can be solved to determine the effect.


Passage number 257.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes. I accept that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 258.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We have on the agenda an opportunity to make comments on financial stability issues, and we have a couple of people who would like to do that.  Why don’t we do that now, and then we will take a break.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply defines the agenda and proposes to make comments on financial stability issues before taking a break.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 259.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the financial stability report was very good this time, not in terms of the outcomes and the concerns but in terms of the thoroughness and directness at which you address some of the issues.  That’s really beginning to gel, and I really appreciate the effort in making that work. I liked the structure that you had in the very beginning, which began with a LISCC portfolio and then went to the broker–dealers. What struck me as interesting is the LISCC organizations that you focused on all had large broker–dealers.  As I looked at exhibit 11 that we were shown today in the briefing, it was   interesting to note that the market equity ratios of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were quite low, but in the previous CCAR exercise Goldman Sachs was viewed as relatively well capitalized, whereas Morgan Stanley was viewed as poorly capitalized.  Then I noted the observation that you made that hard-to-value assets are continuing to be financed by broker– dealers with short-term financing.  And the observation that Vice Chairman Dudley made that during a crisis, like what’s happening in Europe, central banks tend to be the counterparty to a lot of organizations—that they choose not to transact with each other, they tend to transact with the central banks.  As I put all of these strands together, along with what you put together for the broker–dealers, the question that I came up with is:  Is the broker–dealer model sustainable if we have a European crisis. I’d start with asking whether you share my concern about the broker– dealer model being sustainable in a crisis.  What was not in the report was how we could mitigate those concerns. Noting the disparity in capital between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, if your concern is that organizations aren’t going to want to transact with them and they’re highly dependent on overnight financing, then it would be something like altering the repo market, altering what kinds of investments they could make, altering their liability structure. If you could give me more of a sense of what you think would be right and what more we could do, because it is troubling to have such important organizations having credit default swaps as high as they are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses concern about the sustainability of the broker-dealer model in a crisis, while also criticizing the report for not providing solutions or suggestions for mitigating those concerns.


Passage number 260.
 MS. LIANG. We would agree.  We are connecting the dots, in some sense, the same way you are.  We don’t have a full assessment.  Part of why we think stock prices are so low and CDS spreads are so high for these institutions is related to the question of whether they have an ongoing business model that is viable when short-term funding markets are stressed and under Dodd–Frank and the new regulatory regime where proprietary trading is coming off the table.  There is a little less trading activity; we don’t know how much there will be going forward.  I think that very much is an issue, and that is why we were highlighting it.  There are a couple of ways to address that.  There are issues about the triparty market and the repo market.  Are there ways to make that somewhat safer. There are the intraday exposures and the industry task force, but are there other ways to address some of the funding problems in short-term markets. I think money funds are a big part of that.  They are a big source of the funds.  They aren’t the only source.  There are a lot of non-2a-7 funds and other cash pools that we are just starting to try to understand.  Those are long-term policy initiatives—money funds, triparty. On crisis management, which is more near-term if something were to arise, there are ongoing discussions with supervisors in other countries about how one does recovery or resolution for these types of institutions if stresses really escalate.  Currently, because many of them operate cross-border and their funds in good times tend to flow between the different entities, everything is fine.  The concern is if stresses rise and the home-country supervisor wants liquidity there, then it starts to get dispersed.  Having those conversations up front about how one would address that is ongoing.  I don’t have anything terribly reassuring to say here, except long-term reform and some attention to possible crisis management issues.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mostly a descriptive discussion of various issues regarding the viability of financial institutions and the need for long-term reforms and crisis management strategies.


Passage number 261.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I guess the Basel III liquidity rules might be of some help over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It represents the speaker's speculation and a possible positive outcome.


Passage number 262.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. It doesn’t really apply.  The securities firms actually are in good shape vis-à-vis the Basel liquidity rules.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any assertion or statement that could lead to contention or disagreement. It simply provides information about the good position of securities firms in relation to the Basel liquidity rules.


Passage number 263.
 MS. LIANG.  The way the rules currently are designed, the securities firms look great, and the commercial banks do not.  Because they fund with triparty repo, and a large part is Treasury collateral, that doesn’t seem to be penalized in the current version of the LCR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply describes the current design of the rules and how it affects the perception of securities firms and commercial banks.


Passage number 264.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of the Vice Chairman is not related to any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 265.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a polite thank-you message from someone named President Kocherlakota.


Passage number 266.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I had a quick question for Vice Chairman Dudley.  When Draghi took over as the head of the ECB, there was a lot of uncertainty about how he would view the crisis, what kind of role he wanted the ECB to play.  Do you think markets have formed a view that maybe he is willing to play a more active role than they might have thought in November.  And that might be part of the reason for things being a little more quiet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for the opinion of Vice Chairman Dudley regarding the perception of ECB President Draghi's willingness to play a more active role in the crisis.


Passage number 267.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I will just give you my view, and the Chairman and Governor Yellen might have other views that they want to express.  My view is that he has been very mindful of not going over into the fiscal space by having the ECB expand their bond purchase program in any way.  In fact, if you look at the numbers in terms of the amount of  government bonds purchased by the ECB, they have actually been pretty small.  He has escalated in the dimension of what central banks can do and what is clearly within the province of the ECB as far as providing liquidity at term against a broadened collateral set.  And he has been more aggressive in broadening what a normal central bank could reasonably say, “This is my province.  I’m not stepping out into the fiscal space.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the author's view while acknowledging that others, such as the Chairman and Governor Yellen, may have different views.


Passage number 268.
” MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or conflicts that indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 269.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m not sure about the fiscal part.  He is playing a careful game.  He has actually been very hawkish fiscally, and I think the purpose of that is to give comfort to the Germans in particular, in the hopes that they will, given these reassurances, be more forthcoming themselves.  It is a complicated game.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides explanation and analysis without expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 270.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. At least verbally he has been quite hawkish on the fiscal side.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that the person mentioned has been verbally hawkish on the fiscal side.


Passage number 271.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, I meant that he wasn’t actually doing things by the ECB that could be construed as fiscal policy.  He has certainly spoken about fiscal policy quite a bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is a statement of what the speaker meant and acknowledges that the person in question has spoken about fiscal policy.


Passage number 272.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Would anyone else like to talk about financial stability. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking if there is anyone else who would like to discuss financial stability. President Lacker does not respond in the passage provided.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 273.
 MR. LACKER.  Just a comment about Vice Chairman Dudley’s comments about the broker–dealers. I appreciate the threat they pose and the extent to which they still rely on pretty short-term funding and are vulnerable to runs.  It strikes me that they have it within their capability to make themselves invulnerable to runs.  We may not have the actual legal capability, except by clearing a very high bar for 13(3) programs, to come to the rescue of their creditors. But I would question whether that is fully appreciated by their creditors, and I would question whether general market supposition is that our lawyers would find a creative way—would they,   Scott.  I question whether market participants don’t believe that we would find a way to provide support.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, questions whether the creditors of the broker-dealers fully appreciate the vulnerability of their investments and whether they believe that the Federal Reserve would find a way to provide support. This suggests that there may be a disagreement between the speaker and market participants regarding the potential support or rescue of the broker-dealers' creditors.


Passage number 274.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I do think market participants are very unclear about one particular thing, which is the ability of the big banks that have broker–dealers attached to fund their securities brokers versus the broker–dealers that don’t have big banks attached.  It seems like the market takes quite a bit of comfort for Citigroup and Bank of America from the retail franchise when, in fact, the ability of the bank to use that franchise to fund its securities broker is extraordinarily limited under 23A.  I don’t think the market fully understands how big a barrier 23A is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating a perspective about a potential lack of understanding in the market regarding the ability of big banks to fund their securities brokers.


Passage number 275.
 MR. LACKER.  I would point out that this configuration of ambiguity about whether we could or would, with market expectations that we could—that incompatible set of beliefs is combustible. It is exactly what drove our hand in Bear and all of the other bad cases.  And that ought to be a real broad concern for us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Passage number 278.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tealbook is little changed from last time and is forecasting substantial shortfalls on both elements of the mandate.  At the end of 2013, the unemployment rate is 8.2 percent and the PCE inflation rate is 1.3 percent.  My own forecast is virtually identical to that of the Tealbook, with PCE inflation of 1.4 percent and an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent at the end of 2013, albeit with an easier monetary policy assumption for appropriate policy.  In fact, most other mainstream forecasters share that outlook. Macroeconomic Advisers, J.P. Morgan, and Goldman Sachs all expect similar large misses on both elements of the mandate.  Even the four DSGE models predict 2013 inflation at 1.2 percent or less. Despite the high degree of uncertainty, there is surprising agreement that over the next two years, we will fall short of both elements of our mandate. This large miss is consistent with an economy continuing to face substantial headwinds as a consequence of a severe recession and significant financial problems.  One of those headwinds is the continued weakness in residential investment, which did not occur in previous recoveries.  I commend the staff and Governors Raskin and Duke for highlighting that our policies would be more effective if we had a more effective housing policy.  Proactive fiscal and monetary policies could potentially shorten the adjustment period in housing, which would likely have collateral benefits to other components of GDP, such as consumption.  Small business hiring and investment have also been laggards in this recovery.  While recently there have been increases in bank lending to large businesses, small business lending remains stagnant.  Similarly, when you look at private-sector job gains and losses, the net job gains have been for businesses with 50 to 1,000 employees, with the smaller employers continuing to have net job losses.  New business creation is difficult when home equity lines of credit and credit cards are not as accessible as in previous recoveries.  In fact, most banks are looking for collateral for a new business, such as residual value in the owner’s house.  Small business lending is another area where proactive monetary and fiscal policies could reduce the current barriers to lending.  For example, resumption of some of the programs used by the SBA during the recession might   make it easier to start new businesses or expand small businesses.  Both would support our mandate of more quickly returning to full employment. A third headwind is the higher-than-normal level of uncertainty.  The risks of an Iranian-caused oil shock, a much more significant financial disruption from Europe, too much fiscal austerity here or abroad, or a further slowdown in China raise the level of uncertainty and are significant downside risks to the forecast.  While we can do little to directly address these significant downside risks, we can try to promote more-rapid economic growth so that we can better withstand any of these shocks should they materialize.  These concerns do appear to be manifesting themselves in real activity.  For example, over the past month, there has been a substantial decline in freight rates for ships that deliver bulk goods such as coal, iron ore, and grain, as well as for ships that deliver containers of more-finished goods.  This is illustrated by the Baltic Dry Index, which has dropped 50 percent over the last month.  The Baltic Dry Index provides a measure of bulk-shipping freight rates for ships of various sizes over the major shipping routes.  Freight rates for ships carrying more-finished goods have also been falling.  Of course, these rates can be affected by a variety of factors, but the current declines are a possible harbinger of an even slower economy than the one presented in either the Tealbook or my own forecast.  Of all of these downside risks, I am most concerned about Europe.  It remains unclear to me what will pull Europe out of its recession.  Europe is more bank-dependent than the United States, and we may be underestimating the likely credit crunch that will accompany their recession, as well as the political turmoil generated by what is likely to be staggering unemployment rates in much of southern Europe.  While there is little we can do to directly influence European outcomes, encouraging stronger growth in the United States is not only   consistent with our mandate, but might also reduce the tail risk of a much worse outcome in Europe.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 281.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Feedback from most of our directors and business contacts was positive regarding recent performance, and there was a notable improvement in expectations across most sectors.  A number of contacts expressed confidence that fourth-quarter momentum will carry into the first.  Nearly 80 percent of our 44 directors reported that they expect the pace of economic activity to improve over the next six months versus the last six months.  This director group represents a pretty extensive footprint, both in the Sixth District and nationally in some cases, given the scope of their businesses.  Overall, I heard more optimism in this cycle than I’ve heard for quite some time.  Of course, we heard expressions of optimism a year ago going into the first quarter of 2011.  Those expectations went largely unmet.  While I’m hearing optimism again now, I’m also picking up something a little different.  Businesses have noted more confidence among their customers, and this is informing their expectations of sales growth.  Firms remain focused on efficiency and productivity gains, but compared with a year ago, more contacts are telling us they have plans to expand and are planning to add to net payrolls in 2012. A few concrete cases in point.  A large national global design-and-build firm noted a new sense of confidence among their clients, which are mostly Fortune 300 companies.  This contact cited resumption of shelved building plans, as well as new projects.  He also, interestingly, noted a rebalancing of location decisions in favor of the United States versus overseas.  A director from a large consulting firm depicted their large-company clientele as showing increased optimism, with many moving ahead cautiously with expansion plans.  A major rail transportation firm ended the year strong, and volume trends have continued to be very positive in the first few weeks of 2012.  This company said that most of their clients are noticeably more optimistic   going into this year than they were in the fall. A large national auto retailer and the auto manufacturers in our District remain very optimistic.  No doubt we are seeing some catch-up in demand from the impact of last year’s supply disruption, along with the more predictable demand arising from an old and aging national fleet.  Continued strength in this sector would be positive for growth.  I think this positive feedback bears watching carefully, as we may be seeing the beginnings of tangible momentum building in the economy.  The recession dug a deep hole in economic activity in the Southeast, and the climb out has been slow.  Nonetheless, the increased optimism is notable, and firms seem to be coordinating on better outcomes.  I acknowledge the need to be a little cautious and not over-interpret the optimism I am hearing in the Southeast.  When I look at the Systemwide survey of hiring intentions just completed, which was mentioned in the earlier presentation—the middle-right chart in exhibit 2—I see that the responses from my District, almost 30 percent of total responses, were generally more positive than the aggregate results presented in the staff report.  Specifically, when compared with a year ago, we’ve seen a discernible pickup in hiring intentions and basically no change in layoff intentions.  In contrast, apparently other Districts overall saw a marked decline in layoff intentions and a small decline in hiring intentions relative to a year ago. The forecast I submitted for this meeting varies somewhat from the Tealbook projection, with the staff’s continued downward adjustment to growth in the medium term.  We see stronger economic growth in 2012 and 2013 than the Tealbook—on the order of about ½ percent each year—and, for whatever it’s worth, less of a jump in growth in 2014.  This view is overwhelmingly supported by anecdotal intelligence I gathered in preparation for this meeting.  Consistent with my outlook for economic growth, my outlook for inflation is also a little higher than what has been marked into the Tealbook.  I don’t see the inflation trend deviating by asmuch, or for as long, from the inflation objective, compared with the Tealbook.  To illustrate, our January Survey of Business Inflation Expectations indicates that firms are anticipating unit cost pressures on the order of 1.8 percent higher over the next 12 months, a shade higher than what they say they experienced over the past 12 months.  But importantly, they’re telling us they can pass these on—that their markups over costs, or their margins, while still soft, have risen with improving sales.  My trajectory for unemployment in my forecast also departs from that of the Tealbook.  The Tealbook has the unemployment rate in 2014 at 7.8 percent, having been raised ½ point from the staff’s October projection, while we see a rate approaching 7 percent by year-end 2014.  As regards the balance of risks, it’s pretty clear that Atlanta’s forecast is more upbeat than the Tealbook’s, and the anecdotal input we’re getting is consistent with that. In thinking about the balance of risks for growth, I decided to keep the risk weighted to the downside because of the still-looming big, exogenous risks—Europe and others—beyond our control that could throttle the economy and kill momentum.  And as regards inflation, I continue to see the balance of risks as balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Lacker.


Passage number 283.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Reports from the Fifth Federal Reserve District since our last meeting suggest improvement and are consistent with an outlook for continued growth at a moderate pace.  Our January manufacturing survey just released today showed broad gains, with the overall index rising to 12 from December’s rating of 3.  This is consistent with the same pattern shown by the Philadelphia and New York manufacturing surveys, but I’d remind you that the Fifth Federal Reserve District’s manufacturing sector is bigger than the combined manufacturing sectors of the Second and Third Districts.  Our survey also showed gains in manufacturing employment and new orders, and the six-month outlook strengthened as well.  The nonmanufacturing survey was more mixed, though still broadly positive.  We did see negative readings in many components of the retail survey, although the retail sales revenue index was up from 4 to 24.  Residential real estate activity remains pretty weak in our District.  As much as one-third of recent increases in sales can be attributed to distressed sales, we’re told.  This is understandable.  Several of our banks have reported taking a very aggressive approach to moving REO off their balance sheet. Interestingly, one of our large banks has shifted strategies and is now accumulating conformable mortgages, finding them more remunerative than selling them or than other alternative uses of the abundant liquidity that’s piling up in their deposit coffers.  Commercial real estate is more mixed.  Office vacancy rates declined in most of our metro areas, but Washington is a notable exception.  Consequences of defense spending cuts are taking their toll.  More broadly, anecdotal reports from our directors and a number of roundtable councils that we convene month to month, while still mixed in general, have shown a significantly more frequent reports of optimism and a pickup in activity. My outlook for the national economy is not substantially different from the Tealbook’s— somewhat weaker growth in the current quarter, followed by a gradual strengthening over the next few years.  My inflation forecast is a notch higher than the Tealbook’s, however.  Longer-term inflation expectations appear to be pretty stable at this point, and I hope that the release of our consensus statement should, if anything, help cement those expectations in place.  I think inflation is likely to fluctuate around 2 percent for the next couple of years. I believe the Tealbook places too much weight on measures of resource slack in forecasting the medium-term path of inflation. We all submitted projections for the federal funds rate for the SEP this time.  My forecast is for us to raise rates in the second half of 2013 because I think economic growth is likely to   move close to 3 percent toward the end of that year.  And I think real growth is going to be more relevant to policy than the size of gaps, either output or unemployment gaps, given our uncertainty about the level of the natural rate.  This is a feature of monetary policy that’s easy to overlook, because in many of our standard models, for a given rate of inflation, there’s a one-to-one relationship between the level of the gap and the growth rate.  So you could write policy just as well in terms of a growth rate rather than a gap. In the real world, they vary independently, and I view employment growth as a somewhat more reliable indicator, at this point in the business cycle, of whether we need to tighten or not.  So I’m going to be looking at growth rates, not the level of gaps, in thinking about when to tighten policy.  Just for your information, my projection is that the unemployment rate will average 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2013; this places me among the seven respondents to the SEP whose projection for 2013 is inconsistent with the second sentence in paragraph 3 of alternative B. A final note about some terminology.  I don’t know if this is a large miss on our mandate.  I just think that scientifically, we’re uncertain about that, and similarly, it’s not obvious to me that the picture you get from the SEP projections represents a lack of balance. We spent a long time talking about natural rates and maximum employment. What we learned is that there are reasonable estimates that are all over the map, from 5 percent to 7½ or 8 percent.  So I don’t think it’s obvious that the picture you get is so unbalanced or that we’re missing in such a large way.  Given a history of no shocks to the economy in the last couple of decades, could unemployment be better.  Yes, sure.  But given the shocks we got, could monetary policy per se, interest rate policy, have been run in a way that delivered a better outcome. It’s not obvious it would be materially better under some different reaction function or some different policy strategy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 289.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast for GDP growth over the next two years has been essentially unchanged for the past several meetings, while the Tealbook’s has come down.  So for the first time in quite a while, my forecast for GDP is modestly above the Tealbook’s.  I am expecting GDP growth of about 2½ percent this year and 3 percent in 2013.  In light of the December employment report, I did revise down the starting point for my unemployment rate projection, but I continue to expect the trajectory from that starting point to be one of only gradual decline.  At the end of 2014, I expect the unemployment rate to fall to 7¼ percent, still some distance from my estimate of the full employment rate, which I have at 6 percent. I continue to project an inflation rate that dips below 2 percent this year before gradually rising to 2 percent by the end of 2014.  With that overview, I will focus on some of the key issues underlying my outlook. All of the headwinds that many of us have noted for some time—sluggish income growth, household deleveraging, the depressed housing market, financial strains in Europe— remain present to varying degrees. I still expect the economy to expand at a moderate pace despite these obstacles, but I find it hard to anticipate more than gradual progress.  Growth at this moderate pace will only slowly chip away at the unemployment rate. The back-to-back surprises in the unemployment rate in both November and December convinced me to take some of the decline on board in my projection, but I expect only slow progress going forward.  Before the recession, there were fewer than two job seekers for every open job.  Today, there are about four job seekers for every job opening.  I realize that the fundamental solution to the unemployment problem is to increase the number of job openings through more growth in the economy.  Nonetheless, the labor market appears to be adjusting more slowly than it did in the 1980s, which was the last time we had such a high unemployment rate.  In the 1980s, there was more churning in labor markets—that is, more people were losing their jobs each month, but more people were also being hired each month.  While we don’t necessarily want more layoffs, a more dynamic labor market in this sense produces more-rapid declines in unemployment, and our labor market has become less dynamic.  There are many factors that could be slowing the adjustment, but one that resonates with my business contacts is a slower matching of workers to available jobs, which is due to greater specialization needed in today’s workplace.  Looking forward, most of my business contacts are expecting only a moderate number of new openings this year at a rate similar to last year.  Their expectations are consistent with my forecast for only a small decline in the unemployment rate. Today’s unemployment rate also reflects an unusually stagnant labor force participation rate. While there are several potential explanations for today’s low participation rate, I suspect that the participation rate will rise somewhat when labor demand picks up.  If so, the unemployment rate won’t decline as quickly as the employment gains I expect to see would normally produce.  Under these circumstances, I think it will pay us to be cautious about projections of the unemployment rate several years out. Finally, my outlook for inflation has a decline in the near-term inflation rates, like the Tealbook, which reflects diminished commodity price pressures and continued subdued unit labor costs.  What makes my projection different from the Tealbook is that, in my forecast,inflation returns to 2 percent in 2014.  Compared with the Tealbook, my forecast for inflation puts somewhat less weight on unemployment and more weight on the gravitational pull of the longer-run trend rate of inflation of 2 percent.  To respond to President Fisher’s inquiry about the median and trimmed mean CPI, on the near-term momentum in inflation, the Cleveland Fed median and trimmed mean CPI measures are still running near 2 percent over the past year, but they are showing mixed signals on underlying price trends in the past few months.  Looking at the details of the components, while there are some factors pulling core measures of inflation down, inflation in owners’ equivalent rent, or OER, has steadily picked up.  Looking ahead, my staff is concerned that relative price shifts in housing could well put notable upward pressure on both the CPI and PCE this year and next.  OER, which is the largest component in the consumer’s market basket, is being boosted by rising house rents even while home-purchase prices are actually still experiencing declines.  My staff estimates that this development could add about ½ percentage point to core CPI inflation.  This is not necessarily an increase in the true cost of housing or even overall inflation, but at a minimum, it could pose a communications challenge if measured inflation turns out to be obviously larger than what we are expecting. In assessing the risks to my outlook, although my business contacts were generally more positive on their outlooks than they were last month, I still see a predominance of risk factors for growth to the downside.  Similarly, without more underlying momentum in the labor market, the risks to unemployment seem to remain primarily to the upside.  I continue to see the risks to my inflation outlook as broadly balanced.  On the one hand, labor costs could come in weaker than I anticipate. On the other hand, a range of factors could prevent inflation from slowing as much as I anticipate.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some disagreement in the passage. Ms. Pianalto mentions that her forecast for GDP growth is slightly above the Tealbook's forecast. She also mentions that her outlook for inflation is different from the Tealbook's, as she expects inflation to return to 2 percent in 2014 while the Tealbook's forecast does not mention this.

Passage number 296.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The 10th District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  Consumer spending has been solid outside of some softness in restaurant and auto sales, and manufacturing activity, which contracted slightly in December, has bounced back in January, with factory operators remaining generally optimistic about the coming six months.  Activity in the commodities-producing regions of our District remains at a high   level.  Farmland values continue to rise at rapid rates, and in the energy sector, the widespread use of new drilling technologies is promoting strong drilling activity, which in turn has created somewhat of an oil boom in parts of our District.  Competition for workers in these areas is intense.  Some employers report difficulties filling openings, and the demand for skilled workers has pushed up overall wage levels in Oklahoma and Wyoming, in particular.  Amid these booming conditions, there’s considerable outside investor interest and money being directed to the energy sector.  District residential real estate conditions remain weak. However, rents and vacancy rates on commercial properties are stable, and our contacts are increasingly optimistic about sales volume and prices in the coming months. At the national level, I continue to expect moderate growth that strengthens over time.  A key factor supporting this outlook is improvement in the labor market.  While the unemployment rate remains higher than we’d like, it has declined ½ percentage point in the last three months.  Most of this decline has been from job gains rather than unemployed workers leaving the labor force.  A wide range of other labor market indicators are consistent with improving conditions as well. Other releases have been mixed but are generally consistent with my view of moderate but gradually strengthening growth.  Consumer sentiment is up sharply since August.  Auto sales are trending higher, and there are even some tentative signs of improvement in residential investment. Taken together, I view the data as suggesting little change to my medium-term forecast over the last several meetings.  This is a considerable difference from the Tealbook forecast, and I generally project a brighter outlook for GDP growth than Tealbook, coupled with substantially more improvement in the unemployment rate over the next few years. In terms of inflation, we are now seeing some welcome moderation from elevated levels in early 2011, but the deceleration in PCE inflation might be a bit overstated, as measures of CPI inflation haven’tfallen quite as much.  I expect that a gradually improving economy and stable inflation expectations will pull inflation back closer to 2 percent over the next year or so.  As always, there are considerable risks around this forecast.  Events in Europe and the potential for slowdowns in emerging markets that are greater than expected pose downside risks to growth, especially in the near term. In summary, I see the recovery continuing and slowly picking up the pace over the next few years, barring setbacks emanating from abroad.  Thank you.

Passage number 305.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  In general, I think the economy looks to be in a bit better shape than a few months ago.  Although the estimated 3 percent or so real GDP growth case that we’re likely to see in the fourth quarter undoubtedly overstates the degree of improvement, there are several promising signs that, to me at least, suggest that the downgrade evident in the Tealbook over the last two meetings might be somewhat too pessimistic. In particular, I would note that the trend in real disposable income is improving as a consequence of more hours worked and lower inflation.  Credit availability continues to improve, and financial conditions, with the notable exception of the dollar, have eased considerably recently. I don’t cite anecdotal information very often, but I was struck by a shift in sentiment among a New York Fed small business advisory group concerning the availability of bank credit.  At the most recent meeting, there was a marked sea change in terms of improved availability compared with earlier in 2011. That all said, I do still think, though, there are significant impediments, and the Tealbook highlighted a number of them:  first, fiscal drag in 2012; second, the impediments in the structure of the housing industry, which undercut the ability of monetary policy to stimulate the economy; and, third, the effect of Europe.  Even if Europe goes well, it’s going to have an effect on the U.S. trade sector. It seems to me that those impediments are pretty much “baked in the cake,” which says to me that a significant acceleration in the economic growth outlook seems pretty unlikely. One other issue that I think is worth flagging is the Iran sanctions and the threats of Iran to blockade the Strait of Hormuz potentially in response to those sanctions.  Now, even if nothing dire actually occurs—things go a benign way rather than a bad way—the consequence could still be a persistent risk premium embedded in oil prices, and that could actually constrain real disposable income growth.  I’m struck by the fact that oil prices haven’t really fallen very much, despite the fact that we’ve seen a pretty significant downgrade in global GDP growth and we’ve also seen the prospect that Libyan oil will gradually come back on stream over the next year. One other factor in that regard that I think is significant is the budget pressures that Saudi Arabia is under to maintain social and political stability by expanding their education and safety net support.  That also suggests that expectations that oil prices will moderate significantly from $100 a barrel may be mistaken.  Even if tensions with Iran were to subside, Saudi Arabia may now favor oil at $100 per barrel rather than lower.  And I think that’s noteworthy, given that they are the swing producer in the oil market. The bottom line for me is, I feel a little bit better.  But as President Evans noted, we have been fooled before by a better tone to the data.  So call me unconvinced by the recent evidence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there are some promising signs in the economy but also highlights potential impediments and risks that could constrain economic growth. The speaker ultimately remains unconvinced by the recent evidence.

Passage number 308.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Unlike Governor Yellen, I did not resist the attraction of the “Faster Snapback” scenario.  [Laughter] I understand the risk of taking too much signal from the recent unemployment and claims data, and I appreciated the discussion in the special topic presentation on the role of leverage and in the Tealbook box about the way the staff is reconciling very weak income data with consumption projections.  So I recognize that I might be setting myself up for yet another disappointment or a forecast downgrade, but I find the recent improvement in business and household sentiment, along with strengthening in the stock market and other indicators of improving investor confidence in financial markets, to be signs that outside this room, businesses, consumers, and investors are viewing recent economic news and data somewhat favorably. We even saw some growth in credit outstanding toward the end of the year.  However, bankers report that the recent growth in lending is not likely to carry over its momentum in 2012.  Some portion of the growth in C&I loans was U.S. banks filling the holes left as European banks pulled back from lending, and there was some portfolio CRE lending, as the CMBS pipelines were closed.  But the pipelines supporting some renewal of the CMBS market in coming months are already being built.  Small business demand is a little stronger, but not enough to make a difference in total lending.  And the increase in credit card outstandings seems to be coming from higher spending, but that spend is being rapidly paid off, as current portfolios are now more heavily weighted to transactors than to revolvers. That is, the current credit card holder seems   less likely to maintain a balance on the card from month to month.  Still, the reported strong transaction growth in credit and debit card sales in November and December doesn’t quite square with disappointing retail sales in the same time frame.  Bottom line: In the nonmortgage space, credit is actively being offered, but it is not yet being taken up very strongly.  However, if the decision to spend or invest is made, credit will be available for a wide population of borrowers. To echo President Fisher, even in housing, there are some tiny, incremental, but still positive signs of improvement, although I have to say that, to me, the most glaring sign of how bad the housing market is, is what passes for good news—but here goes.  Single-family starts have increased for the last few months.  Existing single-family sales are picking up.  More important, inventory has adjusted to the low level of sales.  Inventory of new homes has been in the six-month range for most of 2011, as builders can’t or won’t build ahead of sales much more than that, and the inventory of unsold homes from failed construction projects that has come through bank REO is dwindling.  Now, for the first time, the inventory of existing homes is down to six months, which is the level that I used in my years as a lender to indicate a market in balance, even at a very low level. Within the existing home sales and inventory numbers are still a high percentage of REO sales and investor purchases, so the level of normal homeowner-to-homeowner activity is quite low.  I take it as a sign of stability and believe that more-balanced inventory will work to stabilize prices in the coming months. Further, because real estate markets, like politics, are local, the national figures should include some markets where supply is quite tight. Just a few anecdotes to illustrate the point.  Omaha, Nebraska, had a seven-year residential lot inventory in 2008.  It’s now down to 18 months, as the lot sales in 2011 were higher than the three previous years combined.  And as inventory is depleted, what is left is a little picked over and less desirable, so the expectation is for an actual shortage of desirable lots within a year. Granted, Omaha has a 4 percent unemployment rate and didn’t have the boom– bust in prices that other markets saw, but there are other Omahas in the country—even in Florida and even in higher-priced homes.  A banker from Naples reported that in the higher-priced areas, places where homes go from $2 million and up, inventory is down from 138 to 68 in a year.  They might have been $4 million homes in better times, but still, that inventory is coming down. Home price declines in November were disappointing, but likely to have been seasonally more dominated by distressed sales.  So I’ll look to the spring selling season to see if maybe we’re hitting bottom in home prices.  Also, I believe that if the GSEs take the lead in moving some owner-occupied homes into rental inventory, it could solidify that bottom.  And speaking of GSEs, the streamlined refinancing of high loan-to-value GSE loans, the HARP 2 program, was announced in November and first offered in December.  Volume was disappointing in December but has reportedly taken off like a rocket in the first two weeks of January, and it now threatens to strain capacity. I think this is another development that bears watching. So, Mr. Chairman, I’m still optimistic that we’re in the “Faster Snapback” scenario, and I even see indications that housing might be finding its own zero lower bound.  But in order not to jinx any of these signs, I promise not to refer to them as green shoots or to mention exit strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing optimism about the economy and housing market based on various indicators and observations.


Passage number 309.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It appears to be a polite and appreciative response from Governor Tarullo.


Passage number 310.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As President Evans and Vice Chairman Dudley have already noted, there have been a couple of times—once each in the last couple of years—where there was a string of favorable, or at least above expectations, data releases that were construed by some within and without this Committee as the start of a sustained, above-  trend recovery.  And as they both noted, in both instances there proved to be transitory reasons for those short-lived bursts.  So the question now, of course, is whether the recent burst of moderately favorable data portends a more durable trend in this direction.  One point in favor of that interpretation is that in the past, there was a pretty close correlation between those bursts of activity and the maximum effects of either fiscal or monetary stimulus, which is surely not the case right now. But my first direct answer to this question is that I don’t think we’re going to get there this year, for many of the reasons detailed in the Tealbook and by some of you.  The most relevant of these for me continues to be that we’re still working our way through the aftermath of the problems peculiar to a serious recession induced by a financial crisis, and that’s what President Williams was referring to a few minutes ago. However, I want to add to that a second point, which is that with the very great condition of the absence of negative shocks whose origins are essentially political or geopolitical, I do think it’s possible that by the end of this year we could be getting closer to the point at which we pull out of the mud and onto a reasonably dry stretch of pavement for a more extended period of time. There are several relevant indicators, some of which were discussed in the introductory session this morning.  But like many people, I continue to think the most important factor in determining this point would be the reality and, importantly, the perception that housing prices have bottomed.  This was the essential asset bubble; the bursting of that bubble was the essential problem that led to the domino-like effects in the markets, and it seems to me that needs to be repaired before we’re going to be in a durable recovery.  While the experience of developed nations after banking crises, as surveyed by Rogoff and Reinhart, would have suggested that the relatively optimistic predictions about housing of a year or 15 to 18 months ago were misplaced, improvement toward the end of this year or the beginning of next year would fit much more comfortably with that same experience. But while we’re now in the range of historical experience of the amount and duration of housing price declines associated with domestic banking crises, it’s a pretty broad range.  And unfortunately, Rogoff and Reinhart are more helpful in mapping the experience than in explaining why housing prices decline further and longer in the wake of some domestic banking crises rather than others. My third point would be that I don’t think that near-term economic policy choices need much be affected by whether the much-awaited turning point is next year, 2014, or for that matter, even this year.  The hole out of which the economy needs to dig is sufficiently deep that continued stimulus will likely be desirable for some time after even a genuinely sustained, above-trend pace of recovery has begun.  In housing, for example—despite whatever the euphemism for “green shoots” is that Betsy would use—the overhang of foreclosed homes is going to be with us for quite some time. So, too, with private securitization markets essentially dormant and the future of the GSEs murky, financing will probably remain at least somewhat encumbered even after a price bottom has clearly been reached. In the employment area, the relatively good news of the last couple of months—and it’s really only that—cannot obscure how far we have to go.  President Pianalto said much, and indeed more, of what I would have said on this point, so I’ll just incorporate by reference or endorse what she said. And I’d also, by the way, endorse what Ed Lazear said in his op-ed in the Wall Street Journal last Friday, except for the line where he got kind of political.  But the labor market analysis, I thought, was excellent. Last month’s relatively good job growth number of 200,000 isn’t really a reason to get too excited.  First, of course, it does follow a couple of fairly tepid months, and as the staff pointed out, the fourth quarter and third quarter, when they’re averaged out for the quarters as a whole, look pretty much the same. We’re still 6 million jobs short of the number of employed   persons in the economy before the recession began, and that doesn’t even take into account population growth over the last four years.  Even if we were to assume a pickup in job growth to a sustained rate—not just of last month’s 200,000, but 250,000 a month, which is a pretty heroic assumption—it would take well over two years to get us back to where we were in terms of the number of jobs pre-recession—again, not taking account of population growth.  I also want to point to this FOMC’s featured favorite labor market indicator, which is U-6.  U-6, of course, includes in its broad measure of unemployment all of those who are employed part time for economic reasons—that is, they’d like to be working full time, but they’re not.  Now, U-6, even though it’s come down a bit, is still at 15 percent. It’s the broadest gauge of unemployment the BLS puts out.  About three-fourths of the people who are working part time for economic reasons are incumbents in jobs whose hours have been cut; only about one-fourth are those who looked for work and found an existing part-time position.  The number of such people is still well over 3 million above where it was at pre-crisis levels, even though it’s come down some over the last six months.  But what’s most striking about this population of the employed part time for economic reasons is that a chart superimposing each measure of unemployment from U-1 to U-6 shows us that the gap between the various measures of unemployment has remained proportionately roughly the same in the nearly 20 years since the U-5 and U-6 data series were begun, except for the relationship of U-6 to the rest of the indicators since this recession began.  That is, even as unemployment goes up, the relative relationships among U-1, 2, 5, 6, and the like have remained relatively the same, except there’s this big jump in U-6 relative to the other measures over the last three years.  And that, of course, is attributable to the part time for economic reasons.  This gap used to be just a couple of tenths of a percentage point to 1 percentage point in the 2001–02 recession, and it’s been 3 to 4 percentage points over the course of these three years.  This pattern, I think, underscores the considerable amount of slack in labor markets, a good deal of which will eventually be filled by restoration of full workweeks rather than new hires.  And so it lends a good bit of support to the proposition that the amount of slack in the labor markets is really greater than the unemployment rate would suggest.  Now, anticipating the response that this is all about the potential rise of structural unemployment, I would underscore that indicators, such as the rate of movement of the long-term unemployed out of unemployment and the JOLTS data, still don’t suggest that the NAIRU has risen beyond the level estimated by the Tealbook. I think this is still an aggregate demand story, and we don’t yet know what the new normal is going to be.  I don’t think it’s predetermined, but it’s dependent in no small part on policy decisions and directions that are taken over the course of this year and beyond.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreements or contention. It is a discussion of various factors and indicators related to the economy and job market, but there is no disagreement expressed.


Passage number 311.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude towards Governor Raskin.


Passage number 312.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In updating my economic forecast this week, one question I asked myself was whether the improvement that we’ve seen in consumption over the past few months appears any more sustainable now than it did at the time of our last meeting in  December.  When I asked this question this week, I didn’t have the benefit of the strong research described this morning in our special topic, but I intend to take that research into account in refining my rough thinking on this topic, and here is that rough thinking. Real disposable income was quite weak last year and considerably weaker than the staff had expected in the fall.  The October Tealbook had predicted a 1½ percent increase in real disposable income, but now it appears as if it edged up only ½ percent.  One wouldn’t expect such a sluggish pace of DPI growth to be associated with the moderate pace of consumption we’ve seen.  Real DPI is a primary determinant of consumption growth, and it has been nearly   flat. If we’re going to achieve a sustainable recovery, I can’t imagine how it happens if real disposable income doesn’t increase steadily.  Rising consumer sentiment and household wealth are not likely to support consumer spending on their own.  Although consumer sentiment has moved up recently, it remains at levels we usually see in recessions.  Moreover, if you peruse the components of the consumer confidence index that aren’t included in the headline figure, you note that people remain extraordinarily pessimistic when asked about their own prospects for higher income growth.  Presumably that reading won’t improve until they start to see some hint that rising incomes are on the horizon.  Similarly, in terms of household wealth, many households are still hurting from the loss of so much home equity in recent years.  So this factor isn’t likely to support spending.  In my view, home values are likely to remain flat, and gains in the stock market are unlikely to be sharp enough to single-handedly drive consumption growth. Of course, none of these factors has to drive consumption by itself.  More likely, we’ll get a little more income growth, which leads to a little better sentiment and spending, and that good news in turn will lead to higher equity values and improved hiring to create a virtuous cycle. But the really lousy income figures that we’ve seen recently make me pretty worried that we’re not yet at the start of that cycle.  This is one of my major concerns about the outlook.  At the time of this current projection, I’m also concerned about higher oil prices because of events in the Middle East and Nigeria, which could further hurt disposable income, demand, and economic growth.  And of course, a renewed worsening of the European crisis could lead to strains in financial markets as well as cause a drag on our net exports. In terms of relative bright spots, I am optimistic that state and local government payrolls may be poised to finally turn around.  After having been under severe pressure in recent years, 2012 may be the year when these payrolls begin to stabilize as budget pressures ease.  Tax   receipts at the state level are improving.  Federal aid to state and local governments, after a significant downturn in 2011 from the phaseout of federal stimulus measures, may stabilize in 2012, and house prices might finally hit bottom in 2012 at the national level.  If all of these factors bring state and local payroll cuts to an end in 2012, perhaps there will be meaningful growth in this segment of the labor market after this year. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The author is providing their own analysis and expressing their concerns and optimism about various factors affecting economic growth.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 313.
  Several people raised concerns about the uncertainties in forecasting—the RMSEs, root mean squared errors, associated with macroeconomic forecasts more than a few quarters out.  Another point made was a concern that, in the possible case of a self-fulfilling deflation, excessive use of policy would leave the central bank defenseless. On the other hand, one person pointed out that the economy is still in such a deep hole, with 6 million jobs less than the total number before the recession, that precise forecasts several years out are probably not necessary in order to see that additional support might be needed. Those are some observations from the go-round.  I’d be happy to take any comments.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. One person raises concerns about the uncertainties in forecasting macroeconomic forecasts, while another person points out that precise forecasts may not be necessary in light of the current economic situation. These viewpoints indicate a disagreement or difference in opinion.


Passage number 314.
 MR. LACKER.  You said something that referenced something I said, and I think it was a little bit different than what I said.  I mentioned employment growth, and I didn’t say I thought it was more correlated with inflation. I just thought it was a better policy indicator.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 315.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the word "Okay." It is a neutral response that does not express any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 316.
 MR. LACKER.  A subtle difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply mentions a subtle difference.


Passage number 317.
 [Meeting recessed]January 25 Session CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  I’ll start by reminding you that at the last meeting, President Kocherlakota raised some interesting questions for the staff to look at.  They were sufficiently deep that we don’t have responses to them yet. In particular, the first question was to look further into how we might adjust our measures of the federal funds rate to take into account the effects of asset purchases and other policies; the second was to analyze further the differences between the implications of optimal policy simulations for policy rules and the implications of simpler Taylor-type rules, for example; and the third was to look further into the monetary policy transmission mechanism.  We will have discussed this, of course, a great deal, but can we say more, quantitatively, about the extent to which the transmission mechanism might be impaired or changed by the effects of the crisis. Bill English has authorized me to tell you that the staff is working hard, and we will be providing you with memoranda on these subjects over the next couple of meetings, but these are obviously important issues for us to consider. Our main item of business this morning is current monetary policy.  So why don’t we begin that by turning to Bill English.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is providing an update on the requests made by President Kocherlakota and the upcoming topics for discussion, without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 318.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Questions for Bill.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.   Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude and a request for questions.


Passage number 319.
 MR. LACKER.  Bill, first, have any participants altered their economic projections.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 320.
 MR. ENGLISH.  For this round. Changed their SEP contributions, you mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply clarifying what is meant by "changed their SEP contributions."


Passage number 321.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement. It only states "Mr. Lacker" without any further context, making it impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 322.
 MR. ENGLISH. There were a couple of changes on Monday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement about changes that occurred on a specific day.


Passage number 323.
 MR. LACKER.  So that was in the packet we got.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states that something was included in a packet that the speaker received. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 324.
 MR. ENGLISH. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Since the passage is simply stating that Mr. English agrees with something (assuming it is mentioned in the prior context), there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 325.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Great.  The packet shows, as I said yesterday, that seven participants have a federal funds rate above 13 basis points—but the lowest is 50 basis points— and have an unemployment rate above 7 percent.  You cited a median figure.  I wasn’t quite sure what that median was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply a clarification request from Mr. Lacker to understand what specific median figure was cited.


Passage number 326.
 MR. ENGLISH. It’s the median for the Committee members.  Which sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the median being used for the Committee members.


Passage number 327.
 MR. LACKER.  You cited something, a median involving 7 percent unemployment. I wasn’t quite sure I caught what it was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is seeking clarification and mentioning that he didn't fully understand what was previously cited.


Passage number 328.
 MR. ENGLISH. Yes. The median unemployment rate for the year of liftoff varies depending on which set of participants you’re talking about.  It is either 6.9 percent for voters or 7.1 percent for all participants—so, about 7.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states two different statistics for the median unemployment rate, depending on the group being referred to. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 329.
 MR. LACKER. The big question I have has to do with these words “currently anticipates” in B(3).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a question or concern they have about the phrase "currently anticipates" in B(3).


Passage number 330.
MR. ENGLISH.  Okay.  Just to be clear, the package of SEP results that you got yesterday on the table has all of the new results.  The package that was distributed on Monday didn’t have one of the changes that was made Monday evening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply clarifying the contents of the packages.


Passage number 331.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, I got a packet on Tuesday morning.  Is that the same packet distributed Monday afternoon to which you’re referring.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individual is simply seeking clarification on whether the packet they received on Tuesday morning is the same as the one mentioned in the previous conversation that was distributed on Monday afternoon.


Passage number 332.
 MR. LUECKE.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 333.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Great.  Maybe sometime we could get that updated.  The big question has to do with “currently anticipated.” Paragraph B(3) has the condition that “this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate” as long as three conditions are met, and the sentence says that the Committee “currently anticipates.” So the word “currently” there suggests that at some future time, given future data, it could be the case that we no longer anticipate that interest rates will be exceptionally low under those three conditions.  And yet this forward guidance language is widely interpreted as a commitment by the Committee.  Today’s Wall Street Journal said the Fed is committed to keeping interest rates low until at least mid-2013, and the same sort of “anticipates” language is used with regard to the year—“Committee expects”—right.  So I’m just wondering.  You helped draft this language.  Do you view this as a commitment—that we’re saying that we’re going to behave in a way that in some circumstances would be other than what we’d want to do then, or is this merely a forecast of our future behavior.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning whether the forward guidance language is a commitment or just a forecast of future behavior. They point out that the word "currently" suggests that the anticipated low interest rates might not be appropriate in the future. However, the interpretation of the language as a commitment by the Committee is mentioned in the Wall Street Journal. This disagreement is evident in the speaker's questioning of the language and their uncertainty about how it should be viewed.


Passage number 334.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I would have said it was primarily a forecast of future behavior, your expectations today, but it may have a very small element of commitment because you’d be hesitant to change something you’d put out there.  But for the most part, this is, as it says, the Committee’s current anticipation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. English is simply explaining his understanding of the nature of the Committee's current anticipation.


Passage number 335.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, if I could just interject.  If we do accept either of these kinds of forward guidance languages, I will be making clear in the press conference opening statement that it’s not intended to be a commitment, that it’s entirely conditional.  Now, I think there is a little bit of a difference between the 7 percent language and the simple date language.  The simple date language is obviously very contingent on changes in the outlook, and we reflect it in changes in the SEP projections from quarter to quarter.  The language that is contingent on economic outcomes should be a little bit more permanent because it’s more about our reaction function than it is about the state of the economy.  It could accommodate an earlier or later date.  It’s also a threshold, not a trigger, and so there’s flexibility in that respect, but I even in that case think one reason to play down the commitment language is that we all recognize that we can’t entirely mechanize these decisions.  I know that a number of people are interested in rules, et cetera, but we can’t entirely mechanize.  There may be other considerations that would be relevant, and so for that reason, we have to leave ourselves flexibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses different types of forward guidance and the need for flexibility in decision-making.


Passage number 336.
 MR. ENGLISH.  One other thing that might be worth saying is that I think that the date language that was added in August had an effect on expectations. It was read as meaning that the Committee perhaps really did have a slightly different reaction function than had been thought.  But since then, as data have come in, that date has moved around. In particular, it’s moved back a fair amount.  So I don’t think that it would be read as immutable.  It would be read correctly as subject to revision as the data change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the date language added in August had an effect on expectations, but since then it has moved around and is subject to revision. There is no evident contention or disagreement.


Passage number 337.
 MR. LACKER.  So your interpretation is that in August, the market reaction was that it learned something about our reaction function, but subsequently the reaction to data surelyreflects a sense that the future evolution of the data is going to be different given our reaction function.  Is that how you interpret movements since August.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 338.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Since August.  Yes, I think that’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. English is simply confirming that the given information is correct.


Passage number 339.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement present. It only mentions the existence of additional questions and President Bullard without providing any context or specific details.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 340.
 MR. BULLARD.  Just on that point, I think there is an alternative interpretation of what happened in August, which is that there was tremendous market turmoil at that time.  There was the July 29 GDP report, which marked down the path of GDP through the recession.  A simple interpretation is that that’s what pushed out market expectations of our time of tightening, and it didn’t have much to do with whether we put “2013” in the language or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Bullard presents an alternative interpretation of the events in August, suggesting that market turmoil and the July 29 GDP report were the primary factors influencing market expectations, rather than the specific wording in the language. This contradicts a previously stated viewpoint, indicating a disagreement or contention between different explanations.


Passage number 341.
 MR. ENGLISH.  But there was an announcement effect with the release of the statement.  On that day, there was a pretty noticeable move in Treasury yields, for example, or in fed funds futures, and so I think the statement itself did seem to do something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply stating that there was an effect or impact from the release of the statement, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 342.
 MR. BULLARD. I think it was an extremely volatile market situation. It’s hard to interpret what happened, but one interpretation is that there was a recession scare right around that time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply presents one perspective or interpretation of the situation.


Passage number 343.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Also, volatility came down for the short-dated yields after our announcement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact, that volatility decreased for short-dated yields after a certain announcement. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 344.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The speaker is stating a clear and definitive statement without any indication of opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 345.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So something was going on there from the announcement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as a neutral observation or speculation without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting information.


Passage number 346.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The relevant point, though, is, was this viewed as an ironclad commitment.  If it was viewed as an ironclad commitment, then the rates would not have responded to subsequent developments, which they did.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement presented in this passage. The passage is simply stating a point and questioning whether it was viewed as an ironclad commitment or not.


Passage number 347.
MR. BULLARD.  Well, you’re saying that sometimes what the Committee says moves the market, and then other times, the market is moving the date of liftoff independently because of changes to the data. I’m saying that the data were very volatile around the August meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents two different perspectives regarding the relationship between the Committee's statements and market movements, without any clear disagreement between the speakers.


Passage number 348.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There are no contradictory statements or opposing opinions in the sentence.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 349.
 MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up on that.  This other hypothesis about August is that it conveyed our sense of future economic data as much as it conveyed information about our reaction function, and the same thing plagued interpreting March 2009, right. We don’t know whether they’re taking a signal from our read about the economy—gloomier than they thought we’d read the economy—or it’s the reaction function.  Do you have a way of teasing that out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is presenting two hypotheses and suggesting that it is unclear which one is correct. They are questioning whether the interpretations of the data are influenced by the Federal Reserve's views on the economy or by their reaction function.


Passage number 350.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It doesn’t matter.  They’re both in there.  When we said “extended period,” we said we think conditions will be such that low rates will be justified.  So that’s saying something both about our expectations of economic conditions and about our reaction to those conditions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact without any opposing opinions or conflicting ideas being presented.


Passage number 351.
 MR. LACKER.  Oh, I know it does, but as a matter of logic, there are two separate effects going on:  how they’re updating about our reaction function and how they’re updating about the data, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It simply states two separate effects and acknowledges their existence without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 352.
 MR. SACK.  I think if it were seen as a significant downgrade to the forecast, you probably would have seen a meaningful decline in equity prices on the announcement, which I don’t believe happened.  I do believe it was interpreted as a defining signal about policy intentions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating their belief about the interpretation of an announcement and the potential impact on equity prices.


Passage number 353.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We’ll continue with questions, but I just want to make sure everybody will have a chance, of course, to comment on the whole situation here.  Two-handers.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging that everyone will have a chance to comment on the situation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 354.
   MR. FISHER.  I think we have to be very careful about what we ascribe any market movement to; markets don’t work that way.  I did read Bill’s paper pretty carefully, and by the way, it’s a thoughtful presentation. I really appreciate it.  You talk about the number of basis points.  Again, we’re talking about one-hundredths of 1 percent.  Now, the shorter you are on the yield curve, one can assume that you wouldn’t have a market impact.  I think President Bullard’s point is very good, and President Lacker raised a very good point.  It’s not clear what you can ascribe things to.  The question is the effect over the longer term.  I do believe we have suppressed the yield curve.  I don’t believe we’ve done it alone.  It’s happened in circumstances relative to what’s happened elsewhere.  We’ve seen additional oomph come from what’s happened in Europe and our relative performance. But I think we have to be extremely careful. We might observe an event occurring, but ascribing it to what is said at this table, particularly with immediacy, may be reading too much into the data.  The data are helpful, but at least for what it’s worth, again, as a former market operator, you never know what moves the market, and I think we take too much credit for immediate reaction. It’s what we do on a sustained basis over time that is impactful, and I do believe we send signals to the market, clearly, that we expect to repress any tightening of policy for a substantial period.  That takes time to factor into the market.  The explanation as to why we do it is, as pointed out earlier, also very critical.  But I would urge the Committee, again, from one person’s perspective, not to read too much into any immediate market reaction because on any one minute, any one second, any one day, the market reacts to a multiplicity of factors that none of us understand.  That’s the way markets work.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker is expressing disagreement with the idea of ascribing market movements to specific events or statements made at the table.


Passage number 355.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "President Kocherlakota" does not contain any specific information or statements that indicate contention or disagreement. It simply mentions the title of a person, which does not imply any disagreement or controversy.


Passage number 356.
   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I want to say that I appreciate the staff’s responsiveness to my questions from the last meeting and am very much looking forward to the fruits of their labor.  I have a quick question about alternative A, which is about capacity constraints for those kinds of purchases.  Alternative A talks about $500 billion of purchases through, I think, January 2013, and I was wondering, if one wanted a more accommodative alternative A, how high could we go in terms of that number without impairing market function.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement of appreciation and a question regarding a specific topic.


Passage number 357.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Do you want to respond, Brian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. English is simply asking Brian if he wants to respond to something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 358.
 MR. SACK. Purchasing $500 billion through January involves purchasing at a pace of just over $40 billion a month.  We’re comfortable that we could do that program through January of 2013 without significant market consequences, but we couldn’t do it for a number of years.  I think our best judgment is that sometime in the second year, we would become quite concerned about market functioning.  At that point, our purchases would be outrunning the amount of gross supply, so we’d have to be extracting holdings from other holders.  And the deeper we have to go there, the more significant types of market disruptions we think can occur.  So I would say that if the Committee were intent on carrying that pace of purchases for a second year or beyond, we’d want to entertain the possibility of shifting some of the purchases into Treasury securities, in addition to MBS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that if the Committee were to continue purchasing at the same pace for a second year or beyond, they would need to consider shifting some of the purchases into Treasury securities, but it is not clear if everyone in the Committee would agree with this suggestion.


Passage number 359.
 MR. EVANS.  Brian, what do you mean by “market disruptions”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any sign of contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question.


Passage number 360.
 MR. LACKER.  Thanks, Chuck.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any statement or information that indicates contention or disagreement. It is only a response of gratitude.


Passage number 361.
 MR. SACK.  I know President Lacker likes that question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sack is simply stating a fact about President Lacker's preference for a certain question.


Passage number 362.
  [Laughter]   MR. EVANS.  Well, it didn’t seem to me as though going in and purchasing from somebody who owned the asset already would be a disruption.  So we might have different interests here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their perspective or opinion, acknowledging that there might be different interests at play.


Passage number 363.
 MR. SACK.  I think when market participants talk about this, they confuse two issues that we want to separate very carefully.  What we’re not talking about is having a bigger market effect.  I think that would be a positive development and presumably an intention of the program.  What we’re talking about is a loss of liquidity in the market itself, a loss of the ability of private agents to transact in the market, and we had an episode of this in the first round of mortgage purchases.  We bought an awfully large portion of the gross issuance in certain coupons—fours, four-and-a-halfs.  At one point, we tried to buy an additional amount of higher coupons, five-and-a-halfs, in which case we had to pull securities out of the stock.  And even though we owned a much smaller fraction of that, that process actually led to significant disruptions in that coupon in terms of the liquidity of that coupon and in terms of our ability to settle the holdings.  We discussed this at the time, and the Committee approved a coupon swap to let us, at the end of the program, not demand delivery of the five-and-a-halfs and switch to a different coupon.  So we do have some evidence that diving too far into the stock can cause these market difficulties.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation and discussing the potential consequences of certain actions in the market.


Passage number 364.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. In terms of Treasuries, presumably we’d want to be buying longer-term Treasuries.  What’s our capacity look like on that dimension. My understanding from our discussion of the maturity extension program was, even there we have some capacity constraints.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question about the capacity limitations in buying longer-term Treasuries.


Passage number 365.
 MR. SACK.  Right.  In Treasuries, we currently own about 20 percent of the stock of coupon securities, and of course, our holdings are staying unchanged, whereas market supply is increasing.  So over time, that would drift down.  However, in longer securities, from 6 toyears, when we’re done with the maturity extension program, our holdings will actually be 30 to 35 percent of the market in aggregate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states the current ownership percentage and discusses how it may change over time without expressing any disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 366.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. That’s a lot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by an individual (Mr. Kocherlakota) and does not involve any conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 367.
 MR. SACK.  So we’re quite large there already. We believe we could push that further.  As I said, if the Committee were interested in a larger or longer LSAP program, I do think we could shift some of the purchases into Treasuries comfortably and easily get to outcomes where this type of program could be carried on for two years or longer, but there, too, eventually there could be a limit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the possibility of expanding a program.


Passage number 368.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple expression of gratitude and does not involve any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 369.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke, did you have a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a direct question to Governor Duke asking if they had a two-hander.


Passage number 370.
 MS. DUKE.  Well, actually I do now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they now know something.


Passage number 371.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of laughter suggests that the atmosphere is light and jovial.


Passage number 372.
 MS. DUKE.  What was the total issuance this year.  I thought it was just, like, $900 billion or something—total new issuance of MBS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Duke is asking a question and expressing her belief about the total new issuance of MBS.


Passage number 373.
 MR. SACK.  Gross issuance of mortgages.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the gross issuance of mortgages.


Passage number 374.
 MS. DUKE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 
Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 375.
  MR. SACK. What we project for 2012 is just over $1 trillion of gross issuance for the year.  So if we take a $500 billion LSAP combined with about $325 billion of reinvestments that we project, that gets us to two-thirds or a little bit higher of the gross as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of projected numbers and calculations.


Passage number 376.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 377.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, did you have a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is a question directed at President Lacker, asking if he has a comment on something.


Passage number 378.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I’m always curious and yearning for more when I hear you say things like you did just now about liquidity.  I think of liquidity as whether you can buy or sell an   asset, and you contrasted that with your effect on the price.  You go in and you buy the 5 percent coupon.  Presumably, that drives up the price.  Presumably, people who can sell can sell it easier now.  If you’re trying to buy, presumably it’s harder, but that’s supply and demand, right. What do you mean by liquidity drying up in this context.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a question asking for clarification and further explanation of the concept of liquidity.


Passage number 379.
 MR. SACK. I mean the ability to buy or sell at the market price no matter what the effect on the price is, wherever the market moves—the ability of other agents to transact in volume at something close to that price and actually receive delivery of the securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining the concept of the ability to buy or sell at the market price and the ability of other agents to transact at a similar price and receive the securities. There is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 380.
 MR. LACKER.  At what price.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or statements that would suggest contention or disagreement. It simply includes a statement made by Mr. Lacker, without any conflicting or contradictory information.


Passage number 381.
 MR. SACK.  At whatever the market price becomes after our transaction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 382.
 MR. LACKER.  What does the market price mean in this context if it’s not what you can buy and sell at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any argument or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for clarification or further explanation.


Passage number 383.
 MR. SACK. In a liquid, well-functioning market, there will be a market price where private agents can transact, buy or sell, at something close to that price in volume.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply explains that in a liquid and well-functioning market, private agents can transact at a price close to the market price in high volume. There are no conflicting opinions or contradicting statements in the passage.


Passage number 384.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. If I could just interject, think about it as how much I would move the market for a given size of purchase or sale.  As the market becomes more illiquid, I move the market by more for a purchase or sale of a given size.  And the bid–asked premium might also widen.  So that’s how you think about illiquidity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing an explanation for how to think about illiquidity in the market.


Passage number 385.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay, and that’s different than affecting the price you get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply stating a fact without any indication of disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 386.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The price is determined where the supply equals demand, but illiquidity is how much I move the price for a given quantity of purchases or sales. That’s how I define the difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply explaining the relationship between price and liquidity.


Passage number 387.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 388.
 MR. FISHER.  Can I just ask for one more information point. What are the equivalent figures for the MBS market in terms of our concentration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply asking for additional information about the equivalent figures for the MBS market in terms of concentration, indicating no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 389.
 MR. SACK. In aggregate, meaning our holdings relative to fixed-rate agency MBS outstanding in total, we are 18 to 19 percent of the market, but again, as with Treasuries, there are certain segments where our holdings are larger. In the 4 and 4½ percent coupons, our holdings are more in the 35 to 45 percent range of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing factual information about the percentage of market holdings of certain securities. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 390.
 MR. FISHER.  Thirty-five to 45.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing a response to a question.


Passage number 391.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention President Rosengren's position on any issue, therefore there is no contention or disagreement mentioned.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 392.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I had a question, again, on the language in paragraph 3.  From alternative A at the last meeting to alternative B at this meeting, the language went through a substantial change.  I looked at this language and thought about what the effect of a disruption on oil prices in the Mideast would be—where, over the short term, the inflation rate would go up quite substantially, and we’d probably, over the two-year period, move further away from our unemployment objective.  When we go to a total measure but go to a short horizon, I wonder if various supply shocks become problematic with the threshold.  If it was a horizon further out or if we used a core concept or talked about underlying inflation—there are a number of ways to change that language, either through the actual threshold or through actually what we’re measuring or through the time period—the language would be less susceptible to a supply shock.  Do you have that concern with this language.  And it gets to the Chairman’s comment that this is not binding, that it is conditional language, and there are circumstances where this language wouldn’t necessarily be something that generated us to tighten.  But just looking at the way the language was structured here, it seemed more susceptible than the language in alternative A at the last meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren expresses his concern about the language change from alternative A to alternative B and suggests that the new language is more susceptible to a supply shock. He questions whether using a total measure but a short time horizon is the best approach and suggests alternative ways to change the language to make it less susceptible to supply shocks.


Passage number 393.
 MR. ENGLISH. Two thoughts on that.  One is, the one-to-two-year horizon is supposed to say, yes, you could get an oil shock or whatever that would push inflation up, but if you see it coming down, say, year after next to something close to your objective, then that’s okay.  And the other is that, as you say, these are thresholds; they’re not triggers.  So the Committee could say, “Gee, we’ve had such a large shock that inflation will be away from our objective for a couple of years—it won’t come back until, say, year three, but we’re okay with that.  And we’ll not necessarily have to take any action to tighten policy given this language.” That was our intent, in any case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing two different thoughts or perspectives on the issue and explaining their understanding of the intent behind the language being discussed.


Passage number 394.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement evident in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude after receiving information or assistance.


Passage number 395.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 396.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, I want to ask about your choice of 6½ percent in alternative A and what the thought process was.  It could be just as simple as using B as a fulcrum.  A adds more accommodation and C removes some accommodation, but an alternative interpretation might be that A implies a lower assumption of the NAIRU than B, or A implies a higher tolerance for inflation risk than B, or the unemployment rate is now serving as a proxy for a later liftoff. So could you elaborate further on the thought process of getting to a 6½ unemployment rate as a choice in A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lockhart is simply asking for further clarification and elaboration on the thought process behind the choice of a 6½ percent unemployment rate in alternative A.


Passage number 397.
 MR. ENGLISH. In A, what we were trying to suggest was that the Committee could try to provide a little more accommodation by, in effect, making it likelier that the Committee would wait longer before raising rates—or at least suggesting that to the public by having a lower threshold for the unemployment rate.  In terms of the SEP contributions for members of the FOMC, four people had SEP contributions for the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff that were about 6½ or lower.  That’s including somebody at 6.6 percent.  So it seemed a plausiblenumber given your SEP contributions.  As I said in my briefing, if you were taking seriously the staff’s optimal control exercises, you could conceivably wait considerably longer still, and we could conceivably have written down an even lower unemployment threshold in alternative A. But that seemed to get away from the SEP contributions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their reasoning and considerations when discussing the unemployment rate threshold.


Passage number 398.
 MR. LOCKHART.  So if you were to provide a whole spectrum of alternatives instead of five, basically, you could have said that A is essentially a 7 percent threshold, but 2015 or 2016.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply proposing a hypothetical scenario by suggesting the possibility of providing a wider range of alternatives.


Passage number 399.
 MR. ENGLISH.  That would be another way to do it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contentio or disagreement in the passage. It simply presents another way to do something without any conflicting viewpoints or contradictory statements.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 400.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage indicated by the response of "Yes" from Mr. Lockhart.


Passage number 401.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I want to make the observation that there is a substantial amount of thinking in academia about the notion that in a liquidity trap, you might want to promise to keep rates lower longer than would be time-consistent.  That is, you want to promise that even when inflation begins to pick up, you’ll keep rates low.  And if that promise is credible, which it may not be, that can produce more stimulus now and give overall better results.  So if you interpret the SEP as being the time-consistent path of policy, there is an argument—I think a pretty reasonable argument—that one might consider going beyond that point in order to get further stimulus now.  But that’s just one additional way of thinking about this.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting different perspectives and ideas about monetary policy in a liquidity trap without taking a specific stance or engaging in an argument.


Passage number 402.
 MS. DUKE.  My question has to do with the language and how you see the language evolving over time.  When we did “mid-2013,” the ink wasn’t even dry before we started wringing our hands about whether that was the right date and whether we should move it or express it differently. So I’m happy to see that the “late 2014” is pretty consistent with the projections that we’re going to publish, but I can see that over time, the projections might move. I was wondering how you thought about changing that guidance, if that guidance is in there— how often, how frequently, with what kinds of circumstances.  And then similarly, is the language on the unemployment rate or on inflation a transparency piece or new dials to turn.  So sometimes in alternative A, the language is, “This is the next step in this process.”  Would we think about the language in 3 as being another dial to be turned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question asking for clarification and the speaker is expressing their interest in understanding how certain language and guidance may change over time. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 403.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think my intention would be that the date would have to be adjusted.  It would need to be at least roughly consistent with the SEP contributions.  If the Committee decided, as the Chairman said a moment ago, to go more in the direction of a commitment to keep rates lower for longer, then the 7 percent, for example, could change, the thresholds could change. If the Committee didn’t decide to go in that direction, I would expect that those wouldn’t necessarily change, although ultimately, if economic conditions change, of course they might have to.  But you’d want to try to have these things be more or less squared up with the SEP contributions, though there can be some discussion by the Committee and agreement by the Committee to agree to things that aren’t necessarily exactly what’s in the SEP contributions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the possibility of adjusting certain thresholds and rates based on the Committee's decision and economic conditions. There is no conflicting opinion or argument presented.


Passage number 404.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In the given passage, Ms. Duke is expressing appreciation or gratitude. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 405.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions for Bill.  [No response] If not, we’re ready for our go-round, and we’ll start with President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 406.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, did you say near the end—I didn’t quite understand.  Are you more comfortable with B(3′).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply seeking clarification or further understanding of President Lacker's statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 407.
 MR. LACKER.  No, I don’t think we should provide forward guidance at this meeting, either in the date form or in the contingent form, given what’s in the SEP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is stating his opinion that forward guidance should not be provided at the meeting, while the rest of the participants in the meeting may have a different view on this issue.


Passage number 408.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The content is focused on expressing gratitude to President Williams.


Passage number 409.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unable to determine without the passage.


Passage number 410.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today I support alternative B with paragraph 3′. My own projection has the funds rate lifting off in late 2014, reaching 50 basis points at the end of 2014.  That’s consistent with the statement as written in 3′. I am uncomfortable with the threshold language in paragraph 3.  Simple thresholds work fine in certain circumstances, such as the military command “Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes.”  [Laughter] So much for no laughter.  However, attempting to represent our monetary policy reaction function with such a simple threshold runs the risk of confusing the public about how we set monetary policy.  And I think President Rosengren’s comments actually illustrate that difficulty regarding an oil supply shock and how the language in this current version of 3 works.  It could be misinterpreted as, if you have an oil price shock that pushes inflation up for a year or two, a signal to markets that we would be raising rates.  Now, I recognize that this is a very difficult challenge to, in a couple of sentences, describe the Committee’s reaction function.  I actually think these efforts are very good efforts, but it’s hard to get this right.  I think that 2½ percent, which was in the earlier draft, also suffered from this issue of raising the question of whether that is somehow our medium-term target.  So these illustrate some of the difficulties  with trying to describe our reaction function through thresholds in a couple of sentences. In fact, the appropriate setting of monetary policy depends on many variables.  It depends on the path on which the economy is going; it also depends on the assessment of risks.  And so I think, again, a simple threshold around the unemployment rate and/or the inflation rate, the way it’s described in 3, is potentially confusing in terms of describing our reaction function.  I’m also worried about how the communication of these thresholds would affect the market reaction.  As the Tealbook notes, it’s difficult to gauge what effect the thresholds in paragraph 3 would have on funds rate expectations going forward.  And I, again, worry about that.  The interaction of policy thresholds with diffuse and time-varying private-sector macroeconomic forecasts is hard to predict.  So, again, I’d prefer paragraph 3′. Looking forward beyond today, we may still have to provide more policy accommodation if the economy loses momentum or inflation remains well below the 2 percent objective.  In these circumstances, I would support greater efforts to ease policy through the purchases of mortgage-backed securities.  I am drawn to the flow-based approach described in paragraph 3′ of alternative A that features an open-ended pace of purchases of, say, $40 billion per month. I actually appreciated very much the staff memo that went through the different ways of approaching MBS purchases going forward.  As I’ve said in the past, and as the staff memo points out, having this open-ended or flow-based approach is more consistent with the standard monetary policy reaction of adjusting policy as economic conditions change.  I also recognize that, in my view, the effects of an MBS program depend on the expected stock and expected path of that program.  So it would be appropriate, even with a flow-based approach, to provide some forward guidance saying that we expect to continue these purchases at least through the year-end or something like that.  To my mind, the big advantage of the flow-based approach is that itavoids this abrupt end of the purchase program either on a date or an amount.  Now, I do recognize, as we discussed earlier, that there are some market function issues involved. It would be good to have more information about how long we could actually extend MBS purchases or Treasury purchases.  Again, this discussion I’ve just had is about future policy, depending on how the economic circumstances change.  But for today, I’m in favor of alternative B with the language in 3′. In terms of the sentence in paragraph 2 “However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations,” my understanding of that sentence was the same as Bill described—that that was a reflection of the fact that inflation was running above desired levels and that inflation risks were elevated somewhat at that time.  And in fact, inflation has come down.  I don’t think we need that sentence anymore, given that the facts have changed.  So I would strike that sentence from paragraph 2.  Thank you.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 412.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B today, but not surprisingly, like others, I would like to suggest some modifications to paragraph 3.  As I stressed in the economic go-round yesterday, I see the outlook as largely unchanged from our last meeting, with a modest economic expansion, a slow decline in the unemployment rate, and an inflation rate that stays near 2 percent.  My outlook supports continuing the maturity extension program and the reinvestment of mortgage-backed securities.  And revealing that the anticipated period of low rates now stretches into 2014 will be seen as another action to support our objective for full employment and stable prices.  While some might see an economic outlook like mine as reason to ease policy even further, I don’t think any additional action is warranted today.  One reason is that my projection for falling inflation is just a projection, and further   declines may not materialize. I would like to see more inflation data supporting my projection.  Just as we were surprised by a rise in inflation last year, we could be surprised again this year or next.  For example, as I indicated in my comments yesterday, we could be surprised by the strength of OER over the next year or two.  If the inflation data come in weaker than my outlook, then that could be cause for further policy action.  A second reason that I prefer to wait on further policy accommodation is that further easing of policy would have some other costs by potentially causing inflation expectations to become unanchored or causing distortions in the Treasury and MBS markets and further complicating our exit strategy.  Based on these concerns, I favor holding off on more-aggressive action today. Regarding paragraph 3, my first preference is to let the Committee speak through our SEP and not put specific guidance in our statement.  We could phase in our communications and let the public digest the new information that we are providing through our policy strategy statement and our federal funds rate path projections in the SEP.  I don’t think we need to rush to give specific guidance at this meeting. However, given the choices offered in alternative B, I prefer paragraph 3 over 3′ because paragraph 3 better ties our forward guidance to economic conditions.  I am concerned with the rate of unemployment given in the paragraph.  I prefer an unemployment rate threshold of 7½ percent.  I think that the natural rate of unemployment is closer to 6, as I mentioned yesterday, than the 5½ percent that is used in the Tealbook’s Taylor rule illustration of the rationale for 7 percent.  My higher natural rate warrants a threshold greater than 7 percent.  That said, I realize that the unemployment threshold needs to reflect the consensus projection of the SEP.  And as President Lacker mentioned, nine of us believe that the unemployment rate will be above 7 percent at the first federal funds rate liftoff.  I also think our experience in the 2003–05 period warrants some caution in extending our policy guidance too far into the future.  I recall very clearly that when I joined the FOMC in January of 2003, the optimal policy prescription from the FRB/US model called for significant rate reductions and an extended period of very low interest rates. Two years later, with inflation much higher than had been forecast, the optimal policy prescription called for an aggressive tightening of policy.  While the optimal policy prescriptions at each point in time were certainly valid and very informative, they proved to be subject to considerable change.  Based on this experience, I am inclined to be cautious in following the prescriptions of optimal policy calculations and to leave ourselves plenty of flexibility.  The language in paragraph 3 should clarify our reaction function, but I also want to make sure that it gives us enough flexibility for us to act based on all available information.  So I would be more comfortable with an unemployment rate of 7½ percent and a date of mid-2014 for the liftoff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Pianalto disagrees with the policy of further easing, preferring to wait and see if inflation data supports her projection. She also disagrees with the specific guidance in paragraph 3 and suggests modifications to tie forward guidance to economic conditions. Additionally, she disagrees with the chosen unemployment rate threshold and suggests a higher threshold of 7½ percent.


Passage number 413.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude towards President Lockhart.


Passage number 414.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll start by stating my support for alternative B, and then I’d like to discuss the distinction between paragraphs 3 and 3′. Before getting into that, let me make a couple of comments on how I’m thinking about the role of the statement versus the SEPs and the intended effect of forward guidance in the statement.  It strikes me that, just based on the first three statements on the policy that have been made this afternoon, we will be introducing innovations that create potential confusion as to the coordination between the statement, the SEPs, and the consensus statement that we approved yesterday, and that more work is required for all of us to understand how those fit together. To my way of thinking, the post-FOMC statement is a policy tool, and the SEP is supplemental   information that communicates individual views of FOMC participants. I don’t believe the SEPs can substitute for the statement of the Committee, because the projections do not represent a voted decision of the Committee or an actionable consensus of the Committee.  I do see forward guidance as a policy instrument—that is, a tool to influence market expectations.  And I think guidance needs to be expressed through the statement or the Chairman’s testimony and other public comments. I see the choice now between paragraphs 3 and 3′ as a question of, what’s the simplest and most effective way to convey guidance attuned to the public’s and the market’s key concerns.  And I think those concerns are the path of interest rates and the Fed’s market activity using the balance sheet. While I acknowledge some awkwardness in stating forward guidance in the form of a calendar date, I think it is still the more appropriate form for issuing official forward guidance regarding the policy outlook of the Committee.  Paragraph 3 retains the calendar date, of course, while introducing the innovation of conditional thresholds based on macroeconomic outcomes.  And the real innovation in this—one that the broad public may not be expecting—is an explicit macroeconomic threshold based on the unemployment rate.  Even if introduced with the affirmation of a “balanced approach,” included in the statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy, this strikes me as opening a new chapter for the FOMC.  And I have some misgivings about going down this road.  Many of us have made the fairly obvious point of the difficulty of expressing the Committee’s employment objective in terms of an unemployment rate as opposed to employment growth.  In recent months, we’ve seen an unexpected drop in the unemployment rate, and there has been much discussion about the causes of that drop and whether it will stick.  Attention has been rightly focused on how to interpret the nature of flows in and out of employment and the labor force. I worry that institutionalizing such an intense focus on a single labor indicator—the unemployment rate—would actually confuse the public’s understanding of the employment mandate.  I’m similarly uncomfortable with the asymmetry of specifying the unemployment threshold in terms of a realized outcome while the inflation threshold is expressed in terms of a forecast.  While the unemployment threshold is based on observable data, the inflation threshold, by nature, is based on our forecasts—in a way, our guesses—about what will happen.  And I worry that this could reinforce cynicism about our motives and has the potential to fuel an inference that the Committee’s true priorities have shifted rather profoundly in the direction of less commitment to low and stable inflation. In addition to concerns about going down the path of putting economic conditionality into the statement, I’m leery of the 7 percent threshold in option B, and even more so of the 6½ percent threshold in option A.  In my view, a 7 percent threshold is getting a little too close to reasonable estimates of the NAIRU. I think the criterion for an unemployment threshold, if we include one, should be that it is high enough that most people will see it as clearly consistent with price stability.  This is especially true since the nature of the threshold is that policy is not expected to adjust until the stated threshold is crossed.  Given the imprecision in estimating NAIRU, and our imperfect knowledge of the lags in monetary policy effects, a 7 percent threshold makes me a bit uncomfortable. So I am concerned that by adding these conditional thresholds to our rate guidance, the Committee may, perhaps unwittingly, introduce a bias in the direction of the employment mandate.  I think that interpretation is almost inevitable in some quarters and carries the risk of destabilizing inflation expectations.  So I would prefer paragraph 3′ in alternative B.  But now that I’m a voter, I’m not going to dissent over the language decision in the statement.  If the consensus is going to go with the substance of paragraph 3, I strongly prefer 7½ percent.  I thinkthis level is high enough to accommodate a wide range of views on the NAIRU or slack and gives the Committee more flexibility to exercise judgment in balancing these two objectives in varied circumstances.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses his support for alternative B and discusses his thoughts on the distinction between paragraphs 3 and 3′. He also shares his concerns about the inclusion of conditional thresholds and his preference for a higher unemployment threshold. However, he states that if the consensus is to go with paragraph 3, he would strongly prefer a 7½ percent threshold. Overall, there is no disagreement or contention, just a presentation of different opinions and preferences.


Passage number 415.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you. President Rosengren" is simply expressing gratitude towards President Rosengren.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 416.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I support using thresholds, including a 7 percent unemployment rate, but feel we need to rework the language before it is included in the statement. I was somewhat surprised that B does not include additional quantitative easing, given the direction that our discussion was heading at the last meeting and the modest deterioration in the Tealbook forecast since then.  Given how far we are from both elements of the mandate both in the Tealbook and my own forecast, it is likely we will not be tightening until beyond 2014.  To shorten the time period of exceptionally low rates would require either much faster growth than is currently predicted or more accommodative monetary and/or fiscal policy in the near term. If GDP growth is as slow as the Tealbook envisions, and we continue to experience large misses on our mandates, at the next meeting we should consider beginning a large mortgage purchase program to reduce the adjustment period.  I support thresholds because they move us in the direction of a statement based on economic outcomes rather than a calendar date.  That said, I am concerned that the latest version of the statement reduced the inflation threshold from 2½ to 2 percent.  We will be announcing a 2 percent goal today, which should clear up any confusion about our longer-term goal. I am not in favor of language that might be interpreted as making 2 percent sound like a ceiling.  Given our current and expected elevated unemployment rate, I believe we need the latitude to allow modest fluctuations of inflation around our longer-run goal, consistent with a quadratic loss function.In addition, I would not support removing the calendar date from the statement now, for reasons just described by President Lockhart.  The SEP, as of this meeting, reflects the expected funds rate path for all participants, with no distinction between voting and nonvoting members.  The markets will price in the interest rate path that reflects the expected vote of the Committee. I believe paragraph 3, with a calendar date, maintains this distinction and better reflects the consensus of the Committee than a scatter diagram of our individual interest rate paths.  Unless we change the SEP—for example, by distinguishing voters from nonvoters or identifying the submissions—the statement will remain our best way to communicate the consensus of the current voting members, which should include the likely date of liftoff and the economic conditions consistent with that liftoff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses support for alternative B but also suggests that the language of the statement needs to be reworked. They also express surprise that alternative B does not include additional quantitative easing, which indicates a disagreement with the direction of the discussion. Additionally, the speaker expresses concern about the reduction of the inflation threshold and disagrees with removing the calendar date from the statement.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 426.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Because I’m in my normal spot today, as opposed to President Fisher’s spot, I’m going to return to my normal incoherence.  So I apologize for that.  My hair is not on fire, but President Evans has got a match pretty close to it.   [Laughter] I’m going to argue pretty strenuously on three points, and probably most strenuously on the first point.  I do not think that simply citing high unemployment and low inflation indicates that more should be done.  I’ve argued this before, and I’ll try to be more aggressive today on that point.  Then I’ll discuss thresholds in the statement. I agree with many of the previous speakers that this is potentially quite confusing, both for the Committee and for financial markets.  And then I’ll discuss calendar dates in the statement, which I have opposed in the past, and with the SEP now, it’s not clear that a date in the forecast really means anything compared with the SEP. I’ve already suggested a qualitative statement that lets the SEP do the talking, and I’ll come to that at the end.  I have provided language in a memo. So let me start on the first point, and let me characterize what some of the argument around the table is.  This is a characterization—I’m overdoing it a little bit to make a point:  “Unemployment is high.  Inflation is near target.  That can’t possibly be the optimal policy, and therefore we must do more.”  That’s what I’m hearing.  Let me make the point that if you look at the memo from Jean-Philippe Laforte, this is patently false. Let’s consider the optimal policy exercises that are included in Laforte’s memo.  This is in the Tealbook.  It’s called “Uncertainty about the Tealbook Forecast and Alternative Simulations,” and it’s the standard memo that we always get. In particular, figure 2 in the memo shows how unemployment and inflation would evolve, according to the model, under fully optimal commitment strategy for the Committee.  So at least if you’re willing to accept the model, you can’t do better than that.  I’ll come back to the assumptions under the model, but if you accept the model, you can’t do better.  This is the full commitment solution.  In that scenario, unemployment would remain high, and inflation would be about 2.1 percent a year from now.  So you would get to 2013, and you’d have inflation pretty close to target, and you’d have pretty high unemployment.  If you accept the model and acceptthat the Committee was able to pursue the full commitment strategy, then these are the values that would obtain in 2013.  And yet, as I am interpreting the argument around the table, many of you would come back to the Committee and say, “Well, we’ve got high unemployment, inflation is essentially at target, and that suggests more should be done.” But that would be a wrong statement in my view, because the most that can be done is already being done, according to that exercise. In that circumstance, in fact, doing more would be making things worse by knocking the economy off the optimal path that’s been calculated.  So the point is that simply citing high unemployment and low inflation is not enough to determine whether the Committee is doing as much as possible or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, is arguing against the belief that high unemployment and low inflation indicate that more should be done. He disagrees with the idea that simply citing these factors is enough to determine whether the Committee is doing as much as possible. He argues that if the optimal policy exercise is considered and the model is accepted, then the current actions of the Committee are already doing as much as possible.


Passage number 427.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard, people are looking for the memo that you’re citing.  Could you tell us where to find it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for the location of a memo.


Passage number 428.
 MR. BULLARD. This is “Uncertainty about the Tealbook Forecast and Alternative Simulations,” which is the standard memo that we get. It has the scenarios about a lost decade.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply mentions an internal memo titled "Uncertainty about the Tealbook Forecast and Alternative Simulations" that contains scenarios about a lost decade.


Passage number 429.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I’m looking at the unconstrained monetary policy, optimal control on page 3 of Tealbook, Book B, and it has PCE inflation rising above 2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It states a fact about the PCE inflation rising above 2 percent.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 430.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The word "Yes" indicates that there is contention or disagreement in the passage. However, without any further context provided, it is difficult to determine the extent or nature of the disagreement.


Passage number 431.
 MR. BULLARD.  Are you talking about Laforte’s memo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement, as it only mentions Mr. Bullard asking a question about Laforte's memo without any opposing views or conflicting statements.


Passage number 432.
 MR. EVANS.  No—talking about the Bluebook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating that the discussion is about the Bluebook. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 433.
 MR. BULLARD.  No—Laforte’s memo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The quote represents a response to a question and does not indicate any contradictory statement or argument.


Passage number 434.
 MR. EVANS.  That was only for research directors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about research directors.


Passage number 435.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Mr. Wilcox is going to adjudicate.  What is the difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Wilcox is going to adjudicate, without any conflicting statements or opposing opinions presented. The question posed at the end does not introduce any disagreement either; it seeks clarification about the difference between something unspecified.


Passage number 436.
 MR. WILCOX.  Okay.  Bill, help me out here.  I think the closest analog that you should all have in front of you is shown in Book B, on page 3, which shows the constrained optimalcontrol trajectory. The difference in what is shown in Jean-Philippe’s memo is that it also plots the Tealbook baseline, and Jean-Philippe’s memo compares the optimal policy trajectory under commitment and under discretion.  So what the version that President Bullard is referring to shows is that, compared with the Tealbook baseline, the optimal policy under commitment, which is the same one that’s shown on page 3 of Book B, holds the funds rate at the current target range longer—through, it looks like, about mid-2016—whereas the liftoff under the Tealbook baseline, which is driven by the outcome-based rule, has liftoff occurring in late 2014.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining the differences between two different graphs and their implications. There is no clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 437.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  So all optimal policies imply inflation above 2 percent.  Only the rule-based—am I right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing agreement and confirming their understanding.


Passage number 438.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay. I’m looking at this picture, “PCE inflation.” In 2013, it’s about 2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact about PCE inflation in 2013 being about 2 percent.


Passage number 439.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  But it doesn’t project inflation below 2 percent indefinitely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It simply states a fact or observation without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 440.
 MR. BULLARD. I’m coming to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is simply stating that he will address the topic mentioned.

Passage number 443.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage "Thank you. President George" as it is a simple expression of gratitude towards President George without any conflicting statements or opposing opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 444.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Because I view the outlook as largely unchanged over the last few meetings, I see no need for the additional accommodation through our balance sheet as described in alternative A or for the further easing through the date extension in alternative B. In addition, now that we are providing projections for the path of the federal funds rate, I, like others, think we should use this opportunity to revisit the nature of our forward guidance from the FOMC statement.  In particular, I would prefer that policy not be tied to the calendar or to specific thresholds for unemployment and inflation.  Rather, we should set policy as described in our consensus statement based on our longer-run goals, our medium-term outlook, and our assessment of the balance of risk, including risk to the financial system.  This strategy necessarily involves consideration of broader factors than suggested by language that emphasizes a date or threshold levels for unemployment and inflation.  With respect to the thresholds, I am particularly concerned about establishing a threshold for unemployment.  We simply do not have reliable estimates of the extent to which unemployment is structural versus cyclical today, much less several years into the future.  Finally, I continue to believe that our problems are not readily amenable to further monetary policy solutions without potential tradeoffs for low and stable inflation down the road.  I expect that the current softness in inflation will be short lived and that by the end of next year, we’ll see readings closer to 2 percent. I also continue to worry that additional action intended to speed improvement in the housing and labor markets could have unintended consequences in the longer run.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. George disagrees with the need for additional accommodation through the balance sheet and the date extension. She also disagrees with tying policy to specific thresholds for unemployment and inflation and expresses concern about establishing a threshold for unemployment. Additionally, she believes that further monetary policy solutions may have potential tradeoffs for low and stable inflation down the road.


Passage number 445.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 446.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I am in complete accord with President Evans but also with President Williams and with President Plosser and President Bullard and President Lacker. [Laughter].  I’m in accord with President Evans and President Williams because I do disagree with the conditionality that is stated in B(3). First, let me just quickly summarize that in terms of alternative A, I would be against additional purchases, and I think we would create a firestorm in terms of those who scrutinize us politically.  I don’t think it’s necessary economically, and it would be unwise, particularly given that, if I counted correctly yesterday, eight of the interlocutors who spoke pointed out that conditions were a little bit better in the economy than they had been before.  One was neutral— that is, Vice Chairman Dudley was somewhat in between.  So we had, if not a majority, certainly a fairly even count. That indicates to me that things are not worse than they were before.  We all have concerns.  I thought there were some very eloquent statements by Governor Tarullo and by you, Mr. Chairman, with regard to “beware of false dawns.” We’ve seen them before, and we must be wary. But I would say, on balance, that it would be a mistake to add to our portfolio at this juncture. With regard to alternative B, I agree with the suggestion that the wording in the first paragraph of alternative C is much more appropriate in describing how I see the economy.  Unless we have some good information about a new impending shock—we are all on the balls of our feet, perhaps, expecting one—we have no new information about the economic conditions in Europe.  I worry that option B as it’s written would unintentionally talk the economy down, just as businesses—as we heard through not only anecdotal evidence, but also from the eight people who summarized their views of the economy—appear to be becoming slightly—and I stress the word “slightly”—more confident.  My concern with this whole exercise, however, is message management.  We’re doing a lot of things at once. I want to correct one misimpression I think you have, Mr. Chairman.  You were very kind yesterday to mention my reference to forward   guidance as viewed in the corporate community.  Of course you plan, of course you forecast.  The issue is making it public and what traps that creates. Having said all that, we are going to make public our projections, our SEP.  I may not value that as much as others at this table, but it is an exercise we’re undergoing. I believe that should substitute for the conditionality and for the date that we place in our statements in terms of our policy alternatives.  I also think there are concerns about contradictions with our long-term goals and policy strategy statement if we get into the specifics that others from a different viewpoint have expressed concern over.  We do talk about a 2 percent longer-term rate, and I had suggested some language, were I to go along with statement B, that might soften the way it’s currently written so we don’t get locked into the short term.  But we also say in paragraph 4 of our longer-run goals and policy strategy, “It would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment,” and yet in paragraph 3 of alternative B, what are we doing. Laying out a specific number—7, 7½ percent for the unemployment rate, which is just the mirror image of employment.  So I think you could create confusion in the marketplace here.  I’m worried about simple message management. We have taken significant steps with the statement of goals and policy strategy. Not 100 percent of us are on board there.  I was somewhat sympathetic to the arguments Governor Tarullo made, but that’s the decision that was made. Laying out our strategic goals helps frame our actions and expectations overall.  And now we’re going to release the new SEP. I think that’s big news.  I think it indicates, as I like to call them, the best guesses—forecasts are guesses—of the Committee as to when we think we’ll have a takeoff point.  I think these two exercises give markets and others plenty to discuss and to digest and can set the stage for any tactical adjustments for policy at our next meeting in March.  At that point, we’ll have muchmore information about whether the recovery is proceeding as some of us perceive, whether or not the situation in Europe is worse or becoming dire, or whether we need to react to some financial event that we should, as central bankers, react to. So, Mr. Chairman, I would advocate, if I had a vote, taking the language of the first paragraph of alternative C, not referring to the date in 3′, but utilizing 3′; and I would also, as a footnote, always include that “the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.” I think that to take that out now doesn’t get us very much.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 449.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude directed towards Governor Duke.


Passage number 450.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B with paragraph 3′. And for the most part, I agree with President Lockhart and, in the interest of time, won’t repeat all of his points.  But I think the one where he said that the statement is policy, which is subject to a vote, and that the SEP is supplemental information is a very important point and does bear repeating.  With paragraph 3, when I originally read it, I was concerned that the simultaneous  publication of this statement, along with the consensus statement, and having originally 2 percent inflation in one document and 2½ in another document, and then having a range for unemployment and then another number for unemployment, all in the same day, seemed likely to me to create quite a bit of confusion as to what we were actually talking about.  So I came in here thinking “not yet” for the conditional threshold language.  After listening to the discussion, I now believe that “not yet” is “not possible”—that it’s not possible to find agreement on this language and possibly not worth all of the disagreements over both language and levels in here. The Chairman raised yesterday a question of whether we are now powerless, and I don’t think we’re out of tools, but certainly our arsenal is greatly diminished.  Because it’s so diminished, I think we have to get maximum effectiveness out of every tool we decide to deploy.  And if communication is going to be a tool that we’re going to use, then the simplicity, clarity, and consistency of that message is, I think, key to its effectiveness. On the other potential tool, which is additional purchases of MBS, I’m not opposed to them as a tool to be deployed, but before we start an MBS program, we need to think about how we can time it to maximize its effectiveness. We’re already seeing some effect just from the expectations that we may at some point in the future resume MBS purchases, and I think we should get the maximum effectiveness out of that.  Also, there may come a point where the data are more obviously disappointing than they are today.  And if so, then the purchases also have a signaling value in that they signal our determination to act to further ease policy.  And then finally, while I appreciated all of the analysis of the possible effect of MBS purchases, it didn’t include any mention of the current obstacles to transmission of low rates in the mortgage market.  Tight credit conditions are still a problem. Limited origination capacity might not be enough to accommodate newly eligible borrowers who want to refinance, as well as others who want to  refinance again, and new purchasers.  So I think we need to pay attention not only to the spread between Treasuries and MBS, but also to the spread between MBS and actual mortgage rates in the marketplace. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with President Lockhart and also expresses her own concerns and thoughts on the matter.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 452.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m tempted, in going through my points, to just indicate by reference the colleague who already made the point.  And so I can do that with Governor Duke on communication and MBS, President Kocherlakota on collective versus individual, and a whole plethora of you on the issue of the conditionality in paragraph 3. I’m not really happy with any of the alternatives that are before us. I should start by saying that I wish what we had had today, and even yesterday, was a discussion, as Betsy was just suggesting, of MBS—or, for that matter, Treasury purchases—with, before us, the kind of information that Narayana was suggesting in his questions to Brian earlier and an assessment of efficacy.  Is this really a case in which we need to understand ourselves as not having considerable optionality going forward, but having to make some choices that don’t really have returns.  As Betsy was just suggesting, I wish we had been able to discuss the intersection between the action we take and nonconventional monetary policy transmission mechanisms— which is to say, how the mortgage market is or is not operating right now.  I’m not saying necessarily that we’d have been in a position to take action even if we had that discussion, but we didn’t.  I hope we’re going to be in a position to do that in the next meeting or two, and I guess it is incumbent on us, as well as the staff, to prepare for that. With respect to what we’ve got in front of us, we put ourselves in a bit of a box here with the initial date.  It was not only predictable, it was predicted—that we were going to create this issue for ourselves later on as to what we do about that.  So I guess since Narayana gave up,there’s not much point in my agreeing with him, but I agree with him anyway on the use of quarters and that the time to do it, of course, would be when you have to make a change anyway.  But I guess we’re not doing that.  We do need to do something, it seems to me. I think we are implicitly tightening right now, although since the markets expect a change, we’re probably not seeing that in reality.  But if we go very much longer without making a change, it will be a tightening.  So I would favor 3′ in alternative B as the best of a not particularly appealing set of options right now. I did want to say one more word on the projections issue.  Narayana and Dennis made the points, I thought, very well, but I did want to add the fact that for other central banks that use projections, and where projections become at least a complementary form of forward guidance, there is a collective process.  And we have no collective process at all here.  And so Dennis’s point about that, which Narayana echoed, is that a collective decision is very important ultimately.  However, even in the projections, we don’t have the kind of discussion that makes people try to align themselves around one or two or, I guess in some cases, three different options.  Instead, we have a scatter point analysis now, which provides some information, but I don’t know how useful it is as a matter of understanding where the Committee may go in the future. Finally, on communication—again, Betsy made the point, but I would just say I think the aim here is effective communication, not maximum information.  And I do fear right now that we are drifting toward this notion that somehow more information of whatever sort is always better.  I don’t think it’s a question of transparency or not, but it’s the same phenomenon that we all experience with the Internet. Does one feel better informed because one has a massive amount of information available to you, which is unfiltered, and no one has tried to put it together and distill it and figure out what, in some sense, is actually going on.  And I fear we’re drifting a bit in that direction.  That’s why I would have, at the very least, delayed a consensus statement.  And I must say, the discussion today makes me wonder about the concept of consensus behind that statement that you all voted on yesterday.  But I would have at least delayed it so that there’s an ability to gauge the reaction to the SEP, to make adjustments, perhaps—again, in line with questions Narayana has been asking about it—over time, and then, in a step-by-step fashion, to try to provide additional information. I’m going to end with a plea, which I know is a plea that will be made in vain, that people not take the opportunity of the vague language of the consensus statement to immediately go out and offer their own interpretations of what it means, because this is what I fear has happened all along, and I’ve already seen some of it—the speeches that have been given even before the statement was adopted. I was asked by someone—and I couldn’t answer because it’s something within the FOMC—“You guys have multiple statements that you’re considering right now.” And that’s what the three different speeches reflected—three different statements. I do fear that that is just going to complicate the communication efforts even further.  So again, with a plea that I know is in vain, it would be good if we could let the Chairman initially try to provide some elaboration and maybe let markets and analysts and others try to figure out what it all means. And maybe, if we’re lucky, they will come to the conclusion that this does illuminate somewhat what we’re doing.  But if we all go out and say what we think, it’s going to sound like the conditionality discussion here, and that does not suggest there’s any consensus whatsoever.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Tarullo expresses his disagreement with the alternatives that are being presented. He also voices his dissatisfaction with the lack of discussion on certain topics and argues that the communication efforts of the committee are becoming more complicated. Overall, there is a clear sense of contention and disagreement in Mr. Tarullo's statements.


Passage number 453.
  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude to Governor Raskin.


Passage number 454.
  MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before I would be ready to take any contractionary steps, I’d like to see more-sustained improvement in the fundamental drivers of economic growth.  As I noted yesterday, one fundamental driver that particularly concerns me is real disposable income, which actually edged down in the second and third quarters, not up.  These weak income data suggest that the growth in consumption that we have seen will have to be supported by credit growth, and without large jumps in consumer confidence or household wealth, I think rapidly rising credit would not be particularly desirable or sustainable.  So consumption and growth could sputter out.  Until we move away from a sputter-out possibility, I’m not inclined to begin contractionary steps. In terms of more Treasury purchases or purchases of mortgage-backed securities, they may be necessary to push the economy onto a more durable recovery path. My issue with employing them now has less to do with whether the economic outlook is sufficiently gloomy for us to decide on such steps and more to do with whether our analytical rationale is sufficiently capable of explaining to a suspicious public how such a program will promote economic growth.  I want to be careful about being glib about this hurdle.  We are not in the realm of the conventional.  We are in the realm of the unconventional, and the unconventional means that we have to be as absolutely precise in our understanding of the transmission channels as we possibly can be, and we must figure out the best ways to describe to average people how these transmission channels work when we engage in unconventional action.  For example, in the realm of MBS purchases, where there are a variety of securities that could be purchased with different coupon rates, we want to be very clear among ourselves what the various propensities to refinance are at various coupon rates.  Then we would want to think about how we trace these findings into both the sequencing of the purchases and the description of the purchases so that  the homeowner whom we are ultimately hoping will react will, in fact, react in a way that promotes a better alignment toward our intent in engaging in MBS purchases. For now, I support alternative B.  While I support paragraph 3′ for this meeting, I think a structure similar to the first version of paragraph 3 has some desirable features that should not be overlooked as we continue to consider the use of our tools.  First, I think that the three conditions that have been articulated are probably the closest we can get to the correct conditions to focus on:  the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and the state of long-term inflation expectations.  The first two conditions line up—not perfectly, but as close as we can get—with our statutory mandate. Including inflation expectations also seems important if we’re going to say that inflation should remain close to, say, 2 percent rather than below 2 percent. I like the flexibility that the “close to” language allows, because I think we should be open to allowing inflation to temporarily and modestly be above the number we choose, but including well-anchored inflation expectations makes it clear we would not tolerate much more than that. I also like that the clarity of the conditionality would encourage an automatic response in market participants’ expectations.  In other words, as conditions change, the markets have instant and contemporaneous information about whether the federal funds rate path is likely to change.  Determining the correct numbers is a serious question, but one that I think would be worth our effort to continue to consider. Finally, I want to briefly address any move afoot to make the SEP substitute for any elaboration of forward communication in our FOMC statement.  It’s worth noting that from a governance perspective, it would be misleading, if not statutorily prohibited, to permit the lines between voters and nonvoters to become fuzzy.  As noted by President Lockhart and President Rosengren, President Kocherlakota, and Governors Yellen and Duke, the SEP is prepared by all,   but the FOMC statement is not.  Equally fundamentally, forward guidance is a tool, and it belongs in the FOMC statement. Thank you.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage. The phrase "Thank you" is a polite expression of gratitude and does not involve any disagreement or conflict. The mention of "Vice Chairman" is unrelated and does not suggest any contention either.


Passage number 456.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Thanks, everyone, for your comments, which not only illuminate today’s conversation, but also provide some guidance for our future meetings and future discussions.  I listened very carefully, made a lot of notes.  I do continue to believe that alternative B is the right approach for today.  There was a lot of very interesting discussion on the conditional policy, B(3).  But some people had difficulties with the general approach, others had difficulties with the numbers, and others raised the possibility of, for example, giving more information about the reaction function more broadly.  There are a number of different ways to proceed here.  It’s an informative and potentially useful approach, but I don’t think I sensed a great deal of support for this language as written today.  So I recommend continuing to study this and related approaches going forward.  I therefore would suggest B(3′). On the question of the date, I have to associate myself with those who argue that the SEP is not a substitute for the Committee.  There are basic governance problems here.  It’s not just a question of voters versus nonvoters, although that is an issue, but more than that, our policies are not made by us individually through some kind of voting process.  It’s really a collective decision where we meet and discuss and come to some consensus.  We certainly wouldn’t want to set the federal funds rate in normal times by having everybody submit a vote before the meeting and then just tallying the results. We have a discussion, and clearly, the outcome of that discussion is the official decision of this Committee. I have agreed throughout that a simple date is far from perfect. However, the SEP does provide useful information about the reasons for the date. It does give the public a sense of what the views of the Committee are and what the projections are.  I think it does actually provide very good support for the particular choice that was put into the statement.  And although I don’t think we should move it willy-nilly, we should be prepared, if we do keep it this way in the future, to change the date. If there’s a significant change in the SEP and in the views of the Committee, then even a change of a quarter would be perfectly appropriate in either direction.  Also, I think putting the date in here is important for clarity because there are not very many people who are willing to go through the details of the SEP to try to infer what the Committee might do, and providing some overview of the collective judgment of the Committee is important.  So I would strongly support and strongly urge us to accept the date, understanding that this is a work in progress.  We’ll get more information about how the SEP is received.  We’ll continue to look at alternative ways to characterize our reaction function or to have rules.  So this is not a stopping point, as far as I’m concerned. A number of people talked about future policy actions, and we need to continue to work on those.  I accept President Bullard’s approach that a policy outcome or an economic forecast   that has inflation below target for a time is not necessarily suboptimal.  However, I would argue that a projection of inflation below target for a considerable period, beyond the normal lags in monetary policy, in most cases would be suboptimal, and I would ask each of you individually, as you look at your own rate projections and your policy analysis, to ask whether you are assuming that rates will be such that inflation remains below target not just for a year or two, but for a very long period.  For instance, I note that the Tealbook—of course, not everyone agrees with the Tealbook—has inflation about 1.5 percent out through 2016.  I doubt very much that you can construct a balanced approach, which means weight on both sides of the objective of the dual mandate, that would give you that kind of result.  Of course, we have only projections.  We need to get some more evidence about what’s happening in the economy, but if it comes in indicating that inflation is well below target and likely even to fall and that unemployment remains stubbornly high, then I think that we would need to take that evidence into account as we consider alternative future actions.  And of course, the staff should be looking at some of these details relating to alternatives that we might at least want to consider at our next meeting. Going back to the language, I heard preference for B(3′).  I think we ought to keep the date there.  I didn’t hear any discussion of B(4).  On the beginning of the statement, there were a few people who thought that the description of the economy was a little bit pessimistic.  We have as usual the slight conflict that our SEP projections relate to the last time we supplied those, which was in November, and there has been some downgrade since November. At the same time, the statement is from meeting to meeting, and since December, there hasn’t been much change in the outlook.  So a question I would raise for the group is not so much about paragraph B(1), which seems to me reasonably balanced.  It notes “further improvement in overall labor market conditions,” for example.  I guess the question I would raise is about B(2), which I think  modestly downgrades the outlook by saying that economic growth is going to be “modest” rather than “moderate” and that unemployment, instead of “will decline only gradually,” “will make only slow progress.”  I wonder if we want to do that or if we would prefer to return to the December language there.  Does anyone have a comment on that.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 457.
 MR. FISHER.  It may be only my personal preference, Mr. Chairman, but I didn’t hear anything at the table yesterday other than concerns.  But in terms of the reporting that took place, as I mentioned in my summary, at least eight people at this table reported that things were a little bit better presently than they were at the last meeting.  So with your having opened that door, I would suggest we keep the language and not change it, because in a sense we’re going from a moderate pace of economic recovery. I would just point out that talking about economic growth being “modest” and “making only slow progress on unemployment” shifts it slightly downward, but there was no supporting evidence at the table other than some real fears and concern, which all of us share; but there was no documentary proof, as it were.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply expresses their personal preference and suggests keeping the language as it is. They also note that there was no supporting evidence presented at the table.


Passage number 458.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there others who’d like to take either side of that question.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage is simply asking if there are other people who would like to take either side of a question, without indicating any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 459.
 MR. LACKER. Are you referring to “decline only gradually”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply a question asking for clarification.


Passage number 460.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes. I’m referring to B(2)—to simply go back to the December language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is simply referencing a specific part of the passage without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 461.
 MR. LACKER.  I’d support that, particularly about “make only slow progress” versus “decline only gradually.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker expresses agreement and support for the mentioned statement.


Passage number 462.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Anyone else.

Passage number 463.
 MS. DUKE.  I would be happier with the December language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that Ms. Duke would be happier with the December language, indicating her personal preference rather than any conflict or debate.


Passage number 464.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’d be against it, but I can see where we’re going here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, expresses that he personally disagrees with something but can understand the direction or reasoning behind it.


Passage number 465.
 MS. YELLEN.  I think if you look at the range of evidence the Tealbook has given us, there clearly has been negative news on income, on the global outlook, and on other things that justifies this change in the language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Yellen is providing a statement about the evidence presented in the Tealbook, which supports the change in language.


Passage number 466.
 MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman, just to reinforce a point that many people have made before, paragraph 1 is backward looking, and paragraph 2 is forward looking.  So we don’t need documentary evidence of anything for 2 other than whatever indicia we look at to try to form our own projections of where we’re going to be going forward.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo is simply pointing out that paragraph 1 is discussing the past while paragraph 2 is discussing the future.


Passage number 467.
 MR. FISHER.  Can I make a point, Mr. Chairman, as to Governor Yellen’s point. We do have a sentence that says, “Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.”  That’s still true.  We have no evidence that it’s worse.  We worry that it may be worse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply mentions a point made by Governor Yellen, states that it is still true, and expresses a worry about the potential for the situation to worsen.


Passage number 468.
 MS. YELLEN.  The Tealbook outlook has been downgraded, and my outlook has been downgraded.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any sign of contention or disagreement. It simply states that both the Tealbook outlook and Ms. Yellen's own outlook have been downgraded.


Passage number 469.
 MR. FISHER.  Yours has, the Tealbook’s has, but I didn’t hear that around the table.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating their own observation about not hearing something mentioned at the table.


Passage number 470.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Since December.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 471.
 MS. YELLEN.  Since December, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any statement that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply states that something has occurred since December.


Passage number 472.
 MR. LACKER.  Excuse me.  The unemployment rate projection in the Tealbook has changed one-tenth in two quarters—it’s virtually identical.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply mentions a fact about the unemployment rate projection in the Tealbook.


Passage number 473.
 MR. TARULLO.  Actually, Jeff, to be honest, I’m not sure I can tell the difference between “decline only gradually” and “make only slow progress.” It’s the first change that I’m actually more concerned with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their uncertainty about distinguishing between two phrases with similar meanings.


Passage number 474.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Expects economic growth “to be modest”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests that the person expects economic growth to be modest.

Passage number 477.
 MR. LOCKHART. It seems to me that we might be able to give an indication of some continuity with the fourth quarter, and so I actually favored going back to a version of the December language that might say something like, “The Committee expects a continuation of a moderate pace of growth” or “continued moderate growth”—and then dropping the word “only” in front of “slow progress.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lockhart is simply expressing his opinion and suggesting a potential revision to the language.

Passage number 484.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I mean on that point, I think that we should just agree that the words are not clear about which direction it is.  So if we can’t be clear on what the direction is of that change, then why don’t we just keep it the way it was. The “modest” versus “moderate” one, I think, is a more substantive issue, and that’s a question of whether the Committee wants to downgrade its economic growth forecast.  And the issue is whether the change in the growth outlook meets that threshold to make that change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion on the clarity of certain words and suggesting that keeping things the way they were might be best. They also mention another issue regarding economic growth forecast, but there is no indication of disagreement or contention with anyone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 485.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I don’t want to pursue this longer than necessary.  How about if we keep, along the lines of what Governor Tarullo said—“The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest”—but then change back to “consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually,” since the unemployment trajectory looks about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting a potential revision to a statement but doesn't express any disagreement or opposition.


Passage number 486.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’m fine with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, expresses that he is fine with something, indicating agreement or acceptance.


Passage number 487.
 MR. LOCKHART. Could you repeat that please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is politely asking for clarification and does not express any opposition or conflicting opinion.


Passage number 488.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So we will keep the first change—“The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest”—as it’s written there—“and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate”—now going back to the old language—“will decline only gradually toward levels.”  Then make the change below about inflation—I think the word “settle” is actually not the word we want because it suggests permanent low levels.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing specific changes to be made and expressing their thoughts on the use of certain words. There is no evidence of opposing views or arguments being presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 489.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  And the last sentence, the bracketed language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The bracketed language implies that there is some disagreement or alternative perspective being presented.


Passage number 490.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay, I was going to come back to that.  So is what we just said okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.

 MR. LACKER.  Should we make a note for future meetings that 2.3 percent is moderate and 2.1 percent is modest.

Passage number 493.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  That’ll be a real dilemma.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 494.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right. Let me ask the Committee now about the bracketed language.  Preferences.

Passage number 495.
 MS. YELLEN. I’d prefer to eliminate it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Yellen is expressing a preference to eliminate something without any opposition or conflicting viewpoint presented.

Passage number 511.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.

Explanation: The passage only mentions the title of "President Lockhart" without providing any further details or indicating any disagreement or contention.

 MR. LOCKHART. I’d eliminate it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.
Explanation: The text suggests that Mr. Lockhart wants to eliminate something, possibly referring to a specific subject or topic. However, without further context, it is unclear what exactly he wants to eliminate and what the possible disagreement or contention might be.


Passage number 513.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  President Williams.

 MR.

Passage number 515.
 WILLIAMS.  Eliminate it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it simply states a command or suggestion to eliminate something.


Passage number 516.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right. I’m getting a slight tilt toward elimination here. Again, there’s obviously nothing here saying that we’re going to go hog-wild on inflation.  It’s simply that when inflation was very high and was not coming down and we were concerned, the original purpose of the sentence was to reassure the public that we would, of course, continue to  pay close attention and implicitly respond if our projection didn’t come true.  Further comments. [No response] Okay.  Will you read what we have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the original purpose of a sentence and providing a clarification.


Passage number 517.
 MS. DANKER.  Yes.  This is a vote on alternative B from the handout and the associated directive, with paragraph 2 adjusted as follows.  The second sentence now reads, “The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.” The bracketed sentence is dropped from the end of that paragraph, and the statement includes paragraph 3′, not 3.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply describing a proposed adjustment to a statement without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 518.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.

Passage number 520.
   Chairman Bernanke Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Duke Yes President Lacker No President Lockhart Yes President Pianalto Yes Governor Raskin Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes Governor Yellen Yes CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  A few announcements.  I will be trying to explain all of this to the public [laughter] at 2:15 at the press conference. I’m going to cover today’s action, and I’ll talk about the consensus statement, the outlook, and the policy projections.  And I’ll do what I can with the questions.  There will be a screen in the Special Library for those of you who have nothing better to do.  And I have a question from President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply a statement of who agrees with Chairman Bernanke.

Passage number 523.
 MR. LACKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but you haven't provided any passage for me to analyze. Please provide the relevant passage so that I can assist you further.


Passage number 524.
  But I’m really curious as to how you would respond if asked about the fact that 11 out of 17 SEP projections have us increasing rates before the end of 2014, leaving only six— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would respond that we changed it from “end of” to “late” for exactly that reason, since 11 of 17 have rates at the end of 2014 at 1 percent or less.  Again, I will say that the Committee takes the SEP projections as useful input, but of course it’s going to make a judgment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply explaining their response to a question.


Passage number 525.
 MR. LACKER.  The other thing I’m really curious about—we debated commitment, the extent to which there’s commitment, and it’s still sort of murky to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 526.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, in my introductory statement, I have a sentence saying that this is not a commitment—underline “not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply clarifies that the mentioned action or decision is not binding or a commitment.


Passage number 527.
” MR. LACKER.  If I could make just one comment about governance and point out the obvious thing that, to the extent that it was a commitment or a forecast, it’s about future Committee members who are now participants.  So the division between voters and participants is not so bright a line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing a clarification and emphasizing that the division between voters and participants is not a clear distinction.


Passage number 528.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Of course, and that’s why we show all of them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that all options are shown without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 529.
 MR. LACKER.  And why we do things the way we do things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "And why we do things the way we do things" suggests a clarification or explanation rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 530.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That’s why we’re putting all of the 17 participant projections into the SEP and not identifying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply stating a fact or a decision being made.


Passage number 531.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker's statement is direct and does not involve any conflicting opinions or opposing views.
