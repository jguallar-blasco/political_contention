{"1981FOMC19810203meeting.txt": ["CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.  Without objection, we will approve the minutes.  Do we have anything else we're supposed to do here at the beginning.  Well, we'll just go to the [new] monetary control procedure.  Presumably, the objective of this discussion is to arrive at some judgment as to whether or not we're generally satisfied with the technique that we adopted [in October 1979]--a technique which, in the short run, emphasizes control of nonborrowed reserves.  And we alter that in the light of what is going on in the money supply or total reserves.  It implies judgmental adjustments in terms of the multiplier; it implies some kind of federal funds rate band.  My own interpretation of that federal funds band may differ from that of others, but I don't think it has been, in and of itself, much of a constraint because every time we [reached the limit] we moved it.  On the other hand, there is some sense inherent in the technique, but maybe not openly stated, that the way the technique is run doesn't bounce reserves up and down very sharply depending upon what happened last week or even last month.  There is some sluggishness in adjustments which in itself presumably has a short-run stabilizing effect on money market interest rates even though that is not the stated objective.  But it is inherent in the way the technique has been operated.So, we have to decide whether to continue with that general technique.  And if we don't want to continue with it, somebody has to put forward an alternative that is desirable in a rather important way, which I suppose could go the gamut of more emphasis on interest rates to more emphasis on some stricter or more mechanical reserve technique.  Assuming we want to continue generally with the present technique, there are a number of questions that arise as to what modifications might be made as a matter of emphasis, [such as] speed of the reactions on nonborrowed reserves and some important questions --which we probably could never resolve today in any event--on the discount window and discount rate management and the management of the federal funds rate band.  I hope we can come out with some coherent or incoherent--preferably coherent--conclusion on these subjects.   Let me say something as far as the conclusions of the study in a more technical area are concerned.  I believe that in any statement I make to the Congress I am going to have to review this study and pronounce some general conclusions.  The most important conclusion will be whether we want to change the technique, the question I just raised.  But on a somewhat more technical level, my understanding, subject to confirmation or change during our discussion this morning--and I may not be comprehensive in this listing--is that there is no real evidence that on a weekly or monthly basis the money supply has moved more erratically this year than before.  I think what the study shows is that it looks that way if you look at the raw figures; but by the time we get finished seasonally adjusting and revising seasonal adjustments as we did in earlier years, it's likely to look in a very short-run perspective about as stable or as unstable as it did before.  In fact, there is a very large random component in the weekly figures and a considerable one in the monthly figures.  So, I take it the study suggested that it was somewhat of an open question as to whether we had a more erratic performance in the money supply this year than in earlier years.  If you look at it in a little longer perspective, say, quarterly, then statistically we did [have more variation]; but whether that was a reflection of external events like credit controls and the sharp fluctuations in the economy or whether it had anything to do with the technique is the open question.  As the study put it, it's certainly not proven that the technique had anything to do with it.I think all the studies suggest that there is a definite tradeoff between interest rates and money supply stability.  And the tradeoff assumes rather violent proportions in terms of interest rates, if we really want to stabilize the money supply.  The studies also suggest that the whole structure of interest rates has been affected by fluctuations in short-term rates much more than earlier, depending upon how you look at the studies.  So, when we're talking about fluctuations in short-term rates, at least in the last year, we're talking about fluctuations in the whole structure of interest rates.  We have not found much evidence of an induced cycle in the money supply when the procedures [led us to] tighten to force a decline [in the money supply] and then to ease off to force another increase.  That's an important question.  My judgment of what is said is that there's not much evidence for that.  And there isn't much evidence that short-run--by that I mean quarterly or more than quarterly--deviations in the money supply have any very pronounced effect on the economy or on inflation because they are not terribly important in that sense.  Well, those are some of the tentative conclusions I have drawn from what I have read of these studies, but they are all subject to further interpretation as we proceed.With that much introduction, I will have Mr. Axilrod introduce the discussion more technically after welcoming Mr. Boehne and Mr. Boykin to our council this morning.  If you can survive this meeting, I suspect you will be able to survive any of the future meetings.  Mr. Axilrod", "MR. LINDSEY. That's plus or minus 5 to 10, in terms of astandard error, which means that one-third of the time we would evenbe outside of that band. Those results applied to the nonborrowedreserves and nonborrowed base measures; they both gave very similarresults. As a result of the supply-side problems that Mr. Axilroddiscussed earlier, the [errors using] total reserves and total basemeasures under the current institutional structure were considerablylarger than for the nonborrowed measures. So, that's the range oferror in hitting your month-to-month money target with the currentinstitutional structure. The actual misses were a bit above that forM-1A and around the upper end of that range for M-1B. Now, those didaverage out to some extent in the Board's monthly model over quarterlyperiods, as Mr. Axilrod mentioned--a bit more in fact than the actualexperience quarterly. The Board's monthly model appeared to haveerrors month-to-month that were about random, so they would tend tocancel out partially as the period under consideration lengthened.With the Board model we did look at a change in theinstitutional structure both in terms of trying to eliminate thesupply-side errors that are susceptible to regulatory changes--eliminating lagged reserve accounting, making reserve requirements ondemand deposits uniform and universal, toward which of course theMonetary Control Act will move us as it's phased in, as well asremoving reserve requirements against savings and time deposits. Andthere once again I'm summarizing Mr. Axilrod's conclusions, but I'llgive you some numerical examples. Total reserves improvedconsiderably; in fact, it became the best operating target if rigidlyadhered to over a control period, giving an error on the order of 3percentage points plus or minus two-thirds of the time. Also, as Mr.Axilrod said, that would imply very significant [interest] ratevolatility in response to unexpected shifts in money demand over thecontrol period, which in this case is a month. So, it's not clearyou'd want to control money that closely. But it would be feasibleeven, I might add, with the kinds of errors that we saw over the last15 months since October 1979. We did try an example with the kind ofgraduated [discount] rate structure in the Board model that Mr.Axilrod referred to and we did get some improvement--on the order of 2percentage points--with the nonborrowed reserves and nonborrowed basetargets. That gives you a sense of the range of variability underdifferent operating targets and different institutional structuresmonth-to-month. Looking at annual rates, even under the present2/2-3/81operating structure, it looked as though for a 3-month or quarterlyperiod the errors by and large fell into a range of 1 to 2 percentagepoints in both the San Francisco and the Board models. As Mr. Axilrodmentioned, the actual errors were somewhat larger than that becausethere wasn't as much averaging out of the monthly errors in the actualexperience as was the case with the models", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Dr. Burns used to be fond of saying thatfor a monthly period, four equals eight on the money supply. Asnearly as I can understand your results, in the present institutionalsettings, minus 10 equals plus 10", "MR. ROOS. May I ask, Steve, is short-run month-to-monthprecision really important. I believe that even the most ardentadvocates of aggregate control will freely admit that short-runprecision is almost impossible to achieve. Is this a necessary factorin deciding what we're going to do. Or if we announce and make clearthat we are going to concentrate on achievement of our longer-rangetarget, wouldn't this be it", " Last year, of course, our cycle was--MR. PARTEE. Four or five years you said", " But it may be--MR. PARTEE. We, of course, had more borrowing", " We observed that the amount of borrowing wepredict is--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You observed that the higher theborrowing, the higher the spread. The causation is the opposite waythan you are suggesting", "MR. AXILROD. My memory, looking at it another way, is thatthe monthly multiplier errors, at least in the models, were bigger onM2 than they were on M-1B but that our judgmental miss--judgmentalmeaning how we actually ran things--was less on M2 percentage-wisethan on M-1B in terms of the growth rates. I'm not sure whether Ihave answered your question exactly", "MR. BOEHNE. I'd like to switch away from the financial sideto the real sector side. I was somewhat surprised that you didn'tlend much credence to the view that these fluctuating interest rateshad some kind of destabilizing feedback effect on the real sector,especially since interest rates other than the federal funds rate didseem to go up with the same amount of volatility. That's rather acasual analysis, [based] especially on talking to people inconstruction and to some extent in autos and some other durable goods[industries] where inventory was important. I had a very definiteimpression that these fluctuating interest rates did have an impact oneconomic activity in their areas. I was wondering if your analysiswas largely econometric or if you attempted to gather any informationfrom the people who are actually in these industries", "MR. AXILROD. We did not find a way, really, of investigatingthat. I don't think there's evidence for or against that proposition.I would say the evidence does suggest that transactions costs havegone up. So, in some sense, if you go to that point, a new issue isslightly more expensive even though the whole yield curve may not showit. We did find that bid/ask spreads were higher; I don't know who isbearing that [cost] ultimately, whether it's the borrower or thelender. But there was evidence that transactions costs went up", "MR. AXILROD. Well, in the housing market there would seem tobe evidence--again it was a continuation of a past trend--of [lenders]trying to put all the risk on the borrower, which tends in effect toraise rates. When rates go down, they don't want to incur the biggercost of getting out of that higher rate commitment, so they try to[lend] at the higher rate, and that sort of thing. But whether thathad to do with our procedure or was just a response to the cyclicalvolatility of rates and the greater rate of inflation expected and thefears that that induced is somewhat open to question", "MR. SCHULTZ. Continuing on this question just a bit more:In the Bluebook I noticed that you assumed that if short-term rateswere at current levels a year from now, the mortgage rate would behigher. Why is that. That was the one thing in that family ofinterest rates that seemed rather interesting to me. All the otherrates you assumed would be at about the same level but the mortgagerate was higher", " It's a bit higher; we assumed essentially thatthe demand for mortgages is still pretty strong given the structure ofthe--MR. SCHULTZ. I see. You just repressed demand during theperiod and it's going to get stronger and stronger. Okay", "-33-2/2-3/81MR. WALLICH. [Yes]", "MR. ROOS. I think there are several fundamental things thatwe ought to consider in charting our course. First of all, it'simportant that we recognize that we have to do something that will beconvincing, not just to those of us sitting in this room but to thebroader body politic in the world in which we live. I will start froma conviction that, right or wrong, most people who have observed whathas happened since October 1979 are far from convinced that it was asmuch of a success or as satisfactory as maybe some of us would like tothink. There is a certain degree of disillusionment that we didn'tachieve as effective control of money and credit as we announced in1979 we were going to seek. Under the present political conditions weface, to try to explain away in a convincing manner whatevershortcomings last year had is almost impossible to achieve.Secondly, I think it follows that to say we will continue aswe did in 1980 but will do the job a little better, without announcingor without agreeing upon certain changes from that procedure, will beless than convincing to the people who are watching us. Politically,if you want to put it that way, and without acting irresponsibly, Ithink we have to say that we are going to make some changes. Theworld knows that we have conducted this study. The world, or at leastthose who are interested in what we are doing, is going to be anxiousto see the results of this study and what we do about it. So, I don'tthink we can get away with either trying to say that 1980 was anunqualified success or that we drew a poor card because of certainextraneous factors. And I don't think we can get away with justsaying we are going to do what we did and do it better.Ideally, Mr. Chairman, if we could press a button, I wouldsay that we should announce that we are going to move the discountrate to a penalty rate more frequently in order to avoid the problemsthat we had in that regard last year. Ideally, we should seekcontemporaneous reserve accounting. I think we should announce--andthis may require longer-run action--that we will seek greateruniformity of reserve requirements. I think we have to bite thatbullet; we have to say that we will do that in order to achievesteadier control of credit and money. I think we are going to have tosay openly that we will permit interest rates to fluctuate morefreely. We can't have it both ways. And I happen to believe that ifwe explain [what we are doing] as effectively as you did yesterday onABC--and I would compliment you, sir, because I thought you weresuperb on that program--that we have the ability to tell people whatwe are going to do. If we told people that we were going to do this,I believe we would have less volatility in interest rates than somepeople might think.Short of achieving these ideals, I think it's absolutelyessential as a bare minimum that we change our procedures and move thediscount rate more frequently to a penalty rate and also that werestore contemporaneous reserve accounting. We have people out therewho are aware of these issues. People in the Administration--theStockmans and the Sprinkels--are going to watch us like a hawk, andwe're not going to be able to bluff our way through this. I think wehave to show that we are doing something, and try something new. Itwould be a tragedy for the Federal Reserve to move back to interest-35-2/2-3/81rate stabilization, even though it might be theoretically desirable;it will not fly in the political climate in which we're living.That's my point of view, Mr. Chairman, in a nutshell", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If no one else has any comments, I willdeclare it the consensus that we will work in the general framework ofour existing techniques. We will now discuss modifying them. I dothink there is basically a tradeoff here, if nothing else, of thedesirability of escaping responsibility for discretely moving interestrates. A number of people have said that in ten years of experiencewe didn't move very far because we don't like to do that. But [ournew procedure] has exacted a price in terms of generating moreinstability throughout the interest rate structure, which may pass.If you want to be an optimist, you say that people will learn enoughthrough the experience, and long-term rates will no longer fluctuateso much. But they certainly fluctuated in disturbing proportion tothe fluctuation in short-term rates in the past 15 months. Now, we'veonly been through two, or not even 1-1/2, interest rate cycles, Iguess, so people haven't had much chance to learn from that. Maybe asthey get through another one or two, these reactions will be less.Let's hope so.Let me turn now to modification of the technique, which hasobviously already been touched upon in a number of comments. I'minclined to reverse [the order]. Well, let's not reverse it; they'resomewhat inter-related, I guess. Let's just discuss both together:the speed of the nonborrowed reserve adjustment--another way of sayingthe speed of the total borrowing adjustment--and the handling of thediscount window or the discount rate. The latter has already beentouched upon on a number of occasions. I think there is a differencebetween moving the discount rate more frequently and moving itautomatically. I continue to be of the belief, and I have heardnothing to dissuade me, that if we are operating on the presenttechnique and tie the discount rate to market rates--whether you callit a penalty rate or whatever you call it--we would have an explosiveshort-term situation either up or down that I find impossible even tocontemplate. The present situation is awkward and is imposed upon uspartly, but not entirely, by lagged reserve accounting. When thingsare tight we don't have a penalty rate and we can't have a penaltyrate, and it looks as if we're subsidizing the banks to some extent.If I could minimize that appearance and reality, to the extent it's areality, I'd be very pleased. I don't know how to do it. We tried tofool around with the surcharge, but those are the kinds of problems Isee. That does not mean we cannot move the discount rate more2/2-3/81frequently. But then as a matter of judgment, I think we also--and itmay be good or bad--are going to get more instability in market rates", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. One thing that hasn't been studied bythe staff--and maybe it's worth studying in answer to the specificpoint that you just made--is how to avoid as big a component ofsubsidy and the criticisms, which may mount further as we get into thethrift institutions discount window situation. It seems to me that wemight consider having a surcharge--a frequency surcharge as we do now,although the timing could change--but that the size of the surchargeshould be equal to the difference between the basic discount rate and,let's say, the average of the 3-month CD rate over the previous fourweeks. We wouldn't get as big a ratcheting effect from that and banksthat come in too frequently would have their subsidy eliminated. Ithink that might be worth some study", " But you have a pretty high--MR. FORD. Paul, I'm not sure. You've made this point anumber of times about the mechanical connection between the way the[window] works and the rest of the procedure, but given thecomplexities of the dynamics that Chuck was hinting at, I'm not sureit's that simple", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they're very much interrelated. Andwe could do the opposite. We can do what you're suggesting in thenonborrowed reserves--[by moving] the borrowings more rapidly eitherat a meeting or between meetings depending upon what happens--withoutchanging the discount rate or even the discount window administration.That's an interesting question. Would we conceivably get more impacton the money supply per basis point of interest rate change because weput the banks into debt, which worries them and forces adjustments inbanks that may not be fully reflected in interest rate movements inthe market because of nonprice considerations", "MR. ROOS. Paul, I'd like to follow up on your analysis andTony's and ask Peter and Steve a question. What were the factors thatled to not adjusting the nonborrowed reserve path more quickly lastyear. In other words, was it a conscious policy that caused you notto move as quickly as you might move this year under this new point ofview or was it a concern about the effect on interest rates. And ifthe latter was the case, wouldn't you still have that concern in theback of your head starting next Monday", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I suspect that during a good part of lastyear we were influenced by projections of the money supply, whichwe've now learned were totally unreliable. Each month during thatautumn period all the projections said it was going to level off thismonth", "MR. ROOS. But you still had hovering in your mind a concernabout the effect on the fed funds rate, right. I thought I justunderstood that", "MR. FORD. The other element is that while this discussion isleading us toward credit rationing of some sort at the window, we'rereacting to a public perception which is technically not the truth--which is that the subsidy goes to the big banks. There is a subsidyfor all the banks but the biggest; the subsidy is for the ones under$500 million, item 1. The second thing is the way we administer thewindow. If I understand it, in doing the rationing now, which we may-45-2/2-3/81want to change as you say, in some sense liability managedinstitutions should not get in", " It's that kind of thing that I see as being--MR. PARTEE. Well, Bill, when I said rationing, I didn'tnecessarily mean a rate control system that would be based onadministration. I think we can ration by having a more elaborateprice schedule. The price schedule might be associated with durationand there might be more than just one surcharge. There might be rulesof the game", " We could do what Fred suggests, except that would meantechnically that the institution whose surplus is dropping to zerowill pay the highest amount of borrowing so that--MR. SCHULTZ. We'd have to differentiate between emergencyand adjustment borrowing", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The most effective thing we can do toaffect bank behavior is to kick them out of the discount window on anindividual basis; otherwise they just don't give a damn. They'll goon making all the loans they want to make", "MR. PARTEE. So, they may do it through the loan portfolio.If they do it by interbank lending, [the Reserve Bank] is supposed totell them they have violated our rules", "MR. FORD. Yes, but try to track that in reality when you'retalking about banks that have 30 or 40 subsidiaries and geniuses to-46-2/2-3/81manage their balance sheets, which we don't. We couldn't keep up withthat, could we", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The conflict I see here, again, is thatthe way to handle the perception and the reality of the subsidy in theadministration [of the window] is to make it easier to borrow with noupper limit. If we make it easy enough, the subsidy will go away.But that works against the short-term control of reserves and themoney supply. The more we work in the direction of short-term controlof the money supply, the more the discrepancy will appear. And Idon't know how to get out of this box", "MR. PARTEE. But, Tony, if we're going to hold to the idea ofa basic discount rate of, say, around 13 percent [as it was] throughthe whole fall and the CD rate runs up to 21 percent, as it did, andwe tie the extended rate to 21 percent, we're not going to be able toget away with that. When the institution--say, one of your savingsbanks in New York--borrows because it is in such difficultcircumstances and we say we will lend to them at one point under theCD rate and that's 20 percent and the basic discount rate out there is13 percent, they're going to cry bloody murder", "MR. WALLICH. I'm very much impressed by the continualcriticism in the press and the market that we have changed our policy.They say the Fed has eased or the Fed has tightened and actually we've-49-2/2-3/81done nothing at all. I think we could defuse that by stating it inthe policy record right away instead of 30 days later when nobodyreads it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it seems to me that the reallyoperative question here, since I don't view these bands that we havehad as having constrained anything much, is whether anybody wants tohave narrower ones and actually have them be constraining", " I supposeit means--MS. TEETERS. Well, I was certainly opposed to raising themand then taking them off this last round. Sure, we have moved them upbut we haven't moved them down to the bottom number; nevertheless, wehaven't hesitated to take the top off. I think it's well known thatwe could have gotten the same degree of restraint without having to goto 21-1/2 percent interest rates. So, I'd be more interested inseeing that the bands stick rather than that they become elastic", "MR. ROOS. If I may, Mr. Chairman, I'd like to go on recordas favoring total elimination of the interest rate bands. From theconversation throughout this morning and in the studies and commentsthat have been made and things that are thought--although who knowswhat things are thought--I think there is an implicit awareness ofexplicit and implied interest rate constraints. I believe that actsin a contrary manner to achieving our aggregate targets. If we'reinterested in consulting frequently on interest rates, I guess weshould also be interested in consulting if the money supply seems tobe functioning in an unpredicted manner. I think there's a very basiccontradiction in trying to control interest rates explicitly orimplicitly and achieving our monetary target objectives. And I wouldexpress myself as favoring the total elimination of any specificationregarding interest rates", "MS. TEETERS. Well, I find that hard to accept. We'regetting to the point where we're transmitting very volatile [short-term] interest rates into the long-term market. Even though wehaven't been able to detect it in the past 15 months, that has to besomething that is going to disturb all sorts of things over a longer-term period. I think we're just abrogating our responsibility if wesay we're not going to pay any attention at all to the interest rates", " I'm not sure, but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the trouble with Governor Partee'ssuggestion--it's good if you want to achieve the result that you wantto achieve--is that other people may have a real concern about [thelevel]. If they are more concerned about a rise of 300 basis pointsfrom 21 percent than they are from 15 percent, you have a problem", "MR. FORD. From one meeting to the next. May I ask for aclarification. Are you saying that whenever we have a meeting, westate the monetary aggregate targets and then always have a proviso tothe Desk that the Manager will tell Paul any time we're going to move300 basis points plus or minus from where the funds rate was when weleft the meeting. And that would call for consultation on the subjectof whether we would want to let the rates go", "2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes", "MR. GRAMLEY. It seems to me, however, that the market isgoing to interpret your suggestion in a very different way. If thefed funds rate on the day of the Committee meeting is 17.42 percentand we say 300 basis points on either side, the newspapers would saythat they have figured out that the Fed's range is 14.42 to 20.42percent. It makes a lot more sense to say it's 14 to 20 percent. Ithink that's what they're going to do. Then if we start playing gamesand say we're going to narrow the range down to 200 basis points oneither side because we don't want rates to go up too far, they'resurely going to say we are playing the rates instead of the moneysupply", "MR. SCHULTZ. My position is that we ought to stay away froma mechanical approach. That's what gives us the most trouble. If wedon't retain some elements of judgment in what we do, I think we're introuble", "MR. SCHULTZ. I'd just hate to get hung up on any of thesemechanistic kinds of solutions. I don't think any of them work", "MR. PARTEE. The fed funds rate is a constraint. I certainlyapprove of your saying this in public, but I think we need torecognize that it's a constraint", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know what you're sayingbecause I disagree with you in terms of these bands. We've changedthem every time we've come [to the limit of the band]. Now, I thinkit is a constraint implicitly in our behavior in terms of rapidity ofmovement. But I just flatly disagree with you that these outsidelimits have been a constraint. I just observed that when we met andsaid we had a problem [with respect to the interest rate constraint],the constraint has been changed", "MR. ROOS. Paul, when we discussed before the problems ofadjusting our reserve paths more quickly, it was specifically saidthat one of the costs--to those who view it as a cost--is widerfluctuations in interest rates", "MR. FORD. Well, if I may comment on Governor Partee'sstatement that the range ought to be widened: It seems to me that ifwe're going to issue a report on changes in monetary policy for thenext year compared to last year, and if one of the things we're goingto say is that we are going to move faster against movements off thepath on reserves, there has to be a logical symmetry in that we haveto say something that is consistent with that on the other side.Either widen the band or make a stronger statement that we will adjustright away", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think there is a real difference.It would happen rarely, but there would have been a difference lastspring and summer and right now when in a sense a lot of people would-58-2/2-3/81want it asymmetrical. Your presumption is that it would be moresymmetrical. I detect that we do not have unanimity but a consensus.[The next topic is] contemporaneous reserve accounting", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I must say my concern about this is notany public relations effect or difficulties with the banks. We canmake the banks do what they have to do. My concern is that the logicis probably to do this, but the logic may not be very strong. And wemay in a sense be promising [too much]. People will say we made agreat change and it may be that not much is different after we've madethe change except that we've complicated our own life a little as wellas the banks' lives. And we could get an adverse reaction becausenothing much has changed. That's the only thing that really bothersme about this", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but I think that's--SPEAKER(.). That'll be the day", "MR. FORD. I know that. But having said that, if we givethem warning, there's no question that the banks can gear up toprovide [the data]. As to the theoretical arguments on things likethe discount window and so on, there is disagreement among thetheoreticians as to how much goes toward getting us out of the boxthat you and I were discussing earlier. But there's no question aboutthe direction. To some extent it does get us out of the box. Somepeople say a lot; some people say a little. Therefore, given myconcern about the absurdities of the discount window operations withthrifts thrown in and everything else that is happening in that area,I feel it's only logically consistent. I am a strong advocate ofmoving, with proper notice to the banks, toward contemporaneous-60-2/2-3/81reserve accounting but not overselling it, though, because I thinkyou're right that if we oversell it, it could hurt us", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Will you feel a need to move thatquickly, in view of the fact that we're still trying to iron out thereporting problems and the inconsistencies", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I assume if this is done, it's goingto have to go out as a proposed regulation for comment. Now, BobBlack raised another question, which is a relevant question. If we'regoing to make this change, should we consider any other change in thereserve period or the carryover, and put it all out at the same time.If we're going to do that, it's going to take a couple of months toprepare the regulation, I suppose, because we would have to debatethese other issues too", "MR. FORD. Yes. And a complication might arise if we're nowallowing some of them to report quarterly. Could that complicate it", "MR. MORRIS. Yes", "MR. BLACK. Well, I think they could [raise it] to someextent", " So itshould be a lot less painful if we reinstate it now than it would havebeen with the same--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I don't really understand. Ican understand those of you who want to impose these extra burdens onthe banks because you think it's a major improvement to [monetarycontrol] but [not] those of you who think it's a very minor one. Idon't quite understand why we're so concerned about not increasing theburden on the banks in other areas but in this area it's okay", " We'regoing to get very minor monetary policy--MR. SCHULTZ. There are some of us who do feel that way,Tony", "MR. WALLICH. [Yes, under] contemporaneous because, in thelagged case, there's a given amount of reserves that the bankingsystem must get if the Fed doesn't supply them.

AXILROD. Well, with regard to a predictable relationbetween money and GNP, the velocity of M2 has shown very little changein the last couple of years. But [the problem] gets very hard whenone puts oneself in another world of controlling [M2]. Then, what arethe relationships. In the present world in which we live, theinterest rates that are available on the instruments in M2 move veryeasily with the market. They have been designed that way. When youstart controlling M2 and market interest rates go up, the [depository]institutions raise their interest rates; In my mind--and I may bewrong--if we really actively control M2, I fear that we'll get muchmore interest rate volatility out of that than one might think. Whenyou are looking at a world where we weren't trying to do that, M2 sortof goes along with the more moderate movements in interest ratesrelative to GNP that we were having.

The conclusion that our own techniques didn'tin some sense create or contribute to the cycle of money", "MR. AXILROD. [There was a] sharp drop in money in the secondquarter; the models would have projected a higher amount of money inthat quarter--much more money--even with the weakness in GNP. So weinterpreted the sharp drop in money, even at the interest rates thatdeveloped, as reflecting a sharp drop in money demand at that point.We weren't creating the money demand; that was the public's reactionto what interest rates [were doing]. The San Francisco interpretationputs much less stress on the sharp drop in money demand and wouldstress instead that there was a temporary deviation in money supply insome sense because everyone was paying off loans. And viewing loansas a supply, the amount of money dropped. They wouldn't tend tointerpret it as money demand. But again, there was an exogenousfactor, that credit control program, unrelated to our operatingprocedures. The big variations were coming out of that. And that'sessentially the basis for saying that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, one of the things that continues toconcern me a bit about this is this simple relationship, and maybe Mr.Ford can enlighten us about it, that we're attempting to control theeconomy through bank service charge practices. Corporations hold alarge percentage of the money supply; their required balances arerelated to their activity in the prevailing interest rate[environment] with an indeterminate lag of several months. We push upinterest rates; the banks all send out notices to the corporationsthat they can keep lower balances next month. Interest rates go down,so the money supply declines. And because interest rates have gonedown the banks send out notices to their customers that they now haveto keep higher balances", "MR. FORD. For a long time, the Fed did a survey of lending[practices] and it supposedly covered that. When you read the resultsof those surveys and talk to corporate lending officers and listen tothe policies dictated to them by their senior managements, there's avast [unintelligible]. You learn nothing from the survey. What youhave to do, actually, is an audit of collected balances--not just whatthe bank says the corporate customer has to have but what it actuallyis getting out of the corporate customer. I think it would show, asPaul suggested, that when things get tight the bankers try to comedown on them harder. But as for how much they do, I've never seen anygood evidence for all the banks.

So there is room within a range concept toaccommodate, I would think, a large number of the members of theCommittee", "MR. BOEHNE. I agree with the staff forecast in general. Butit does seem to me, as one goes about talking to people, that thereare some real disparities in peoples' outlooks and I think that hassome implications. For example, a majority of businessmen even in theThird District, which has been an area of slow growth, are really muchmore optimistic than this forecast. [That includes those in] hightechnology, energy development, business services and that kind ofthing. On the other hand, if you talk to businessmen who are doingvery, very, poorly--those in auto and auto-related industries, smallbusinessmen who have to finance inventories, and thrift institutions--[it is quite different]. While we have been used to regionaldisparities, it seems to me that the disparities among business typesare much sharper and much stronger than in previous recessions. And I-88-2/2-3/81think the true picture of the economy is quite different. If we havethis outlook of slow speed ahead, on average, I think we are going tohave a minority of businesses that are really going to be pushed tothe wall, even though on average it looks as though we're just goingslow speed ahead", " We understood rational expectations in the--MR. CORRIGAN. That's not rational; that's irrational, Ithink. But that's the catalyst in terms of the forecast as I have putit together here.

Our forecast for the year as a whole is not somuch different, but it's different in shape. That is, we're morepessimistic for the first half. Sitting here a year ago, we had allthis financial restraint in place and we were wondering when we weregoing to see some response. When we did get a response, we got apretty big one. I don't think it's going to be that big this year; Ithink we're close to another peak in economic activity, with a shallowrecession coming in the first half. That's what I would look for", "MS. TEETERS. When I looked over the staff forecast, whatreally struck me most was how sensitive it was to the inflation rate.Given the monetary assumptions that we adopted in July, we alreadyhave the velocity to a point that if there's any increase in inflationover what the staff is forecasting, real growth could shoot down tothe point where it is negative all year long. It seems to me that ifthere is any risk in this forecast, it is that we'll get moreinflation and a comparable decrease in real growth. So, we could havea year-long recession based on the types of assumptions we're making.That would indicate to me that instead of trying to lower the monetarytarget ranges, which we just barely got within [last] year, that we'dbe well advised to stay with the ones we had this past year and try tocome in at the center of them rather than to lower them progressivelyand run what I think is an increasing risk of missing them on the topside. My forecast--I'm obviously the bottom one among the governors--is that we're going to have less real growth and somewhat moreinflation. And [my view is] that we probably won't have higher-90-2/2-3/81interest rates either or we'll miss our monetary targets for the restof the year", "MR. BALLES. Well, I guess differences of opinion make stockmarkets, horse races, and forecasts. I lean toward the side of beinga little more optimistic than the Board staff, showing a bit more realGNP growth and a bit less inflation for the year. But [thedifferences] are certainly within the normal range of judgmentalthings that have to go into these forecasts. I was mainly interestedin asking Jim what he would consider the greatest point ofvulnerability in this forecast. Do you share my misgivings about anyforecast now in view of the ongoing uncertainties about the newAdministration's economic program and what it might do both on thespending side and the tax side. Is this forecast of yours, forexample, very sensitive to significant changes in the tax rates or[government] spending levels. I don't know myself how to do a solidforecast in view of those uncertainties", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In your model, prices ought to begin goingdown some in terms of their rate of increase", "MR. WALLICH. Well, I made my projection on the expectationof some overshoot of M1, whichever we choose, because while a shift inthe demand function is perhaps probable, it may not be so large and itcertainly is not assured. Even so, I think it will imply veryconsiderable restraint. We wouldn't overshoot unless interest rateswere pressing us very hard, so I arrive at a rather adverse conclusionon the real GNP. On inflation, traditionally we have undershot ourprobabilities. So, given that during the year some bad things surelyare going to happen--more food problems, more oil problems--and nogood things, one has to expect not a further rise in the CPI butprobably a rise in the deflator. On unemployment, although it's avery unhappy projection to make, I think unless unemployment is high,price increases aren't going to slow and wage increases aren't goingto slow. We have no magic way of getting from a low growth of themoney supply to lower wages and lower prices, except via low capacityutilization and high unemployment; and, of course, that in turn isachieved by high interest rates. These all are very unpleasant thingsto contemplate and that's why I decided I'd put them down. I think Iam among some of the excluded outliers here", "MR. GRAMLEY. I don't have any basic disagreement with thestaff projection. But if you look at what is likely to happen overthe course of the four quarters this year and to fiscal policy in thelatter half of the year, it seems to me that we face the realpossibility that aggregate demand in the latter half of the year willbe considerably stronger than the staff anticipates, at least innominal terms. And that will put considerably more pressure on pricesand considerably more pressure on interest rates. I say that becauseif you look at the staff projection of the high employment surplus ordeficit, it switches from a $19 billion surplus in the first andsecond quarters to a $22 billion deficit in the third and a $14-93-2/2-3/81billion deficit in the fourth. In other words, virtually all of theeffect of that fiscal policy on the tax side goes in immediately butthe effect of the budget restraint is much delayed. Of course, whatwill be happening at that point is that no one will really knowwhether these intentions on the expenditure side are in fact beingrealized if the tax cut goes through. So, I could be one of thoseoutliers at this table on the price side. I think we're going to belooking at a GNP deflator that has not shown any signs of decelerationduring the course of 1981 and a CPI which might well be acceleratingagain as a consequence of the effects of both rising interest ratesand some pickup in economic activity. At some point during the courseof 1981, we're going to have to ask ourselves how long we can stickwith a policy posture that is simply not doing any good whatsoever inbringing down the underlying rate of inflation because the fact of thematter is that what we have done so far has done no good at all. I'mnot saying we ought to quit, but I think we as a Committee are goingto be facing a very, very grim set of economic statistics with no realhope that the underlying inflation rate is going to improve", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say it has done no good at all. Areyou excluding the possibility that [our policy] prevented it fromgetting higher", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, the critical thing here is that it isabsolutely clear that monetary policy [alone] just can't do this job.If we don't hold on to the monetary aggregates, inflation gets worse;if we do hold on to them, all we do is put all the pressure on certainsectors of the economy. And [the result is] a very difficult economicsituation unless the government gets out of the way and lets creditdemands come down some. These people who are going around saying thatmonetary policy can do the entire job of getting inflation down arejust terribly destructive. I don't know how in the world we can getthat point over; monetary policy [alone] just won't do it", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I know, but you saw the House BankingCommittee study. It said that the Federal Reserve was entirely toblame for inflation and that the Treasury deficit had no impact", "MR. MAYO. Sure, it's only $100 billion. It's up to what--16or 17 percent of the [total budget]", "MR. SCHULTZ. I would just note that I happen to get BurtCox's forecast for Merrill Lynch economics. I am very much afraidthat the Secretary of the Treasury may be looking at that one becauseit's much more optimistic than yours. And I think therein lies partof the problem", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think that's purely semantic. Ifyou think of it from the midpoint, we have base drift under anydefinition. If we don't admit that it's base drift because growth waswithin the cone, we don't have it. It depends; different people havedifferent views of these cones. Some people say the midpoint is theright target and any deviation is [measured from] the midpoint. Otherpeople say that [the cone itself provides] the elasticity one allowsoneself to adjust through the year and we shouldn't consider ourselvesoff course if we're within the cone. I don't think one way is rightand one wrong. It all depends upon how one looks at it", " You get this problem--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We just make a different estimate of thetarget when we make it identical", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There's also a problem that when it'sa big adjustment, even the skeptics recognize that these screwynumbers are a result of the adjustment. But when it is a very minoradjustment, then the skeptics are going to say we are trying to fudgethe figures on the growth [of the aggregates]", "MR. MORRIS. I'd like to suggest, Paul, if we do go aheadwith M-1A and M-1B guidelines for 1981, that we state the guidelinesabstracting from shifts in NOW accounts. In other words, I'deliminate this bottom section because, with all due respect to thequality of our staff, I don't think they can possibly come close inestimating the shifts. The prima facie case is the fact that theywere off by $13 billion in the first week. And the idea that we aregoing to see half of the total annual adjustment to NOW accounts inone month goes against the grain of all prior experience. I justdon't believe it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just so that the discussion can proceed,let's try to resolve how we present the targets after we decide whatthey should be, recognizing that there is an issue there. Yourposition is that we shouldn't have an M1 target at all", "MR. PARTEE. I just can't agree with that", "MR. MORRIS. Well, I would rather not raise them from thisyear's; I'd like to have the staff explain to me why we apparentlymust do that. Obviously, I'd prefer to have a somewhat lower range", "MR. PARTEE. May I ask Jim a question about this. The wholebusiness is just so unclear to me. If President Black'srecommendation were accepted by the Committee, would that be a tightermonetary growth target than you assumed in the Greenbook. He's optingfor the 1 point [reduction]--that is, alternative II, with M2 and M3the way they are specified here. Would that be tighter than yourassumption in the Greenbook", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I basically agree with what RogerGuffey has suggested: the 1/2 point reduction on the M1 ranges. Wemight consider a somewhat different approach on M2 and M3, however.It seems to me that you could say to the [Congressional] committee-117-2/2-3/81that, given the uncertainty with regard to the new instruments and thestructural and transitional shifts, we want to widen the range. Wecould widen it symmetrically and make it 5 to 10 percent instead of 6to 9 percent. Or, if we feel there would be too much criticism of thewidened range, then I would say that we are keeping it at 6 to 9percent but we will have a clearer fix on it in July. Therefore, weare putting the committee on notice that we can't assess the effect ofthese structural shifts and these new financial instruments completelyand that in July the numbers may be different and the targets for therest of the year may be different", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, abstracting from the Partee integral andthe Wallich differential and given my lack of confidence in theforecast and estimates of velocity and inflation, I have a veryunscientific proposal. I think we ought to lower the M-1A and M-1Branges by 1/2 percentage point from the ranges of last year and keepM2 and M3 where they were last year. It seems to me that we knew inthe middle of last year that the relationships between the M1s and M2and M3 were not right. We probably should have changed those rangesin July, and I don't think we're going to catch a lot of flak by notchanging them now. I do think that most people still look at M1,particularly M-1B now, so I feel it's important to lower that by 1/2percentage point. But it seems to me that, given the uncertainties,that's about the best we can do", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice", "MS. TEETERS. I'm not really enthusiastic about lowering theranges at all. We've been concentrating on page 6, but if you turn topage 7 it shows that the implied interest rates are extremely high.If we had to publish our projections of interest rates, we might havea different attitude toward this. Even with a 1/2 percentage pointreduction, the economic outlook is extraordinarily bad. We've usedevery gimmick we could to get [the economy] not to decline, includingshifts in demand for money and higher rates of velocity. All sorts ofthings could go wrong, and there's no room for any slippage at thispoint in that projection. But I see I'm all alone in not wanting tolower the ranges, so I could go along with taking them down the 1/2percentage point. I would strongly support Governor Rice in sayingthat I don't see anything in this system that says we have to take theranges down year after year. There is a certain amount of moneygrowth that is necessary in this economy. If we keep this up, we'regoing to get to zero [money growth] and we're going to have five yearsof total stagnation if we commit ourselves to that course. So, Iwould support alternative I as stated in the Bluebook. If my memoryserves me right, last year we didn't like the ranges on M2 and M3 thatwere said by the staff to be consistent with our range on M1, so welowered them. And we missed them. I think the best judgment as towhat are the most consistent numbers is that being provided by ourstaff. Even though [lower ranges for M2 and M3] look cosmeticallynice, we could be sitting here a year from now with the same result:That we had cosmeticly nice looking ranges and then missed them by theamount that the staff said we were going to miss. So, I stronglysuggest that we take alternative I as specified", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Did we miss M2 by more than we missedthe narrower aggregate", "MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to pick up on thethought that Ed Boehne laid out: That we ought to focus very, verycarefully not just on the original perceptions that the public has ofwhether or not we've lowered our targets and your problems--and you'regoing to have plenty explaining this to the Banking Committees--butalso on the perception of policy as the year develops. If we think wefaced a credibility problem in 1980, we have seen nothing yet. It'sgoing to be potentially 10 times as large in 1981. Consider, if youwill, what will happen if we publish a range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent forM-1B. The first month of the year we had growth of 16 percent. Itwas 16 percent the first month. Furthermore, our expectation is thatif we hit the midpoint of that range, the fourth quarter-over-fourthquarter increase will be 6-3/4 percent. If Ed Boehne is right--and I-123-2/2-3/81strongly agree with him--we're much more likely to end up at the upperend than the lower end of that range. So the public is going to lookmonth after month after month at an M-1B number that is growing, letus say, at 8 to 8-1/2 percent on average, while the upper end of thetarget range is 6 percent. I just don't think that's viable. Thesame argument in reverse is true with regard to M-1A.So, if we're going to put out ranges, we really have to gofor the bottom line. We have to tell the public these ranges areenormously uncertain but are our best guess of what we think actuallywill happen this year. This isn't just a matter of public perception.It is, as you indicated, a fact that we are going to be terriblyuncertain ourselves as to what these numbers mean. And how the heckwe can conduct monetary policy sensibly with monetary aggregates, whenthe monetary aggregates are just literally off the wall, I do notknow. But it seems to me that Frank Morris has a good suggestion. Asa minimum, we should put principal emphasis on the monetary aggregatethat is least disturbed by these transitional phenomena that we'redealing with, which would be M2. I don't think we can drop M-lA andM-1B. I wouldn't go that far; I think we have to have some narrowmoney figures. But I would go for using M2, announced as ourprincipal target. I think we ought to go with the staff range forthat on page 6, and I would go for alternative I rather thanalternative II. Looking at history, we find that broad money aspresently defined in M2 has a rate of increase that tends to be 3-1/2to 3-3/4 percent on average above the narrow money numbers. So Ithink we can justify that upward movement in the range for thatreason. Additionally, when we're going into a period in which theattractiveness to the public of one element of M2--NOW accounts--isincreased, that is going to attract some funds from elsewhere into M2,so we can justify it on that grounds, too. So, I would go with an M2range of 7 to 10 percent, using that as the principal one, and usingthe ranges for M-1A and M-1B in alternative I with a statement at thebottom of the page instead of in the middle of the page. And I woulduse the left-hand side rather than the right", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Declare that we're reducing them but notreduce them", "MR. SCHULTZ. You better provide something to sniff now", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't even know what the definition ofbase drift is. It depends upon whether you thought you were reallyaiming at the midpoint of the previous year and there's an error inthat. Anyway, for the reasons I suggested, I would go below the 7 to10 percent and 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent [shown under alternative I].I'm not sure we want to go above where we were last year, but for thepsychological or presentational reasons I don't like going as high asstated there. But I have no great compunction about announcing thatwe expect to be at the high end of the range--that we would bedisturbed about being over the range but not at all disturbed aboutbeing at the high end of it--and that the low end of the range is onlyto take care of totally unexpected developments that might for somereason reduce the attractiveness of money market funds or whatever.We could get a development in the thrift industry such that they don'tbecome more eager competitors for money market certificates, so that[lower end] was expressed for a variety of other contingencies thatconceivably could develop. We have a pretty mixed view on this, Ithink. The Committee is pretty well split down the middle in theinitial comments between a 7 to 10 percent group and those who prefersomething less than that. There is a slight majority--seven--for lessthan 7 to 10 percent, just using the M2 number.The only other comment I would make is that we will beannouncing these targets a few days after the Administration isannouncing its program. I don't know what that's going to be. Iassume it's going to include Kemp-Roth for three years. I'm not atall sure it's going to include--my guess is it is not--a beginningdate of January 1, 1981. I think it will be some time after that.And I do think they are probably going to have a bigger expenditurereduction number in the proposed program than conventional wisdom hasassumed--conventional wisdom now and perhaps conventional wisdom afterthey announce it--is at all possible. But I suspect they are going tohave a very big number in there and put a lot of emphasis on theimportance of the changes they are trying to make in the structure ofthe budget and, therefore, in the American economy. The question ishow our money supply numbers will play in connection with that tune--whether it will sound like we're doing business as usual or supportingthe program or whatever. I don't know quite how that will play, butit is a psychological question.2/2-3/81I guess what I am saying is that if it's the greatpredominance of opinion that we go substantively, however presented,for what is alternative I in the Bluebook, I would suggest that wereduce the M2 and M3 numbers to some extent. The presentation wouldsuggest that we would be near the upper end of the ranges. That iswhat I would propose. Presentationally, I think we have to give atleast a tentative view and try to avoid getting it written inindelible ink in any way; I'd give a penciled-in tone for how theactual number may look. You know, we're going to have to report whatthe actual numbers are; and I think we have to give a target at somepoint relevant to the actual numbers rather than say that we cansomehow adjust the actual numbers when we don't have a good enoughhandle to adjust them on a week-by-week basis. By the same token, wedon't have a good enough handle to adjust the target on a week-to-weekbasis either. But I think that can be a little vaguer concept than anumber we actually have to publish every week in print. Sooner orlater we will be forced into giving a target that allows for theshift. My main reluctance about doing that at all decisively rightnow is that there's such a jog in the actual pattern of the numbersthat come out right away. But I would, as I feel now, do it that way.I've been playing around with just how we might present thisand give some sense of continuity. There is a possibility. Theproblem is impossible, I hasten to say, because we really have threesets of numbers. We have numbers based upon what we were estimatinglast year, where we are now, and with further shifts [this] year. Togive some sense of continuity in terms of the M1 numbers anyway, I waswondering whether we could take the cone we had last year, which isthe conventional way to express these things, and adjust it for whatactually happened to the numbers. That means that the actual figureis very close to the cone for the fourth quarter. We could take thetop of that cone and extend it by whatever percentage we have decidedon here. It would be extended in the case of M-1B by 6-1/2 percent--we'd have to go off the right-hand side of the sheet--and by 4-1/4percent for M-1A, if [alternative I] is the decision we make. Then wewould extend the bottom part of the cone by the same percentage and wewould have created a channel which is consistent with the 4 to 6-1/2percent target or the 1-3/4 percent to 4-1/4 percent target. But thecone would coincide with the channel by the fourth quarter. Thus wewould have established a channel in which to operate with exactly thesame upper end of the line as the cone. But the bottom end of thechannel starts from last year's target rather than where we are at themoment. It's the same information; it's just presented in a differentway so that we can link the one target to the next. I don't knowwhether one would call that base drift or not. It creates the samechannel we had last year", "MS. TEETERS. It sounds in fact more like 6-1/2 than 6-1/4percent. Is that what you're saying", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Yes], if we literally did what I justdescribed and did it from the cone instead of the actual and took thepresent estimates of the cone--we could change them--but if weaccepted that one-third/two-thirds split instead of a 50/50 split. Ifwe took a 50/50 split, it comes out that the actual is just about onthe cone; if you take the one-third/two-thirds split, it is not. So,it would imply that we're going to make that up during the year and itwould reduce the ranges effectively by 1/4 of a percentage point", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, you took off on the midpoint, I think.This is a little different", "MR. BLACK. What we originally thought we would do in the wayof presenting charts is what you said, I think. I have some sympathyfor it, but we decided we couldn't explain it to the Committee. Butmaybe we can explain it to the public", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is it exactly. Right.SPEAKER(.). But you can't do it, I don't think", "MR. WALLICH. I am troubled by M-1A and M-1B and moretroubled by M2. It's not that I want to speak up now, but incombination it becomes very, very troublesome", "MR. SCHULTZ. I would like to be persuasive on staying wherewe were last year. It seems to me, given all of the uncertainties,that we might as well get hung for a sheep as a goat here. This 1/2percentage point doesn't seem to me to make that much difference, andif we go up from last year, I think we're going to get a lot ofcriticism. We will say: \"Well, we're going to go down 1/2 point onM-1A and M-1B.\" And they are going to say: \"Aha. But you're goingup on M2 and M3.\" I just don't think it's that crucial; we arelooking at a whole family [of aggregates], which I think is important.If we get outside the range on M2 and M3, that does exert someadditional discipline. Most people continue to [focus] on M-1B, and Ithink that is the more crucial number; I don't think we help ourselvesvery much by going to, say, 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M2 rather than 6to 9 percent. We would lose a lot in the presentation. I do thinkthat the perceptions are crucial at this particular point in time,just as I think the perceptions of budget-cutting are crucial in thefiscal area. So, I would make an argument for 6 to 9 percent on M2and 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent on M3, understanding that we're not onlygoing to be at the upper end but that the relationships may be suchthat it's very difficult to stay below that upper end. I still thinkwe're better off that way", "MR. PARTEE. The thing is that we were over [our M2 range by]quite a bit this past year--by 0.8 percentage point if the figure isright--and we're going to be over this year because, after all, we dohave within that aggregate two pretty dynamic competitive instruments:the money market funds and the money market certificates. And theMMCs have some potential for further development as a market tool. I-135-2/2-3/81might also say that we're in the hands of the DIDC because it couldchange rate relationships. Then who knows what might occur. I ratheragree with you that it may not be worthwhile to confuse things. Onthe other hand, I think this is the one time when we can say: \"Look,we have the relationships wrong between these aggregates growth rates;we had them wrong last year. We can't set each growth rateindependently because they have complicated relationships with eachother. Recognizing that and recognizing the close correspondencebetween M2 and GNP, and seeing that people are thinking in terms of a9-1/2 or 10 percent increase in nominal GNP this year, we think webetter have a range that would encompass what might occur. That's whywe have a higher range.\" But I'm sympathetic with your point of viewthat a 1/2 point difference isn't much", "MR. GRAMLEY. May I take up on that point. The staffforecast with the 7 to 10 percent range for M2 is for an increase innominal GNP of 9.6 percent and a decline in real GNP of .8 percent.Now, I think it's a question of whether we want to aim as our centralpoint for -0.8 percent, or essentially -1.8 percent, for real GNPgrowth in 1981. Both of those imply restraint. The question is notwhether we have restraint but how much. I too think, as Nancy said,that inevitably we're going to be leaning more on M2 as the year goeson to guide ourselves and to explain to the public what we're doingbecause M2 is the one aggregate that's going to be most robust underthe kinds of institutional changes we're looking at. If we can getaway with the presentational problem initially, I think we should goup to 7 to 10 percent as a more meaningful number for M2 if we lowerthe narrow aggregate ranges 1/2 point. We'll regret it later on if wedon't", "MS. TEETERS. Tony is trying to suggest that we widen therange", "MR. PARTEE.

Why is it, Steve, that the aggregate targets areso [disparate]. Ordinarily when we look at alternatives \"A,\" \"B,\" and\"C,\" we see something close to an equal distance between them.

So, that puts me in the neighborhood of \"B.\" But I agreewith Steve in that I don't think the Ms mean very much in this period.They have some marginal value. So, I would have a federal funds rangeof 15 to 20 percent in the directive, start the period about where thefunds rate is now, and if it looked as though the funds rate would-154-2/2-3/81have to go outside a 16 to 19 percent effective range, then I'd have aconsultation", "MS. TEETERS. But one of the problems we have here is thatthose six months are when we're going to get the most fiscalrestraint; we will be getting the full impact of the windfall [fromlower prices on] oil plus the sharp increase in social security taxes.If the tax cut comes through, it would seem to me that we'd want ourrestraint more in the second half of the year than in the first halfwhen the economy is already headed down. I find the upper limits ofthese ranges very unacceptable anyway. But given what we know isgoing on, it seems to me that we should be somewhat looser during thefirst half than we are in the second. That would lead me toalternative A with a lower funds rate range, maybe 13 to 18 percent", "-155-2/2-3/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say we're well outside of the range.Where are you measuring it from. We were too high in the fourthquarter; we now look a little low only because December was low", "-156-2/2-3/81MR. GUFFEY. I would join those who prefer something between\"B\" and \"C.\" The problem is complicated as far as I can see becauseof the very sharp one-month drop in money growth in December. Itrebounded in January and we had about 6-1/2 percent growth, which isabove the long-run target that we just established for 1981. If youlook at \"A,\" for example, the money growth that we would have to haveon a monthly basis to get back to our 4-1/4 percent growth by the endof March involves very large figures. The same is true of \"B.\" Itseems to me that we shouldn't [go that fast]. [My prescription]represents what we have done in the past; we've tried to [make up]about one-third of the [way each month, taking three months] to getback to the midpoint. I would suggest that we get back to themidpoint by April or sometime beyond", "MR. ROOS. I would lean toward either alternative A oralternative B. I don't feel strongly enough that I would bepassionately opposed to \"C.\" But we should remember the experience wehad in the early part of last year when we permitted the aggregates todrop from a rather high rate of growth down to a significantly lowerrate of growth. We had M-1B growth over the second half of last yearof something like--I don't know exactly--12 to 14 percent, and we arejamming it down even with alternative A to a significantly lower rate.In my way of analyzing the effects of changes in the growth of theaggregates, I am impressed by research that we've done that shows thatwhen we have an abrupt drop in the rate of money growth from a higherpace to a lower pace and hold it there, that does have a very negativeeffect on output and can precipitate a recession. And it usuallydoes. I think we should really try to avoid unseemly fluctuations inthese aggregates. I would intellectually lean toward the lessrestrictive of \"A\" or \"B,\" but I wouldn't go to the mat on any ofthese three alternatives. I do feel that the fed funds rate range,short of this Committee overwhelmingly going to a broad range of 1 to20 percent, should be as broad as possible. I'd opt for 14 to 20percent to keep it broad", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-1B and 3 to5-1/2 percent for M-1A", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe we can work on this for the nextmeeting.

I getthis [criticism] all the time, of course, most specifically from thecurrent Chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee. I'm justusing him as an example because of his institutional position. He isin a mood where he says: \"I don't give a damn where those money supplyfigures go, but you have too much volatility in interest rates.\" Now,that is one source of criticism. Everybody can unite on criticizingus on volatility. One group comes at it from the standpoint ofinstability in the money supply and another group comes at it frominstability in interest rates.

Oncehaving set the borrowing path there, the federal funds rate came outwhere it came out regardless of where the limits were on the federalfunds rate. The path was reset. The only question is: reset fromwhat to what. It was reset, based upon some judgment of what theaggregates in total were doing combined, I'm sure, with some feelingin the mind of Committee members--and each one probably had a slightlydifferent feeling--as to the implications for interest rates. But,once having made that decision, the federal funds rate was no longerrelevant. We had our consultation when it moved below 15 percent.The result of the consultation was to set a certain nonborrowedreserve path, and the federal funds rate then fell out regardless ofthe 15 to 20 percent limit.

KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix", "MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a comment andask Steve some questions. These figures on adjusted M-1B, of course,are going to be the great guessing game of 1981. There has been a lotof solid analytical work done at the Boston Bank and by the Boardstaff on what happened in earlier periods when NOWs were introducedand so forth. We have some survey data already. We intend to do somemore surveys. Yet I, for one, Steve, end up with a feeling of alittle skepticism about how much we solidly know. I'm told by mystaff, whom I have had looking into this, that if we took at facevalue the survey data that came in from the banks and the S&Ls forJanuary and February and assumed that about the same results prevailedin March that prevailed in February, we'd end up with something like aweighted average for banks and S&Ls together of 82 percent of thesource of NOWs being demand deposits and the balance being non-transaction accounts. That is in a bit of contrast with the bestjudgment of the Board staff. It came out in the Greenbook, forexample, that in January 80 percent of the NOWs came out of demand,and the figure for February and March was 75 percent. Using thefigure that we came up with of an 82 percent weighted average as arough estimate for the first three months of the year--and I don't saythat I have complete certainty on that either--rather than the [Boardstaff] figures I just cited, we would come up with a 5.2 percentannual rate of gain, seasonally adjusted, for M-1B from December toMarch, versus your figure of 3.2 percent. In other words, it would bea full 2 percentage point difference and the level of M-1B would be $2billion higher", "MR. BALLES. The only other comment I wanted to make on this,Mr. Chairman, is that some of these fine and really well-designedanalytical studies that were done, say, with respect to the NewEngland experience, lead to a conclusion that probably about two-thirds of the source of NOWs was demand deposits and the rest was fromsavings and so forth. We have a feeling that that might not beapplicable to the United States as a whole in 1981. We see that avery large number of respondents to the surveys, contrary to what Iunderstand was the case in New England, are permitting minimumbalances to be held in various forms of savings instruments, such aspassbook accounts, money market certificates, the 30-month smallsavers certificate, etc. At least in the West, the largest banks andthe largest S&Ls, in fact, are permitting those so-called minimumbalance requirements for NOWs to be held in savings instruments, whichI understand contrasts somewhat, Frank, with what had been theexperience in New England. If that practice should prevail as wecontinue to keep this under observation during the rest of the year,it might lead to a greater proportion of NOWs coming out of demanddeposits and less out of savings. So, there is the possibility thatthe present methodology could be understating the adjusted growth inM-1B. But I think that needs some more study", "MR. BALLES. I can only speculate that the extraordinaryincrease in velocity of M-1B, as reported based on the adjustedfigures, could not have been so big if the adjusted figures shouldhave been adjusted higher. We get those sorts of interactions goingon. So I, for one, just have to express some skepticism. All I'mdoing is trying to find out how solidly we know what the adjustedresults are", "MR. AXILROD. Oh, that's right. Given the size of theshifts, we should. But this is very ad hoc. We don't know because wedon't know how the OCD series is going to behave once [the shiftshave] happened. This is just putting back into demand deposits whatwas shifted out. But once it is shifted out, combined with somesavings deposits, it bears interest. Given that interest payments aremade, we don't know that the seasonal behavior is going to be thesame", "-28-3/31/81MR. SCHULTZ. Mr. Balles talked about a range of possibleoutcomes. It's rather important to think along those lines because,at this point, it's easy to parade the horribles. In spite of mygreat respect for Mr. Kichline, I think his forecast is not likely tocome to pass. If you look at what he has for budget deficits--$85billion [in 1981 and $94 billion] in 1982--and then look where he endsup with his GNP forecast, which is for very sluggish growth, I thinkthe proper assumption is that we have very high interest rates duringthat period. From my discussions with bankers around the country, Ijust don't think the real world is going to operate that way. I getthe feeling that they're pretty concerned about the financialcondition of a lot of corporations out there, and I just don't think alot of companies can stand that kind of environment for that length oftime. I don't know what it's going to be like, but I doubt that it'sgoing to be like that forecast. Take two possibilities. One is thatthis M2 growth is more meaningful and that we get tax cuts thissummer, which are going to be very expansionary. We [could] get anenormous surge in money growth in the last half of the year and veryhigh interest rates, and then get socked like the devil in 1982. Ortake the other way around that we are going to have a much weakereconomy short term than now appears likely, so [money] growth is goingto be much slower. Add to the whole problem what the House BankingCommittee said--I was struck by this--which was that they could acceptthe upper end of the target ranges for monetary growth for 1981provided that budget and other fiscal policies offset the highunemployment effects that the monetary policy is expected to produce.That seems to me to be a scenario for absolute disaster. If they aregoing to continue to look to us to hold the line, I don't think wehave a choice. We've said what our path is going to be and, if wewere to attempt to ease, it's pretty clear that everybody would thinkwe had let the inflationary cat out of the bag. And it seems to methat interest rates would be even higher under those circumstances.So, I don't think we have a choice; we have to stay on our generalpath here. But the scenarios of what could possibly happen can bepretty wild. So, it's rather crucial at this point to try to retainwhat flexibility we can and to have some range of options because thisis a pretty tough period we are heading into", "MR. PARTEE. But you should have taken two-tenths of thedecline in savings accounts and added that in, too. You didn't dothat", "MR. CORRIGAN. Well, we can dispute that, but I think thisunderstatement of M-1B is very real", "MR. PARTEE. I don't know", "MS. TEETERS. I would like to remind you that those deficitnumbers are not independent of the forecast. Our projected deficitfor next year is considerably above the Administration's, primarilybecause of a much, much weaker forecast--a 0.5 percent rate of realgrowth rather than 5 percent, and higher unemployment rates andinterest rates. I think we added back in about $18 billion forinterest payments based on our interest rate forecast rather than theAdministration's, and we're losing about $25 billion in deficit perpoint of unemployment, if you compare the 6 percent with 5 percent.So, if Henry's scenario that the risks are on the up side comes true,the size of the deficit will be considerably below what is beingprojected at the present time. As I understand this forecast, thestaff had a great deal of difficulty getting any of the GNP numbers towork out because of the paucity of money. It is a very tightforecast. And the interest rates that would have come out of just amechanical running of the model are considerably higher than what arebeing shown here. So, in contrast to what Henry says, I would thinkthat the risks are on the other side. The consumer is running out ofsteam; the automobile [sales] probably won't last. [Businesses] canslow down investment. I don't feel strongly enough about it to saythat [the risk on] the forecast is on the down side, because I thinkwe have some real demand pressures which are being suppressed, namelyin housing at the present time, which with any sort of readjustmentwould rise.-33-3/31/81This forecast is one of the gloomiest I've ever seen. And itcertainly is gloomier than any forecast that is in the public [arena]now, mainly because of the underlying assumptions about interestrates. I don't particularly want [policy] to let up. On the otherhand, I don't want to screw it down any harder at this point. Itseems to me that the best way to do this is approximately alternativeB because what Fred says about other corporations [is true of thethrifts]. We're going to have impacts on the thrifts. If we keepinterest rates up there, we'll get a lot of emergency reaction intrying to rescue them. A very good study was done here at the Boardon the number of corporations that have had their ratings in the bondmarket downgraded. It's not only surprising, it's fairly widespread.There are going to be a lot of corporations in trouble, and I don'tsee making it any worse for them. I would also point out that we haveM2 misspecified relative to where we've set the M1 measures. We havedecided to keep the M2 target where it was last year, even though thestaff's best estimate was that it would be higher. So we're trying toget M2 into a slot that's inconsistent with M1. And if we just lookat the fact that we're over [our target] on M2, I think that is goingto lead us to actions to depress its growth and depress the M1s [more]than ever. And we've got the money market mutual funds. We have aninterest-sensitive, very interest-sensitive, [component] in the M1measures, and if interest rates begin to drop, we're going to besitting here worrying about the fact that M2 is going down, not thatit's going up--and for [a reason] that's not connected with ourtargets. In terms of the alternatives, I come out for \"B", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's much easier to disagree with thestaff forecast than to come up with one of your own", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but that 4-1/2 percent is adjusted.On an unadjusted basis, that means what: 6-1/2 percent or something", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you look at the last line on page 8, asI understand it--.

With respect to thestaff forecast for the economy, I don't know that there's very much todisagree with if you can't come up with a better forecast. But sinceI'm not a professional economist, I guess I can take the liberty ofsuggesting that the forecast in the past has consistently undershotthe actual performance. And queuing off of that history, I wouldbelieve that we may be looking forward in the period ahead to somewhatstronger growth than is evidenced by the staff forecast in theGreenbook. Having said that and then looking at what is described asthe downward shift in demand for money that has been very great in theperiod just passed--and the sub-talk that we'll return to some morenormal level in the period ahead--it suggests that we are going tohave very strong money growth as we move to the second quarter andperhaps into the third quarter. If that's correct, it seems to methat we ought to take what we can get now, and that would suggest atleast \"B\" and perhaps \"C.\" And since I can't decide between the two,I would take something in between. The borrowing level that has beendescribed in the Bluebook as being consistent with alternative B, andI believe that's $1-1/2 billion, seems a bit high to me. Let me makethe point that there has been some discussion about whether or not M2should be taken into consideration for the period ahead. I'd like tosee it taken into consideration in a sense that it is running veryhigh. And at the time the staff sets the paths for the period aheadand the borrowing level consistent with those paths, M2 should beeither explicitly in the directive or, because of the discussionaround this table, implicitly be taken into consideration and notlowered. Thus, that suggests a bit firmer policy, or closer to \"C\"than to \"B.\" I would just come out someplace between \"B\" and \"C,\"which is about 6 percent from February to June", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[Unintelligible] money supply figure. Thenext money supply figure, in case any of you don't know it, shows asizable increase, which is not particularly in line with anybody'sexpectation or projection and puts us well above the last path we had.I'll get to that in a minute, but I want to put it in the perspectiveof these seasonals. And I'm afraid there was some misleading of theCommittee at the last meeting in that it was said that it just doesn'tmake much difference. It makes quite a lot of difference--not theseasonal changes themselves, but how we treat NOW accounts. On theseasonals themselves, a tentative decision has been made to use thetechnique which, in effect, knocks out April to September of lastyear. If we don't, and just run an ordinary seasonal, a lot of theseasonal adjustment factors move in the opposite direction from [theway] they have been moving in recent years and the year-to-yearchanges in seasonal adjustment factors are much bigger than has beentypical. There are 0.5 changes and 0.6 changes in particular months,which is very exceptional and doesn't look very reliable. Moreover,the other technique is at least consistent with what our outsideconsultants said to do when we had something unusual occur in a seriesin the space of a year. Also, it gives seasonal adjustment factorsthat are at least no more different than they ordinarily are; theychange either 0 or 0.1 or, in a few months, 0.2; and they all tend tomove in the same direction they have been moving in recent years. So,tentatively at least, we're operating with those kind of revisions inthe seasonals.As for NOW accounts, we are putting in the NOW accounts andseasonally adjusting them. Of course, they've gotten quite big thisyear, and there is a decision as to what to do. I think we can saythere is no right way of doing it. We don't have any history thatgives a particular seasonal for NOW accounts. We could do what we'vebeen doing up to now, which is to assume they have no seasonal. Wecan do what we are tentatively doing, which is to assume that theproportion of NOW accounts that came out of demand deposits acts likedemand deposits and the other portion acts like savings accounts. Orwe can just seasonally adjust the [M1] series with NOW accounts in it,which is presumably what we would do in the long run. But, of course,we haven't got much experience for that either. So, tentatively, whatwe're doing is taking that middle course, which is to seasonallyadjust the total of M-1B adjusted, in effect; and we get a seasonalthat is almost the same as the demand deposit seasonal, but there's abig difference in the fact that we're including NOW accounts where wedidn't before. This question arose at the Committee meeting [in lateMarch], and the response was that it didn't make much difference.Well, it turns out that it makes quite a lot of difference on a month-to-month basis. An advantage of publishing this now is that it makesalmost no difference from December through April. In other words, itwould not change the April level appreciably. It would raise it by$100 or $200 million or something, according to our current estimates.But it does not make a very appreciable difference for the wholeperiod from December through April. It does make a big difference forparticular months. I'll read you what we tentatively have for themonthly adjusted figures", "MR. PARTEE. For M-1B", "4/28/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that adjustment factor I don't thinkis seasonally adjusted, but we will show the adjusted figuresseasonally adjusted.

BALLES. The one thing that's worrying me is the pointthat some of you will remember from past years when we got into thisseasonal adjustment problem. It is what Arthur Burns used to call the4 equals 12 problem. The different techniques are all equally validbut yield different answers. I'm just wondering whether by publishingthe new seasonals we're adequately going to guard our flank, so tospeak, by pointing out that the seasonals are a matter of somejudgment", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, could I ask Steve one minortechnical question. Steve, it looked to us as if the 18 percent Aprilfigure was based on a 72-1/2 and 27-1/2 percent break rather than a 70and 30 percent break. If we are right on that, you'd get a littlelower figure than this with a 70/30 split", "4/28/81MR. CORRIGAN. Paul, may I ask one other question, please.Somebody mentioned M2. When we swing over and incorporate the newseasonal for M-1B, is anything going to be done in terms of the factthat the money market funds component of M2 is also not seasonallyadjusted", "MR. CORRIGAN. It might not be a bad idea to mention that inyour explanation. Having done this with other checkable deposits isgoing to draw attention to the fact that we haven't done anythingthere and [that will] then raise more questions", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I think you're probably right. Maybewe ought to fiddle around just for our own edification to see whatdifference it makes. We have time. I should mention one other thing,just for the sake of completeness, so long as we have M-1A. That isbeing seasonally adjusted with a demand deposit seasonal, which isprobably wrong theoretically because a certain type of demanddeposits, namely consumer demand deposits, is a smaller component ofthat now and that presumably changes the seasonal. But we don't knowhow [it does so] and there's nothing much we can do about it.4/28/81If that is behind us, let me just introduce the more currentdiscussion by saying that, obviously, we have a high April figure. Wehave had upward revisions for about three weeks, which is always anominous sign to me. Last week's preliminary number showed a fairlysizable decline. By the time we got around to publishing it--everyday it got whittled down--it was practically no decline. At the sametime, we have this high preliminary figure for the [week] we willpublish next. And that is a little surprising, just with reference tothe earlier question, because if the IRS is really processing taxpayments more quickly, one would have expected a seasonally adjusteddecline. I don't know what up-to-date information we have on that. Ikeep hearing that they are doing it quickly but, if that is reallytrue, it makes the increase even more ominous. Let me just say thatfor several weeks the reserve path would have indicated sometightening; and in some statistical sense, that was right. But themarket hasn't reflected it until the last day or two; it is nowreflecting it quite strongly. But last week, on these normalconventions we use, we expected borrowing to be $1-1/2 billion and itwas well below $1 billion because instead of having positive excessreserves we had minus excess reserves of $450 million. That isbigger, I understand, than anybody has been able to find in recordedhistory. Let me have Steve describe the last few weeks and theoutlook and then Peter can describe the market", "MR. AXILROD.

I think we'd be better off tosay we're going to have a funds rate ceiling rate of 20 percent orsome explicit number.

I think that putting new numbers aroundit in the context of the current situation works in exactly theopposite direction; it reinforces the view that we're playing footsieswith the funds rate. To me the language the Chairman has suggested isclear enough. It does by implication say that something in the areaof 20 percent is fine. But by implication it also says that somethinglike 25 percent isn't fine, and if we found the rate moving in that5/6/81direction, we'd have another consultation.

Paul, I don't have any trouble withthe substance, but I find the wording a little elliptical to myliteral mind. If, in effect, we are making inoperative the upper endof the range between now and the next FOMC meeting, I'm not sure thatthis language carries the implication that at other times we wouldwant it to be operative. If you're that insistent about not wantingto project that emphasis on the fed funds rate, it does prejudice--andmaybe rightfully so--the whole question of whether we have a fed fundsrange in the future or not, because I don't understand why you wouldhave that concern now and you wouldn't have that concern twelve daysfrom now", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Forinstance, we've had this strong surge in the first quarter, which maybe revised up. But it doesn't seem to have led to a great increase incapacity utilization; it may have in materials but not in other areas.And it hasn't led to a reduction in unemployment, as one would figure.Now, if we are looking at this first quarter, it really means that GNPfrom here on out will be about 1 percentage point higher than it wouldhave been had GNP grown at something like 3 percent or so--spreadingthe difference roughly over the rest of the year, or dividing it by 4.So, the whole picture is somehow tighter. And that I don't quite seereflected in the capacity utilization or the unemployment figures; butit must be there. I also am asking myself: Why, in an economy inwhich no single thing seems to be outstandingly strong, is there solittle room. Why, when we've got some distinctly weak sectors likehousing and automobiles, has the economy been expanding so rapidly.Is it because the saving rate is so low that we're now at a muchhigher level of consumption than we normally would be so that leavesless room in the economy for other things and is squeezing things out.I find all these things difficult to reconcile, but there seems to beno doubt that the economy is not going down even moderately as much asthought; it may not go down at all and is overall very strong", "MR. PARTEE. Yes, we could get a sharp change inexpectations. The people who are expecting prices such as real estatevalues to rise will stop expecting them to rise. And then suddenlywhat didn't seem to be such a high interest rate before will seemextraordinarily high, and that could happen very quickly. But onejust can't predict when it will happen. By the way, though, Tony, Ido think that [our policy] is having a restraining effect on theeconomy. It's clear that housing starts are not going to stay at 1.2million; they're going to drop below it. And that's very restraining.That's one of the biggest industries in the economy, and it's largelydue to interest rates that housing activity is as low as it is. Oninventories, I agree with Frank. He said inventories are very, verylean. Why are they lean. It's because interest rates are so highthat everybody pays great attention to keeping inventories down. Theautomobile business, which in the last two or three 10-day periods hasbeen below 6 million in domestic sales, is 4 million off what theindustry has been accustomed to.

Well, I see the economy lifted to a higherlevel of [activity] and, with a given rate of money growth, we have ahigher level of velocity than one would have expected. Certainly, wehave to [get money growth to] come back [toward our] midpoints. If wedon't do that, I think we will have continuing pressure from highinterest rates for a long time, with the economy being held down byalways bumping [up against] the admittedly very tight-fitting moneysupply ceilings. I find that uncomfortable to contemplate for thefuture. So, if we could create a little breathing space in the realsector, letting out some of that steam that built up during the firstquarter, I think we would operate more comfortably with our existingtargets and in the long run we'd probably have less high interestrates. Conceivably, maintenance of these high interest rates wouldgive us this [result] anyway through some sort of financial crunch.But we don't want to provoke that. So, I would lean toward exerting agood deal of pressure now in order to get [rid of the imbalances in]the economy and [in] the relationship of the aggregates to theeconomy. That suggests that \"C\" is the appropriate alternative. Tothe extent that one can [anticipate] these things, if \"C\" will allowthe funds rate to come down later even though it may mean a higherfunds rate immediately, that's what I think we should aim at, i.e.somewhat less pressure in the economy for the longer run.I would say one other thing. Given the way we were surprisedby events in April, we ought to examine whether we couldn't respondmore flexibly to such developments. I realize that means respondingto the weekly data in a way that the data themselves don't reallyjustify. Nevertheless, it has happened again and again that we wereovertaken by events and, in the light of hindsight, probably wouldhave wanted to move faster. I don't recall so many instances in whichwe did move fast and then regretted it or didn't move and then foundthat that would have been the right thing to do. On balance, I thinkour failures have been on the side of actions [that were] too littleand too late", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm primarilymotivated by a desire to hit the targets that we set earlier, notbecause they're magic but because that would tend to avoid the samekind of thing that happened in June, July, and August of last year.That is, things got away from us after one month [of] fairly large[monetary growth]. We say that isn't terribly bad, but when we startpiling one month after the other, we then have a very small chance ofhitting our targets for the year. Therefore, restraint at the moment-31-5/18/81is attractive to me, but I'm not sure that I would go as far as \"C.\"The staff's estimate of growth in M-1B of 6 percent or a little abovein May under alternative B probably is subject to being off by atleast 100 percent. That is, I think we could get 3 percent or 9percent in May as easily as 6 percent. Thus, my prescription would besomething between \"B\" and \"C,\" with a borrowing level initially ofabout $2.1 or $2.2 billion and with the rather specific instruction tothe Desk and to the staff that if money growth as it develops in Mayis running above 6 percent, the borrowing level should be adjustedupward promptly to $2-1/2 billion, [the level] I believe the staffwould say at the moment is consistent with \"B.\" So, I am choosingnumbers for growth in the aggregates between \"B\" and \"C,\" with aninitial borrowing level of $2.1 or $2.2 billion but I would beprepared to move borrowing up rather rapidly if growth in M-1B startscoming in above 6 percent in May. A federal funds range of 17 to 22percent would be acceptable", "MR. FORD. Yes", "MS. TEETERS. Well, I'm shocked by the consensus that isemerging. I don't think this economic outlook, which is based on \"A,\"is at all encouraging. It means another year or maybe two years of nogrowth in the economy. I find the unemployment rates projected, withno growth, rather unbelievable also. More importantly, it seems to methat the level of borrowing is now becoming very crucial here. Atjust under $2 billion we have already put a great deal of pressure onthe market. We have shot [short-term interest] rates up 3 to 5 fullpercentage points, depending on which ones you look at. If we moveborrowing up another $1 billion, the [proposed fed funds upper end of]22 percent isn't going to hold. It seems to me that we really shouldbe somewhere between \"A\" and \"B\" and perhaps move the borrowing fromthe present $1.7 or $1.8 billion to just over $2 billion and let thatbe the deciding point here. I'd set the [top of the funds rate] rangeat certainly no more than 21 percent, which I find difficult toaccept. We're putting a lot of pressure on the market now. Wehaven't had enough time, as Frank said, to assess what that suddenchange in interest rates is going to do. I think it's foolish to runrates up another 5 percentage points in such a short period of time,which I'm convinced \"C\" would do at this point. I can live with \"B,\"but I don't like it. I'd much rather have the borrowing halfwaybetween $2 and $2-1/2 billion", "MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, there are several things we haven'treally talked about this morning, including the internationalsituation, the Middle East, and a number of other things thatcertainly could alter the outlook very quickly. A second point isthat I'd be very happy if somehow we could get away from the checkwriting privileges on these money funds, because I think we areexposed there with the funds investing in issues that could go sour onthem. We may have more volatility built into this than we arethinking about. The third is that we talk about targets as if theywere fixed and we forget base-drift and a whole lot of history thatgoes into them. I'm not sure that hitting the midpoint of our newrange is what we really ought to be doing. A little miss on the lowside might be more helpful than misses on the high side. I'mdisturbed by the M2 and M3 figures, which tend to go on the high sidein this set-up. On the other hand, I have some sympathy with Lyle'spoint of view in that I'd hate to see us run the rates up and then runthem right back down again. That would not be very helpful in termsof our longer-run objectives. To take a stance at this time, I wouldbe content to be able to hit somewhere between \"B\" and \"C\" rather thanto set a target and then be all over the lot in terms of ourperformance. I, too, would be inclined to raise the borrowingobjective to help move in that direction; I'd go to $2.1 billion orsomething in that neighborhood as a first move", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'll reveal my forecast on where theCommittee would come out, which by coincidence or otherwise doesn'tmake me feel uncomfortable. We have had a 5-1/2 percent [M-1B] targetfor the quarter, and the alternative that's consistent with that is\"C.\" But we had a big increase [in M-1B] in April. My forecast wasthat it might not look too good or that people might not want to saythat we should go all the way to \"C,\" which implies about 1 percent[M-1B growth for April to June] by the time we state it in thedirective. Stated flatly, we're certainly around the \"B to C\" area;both the Committee and the non-Committee members, looked atindividually or collectively, are split someplace between \"B\" and \"C\"with a little flavor of between \"A\" and \"B.\" The question I wouldraise is whether we can reconcile that part of it, and I'll get to theborrowings and the other issues in a minute. If you look at the waythe record has been stated historically, the most consistent way isthat [at this point in the quarter] we'd put in a growth rate forApril to June", "MR. WINN. Is it through June or to June, Paul. I'm worriedabout the lack of [unintelligible]", "MR. GRAMLEY. To get [a growth rate of] 5-1/2 percent orsomewhat less for March to June, we are going to have less than 1.3percent for April to June. That bothers me; it seems to me that weare putting in figures that are really not consistent with oneanother", " And that's what I'm--MR. GRAMLEY. But that first \"lower\"--the phrase \"an annualrate of 3 percent or lower\"--connotes that. I wouldn't have judgedthat the Committee's view is that [M-1B growth of] 1 percent or lessis what we are really shooting at. And 1.3 percent or less is whatwe'd have to get if we are going to get 5-1/2 percent or less fromApril to June", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it wouldn't be. But in that caseit's not consistent with the 3 percent either", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but then it says the previous targetwas 5-1/2 percent or less", "MR. BLACK. But wouldn't 3 percent itself be inconsistent", "MR. PARTEE. That moves us toward consistency, but it doesn'treally make it consistent. That's the point", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If we discuss the central issuefirst, maybe this clause will fall into line more easily. If we say 3percent, we are going squarely for alternative B. It's only if luckcomes along that we are going to accept lower [growth]. The consensusof the Committee was clearly for between \"B\" and \"C.\" Some people had\"C,\" some people had \"B,\" and no more than one or two were between \"A\"and \"B.\" I think 3 percent doesn't reflect the Committee consensus", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think any constructionallows us to deal with that. What allows us to deal with that iswhere we go on the borrowing assumption right now. I don't see peoplebeing all that gung ho on the borrowing assumption that the staff saysis consistent. I'm not sure it is. The staff estimate may be toohigh. I think we ought to get some understanding of what we aretalking about here, but the only difference it makes in the real worldis what number the outsiders read six weeks from now or when it's allin the past anyway. We can obviously put in 2 percent here. Thatgoes squarely in between", "MR. BALLES. I think it would be less confusing if wefollowed what Tony suggested by putting in 2 percent and dropping thewords \"or lower", "\"MR. CORRIGAN. What's wrong with a range. I guess theproblem is that it doesn't let us deal with the bottom side", "MR. AXILROD. The essential sentence that you have there saysthat if it appears during the period before the next meeting thatfluctuations in the funds rate, taken over a period of time, within arange of __ to __ percent are likely to be inconsistent, etc., theManager will inform the Chairman, who will then decide whether thesituation calls for supplementary instructions. That sounds as if thefederal funds rate is an objective within the [context] of theinstructions. The proposal, in line with some of the [points] raisedby Committee members, essentially has the same beginning but it triesto make the federal funds rate seem more like a consultation pointthat involves a little more flexibility. It says that if it appearsduring the period before the next meeting that pursuit of the monetaryobjectives and related reserve paths is likely to be associated with afunds rate range persistently outside a range of _ to _ percent,then the Manager will inform the Chairman--the same sort ofinstructions as before--but then it says \"who will then decide whetherconsultation with the Committee is necessary", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I think that's a mistakeanyway. If we are all saying that the purpose of the funds range isto trigger a consultation, then we should not imply so clearly thatthe Chairman can veto a consultation and in effect abolish the FOMCand run a one-man FOMC", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think we ought to discuss whetherwe want this at all, which I guess is the question you're raising.I'm obviously at the hands of the Committee, but I don't find anydifficulties myself, and I see some advantages, in saying if interestrates move extremely enough the Committee at least wants to review-45-5/18/81what the heck it's doing. I think that's the question. If we reallythink that, then I'm inclined to feel that we ought to say it. If wedon't think that and genuinely don't think this is anything to beworried about, then we [could] leave it out. Now, we could write thisto say that if either the money supply is moving well outside itsrange or if the federal funds rate is moving well outside its range,we would consult. And I think that is true in a sense. Thedifference in the implication is that if the money supply is runningoutside its range, we know what to do if it doesn't involve conflictswith these other things. We know what to do in the sense of thegeneral direction", "MR. SCHULTZ. All right", "MR. PARTEE. Also, it seems to me that there ought to be aprofessional judgment on the part of the Manager that it's going torun well outside the range rather than that the Chairman is makingthis decision. If we want it to be a technical question, it seems tome it ought to be a Manager's question", "\"VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

But if we then comealong a month from now and publish a directive, which may mean thesame thing to us but changes maybe 60 words, that will give rise tothe analysts publishing from now until at least the end of the yearall sorts of interpretations. I think that's what we don't want.

I think it isstretching things to say that the earlier instruction could beinterpreted in the way it was interpreted in that meeting. And Ithink what is now being proposed is consistent with the interpretationin the telephone conference call. It was a stretched interpretation,which now needs a different instruction, I think, if we're going tostay with it and use it. So, I do believe a change is necessary", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I think one has to start with the Memorial Dayweekend when there is some suspicion that borrowing was as heavy as itwas over the weekend because we were coming toward the end of thequarter and people felt entitled, in some sense, to use the window.It was a long weekend and borrowing was quite heavy over that weekend.Thereafter, we had a kind of alternating pattern in which borrowingtended to be low and then high in successive weeks, which is not anunfamiliar pattern with banks who tend to bet that the next week isgoing to be like the [current] week. So, if Wednesday is tight, theyare likely to figure that out and borrow on Friday. That gives aprofile for the week of high borrowing before the weekend and lowborrowing afterward. If borrowing then toward the end of the weektends to be low, which happened in several weeks, and money marketconditions are easier, that tends to make banks borrow less before theweekend--less than called for by our path--with the result that byWednesday the amount they have to borrow is substantially more thanthe average, and interest rates go up", "MR.

For example, today theDeutschemark fell very rapidly and sharply and they didn't spend adime. On other days they will spend a lot of money.

The problem as I see it--and this is where I would agree withTony--is that the lags in this whole process are very different. Whatmay well happen is that two years from now we will be looking at acurrent account deficit of enormous magnitude [that is] slowing theeconomy down a lot, and we will be driving interest rates down becausewe're trying to keep our own domestic economy going, therebyaggravating our inflation problem because of what is happening to theexchange rate.

No, the German government would liketo see cooperative intervention between the Bundesbank and the FederalReserve.

This has been a matter of some discussion.Maybe we ought to linger on this point a moment, Mr. Kichline", "MR. KICHLINE. As you know, forecasting interest rates is areal problem, and I tried to say in my [briefing] that there are a lotof pitfalls involved in this process. We've tried to look at this ina variety of ways. The charts aren't plotted incorrectly, and you'vedescribed what is there and what the implications are. Our generalview is that we do have very strong latent demands for goods andservices in the economy in a variety of sectors; [those demands] arebeing held down by interest rates. We're stuck with an assumption of4-1/4 percent [growth in] M-1B and a good deal of uncertainty abouthow to interpret that measure of money. Is it really the sort ofthing that one would have perceived in the past, linking it closely totransactions demands. Or is it changing. In our forecast, looking at4-1/4 percent money [growth], we have what we've termed some furtherdownward drift in the money demand function. That is, money is actingin a more powerful way than the 4-1/4 percent [growth] we observe.But even so, using any of the standard models, to get the economy tolimit growth of money demand to 4-1/4 percent takes incredibly highshort-term rates. The Board's model has much higher rates than wehave here. At the same time, we get very high long-term rates, whichis one of the factors damping investment growth in our forecast. And,in response to a question earlier this morning, my [comment] was thatwith the kinds of rates we have built in one could easily argue a casefor a lower investment demand than the staff has forecast. That is,the implied real rates are very high.-17-7/6-7/81So, we're really fighting this issue of what kind of[interest] rates would be associated with the 4-1/4 percent growth inmoney, whether [that] is sustainable, or whether in fact we might justfind the economy collapsing in that environment and [money growth]then snapping back. But it's a key issue with regard to the staffforecast. Projecting nominal interest rate levels out a year or ayear and a half is something I wouldn't like to stake a lot ofconfidence on. So, you pointed to a real problem. It seems to methat we could not expect that situation [of high real rates] topersist for an extended period of time. It would have to be resolvedin one way or another, either by the economy collapsing and draggingrates down or by rates falling with changing price expectations. Wedo have in this forecast a rather favorable price performance, and onewould think there would be an unwillingness to pay those long rates.So, it would need to be resolved", "MR. WALLICH. Yes, but aren't you arguing in effect thatbecause we've had such a large shift in the first half of the year,we're therefore unlikely to get any in the second", "MR. FORD. Yes, but that could be consistent.... Let me putit to you as a question: Couldn't that be consistent with a muchlarger percentage of the balances in money market funds being drawn inthe form of transactions if the wealthier households are the ones thatare doing it. Each check would have to be a minimum of $500, right.Then there is a learning curve. I would say that over the next yearor two, if you guys believe that these high interest rates will last,that percentage of households and especially the percentage of dollarsthat get used as checking accounts--assuming Congress doesn't takeyour advice, Paul, and puts reserve requirements on them--[is going torise]. We are going to see a big shift. The shift we're going to betalking about six months or a year from now isn't going to be theshift to NOWs out of checking; it's going to be the shift to checkingin the form of MMFs. And since normally we think of checking accountmoney as an M1 type number and since MMFs we think of as M2, we mayhave to think some more about that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If this table is right that I have infront of me and you haven't changed your numbers, your nominal GNPforecast for next year is a lot higher than the staff's. Right", "-23-7/6-7/81MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, all this conversation, ormuch of it, suggests to me that we ought to face up to the fact thatwe do not know how to measure transactions balances in our presentsociety. M-1B is somewhat of a nostalgic attempt to maintain aconcept of transactions balances and I think it's leading us into allkinds of problems. First of all, we don't know what M-1B unadjustedis in the sense that we don't know how much of M-1B is really not atransactions balance. For example, in the areas where there are veryhigh minimum balance requirements for NOW accounts, people will shiftassets into their NOW account in order to get the free services. InConnecticut, for example, the average balance in a NOW account is$6,000. This is substantially higher than the average balance inpersonal checking accounts in Connecticut before the NOW account cameinto being. The reason is that [banks] learned from the Massachusettspricing of NOWs and put in very high minimum balance [requirements].So, some part of M-1B unadjusted is not a transactions balance. Thenwe adjust the M-1B for shift adjustments, and I suspect this is doneon the basis of--to put it mildly--incomplete evidence. In additionto that we have the evidence just cited that some 4 percent of themoney market funds are being used, at least to some degree, astransactions balances. I suspect that percentage will rise over time.We have overnight RPs, for example, that are used by a good manycorporations as transactions balances, and RPs are not in M-1B at all.I really don't think we will ever, from now on, be able to have aconcept of a transactions balance in which we can have the sameconfidence we used to have in the old M1. At least we knew then thatM1 was the store of money that people had available to them to makepayments. It seems to me that we could be splitting hairs on M-1B fora great many years and talking about these wild changes in velocity,about these changes in money demand, and so on, and all we'd be doingis covering up the fact that we simply don't have any basis formeasuring what transactions balances are any more", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I think M-1B is quite a bit better thanFrank has said. What we really have to do is to talk about firstdifferences. We need something to steer by. Now, the fact that thereare some idle balances in a transactions total of M1 doesn't mean athing", "MR. PARTEE. And that, of course, one allows for in thevelocity estimate. You can take any number and modify it to takeaccount of other things that you think are happening in the economy.I don't see that M2 is that much better [than M1]. If I understandwhat the DIDC did, in another 25 days we're going to have 4-yearcertificates in M2 that are probably going to sell like wildfire. Are-24-7/6-7/81you going to consider those transactions balances. They're going tobe in M2", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Market people that I talk with feelthat inflationary expectations are not down. That's a view amongtheir clients as well as their own view. And, of course, that iscorroborated by the long rates we see. So, I come back to a verypessimistic view. It seems to me that there's a good deal oflikelihood that [the economy] will stay stagnant. If the economypicks up in the fourth quarter the way some people feel it will, itwill put a lot of pressure on interest rates. And we will have had bythen, unless we [see rates decline] in the coming weeks of thisquarter, a protracted period of very high real interest rates. Itseems to me that some companies are getting to the limit of theirabilities [to cope with these high interest rates] and there will besome failures. I think this will change inflationary expectations andin the process there will probably be a certain amount of recession,too. But that's a [scenario] that doesn't give us a gradualtransition to a much better world", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I didn't submit estimates so perhaps it'sunfair to say anything. But I come out a lot closer to Tony thananybody else who has commented. I think we have a heroic staffforecast here in saying that inflation is going to drop this much.I'm inclined not to believe it because I don't think we've had theconfrontation with costs that is going to be required to call for apermanently lower increase in costs than we've been seeing. I don'tthink that's easily handled by people just saying that they willsettle for a lower pay increase or take lower corporate profitswithout fighting back. I think they will fight back, and it's goingto be a very difficult period. I have the feeling--and have had itfor the last year or so--that the way we're running monetary policynow, and it's a way that's probably appropriate, is as a governor onthe economy. Essentially what we have here is a governor-typeoperation in the way the staff has run their forecast through '82.Any time those latent demands begin to perk up and we get an overrunin money, we will tighten up and interest rates will go higher. Thatwill then force the economy down [to] the point where the money demandwill be [less] strong and interest rates will fall. And we'll get a-28-7/6-7/81little better [economic performance] coming up to that limit again andthen tend to go through it while interest rates will be high until theinflation rate is significantly reduced.I guess I would be rather in agreement with the staffprojection except that I would have put inflation a little higher thanthey have it, for next year certainly. I think there's going to be abig food price increase next year. Also, I can't really buy therecovery they have in the second half of '82 because by then we'll befaced with financial distress on all sides. And I think that willhave enough of an expectational influence that the economy won't, infact, recover. That's all", "MR. GRAMLEY. I put down numbers for 1982 that are not a lotdifferent from what the staff is forecasting. My real growth numberwas 1 percent; my implicit deflator number was, as I remember, 8-1/2percent or somewhere around there. But I put those numbers down witha lot more foreboding than has been expressed in some of the commentsaround the table, because I think those numbers are realizable only ifwe get very, very lucky and have a big shift in money demand or if wehave a sequence of developments in which we get more consumption thanthe staff is talking about and a lot less investment, with all thatmeans for potential problems for the future. Particularly, I want tocall the Committee's attention to what I think could be a degree ofself-deception. That is, we have to be awfully careful about whatwe're accomplishing, if in fact we live within our targets of moneygrowth but get a lot more effective increase in money because we'vehad big downward shifts in money demand. I don't buy the argument,for example, that because nominal money growth is actually falling wecan get declining inflation but because we're getting such a big dropin money demand we can also get real growth. That in effect sayssomehow that the inflation rate is some mystical property ofexpectations and has nothing to do with what is really going on in theeconomy. I don't think it's going to happen that way. Inflation isgoing to come down if, and only if, we're awfully lucky and at thesame time have very, very constrained growth in real economicactivity. We'd be very lucky indeed to get the kind of improvement onthe inflation front that the staff is forecasting. We will get itonly if real growth is constrained to somewhere around where we'retalking about. I worry a lot about the implications of interest ratelevels that persist at where they are now for another 18 months. Ithink we're really looking at major, major problems ahead", "MS. TEETERS. I played with the numbers also and I came upwith two scenarios. Basically, the overall [unintelligible] is thegovernor on the rate of growth of nominal GNP. And given thereduction in the rate of growth in money and the assumed reduction fornext year, we don't have much room for a nominal GNP that is verylarge. One of the two scenarios that seemed to fall out of my workingwith the numbers was that we would have a full blown recession thisyear. Yes, it could happen. With all the growth that we've had,[growth for the year] could still come out at 1 percent because of thefirst quarter, but we could have zero or a negative in the otherquarters. If you look at the flash on real GNP in the second quarter,-29-7/6-7/81the only thing that is positive is inventories; everything else isdown. Basically, it's a negative quarter. If we got the recessionthis year and we stayed with high interest rates, then we could getsome recovery but not a very vigorous one next year. The otherscenario that can work here, with these high levels of interest rates,is that we could squeak by this year without a major recession andthen have very, very slow growth next year also--basically two verylow growth years rather than a recession and a recovery. I don'tthink we can live with these interest rates over that period of timewithout really causing a recession, the timing of which I'm uncertainabout. But with these rates of interest we will be there probablysooner rather than later", "MR. WALLICH. Well, I was away so I didn't put in anynumbers. My only reaction to the staff forecast is that I'm skepticalof the favorable inflation developments. I can't prove that outcomeisn't likely but it seems more optimistic than I would expect in lightof the details of the situation, both in terms of the particulardevelopments in food and energy and what I see on the side of costs.As for the slow growth, I have no sense of which way it's going to go.It seems to me that Chuck is right in saying that we have a governor-30-7/6-7/81on the up side. Any time the economy breaks out on the up side itwill be pushed down again by rising interest rates. If we have asymmetrical policy, that would be true also on the down side. That isto say, any time the economy slows down interest rates will be pusheddown if we keep the money supply on track. So, I wouldn't anticipateany very severe recession. But the economy could fluctuate betweenmoderate expansion and moderate contraction. Now, I hope the analysisis true regarding this quasi-equilibrium of [the economy] movingsomething like 1 percent for two years as a result of strong privatedemands. It would give us an opportunity for the future. It would beequally well rationalized in terms of there being a very strong demandfor credit on the part of the government through a rising deficit thatkeeps interest rates high rather than the strong and unsatisfiedprivate demands. If we get out of this inflation, it's unlikely to beby what Lyle calls some mythical relationship. I think it will bebecause costs are coming down. And costs will come down in the[usual] painful and unpleasant way--falling profits, rising excesscapacity and, unhappily, higher unemployment. There is some tradeoff,I think, in terms of lowering the level of unemployment, excesscapacity, and the duration; the lower level and longer duration willaccomplish about the same. But I think it would be surprising if wegot out of this inflation without more sacrifice than is implied inthe optimistic interpretation of our situation", "MR. WINN. My second point is that in talking around--I'vebeen in the building game a little recently--builders all complainthat they haven't had a chance to increase their prices in the lasttwo years because of the status of housing. They are all sittingthere with [price hikes of] 20 percent or more ready to go anytimethere's a little uptick in the housing area. Now, this may be wishfulthinking, but they certainly are not psychologically adapted towardholding the line. Finally, all our scenarios suggest a smooth processdeveloping. I just think about all the uncertainties and thequestions. I don't think we have a year to go on the thrift industrybefore we start to see some major shifts of funds. I don't knowwhether it will be people getting scared and shifting funds, or anacceleration [of flows] into the money funds, or a money fund goingkaput. Then we could wake up with $100 billion more looking for aplace to go. We may have major problems from crises and movements ofmoney, which are going to impact institutions in a way we don'tforesee. And that's going to be the biggest psychological change totake place in the period ahead", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Have we exhausted the comments. I guesswe can't carry this much further this afternoon. We didn't get quiteas far as I thought we would. Maybe we'll start off with Mr. Axilrodtomorrow.Let me just say that, when I look at where we are today ascompared to where we were six months ago, I share Larry Roos's feelingof some satisfaction thus far. But it's a limited satisfaction. Ithink we have clearly taken the froth out of inflation. All thoseprices that are sensitive to tight money or expectations, or both, arepretty well deflated. In fact, I think many of them are deflatedbelow the cost of production and, therefore, if things got easier,they would go up again at some point. If the economy began going upagain and interest rates began going down, we probably [could expect]increases in some raw materials prices anyway. I think we've beenexceptionally lucky on oil--I don't know how long that will last--andwe've been pretty lucky on food. The trick is to convert that luck,to the extent that it is luck--it's partly tight money--into a morelasting wage and cost pattern. Views differ on that. I don't quitebelieve that we're seeing it yet, but I hope we will see it. I thinkwe can begin to say that something may be happening on the inflation-32-7/6-7/81side. I'll concede that much, Mr. Kichline, even though it will takesome time to be confirmed.I also think conditions are softening in the economy, whichmay be optimistic compared to the view of some in the markets thateven this level of interest rates wouldn't soften anything in theeconomy. I believe we are seeing, at the moment at least, somesoftening; but the burden of all the comments that were made aroundthe table is that there is no simple way to get from here to there. Idon't know whether the staff forecast or many of the other forecastsimply a fairly simple way. They don't imply big recessions or a bigbacktracking on inflation. I'm not sure that there is an easy way toget from here to there or any way that doesn't involve a lot more realproblems and controversies than we've had so far. But we don't knowwhere all that is going to lead or precisely what direction it's goingto take.Meanwhile, we have to make a few decisions. We unfortunatelyhave to use these fragile numbers that we have, and some of them aregetting increasingly fragile. I agree with Frank Morris in terms ofdirection, but we happen to have a law as well as an expectation thatsays that we have to review our present targets and have to put downsome new ones for next year. We are in a happy or unhappy situationthat practically everything is outside the target range. It's notquite that bad: Some are high within the range; others are above orbelow; it depends upon which one you look at. I think we do haveinconsistencies among the targets for the first half of this year. Isuspect the staff analysis, when Mr. Axilrod gets to it, will suggestthat those inconsistencies will become less as the year progresses. Iguess he has to assume that because they were estimated in aconsistent way originally and if they're off path for six months--ifthe original analysis was right--they have to come back towardconsistency in the next six months", " Chairman, isn't it worth pointingout that the staff originally recommended a much higher M2 as beingconsistent with--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they recommended a somewhat higherM2, but the distance--SPEAKER(.)", " 10 to 12--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know. It wasn't that high; it was1/2 to 1 percentage point higher. The discrepancy could explain, onecan say, perhaps half [of the overshoot from the target]; I thinktheir original analysis probably would have explained one-third ortwo-thirds of it or less", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That may be pretty vague, and I was prettyvague. I raised the question of lowering the M-1B target [for thisyear]. But whether or not we lower it, I would not aim right nowaggressively, in quotation marks, for something like the A alternativepresented here in the short run and what that means for the long run--returning to the midpoint of the present target. I think we have thealternative of either lowering the target or saying that we are goingto be low in the range--not necessarily outside the target, but wedon't expect to be in the upper part of this range. We could eitherbe below the target or in the lower part of the range. Those are thetwo choices I see for changing the M-1B target for this year", "MR. ROOS. No", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, we shouldn't be talking about theshort run. Is page 8 the short-run stuff", " To hit the bottom part of the present range of3-1/2 percent--MR. PARTEE. Well, I don't know. You say it's fast. Let meremind you that a year ago we were sitting here talking about how inthe world we could get back up into the ranges. In fact that was thekey note of your July presentation. So, who knows. I think we oughtto choose these numbers with respect to what we think the longer-runeffect will be and then struggle with the question of whether we comein low or go above or anything like that in the short run. But weought to try to keep in mind what the economy requires.Quickly, Paul, I happen to agree: Alternative 2 looks allright to me", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I disagree, Henry. I think one hasto discuss what one is recommending for '82 in discussing whether torevise the remainder of '81 or not. If you want to revise theremainder of '81, you then are going to be much less willing toannounce a further reduction [for '82], presumably, at this time", "MS. TEETERS. We don't have the answers, but implicit inthese is the level of interest rates. Alternative I is the one thatkeeps interest rates in the 18 percent range for the full 18 months,isn't that correct. Presumably alternatives II and III would putinterest rates in the 20 or perhaps 22 percent range", "MR. ROOS. The ranges should be left unchanged. I think weought to opt for the lower of the two alternatives to stay within theranges, if I understand it", "MR. ROOS. I would think, and this may be unrealistic, thatat this particular time whichever way we go, it would be appropriate[to provide] an early explanation in a public statement by theChairman or through some other mechanism as to what we actually wereseeking to accomplish in this meeting. In other words, in thissituation an understanding of what we are trying to do is so criticalcurrently that getting our story across through signaling [may not bethe way to go]. Maybe it is too early to talk about this--maybe itought to be in the directive--but whatever we come up with, if we optfor what the Chairman implied earlier, I just wonder whether thisshouldn't be expressed and explained quite openly or publicly withoutthe 30-day lapse that usually accompanies these things", "MR. SCHULTZ. But some comment in the directive to indicatethat it is indeed being looked at might well be worthwhile. Giventhat we are in fact looking at a family of aggregates and that none ofthese aggregates is behaving very well, it might be a good idea toindicate to people in the market that we are indeed looking at leastto some degree at M2", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, with the exception of Mr. Black, I wasthe outlier on my forecast for inflation for next year. [My forecastwas] predicated on the idea that we would continue with the policy ofmonetary restraint. I disagree with Governor Wallich. I think wehave a real opportunity at this point to bring inflation down. Thereare a lot of indications that the groundwork has been laid and thatthere is sensitivity [to that possibility]. I certainly would agreewith Mr. Solomon, though, that it takes a period of intense price andwage competition to bring inflation down. We have that opportunityover the next four quarters and I think it is very important that wenot lose this opportunity for two reasons: (1) because the Americanpublic are going to get very impatient if they don't start to see somereal effects from the kind of policy we've been carrying out; and (2)because we have another big tax cut coming up on the first of July ofnext year and that's likely to be very stimulative.So, to me, the next four quarters are really crucial. It isvital that we have a continued policy of monetary restraint. Thereare risks on both sides. There is a risk in what I really would liketo see, which is a period of very slow growth or a mild recession, andthe risk is that it could get out of hand on the down side. I don'tthink that's likely to happen, first because there is a great deal oflatent demand in the economy and if the economy does weaken to thatdegree, interest rates would come down and that would have astimulative effect. Also we have another tax cut coming on October 1and we have continued heavy defense spending, [both of] which I thinkare likely to prove to be a support underneath the economy if itshould get much weaker than I would anticipate. The risk on the otherside of not having a firm policy of monetary restraint is that wecould have a very difficult time early next year. It seems to me thatthe period of greatest danger for the thrifts is that period; if weease up and then have this tax cut and the defense spending and theother things that could well take place, we could easily be in asituation in the first quarter of next year where interest rates arerising and there is tremendous pressure on the thrifts. I thinkthat's the period of great danger. It seems to me that we have a realopportunity here and it's very important that we not let thissituation get out of hand as we did last year. The economy is poisedso that we can exert a real effect on inflation.So, I would like to see us reduce the lower M1-B band forthis year to 3 percent from 3-1/2 percent. I see the arguments on theother side, but if we leave it at 3-1/2 percent the market would lookat it and say: \"That points to a big increase for the remainder ofthis year and if the Fed weren't going to try to hit that target, whydid they leave it there.\" I think that makes a lot of sense. Theargument can be made that if we put in 3 percent, then that is a realtarget and maybe we would have to hit it in spite of what may happenin the meantime. It seems to me that the stronger argument is that ifwe leave it at 3-1/2 percent, the market will anticipate that we'regoing to be pumping up the money supply pretty rapidly between now andthe end of the year to get to that figure. So, I'd like to see uslower that range to 3 percent on the down side.Next year, I do think there's likely to be a wide swing,particularly in M-1B. My anticipation is that the economy likely will-45-7/6-7/81remain somewhat sluggish in the first half. But if we do have somesuccess in getting inflation down and that tax cut hits on July 1, thesecond half of the year could be pretty strong and I think we arelikely to get some rather wide swings [in monetary growth]. I wouldopt for alternative III, which would mean a further lowering of thetarget range for M-1B on the bottom side but retaining the 3-pointrange", " I'm very much afraid--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're also saying you'd leave itunchanged in '82", "MS. TEETERS. May I remind you that we shouldn't take toomuch credit for the price easing. I never thought we were totally atfault for the price increases that we suffered from OPEC and food; andI don't think the fact that OPEC and food have calmed down has a greatdeal to do with monetary policy per se, except in the very long run.As a result, I think we ought to be very careful about what we do interms of interest rates. Nobody yet has mentioned housing; nobody hasmentioned the Chrysler problem; nobody has mentioned all the companies-46-7/6-7/81that have had their credit ratings downgraded; nobody has mentionedthe possibility that the thrifts are going to go [under] if we keepinterest rates up. I get the impression that we're really tearing atthe fabric of the financial world and the economy. If we persist inhaving very high interest rates over very long periods of time, we'regoing to cause a disaster in this country. It may not be next monthand it may not be next quarter, but it's going to be a severe problemand it's going to come down on our shoulders for having pushed theeconomy over the edge.I happen to agree with Tony Solomon on the short run becauseif we aim for the 3-1/2 percent lower end of the M-1B range for thisyear, then we have no place to go next year. We can put our ranges atany place up to 5 percent, but if growth were to come in [at or] above3-1/2 percent, we're going to be in a position of increasing the rateof growth of the money supply and not decreasing it. So, I think it'sfoolish to try to come in at that lower end. I think we're going tocome in at the lower end and I think we're going to come in at thehigher end on M2, which we've known since the staff was telling usthat in February. However, the markets are totally aware of ourproblems with M1-A and M-1B and M2. If you read the most recent DRIreport it describes exactly what our problems are in getting thesethings to come together. Therefore, I don't think we have anycredibility problem in explaining the difference between M-1B at thelower end of the range and M2 at the upper end of the range. Thatleads me to the decision that I don't think we should change theranges. We should stick with the M-1 B range of 3-1/2 to 6 percent.We ought to have good conversations and a good flow of informationback and forth between ourselves, the market, and increasingly withthe Congress, and we can explain what is happening. We don't have tochange the ranges to do that. I don't think we should go foralternative II; it's too strict. If people look at the first half ofthis year, everybody is aware that we're way under on the M-1B growthrate. Even if we don't achieve our current range the second half ofthe year, they will be understanding of it. And we can talk about it.When we come to next year, if we aim for a higher rate ofgrowth in money and presumably some easing in interest rates, which Ithink is appropriate at this point in time, then my preference is withLyle; I don't see any reason to tighten up. Nominal GNP next year isgoing to be a great deal larger than it is this year. Why reduce themoney supply and almost assure ourselves that we're going to maintainhigh interest rates for this long a period of time. It seems to methat we don't have to adopt any of these strategies. We could stickalmost exactly with the numbers that we have this year and, in effect,that represents a fairly tight monetary policy. So, I come downsomewhere between alternatives 1 and 2 on page 8 and for retaining the1981 targets for 1982, particularly since we are setting preliminarytargets for 1982. In the past we've trapped ourselves by setting[new] targets in July and reaffirming them in February. With all theuncertainties that we have, it seems to me we'd be better off to stayput now and, if necessary, change them in February but not commitourselves to a lowering of the targets this far in advance of actualeconomic developments", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me just make one point as afootnote. I think you are correct in worrying about [high] interestrates and what that might do to the financial fabric. The question ofstrategy is whether we take that risk in the short run or exacerbatethat risk by being too easy in some sense in the short run and havinghigh interest rates longer. I think that's the issue before us", "MS. TEETERS. It has been over the past 2-1/2 years that I'vebeen here, and all we do is end up with high interest rates", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you could argue we haven't beentight enough", "MR. WALLICH. That's a tighter fit for M2 than is proposed byany of the alternatives I through III on page 14, isn't it", "MR. BOEHNE. I think we're positioned really rather well withrespect to our '81 targets. Looking forward from last February, Ididn't expect that we'd be as well off as we are now, and I think weought to accept the good fortune that we have. So, I wouldn't tinkerwith the '81 targets. To be at the bottom end with respect to M-1Band at the upper end with respect to M2 is about as good as we canhope for. In fact, I'd be very happy if we ended the year in roughlythat position. So, I would leave those targets unchanged. I amconcerned somewhat by the shortfall that we are getting in M-1B.We've now had [minus] 5 percent in May and [minus] 10 percent in June.We do have a forecast of growth in July and I think there's anunderlying feeling that the risks are for too much growth in thesecond half of the year. But I have seen this pattern develop before,so I have no problem in beginning to resist this shortfall some, whichI think is consistent with the idea of moving between now and year-endtoward the lower end of the M-1B range. It doesn't do us any good inthe market to run double-digit shortfalls because what comes from thatis the expectation that we can't tolerate that for very long and we're-50-7/6-7/81going to have to resist it. So, I think some resistance to that isappropriate.As far as 1982 goes, I think we ought to keep the ranges forthe broader aggregates about the same as those we now have for 1981and I am torn between whether we should lower the M-1B range by a halfor a whole point. I could live with either. If we lowered it by awhole point, we'd be getting a little more consistency between thenarrower and the broader aggregates. But the important thing is thatwe lower the M-1B range; whether we lower it a half point or a wholepoint I'm not sure is significant. We are going through a period ofmaximum danger with regard to the inflation problem and the potentialdanger to structure as well as a possible recession over the next 12months. However, I'd rather be running that gauntlet over the next 12months than the 12 months after that or the 12 months after thatbecause we have begun to make some progress down the anti-inflationroad and the costs and the amount of that risk will be less over thenext 12 months than in the subsequent 12-month periods. From thestrategic point of view, we have to try to keep this anti-inflationarymomentum, of which monetary policy is a part, going over this year andnext year", "MR. MORRIS. --if we could get away with cutting the rangefor M-1B by 1/2 of one percentage point next year and with keeping theother ranges where they were, I think that would be an excellentoutcome. If we can't, then I would be willing to cut the whole batchby 1/2 percentage point. And I would support Steve's suggestion thatif we're going to have an M-1B target, we have solely a shift-adjustedtarget. Having two targets for M-1B is also a source of confusion", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'd like to make a parentheticalcomment that may be of some use. I encountered enormous resentment inEurope among government officials and central bank officials about ourcontinuing to publish the weekly money supply statistics. Maybe theirreaction is much too excessive, but they believe that we unnecessarilyencourage extra volatility above and beyond what our October '79approach involved by our continuation of the weekly publications. Ijust pass that along for what it's worth", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're going to have to consider that oneof these days. I take it that the predominant comment from marketpeople, as you would expect, is that they want us to continue it.There are some comments in the other direction, however; but all themarket people argue that the more information they get the better", " If wewanted to take that evidence from this Michigan survey, that's--MR. GUFFEY. Well, I think we ought to leave it right whereit is. That story can be told from the picture that will unfold in1981, and I think it leaves open the lines of communication even withthe monetarists. For 1982, from the alternatives on page 14, I likelowering the range of M-1B coupled with broadening the range to 3percentage points, so 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent has some attractivenessto me. But I'd also retain the present ranges for M2, M3, and bankcredit. I'm not sure what those all mean. For M2 at least I'd retainthe present range, the 6 to 9 percent. As to the short run and whatwe do in the next month, as I understand the procedure, we're notgoing to talk about that right now. So I'll stop. I do have somecomments to make about that, however", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I think the sense of it is clearenough, but just as a semantic matter I think we're minimizing whatinevitable risks there are by doing that. There are risks with any ofthese alternatives", "MR. BOEHNE. I think it comes down to how one weighs therisks of growth in the aggregates in the second half of this year thatis too rapid and a repeat of what happened last year versus acumulative shortfall in the aggregates. We've seen the possiblebeginnings of [a cumulative shortfall] in June and July and I do givesome weight to that possibility. I would come out somewhere between\"B\" and \"C\" on page 15, preferring to err more in the direction of \"C\"than \"B,\" but somewhere in that \"B\" to \"C\" area", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman I would support alterative B.I like the idea of having a plan to hit the lower level of the rangeor to get close to it by November. I don't think I would want topublish that objective in the report we put out or, in other words,commit ourselves to being on that particular course, given thevolatility of these numbers", "MR. MORRIS. Oh, yes. But I'd just not say that these aredesigned to get us to the lower end of the range by November. Since Ithink the third quarter is going to be weaker than the staff isprojecting, this can probably be accomplished without as much interestrate pressure as in the forecast, so I would support a funds range of14 to 20 percent rather than the 16 to 22 percent shown", "MR. WALLICH. I share the view that we have to avoid arepetition of '80 but we also have to avoid a repetition of '79. Itwould be the third year if that happened. I don't think M-1B byitself is all that important, but the appearance that it is risingrapidly would be very damaging. I think we ought to stress that moreweight is being attached to M2 and, in that context, I would say M2growth at 8 percent seems desirable with M-1B at 7 percent, let's say,and the funds rate range at 17 to 22 or 23 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do we have a consensus on that", "MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, I'm in the area of \"C\" partlybecause I think we don't want to repeat 1980 but also because I havean eye on where we're going to start off 1982. Steve said that thequarterly average number toward the end of the year with \"B\" gets usup in the 8-1/2 percent area and that to me is troublesome. I getmore and more attracted to \"C\" with the advantage of Mr. Solomon's-64-7/6-7/81comment to the effect that, at least as they view the world, we couldget [the growth rates of] \"C\" with a funds rate of 15 to 20 or 21percent--either one would be all right with me--and an initialborrowings level of $1-1/2 billion", "MR. SCHULTZ. I think the economy is going to be a littleweaker in the third quarter and to me that's a consummation devoutlyto be wished for. I would not move too rapidly to offset a littleeconomic weakness; and under those circumstance I think alternative Cis as fast as we ought to go, not as slow as we ought to go. So, Iwould favor alternative C for M-1B and M2 and I would start theborrowings at $1.5 billion and put the fed funds range at 15 to 21percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The scary thing is the psychologicalpressure on us [depending on] where we end [in any] fourth quarter.If we're seriously overshooting or undershooting, we're going to makethree times the effort--or at least we're going to be under that kindof pressure psychologically--to make a much bigger response than isgood for the economy, simply because it happens arbitrarily to be thefourth quarter and people will be judging us on the fourth quarter", "MR. PARTEE. We'll have to decide on the fourth quarter alittle later. But, you know, it's a long time to the fourth quarter.We may well have a double-digit plus or a double-digit minus betweennow and then so we will be talking in an entirely different arena whenwe get to discussing the fourth-quarter average, which I wouldn't wantto see go up as fast as that 8.2 percent or whatever Steve has onthat. I also disagree with Lyle that we should not pay any attentionto shortfalls below the number because I can't tell whether there's ademand shift or not. That is, when we're experiencing it, it can beeither a demand shift or it can be a weakening in the economy; and themoney supply numbers can very well predate the weakening in theeconomy somewhat so that we're not all that aware of it. But we'renot talking about a very strong economy when the auto companies reportan annual sales rate of 5.4 million and wonder whether they cansurvive to the end of the year. That's not a strong economy. It'salso obvious in housing that we're not talking about a strong economy.Builders are going out of business every day. So, I don't want totake a lot of risk of a cumulative shortfall. Remember, if we put Mayand June together we have as much of a drop as the April drop lastyear, which really galvanized us, perhaps improperly, into action.So, I think we shouldn't accept a substantial shortfall from thenumbers that would be occasioned by alternative 2. I guess the fundsrange could be 15 to 21 percent. Interestingly, I had greatdifficulty finding what the funds rate range had been over the last-67-7/6-7/81period when I read the Bluebook; it wasn't in the usual place. We'vedeemphasized it to the point that we don't even report it now.Assuming it was 16 to 22 percent, which is in the crossed out sectionof the directive, 15 to 21 percent seems all right. I wouldn't wantto see the borrowing target above $1.4 billion, which as I understandit is where we are currently in this period. I don't think we oughtto raise the borrowing target above what it now is", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I favor alternative B. Itseems to me that if we pursue alternative C, we run a substantial riskof not getting M-1B back even to the lower part of the target range.We just may not get back to the range. Alternative B gets us back tothe range by November and we're still on the low side, so alternativeB makes more sense to me. And I would go with a federal funds rangeof 16 to 22 percent and borrowing at $2 billion", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You may be right. These are adjustedfigures, certainly; and if we continue to get some growth in NOWaccounts, the unadjusted figure will be still higher. It's a pointworth making. I'm not so sure that we're going to get much growth inNOW accounts from now on. In the last couple of months we haven'tgotten much, but nobody knows, obviously. It may be that thesefigures are coming together. But the chances are you're right", "MR. BLACK. If we go with \"C,\" we need to lower the bottom ofthe M-1B range", "MR. ROOS. Yes", " Obviously,we're between--MR. GRAMLEY. Let me ask for a staff interpretation of theconsistency of a borrowing number of $1-1/2 billion with a midpoint of19 percent on the funds range. I thought when we last talked about afunds rate in the 19 to 20 percent area we were talking aboutborrowings of about $2-1/4 billion. I think we're talking aboutnumbers here that are just inconsistent with one another", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We would argue somewhat differently.We believe that borrowing of $1-1/2 billion implies a fed funds rateof 17 to 18 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Are you still using a rough rule ofthumb, Steve, that a $100 million difference in borrowing represents1/2 of a point", "MR. CORRIGAN. A question to Paul Meek: Do the market peopleperceive that the 18 percent surcharge rate is a de facto [floor] onthe federal funds rate. It shouldn't be, but is that the perception", "MR. AXILROD. If you put it in the directive along with thegrowth rate for June to September, I think it would have diminishedimportance. It would just call to the market's attention that this isnot such a high growth rate month-by-month. If you put it in withoutthe growth rates month-by-month, unless we understood what it is theCommittee intended for the growth rates month-by-month, there would besome difficulty in targeting. That is, if July came in very strong,the quarterly average would really depend on the projections forAugust and September. So, if that average were the sole target, wewould be back in the arena of simply making the money marketconditions depend to a great extent on how the staff happened to seethe projections, right or wrong, in the months and weeks ahead.Whereas if we had some idea of the implicit monthly targets that theCommittee preferred, then we would not be so dependent on projections", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You raise some question in my mind aboutwhat kind of quarterly pattern you have in mind", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The staff says no. Or, what is coming outof the machine says that we have to have a higher borrowing level.But I don't know. A lot of skepticism was expressed around the tableabout whether in fact we do need a borrowing number that high.Balancing my general feeling about where the major risks lie, giventhe shortfalls that we have had, I don't want to run an undue risk ofa further shortfall. Borrowing of $2 billion would produce, at leastI would think, a 20 percent federal funds rate around this time. I'mnot sure we want to be that tight; and 20 percent is what the staffsays that $2 billion would produce", "MR. CORRIGAN. Does that mean that M2 is within its range forthe year", "MR. CORRIGAN. The implication is that it has some relevancefor whether or when we change the nonborrowed path", "MR. GRAMLEY. I don't", "MR. BOEHNE. Is there some way to build in that a littleweight would be given to weakness in M-1B. It's all loaded the otherway", "MR. BOEHNE. Well, as I recall, for June we started out withan estimate of plus 5 percent and ended up in the negative at minus 10percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure exactly either, because wehave 19 different permutations and combinations. I didn't go quite asfar as what you said. I said that if M1 were coming in weak, we wouldjust let the natural result come in on the borrowings. I haven'tfaced explicitly what we would do if M1 is in fact [weak] and M2 isabove 9 percent. I suppose at some point if M2 got strong enough--there's some shady area there--we would have to reduce the nonborrowedreserve path", " Obviously, there are lots of circumstancesin which we'd have enough of a conflict that we would have aconsultation, but the clear implication is that we would let M-1B getweaker than 7 percent if M2 is running strong in the short runpending--MR. GRAMLEY. One thing that I think would [address] theconcerns of a number of people is [to agree that it] would be a signalfor a consultation also if we were to see some significant weakness inincoming economic statistics and at the same time a weak M-1B number", " But if the economy weakened, even thoughinterest rates were coming down, in fact there would be some forcepushing M2 up, but at the same time M-1B is likely to be---78-7/6-7/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can't handle every possible contingencyhere. The ultimate answer has to be we would have a consultation ifthings go askew enough", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, would you want toconsider that we would have an understanding on this M2 caveat but notinclude it in the published directive", "MR. SCHULTZ. That's what I argued for before, Henry; I ranthat up the flag pole and there were some who didn't salute", "MR. FORD. Paul, you read us just a small part of thesuggested language; I take it there's a lot more on both sides of itthat doesn't leave the impression, as that one paragraph does, thatthis whole decision--even though it's the most conservative choice--sounds expansive", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's about what a lot of people aresuggesting, but I would cast my vote on widening the M1 range a bit.You might want to say a word about M3, Steve. You told me you havethe feeling that it may be a little high here or that it could becomfortably lowered", " I don't know whether we want to do that or not,given the--MR. AXILROD. Well, just to be clear on these ranges, we hadcentered them in alternatives I, II, and III on our projections of themidpoints [of the associated M1 ranges]. The alternative III range,therefore, has a midpoint of 8 percent [for M3 and for alternative Iit's] 8-1/2 percent. And with the Committee willing to say thatgrowth in the broader aggregates could be in the upper ends of theranges, it would not be too difficult to lower the 6-1/2 to 9-1/2percent range to 6 to 9 percent because we're not projecting growthabove that [upper limit]; our midpoint is not above or even very nearthat 9 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm saying 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent but3-1/2 to 6 percent is the present range. Well I don't know if it is;it's 3-1/2 to 6 percent or 6 to 8-1/2 percent, depending upon whichway you look at it", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, don't you think the process of innovationis going to continue, though, to some degree", "MR. SCHULTZ. But the other side of it is that we wouldcertainly, we hope, get substantially less nominal GNP next year thanthis year", " Yes, but we have a--MR. SCHULTZ. Yes, but listen: When you talk to[Administration officials] in private they are very clear about thefact that they really don't believe in these numbers that they arepublishing here at midyear. They say it quite directly. They havesaid it to me", " So,we'll have to say we are inconsistent with that assumption if we--MR. PARTEE. Yes, they [assume] rising velocity, too. Well,maybe it will go up", "MR. BALLES. I have a question on that Mr. Chairman.Obviously we're making some provisional statements on the 1982 ranges,but at what point in time do you foresee our moving to the actual M-1Bas compared to the shift adjusted", " Well, I am hoping--MR. BALLES. I can see us going on forever and ever ignoringwhat the actual is", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we've run out of speed on thisalready. It has exceeded my tolerance for having any faith in theadjustment now", "MR. ROOS. If that's the case and if these next six monthsare critical and we will have another opportunity to change what we'regoing to do for '82 next February, in order to reassure the marketsand to be consistent, why don't we say this time that we're going toreduce the numbers on M1 by 1 percentage point at both ends. And ifat the end of the year the picture is different, we can still make anadjustment next February with less problem, in my opinion, than we'dhave if we come out with testimony on July 22nd that we're really notgoing to continue our 1 percentage point reduction each year. I thinkthis is an important time to state once again what we're doing", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's horrendous. One would have toassume an increase in velocity of circulation of something on theorder of twice--or 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 times--the normal secular increasein velocity of circulation. That is too heroic an assumption to make,Larry. The fact that we've come in comfortably so far is strictly dueto this rather fluky situation. If the staff is right and we don'tsee that, and we just have the normal situation continue for the restof the year, if I'm understanding this right, we would still come inat about what--5 + 3, Steve. Is 5 the increase for the first half", "MR. WALLICH. We seem to assume that growth in velocity is aspecial event due to definable changes in technology. But if peopleare circumventing the need for transactions balances right and left byusing money market funds and overnight arrangements and so forth, thenreally all that is happening is that M-1B is becoming a smaller partof the transactions balances. And its velocity isn't really ameaningful figure; it's just a statistical number relating M-1B toGNP. But it doesn't exert any constraint. That is what I fear may behappening, although one can't be very sure. But that makes a rise invelocity more probable than thinking of it in terms of a specialinnovation", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The fact is we don't know. We're allgiving grist to Mr. Morris's mill", "MR. GRAMLEY. But you could also argue that M-1B doesn't makeany difference. Whether our money supply comes in at 2 or 3percentage points above what is otherwise stated, what difference doesit make if we have more money or more velocity. It all accomplishesthe same objective", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I think you know that I have less andless confidence in M-1B; I give less and less weight to it", "MS. TEETERS. There are two other problems here, though.It's going to be impossible for us to raise the number. Suppose weget a repeat of last year and get a sudden expansion in the moneysupply over the fall; we will end up with a high base. Then we willface the problem we faced at the end of last year as to whether we caneven meet the targets that we set for ourselves in July. And if welower them too much--by a whole percentage point, say, or even if welower them at all at this point--and then in February we really needto raise them 1/2 percentage point, we're not going to be able to doit. A second consideration here is that if we get the ranges too low,we will never be able to get within them and we'll lose credibilitybecause we can't achieve our targets. We have to balance whetherwe're going to achieve the targets as well as whether we're ever goingto have the opportunity to raise them, which I don't think we are", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

There's awhole range of numbers we can put down--different higher limits,different lower limits, whatever", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The other side is: If we lower it, wehave a target that is more attainable on the low side, consistent withthe decision we made earlier. It's less frightening on the up side.It comes down, in part, to how convinced one is that if we saw asudden radical move in the other direction so that the upper side isthreatened, we'd be prepared to pull out even more stops than weotherwise would, given that we went out of our way now to lower it", "MR. SCHULTZ. Some get rained out", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. At this stage, I think yes. It's clearthat for 1981 there isn't going to be any change", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

We've had carsales continuing very low. We had a pretty good increase ininventories in May and the inventory/sales ratio is rising.Industrial production is down; it now looks as though we're going tohave a decline in industrial production in the third quarter ratherthan an increase.

Itseems to me that most analysts would say that the dollar is way toohigh. And it has been bid up there by speculation in these markets.Therefore, why not get the adjustment over with and have a free fall.Wouldn't it be better perhaps to get the rate down to a more crediblelevel quickly rather than very gradually. That's why I raised thequestion", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, it would have been better. Itcan keep American industry more consistently export oriented if wedon't have such enormous swings, but that requires leaning against thewind. And if we're not going to lean against the wind and we have[the dollar at] these high levels, when a decline comes, it may bebetter from a purely export competitive point of view if it comes in amonth rather than over six months. On the other hand, [a sharp move]is very demoralizing to financial flows and financial markets andpolitically as well, because it doesn't look as if there's muchcooperation left in the system. I think there are tradeoffs on that,Chuck. There are a lot of people who will feel that a rapidlyplunging dollar shows mismanagement by the Administration, and to somedegree by the Federal Reserve, and is an indication that things arenot right in the United States. There is that view", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I raise the question: Why do we have toincrease that limit. I understand the German mark limit, but withthat much leeway in the total, one doesn't follow the other, does it", "MR. GRAMLEY. Governor Wallich, I'm not sure at all that oneought to accept the view that a looser relationship between the fedfunds rate and other rates of interest is desirable. If one couldargue that what we're trying to do in the short run is make reservedemand and reserve supply come into balance and one can do that withthe federal funds rate alone, then I would perceive the wisdom of yourargument. But I doubt that that's the case, because very-6-8/18/81fundamentally the demand for reserves depends on the demand fordeposits. And the demand for deposits will depend on a whole spectrumof short-term interest rates other than just the federal funds rate.So, I'm a little concerned about our ability to get where we want togo, not just in the longer term but even in the shorter run, in regardto control of the monetary aggregates if the relationship gets tooloose", "MR. BLACK. This is just the way you treated FirstPennsylvania", "MS. TEETERS. So moved.SPEAKER(.). Seconded", "MR. AXILROD. Yes, but what I had much more in mind weremoney market funds and overnight RPs; all those sorts of things dohave a transactions account element. One can run a zero balancedemand deposit through these other items. One might even run itthrough things other than what we're measuring. That's one of theproblems. It's very difficult, of course, to distinguish theinvestment element of those very short-term [instruments] from thetransactions element, but they have both", "MR. SCHULTZ. I would tend to argue the other way, Larry,that if we were to target very precisely on just one aggregate, itwould put us even more in a box. The object of trying to target onany aggregate is that it's a proxy for GNP. But the problem isclearly that those relationships are not very tight any more; they aregetting looser and looser. It seems to me that the events that aretaking place argue for looking at a broader range of aggregates andfor having wider target ranges for the aggregates that we look at.Now, that may give us some difficulty in terms of the precision ofmonetary control on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis, but it seemsto me that we'd get into a bigger box if we tried to target on anysingle aggregate and tried to be very precise about it because theserelationships are changing. We could easily get into a situation suchas the British got themselves into by targeting on sterling M3;suddenly they were just way outside of the target ranges and they hadvery serious problems. I, for one, would argue for looking at moreaggregates with broader ranges than for looking at a single aggregateor a very narrow range", "-11-8/18/81MR. ROOS. What bothers me--and I may see it totallyincorrectly--is that a couple of our targets seem somewhatincompatible, just as years ago our interest rate targets werefrequently incompatible with the aggregates targets. One can't steerwith two compasses if those compasses aren't reconcilable", "MR. AXILROD. I should add, Governor Gramley, that this againassumes that the Committee wouldn't be rigid in relation to M2. Butif the Committee made M2 the predominant target, let's say, we're notcertain that we could hit even the low end of the M-1B range. Andunder that assumption, I think interest rates would be higher in theshort run and nominal GNP lower in the long run", "MR. AXILROD. Without going into any detail, PresidentBalles, I think developments in the institutional structure of thedepository system in the country are such as to make that almostimpossible at the moment. I don't want to sound pessimistic, but it'salmost impossible because we don't have a way of separating outtransactions accounts from other accounts. For example, if we forbadeanything to be issued anywhere that was under 14 days in maturity,then we might begin to separate out transactions accounts from otheraccounts. If it was under 14 days, it would be a demand deposit andhave a reserve requirement--to give an extreme example of how we couldmake a separation. But the way things are going now, it's verydifficult to make the separation. We don't even have reserverequirements on money market funds transactions use; that would giveus some automatic separation. But now if money starts flowing out ofmoney market funds, I wouldn't be tempted to think that was demanddeposits flowing out; I would be more tempted to think it wasinvestment money going out. But I wouldn't know. So, we just don'thave any basis for doing that", " I forgetwhether that is an annual rate or the actual--MR. AXILROD. An annual rate for the first half of the year", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But that made no allowance at all for thedegree to which the holding of a money market fund enabled people toeconomize on a transactions account merely by the fact that they heldthe money fund and had that reserve available for instantaneoustransfer. So, undoubtedly, it's an underestimate in terms of itssubstitution effect for transactions balances. That was an arbitrarything which gave us a general order of magnitude perhaps. But wenever get at that second kind of influence. What is a transactionsbalance. I don't know; one can't define it that clearly. But thisdirect substitution effect is even harder to get at than the directtransfer effect, so to speak. So what do we know. It was enough sothat it brought M-1B roughly to the lower end of the target in thefirst half; that just allowed for the increase in money market fundsfrom December through June or the 6-month period in the first half ofthe year. I don't know whether it's quarterly or monthly at thispoint. We can make estimates of that sort, but what confidence do wehave in them and what does it tell us in the end. We have a figurethat's increasingly an artificial construct to start with, even whenwe just take the numbers; and then we begin making these adjustments.The adjustment for NOW account transfers is becoming increasinglyproblematical. I think it was appropriate during the initial stage ofbig transfers; it gave us a much better feel for what was going on.But after six months these transfers have diminished substantially,and I don't know what it means anymore to make this adjustment becauseI'm sure we're now getting transfers out of NOW accounts into moneymarket funds or something as well as transfers in", "MR. BLACK. That's what our small bankers think is happening.At every one of our board meetings the two small bankers say peopleare fooling themselves if they think it's coming partly out ofsavings; it's all out of demand. Of course, that's based on their ownexperience and nothing else", "MS. TEETERS. I realize that. On the other hand, it alsogets us out of having to judge between what we're going to target on.But, with all due respect, may I point out that in February the [long-run] targets for M-1B and M2 were not consistent and they've becomeeven more inconsistent. Relative to the midpoint of M-1B, [theCommittee] put the M2 midpoint too low. It's not at all surprisingthat one is at the bottom and one is at the top. It's just that theyare more at the bottom and more at the top than we anticipated theywere going to be", " Idon't know how in the world we make--MR. GRAMLEY. I bet our staff's estimates of total creditflows for the last half of this year as a proportion of GNP arenowhere near the peaks that we have seen in past years. Isn't thatright. These numbers look big because we have a huge deficit in the-19-8/18/81federal budget. And one of the major reasons, though not the onlyreason, we have a huge deficit in the federal budget is because theeconomy has been very sluggish and revenue growth has been slow. Ican recall the same sort of argumentation going on in the first partof 1975 when people said it was impossible to bring interest ratesdown because the federal deficit was so big. The federal deficit isnot the only factor that affects the interest rate. It's one of them.But a major reason why interest rates are high is because we have hada monetary policy that has been very, very tight in the context of aneconomy that has been relatively strong", "MR. PARTEE. The funds raised by nonfinancial sectors in thethird quarter are estimated at 12 percent of GNP. That was 15-1/2percent in the fourth quarter of last year and it was 18 percent in1979; it's really quite a low number", "MR. SCHULTZ. But, Governor Gramley, would you not agree thenthat if the Fed were to be seen as pumping out reserves at a rapidrate, it would have a severe expectational impact and would, in fact,put upward pressure on interest rates", "MR. GRAMLEY. I don't agree with that. What I believe hashappened in the past that has led people to that thought is that whenwe've had very, very large increases in the stock of money, it hasprimarily come from the demand side. And the markets have reckonedwith the fact that they know we are going to lean hard against thatand, therefore, that interest rates will begin to move up", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're next on the list, so you ought tomake up your mind right now", "MR. KEEHN. To add a very negative note, but certainly oneyou've heard with some consistency from the Middle West, our basicindustries continue to be very, very hard hit and are reallydeteriorating further. I'll just comment on a few. On the automotive-24-8/18/81side, which we've talked about at some length, I think any improvementthat has occurred in auto sales really is a result of rebates. I'mtold that the rebate structures that now exist and will be put inplace in the near future cannot be afforded by the industry but theysimply have to use them. On the capital goods side, machine tools arevery, very soft; farm equipment is down again, of course;construction equipment is grim and I'm told that among some of thesmaller companies in that industry bankruptcies are coming becauseenough has taken place that nothing can really turn them [around].Railroad equipment [manufacturing] isn't just slow, it has all butstopped. It's an industry that is in really deep trouble. On theagricultural side, though production is up, which ought to bode wellfor prices, interest rates are having a negative impact on the cost ofcarry for that industry as well. Net, with regard to the Middle West,there's a growing fragility, if you will, in the system. At somepoint I think we are going to see some bankruptcies erupt across someof the industries that are the most troubled, and the fabric will betorn in such a way that it's very possible we will not get the kind ofrecovery that we need for good sustained growth. So, the word fromthe Middle West is really one of a very somber outlook", "MR. KEEHN. If you're asking about the credit, they have notcompleted the renegotiation of credit. Some banks are giving them avery difficult time on it", "MR. KEEHN. I can give you an anecdote: I just bought ahouse and there has been no decline in the prices. Seriously, I thinkthe rate of increase is clearly being tempered. Sales of houses,particularly in the middle price sector, are very, very slow and theprices are beginning to come down", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I've been a little puzzled by thesevarious statistics showing more strength than I [anticipated]. Itseems to me that both consumer and business pessimism is at a fairlyhigh level right now. I know it was particularly marked at ourdirectors meeting this last time; almost everybody there waspessimistic for some reason or other. And there was a very sombernote in the Redbook this time. Also, the point that Si just madeabout bankruptcies is part of the tip of the iceberg; there may besome repercussions when some of these begin to appear, as theyinevitably have to, with the small business situation and the highrates that people are paying. So, my guess is that the apparentstrength in employment and sales in July may be temporary. We've hada pretty sharp deceleration in the aggregates, and real interest ratesare pretty darn high, so I would expect the economy to weaken somewhatfurther in the third quarter. I think the staff's forecast of anessentially flat economy in the third quarter is about the best thatwe could expect and my guess is that it will be a little weaker thanthat. But looking at it out a little further, I think we might get alittle more rebound than they are projecting, too, particularly ifinflation continues to moderate. If this sluggishness in economicactivity that I think might happen does materialize, there ought to besome downward pressure on interest rates and that ought to help. Andif we can get any significant move toward deregulation, that's afurther factor. So, I guess I'm pessimistic in the short run butmaybe a little more optimistic in the long run than [the staff]", "MR. PARTEE. Do you suppose things are ever bad in Aspen", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Growth of 7 percent, which is much biggerthan what it has been running. I don't know whether that will attractmuch attention or not. While we've been getting easier in thatquantitative sense, interest rates haven't reflected it. I take itthey're up again today. I guess there's a lesson in that: That weliterally don't know how to affect interest rates these days. Wedon't know all the things at least in the market that are affectinginterest rates. We don't know how that interacts with our policy to-29-8/18/81get any very reliable change in interest rates, assuming we want that.There certainly is an enormous desire on the part of the country tohave lower interest rates at this point. That pressure is buildingand it's going to build further. I'm sure the Congressmen are gettingan earful as they go around the country during their recess--unlessthey're all at Aspen, and I didn't see any there. And that backgroundis going to become more difficult.Looking at this problem, which is reflected I suppose in theprojections of the staff, right or wrong--and not many people havesaid they can make a better forecast this month, in contrast to lastmonth when everybody seemed to be more optimistic and saw interestrates down--it seems to me that this is not a period we're going to beout of in a hurry, if you take that as a benchmark. The staff isprojecting that with policies of anything like what we have thecurrent interest rate structure is going to continue indefinitelywithout killing the economy in any sense; [in the forecast] theeconomy stumbles along anyway at a level course, gradually building upif we go out enough quarters. It's not a very happy picture for us tobe in, looking ahead. Given that we are in the early stages, if I canput it that way, of any success in the anti-inflationary effort--giventhat kind of outlook and given the demonstrated apparent resilience ofthe economy in the face of very high interest rates despite thedistortions in the economy and the very different impacts on differentsectors--it seems to me that there is still a considerable danger, andmaybe an overriding danger, of underkill rather than overkill. [Ithink that's true] whether one looks at it in short-term economicterms or in terms of the longer-range problem we foresee over the nextyear, 18 months, or two years, with the fiscal stimulus that's comingalong and has been remarked upon here, the big government deficits,and the demonstrated resilience of the economy. It would be lovely tosteer those interest rates down if we knew how to steer them, which Idon't think we do. But if we did, what are the risks that in a fewmonths we will [witness] another rebound in the economy and HenryKaufman's [unintelligible] scenario will come true. Then we will bein an even more difficult period, losing time at the very least in thefundamental fight on inflation; and we will [face] a more awkwardmarket and I suppose a [worse] political situation not very manymonths down the road, with higher interest rates, more concern aboutfinancial institutions, bankruptcies, the outlook for the economy, andall the rest.When I add this together [I come out] with a posture that isnot overriding but is convenient at the least, and makes some sense atthe best. We are in a mid-quarter meeting; we set some objectivesafter some careful consideration at the beginning of the quarter andI'd say that unless there's a pretty strong reason for changing, let'sstay where we are in terms of the directive. Where we are in terms ofthe directive is not bad. If these recent M1 figures hold up--whilethey look big in the short run and that has some unfortunaterepercussions and shows the other side of our dilemma--it brings us atthe moment anyway about on track in terms of the M1 figures that weset forth in the directive last month, taking July and Augusttogether. The M2 figure was slightly lower in July than wasconsistent with the directive. It didn't bring any pressure on us totighten up. There is a fear and a concern, which is understandable,that the M2 figure will bulge at least in August because of somefigures we have for the first week or so in August. And with M1 going-30-8/18/81up more rapidly, that also tends to support M2. So there is somedanger, if danger is the right word, of overshooting in the narrowersense on M2 in August anyway. Part of that, but a fairly small partdepending upon how big the overshoot is, can simply be looked at asmaking up for a slightly low figure in July. So, while we are moreuncomfortable on M2, the discomfiture is not yet at least at an acutestage. And I have some question as to whether fine-tuning at a mid-quarter meeting--to do too much tinkering on the basis of short-termexpectations about M2--is worth it.In terms of the expectational and imagery question, we haveto maintain the policy course. We have not yet had whatever publicimpact there will be, if any, of the apparent raising of the M1target, depending upon how one interprets it. It obviously hasn'tbeen raised in the broader sense of the target for the year; indeed,it has been lowered by one interpretation. Regardless of that, Idon't know how people will interpret both a higher rate of increase inthe directive and a higher rate of increase that seems to be in storefor August nor what that's going to do to expectations. But Iwouldn't want to press our luck, if indeed we have luck on that score,of not being interpreted as having overtly eased policy by takinganother step now that for two months in a row would seem to push in anexpansionary direction, when nothing much has happened during thismonth to suggest that that's appropriate other than that people aresick and tired of high interest rates, which I well understand. Butthe business news, in fact, in this past month has been better thananything that was expected when we last met. I think almost everybusiness figure has been better than one would have anticipated atthat time. So, I would suggest to you that the most prudent course ofaction at this particular meeting is just to write a directive whichcontinues the wording we had the last time and in effect says theCommittee continues to seek what we sought a meeting ago, which isequivalent roughly to alternative A, the more liberal alternativegiven in the Bluebook", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Yes.] At this stage I have not discussedquestions of tactics and interpretation in a fine way, regarding justwhat we would do if one of these figures goes off. We've already hadsome discussion at this meeting, which the record will make clear,that we are aware that M2 may be distorted by these all savercertificates and the other kind of saver certificates. The differencebetween the all saver certificate and the small saver certificate is\"SM\" and I think this whole thing is somewhat of a sadomasochisticoperation, so maybe that's appropriate", " I don't think itmeans anything at all, but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends, I suppose, how much this earlyAugust growth is affected by these small saver certificates. I don'tknow whether [the staff] projection for August is right", " They had abig jump in these small saver certificates; whether that's a one-weekphenomenon or whether it will continue--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Anyway, what you are saying I gatheris this: That if we got this kind of growth in August and we arerunning, say, 9-1/2 or 9-3/4 percent on M2, you wouldn't see any needto call for a consultation and a change in the signals. But if M2started exceeding what--10 percent--you would. What is your thinkinghere", " And if we are wrong about rates--MR. PARTEE. That's the trouble. I think it's an automaticinstruction to the Manager. You could intervene and say we betterhave a conference. But it is an instruction. The Manager is toprovide nonborrowed reserves below the path he otherwise would if M2is at the point where the proviso takes hold", " That's why I think it would be better to talkabout why M2 is high rather than to automatically--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, as I say, I think that requires someinterpretation, which we would reflect in the discussion at the least.But there's nothing that's going to affect M2 that we didn't knowabout last month when we put this [proviso] in the directive", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think this is the problem Larry:There's nothing we can tell people that is going to convince thembecause everybody will have different interpretations. I can assertthat [we haven't eased] but somebody can come back with a differentviewpoint and say that's a lot of baloney. I think it's right in ourterms; I'm not saying it's wrong. But somebody will say that he looks-34-8/18/81at reserves and at nonborrowed reserves--and that's what they do mostimmediately--and those measures have gone up at an annual rate of 20percent for two months. Or someone will say: \"I look at the reservebase and the Fed had that under control for a while, but now at theend of August for two months in a row growth in the base has been 9 to10 percent. So, he's blowing a lot of smoke because those are theindicators I look at and they've eased [because] total reserves aregoing up by whatever.\" There's nothing we can say to convince aperson who looks at those indicators that we haven't eased. This isthe state of the confusion we have in the markets, even though in myterms it's a misinterpretation. There it is. And they are not goingto change their minds because we issue a white paper or anything else", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not saying I'm not going to get on.All I am saying is that I don't think that's going to solve in anycomplete sense the kind of problem that you suggest. We are stuckwith it in this peculiar period, when so many people operate ondifferent theories and they are all uncertain. There is no action tobe taken that everybody is going to interpret the same way", " And if the Chairman can say the 7 percent isnot a ridiculous number--and in fact I would have preferred it to behigher than that myself and I'm usually quite tight--MR. GRAMLEY. The markets surely are going to remember thedecision to aim toward the lower end of the range for '81 and to-35-8/18/81revise down the figure and establish a target for '82 which was stilllower. It occurred at the same meeting", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Rates did not drop. They dropped before.At the time I made that statement they were at the bottom, as itturned out, and we had the great overshoot while rates were risingvery rapidly", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not saying that it's going to repeatitself. All I am saying is that there are a lot of skeptics in themarket who are going to say that it's going to repeat itself", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think this makes a lot ofdifference, frankly, on what we talked about--the most you couldassume is that those of us who are more sensitive to interest ratesmight like to see them a point or a point and a half lower--becauseone can't have an impression that the Federal Reserve is sharplyeasing monetary policy. I don't think the real crunch is coming now.The real crunch is going to be next year when, basically, I think weare going to be blown out of the water. Unless we can show aninflation rate decline to 5 percent, when the Administration isdisappointed in all of its projections and we have a stagnant economyand the supply-siders are beginning to turn against us and everybodyelse is turning against us, it's quite clear that people will notunderstand why we are still continuing with such a high level ofinterest rates. And it's going to be very hard to explain unless wecan show an inflation rate of 5 to 6 percent and say \"Yes, we have astagnant economy but look at what we achieved, and we achieved it inthe face of huge budgetary deficits.\" Aside from that kind ofdefense, I don't think we will be able to sustain this kind ofmonetary policy next year. I don't think we are at the crunch yet,and I think it's a very minor decision whether we do--. If we reallywant to get interest rates down a point to a point and a half, we haveto put in an initial borrowing assumption of about $1.2 billion ormaybe even a fraction lower. If we put it at $1.4 billion, then I-36-8/18/81think we will have to add--and we probably wouldn't want to add--a 1percent cut in the discount surcharge in order to get it down there.But then we would be giving a policy signal. We wouldn't appear to befollowing the market. So, I don't have any problem in a certain sensewith Paul's taking such a hard line as he is, but I just don't thinkthis [policy stance] is going to be sustainable well into next year ifwe continue running such a stable, stagnant economy with certainsectors getting into a crisis situation", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you're worried about next year, andthere's a certain legitimacy in that, surely your best defense is notto be easy prematurely this year. There will be some tradeoff betweenlower interest rates now and lower interest rates then. I don'tconsider my line a particularly hard one. It seems to me it's on theupper crust of the choices given us. But whatever that interpretationis, my general point is: What has happened between last month andnow, except better employment figures, better retail sales figures,and less concern about an immediate deterioration in the economy thatinduces us to change the directive in a way that will be interpretedas an easier mode", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I think you are right: We oughtto keep the same directive for the reasons you suggested. On thisissue of M-1B and M2 and their divergent behavior, I think there'snothing in economic theory that suggests to us which one of these weought to be pursuing. Therefore, not having a theory, we are thrownback on common sense and I am beginning to think common sense suggeststhat we shouldn't be trying to control either one of those. Butthat's a subject for the future, it seems to me. If we are going tobe governed by common sense, we ought to start looking at the state ofthe economy and the state of real interest rates. And it's clear thatthe economy is flattening and that real interest rates, if we knew howto measure them, are at the highest level since the 1920s", "MR. MORRIS. Well, if you look at nominal rates, I would havethe same conclusion, because we have a flat economy and we havenominal interest rates at historic highs. It seems to me thatalternative B would suggest a deliberate policy of needing stillhigher interest rates, which to me is a policy that is pretty hard tosustain at the present time. So, I think alternative A with the samedirective, which you are proposing, is correct", "MR. WALLICH. They're high enough, but barely, because theeconomy is bearing up very well under these interest rates. There isone sector that is very badly damaged and it is bearing up poorly.But the rest are curiously unaffected and on the whole the economy isstanding up remarkably well. So, I can see no grounds for going downon interest rates. I can see the danger of a great boom as these taxcuts take hold later in '82, and I think we'd be a lot better off ifbefore then the economy had been slow rather than beginning to move,because it will get enough or more than enough movement out of thattax stimulation. So, keeping [economic growth] at zero seems to meabout right. One can't positively look for a reduction and feel goodabout it, but we certainly ought not [foster] any stimulation at thistime. We just have to sit with the high interest rates, painful asthat is.Now, I am concerned about a repetition, on a small scale, oflast year: namely, that we start below the lower end of the M-1B bandand shoot through the band. It would be the third time that we'vedone that. It doesn't seem likely at this time, but it has happenedtwice before. And that makes me concerned about anything that lookslike a rapid growth of M-1B, suspect as that variable is. I'm alsoconcerned, if we imparted to it any degree of momentum, about how wewould bring [that pickup] to a halt once growth has gotten more orless back on track. At that time we'd have to have higher interestrates. And that's something we had better avoid. So, I lean toward alow growth rate for M-1B, as described in alternative B. One couldmitigate the interest rate consequences of that by being cautiousabout setting the borrowing requirement. In any case, I think thesetting of the borrowing requirement is a much more powerfulinstrument than the change of the path by 1 percentage point up ordown. That would get me to alternative B, possibly rephrased as it isin the second version of the directive [shown in the Bluebook] wherethe possibility of accelerating M-1B is allowed. I'm really not happyabout the acceleration. I just don't want to put too much of a burdenon M2 because of the doubts that are attached to it at this time", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I understand that", "MR. FORRESTAL. What I was coming to is suggesting thatperhaps at some point the Committee ought to look at an alternativethat would be even more restrictive than alternative B with thepurpose of bringing M2 growth down further into the range and notleave it above the range set by the Committee", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I respectfully disagree. I can'tthink of anything worse than starting to use numbers on publictelevision aside from the year-over-year number. If we start talkingabout intermeeting numbers of 7-1/2 or 8-1/2 percent, or whatever itis, I just don't think people would understand that. I think it'smuch more convincing if we talk in somewhat more generalnonquantitative terms", "MR. BLACK. I agree they don't understand, Fred, but that'swhy I think we ought to be trying to explain it to them. And that'swhere we differ. I think this will help a sensible person understandit whereas [now] they misunderstand it in every possible way, as theChairman indicated awhile ago", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

Well, if you read the directive it says onething, but there's some side agreement that we'll do it a differentway. I just think that's a very bad procedure", "MR. PARTEE. It says \"remains around or moves within.\" Youwant to leave that phrase in there. Now, I suggest that 9.4 percentis certainly right on the very border of violating, if it doesn'talready violate, the directive", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think that's right.Obviously, it's a question of interpretation. But \"around the upperlimit\" does not mean the upper limit", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. I'm almost surprised, Chuck,that you say that. If we're talking about something like 9.3, 9.4percent, isn't that around the upper limit", " The trouble is that this says what we didlast time, which doesn't--MR. BALLES.

I would think we could perhaps [say no] on thebasis that this is not the right time. I don't want to preclude thisfor all eternity", "MR. BOEHNE. I'm getting this not from the biggest banks inour District but from, say, the $1-1/2 billion size ones who tend tospecialize in lending to small and medium size businesses. Theircries of concern are getting louder. I'm also hearing this directlyfrom the small and medium size businesses. I've talked to a number ofthem; I had a luncheon last week with people from small and mediumsize firms in manufacturing, services, and consulting type businesses,and they're talking about accounts receivable that are going out 120days and higher. The worst offender appears to be the federalgovernment, which is very slow in paying its bills. The kind ofcomment I heard at the luncheon was: \"I'm just hanging by the tips ofmy fingers over the edge of the cliff; I can see the edge of thecliff.\" We had a go-around and almost to a person they mentioned thiscash flow problem as being very, very serious. It was in variousdegrees depending on who was talking. But the tone of \"Am I going tosurvive or not.\" was clearly there. That was a real question", "-7-10/5-6/81MR. MORRIS. I can confirm Ed's finding. I've talked to anumber of small and medium size bankers who have reported that justrecently, in the last few weeks, for the first time this year they'relooking at some loans that are turning sour. It's a very recentdevelopment. Bankers not only in Massachusetts but in New Hampshireand Maine have said the same thing. But they've mostly been the smalland medium size banks, not the big ones", "MR. GRAMLEY. One wants to remember also that historicallynumbers of failures have not been procyclical; they werecountercyclical for many, many years. The reason was that whenbusiness activity speeded up, the rate of business formationaccelerated and there were so many new firms coming out that theretended to be more failures. But when there is a prolonged period inwhich the rate of net business formation is low and there's a verysharp acceleration in failures, I think it is an indication of growingdifficulty. The other thing that ought to be said is that one knowsjust from raw logic about interest rates that small businesses willhave difficulty when they are paying 20 percent for credit and arelooking at a rate of increase of basic industrial and service pricesof between 8 and 9 percent. You can talk all you want about how theinterest cost is less taking taxes into account; but as a firm getscloser and closer to the edge, the less relevant this tax calculationbecomes and the more the firm is going to be staring at the need topay 20 percent for credit. So, just abstracting, the problem has togrow and grow and grow as time goes on. It's not surprising that Edis finding more and more signs of this", "MR. FORD. We're getting the same picture. In terms ofspecifics, the optimistic points I found are the high-tech companiesin the Southeast, such as andso on, which I visited in the last few weeks. They are all super10/5-6/81optimistic about the way things are going. Their earnings are growingin the 20 to 30 percent range or higher. The technical serviceindustries of that type are doing very well. The weaknesses that wefind are in the areas that one would expect. We're seeing more andmore classified loans to developers. We also have in our section ofthe country--in Atlanta, for example--a very high office vacancy ratethat is beginning to approach the problems we had in the mid-1970s interms of percent of vacant floor space and things like that. So,we're finding significant signs of weakness both in commercial andresidential construction and in the lending institutions other thanbanks, i.e. the thrifts. I find these days that just about every S&Lexecutive carries around in his pocket a schedule of weeks to go ormonths to go in terms of how long the S&L's equity will last based onits current earnings. There's a lot of worry in that industry. Thetourist industry in southeast Florida is way off. The state had itsslowest [tourist] season in the last ten years in the southern part ofFlorida and that also affected related industries. The lumberindustry, which is big in our area, is also in dire straits because ofthe housing situation; the carpet industry in Georgia, where we havethe capital of the world's carpet business, is beginning to come undersome stress. Putting all of this together, my feeling is that overallwe have a mixed picture. The economy is moving sideways. Some of theindustries are prospering and the ones we would expect to be hurt arebeing hurt", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I must say that among the bankers I havetalked with there's a growing sense of concern about small and mediumsize businesses. Several of the bankers have commented that there arebankruptcies that are in [train]--that at this point, nothing can bedone to defer them and they're just plain going to happen. Despitethat, just to echo Tony's comments, I haven't talked to anybody Iwould regard as a responsible individual who would suggest that weought to change what we're doing. [They think] the course iscertainly the right one.I just want to comment a bit on bankruptcies. Though that isa statistic that is available and is followed, there are also a lot ofpeople who are just quietly going out of business at this point, andthat is not a statistic that we can follow very easily. And there area lot of people who feel that some of these small and medium sizecompanies are simply getting what they can out of the business beforethey actually have to go into bankruptcy. So, this is having anadverse impact on that group.Let me ask Jim Kichline something on what he said aboutconstruction. My impression is that major construction is holding uppretty well in terms of orders and that kind of thing. Is that right", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Thank you. I had a bunch of cattlemen inhere on Friday and they weren't very happy", " In their more emotional moments, they--MR. CORRIGAN. You have to understand, though, that when theytalk to Congress, they turn the whole thing around", "MR. BOEHNE. I had 8 or 9 people in for lunch a couple weeksago and I asked them how many of their Congressmen who voted for thetax and budget cuts last time would vote for them this time. I foundabout eight Congressmen represented and the group thought that twowould not support another round of budget cuts", "MR. PARTEE. Steve, didn't you say 12 percent growth fromSeptember to December does not get us back to the range. That is,December is back to the track, but people will still be able to readthe fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter growth even then, as I read theBluebook, as 3 percent rather than 3-1/2 percent", "MR. RICE. Steve, did I hear you say that if we tried toincrease M-1B so that it moves back toward the lower end of the targetrange from where it is now, given the demand for M-1B, that would ineffect be inflationary because we would be giving people more moneypresumably than they want to hold. Is that correct", "-20-10/5-6/81MR. AXILROD. No, [raising its growth] to that 12 percent,which would be needed to get it back [into the range]. And if youhappen to think that there's a sizable pent-up demand for goods andservices, as some of us on the staff think--some may not--then wecould have a very sharp rebound in spending and a sharp rebound ininterest rates later in order to keep money under control. And ifthat large money growth sets off a sharp rebound in spending, I thinkthe progress made in curbing inflationary expectations would be lost.That's one analysis that one could make. If you think the economy isextremely weak in any event and no one is going to do much when shortrates go very low, then you might not come to that conclusion. That'swhat I was saying at the end of my statement", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is it 5/8ths of 6 or 5/8ths of thedifference between 3 and 6.", "MR. GRAMLEY. That's particularly apropos when these monetaryaggregates are so slippery and so difficult to interpret. I think wehave ended up with an economy that has had more restraint on it duringthe course of this year than we had expected earlier. And, frankly,we have had more restraint than I personally would have wanted in thesense that I think our objectives over the long run are not likely tobe maximized by permitting the economy to slip into a couple quartersof negative growth like this. If we could somehow fine-tune--and I'mnot suggesting we try--and keep the economy growing at zero or aslightly positive rate, I think we would be better off. The pressuresto do something to turn it around are going to intensify if wecontinue to have negative growth. The structural damage that is beingcreated is also growing, and I strongly agree with Ed Boehne that wehave a real problem there.[Steve's] comments about M2--as to why M2 can be a veryslippery guide--I thought were particularly interesting. When wewatch M2 and try to limit it, we induce innovations that in turn tendto make M2 continue to grow. As a consequence, interest rates go upand that weakens the economy. So, if we slow the growth of M-1B evenmore--. I look back at the past couple of months and I wish I hadlistened to my colleague, Governor Partee, about why we need to paymore attention to M-1B in a period like this. I think one of thethings we need to do in our decisions today is to make sure we don'tdo what in effect we have done in the past couple of months, which isliterally to ignore M-1B. We have given almost entire weight to M2,the way the period worked out. That wasn't what we intended, butthat's the way it happened. I don't think we can adopt a policy todaythat is designed to make M-1B get back up in the target range by thefourth quarter or by December. That would just induce a collapse ofinterest rates. We would have the economy growing like gangbusters inthe first half of next year and then we would be in real trouble. Butwhat we do have to do, I think, is to make sure we pay more attentionto M-1B than we have in the recent past", " It's a question of--MR. PARTEE. A technical point on M2 that I would make, Paul,is that we have to remember that we are factoring in new elements ofmarket-related rates as time goes on. That can give a firstdifference in M2 that we are coming to a steady state", "MR. RICE. No, not quite. I think the staff forecast isabout right. I agree with their view that there's no solid evidenceat present that the economy is in the process of a sharp downturn,despite the softening tendencies that we see. But it seems to methere is a danger that the weakening that we see in progress will gainmomentum and could possibly become cumulative. That is just apossibility. I don't see it, but it's possible. And much of whatI've heard this morning increases my anxiety that there may be morefinancial strain out there than we recognize at the moment. Onepossible result of that is that a downturn could gather momentum. Inthe circumstances, I think our policy should seek to avoid encouragingany process of a cumulative downturn. It would not do that, Ibelieve, if we accepted a much lower rate of growth in M-1B than wastargeted. On the other hand, I think policy should avoid any attemptto achieve a precipitous easing of money and credit at this time.What we should do is to aim at maintaining current conditions whilegradually trying to nudge M-1B back in the direction of the lower endof its target. It may well require some slight reduction in interestrates to maintain current conditions, but I think that would bedesirable at the present time. This suggests to me that alternative Bwould make the most sense in the current situation", "MR. WALLICH. Well, it seems to me we're seeing again what isthe nature of a stable money supply target. It leads to very wideswings in interest rates. That in turn leads to possibly wide swingsand very quick swings in the economy, with a ceiling placed overexpansion and a floor probably placed under any contraction, butunfortunately with a great deal of damage being done to the machinerywhile these gyrations proceed. So, I'm concerned about a move to getback on track with M-1B. I think we're better off considering that asprogress against inflation and money in the bank and not trying toundo it. I think we're in danger of repeating 1980. And back in 1980I said that we were in danger of repeating 1971-79. We didn't dothat; we did much worse. [I'd] preclude any risk on this score here.I do have to say, contrary to the implication of what I've said sofar, that if I understand Steve correctly about M2, it sounds asthough he is saying it's perversely interest elastic. That is, thehigher interest rates go, the faster it grows. For that there is aprecedent in the British experiment with sterling M3. They made thattheir number one target and it kept growing very fast. Theimplication seems to be that it attracted funds from outside themonetary aggregates, out of non-monetary assets, and so it grew fasterthe higher interest rates went and, therefore, substantially misledthem. Evidently the aggregate they should have looked at was morenearly M1", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I want to take off from a comment thatMr. Roos made on the subject of credibility. That's an issue that allof us have wondered about and thought about, particularly in view ofthe fact that there is a lot of pressure on this institution. We'vehad a lot of bills introduced in the Congress to restructure theFederal Reserve or to do away with it or, perhaps the one that makesthe most sense, to impeach all members of the Open Market Committee.At any rate, it strikes me that our credibility is not at issue whenit comes to whether we hit the bottom of the target on M-1B or not.Our credibility is really at issue in the more basic question ofwhether we are going to do the job that I think we were in essencecreated to do. It seems to me that the basic function of a centralbank is to avoid deflation on one hand and inflation on the other.And I'm not terribly sure how successful we can be fine-tuning inbetween. My feeling is that maybe we shouldn't call this the momentof truth because it's going to be a lot longer than that. It's goingto be a period of truth. I don't fear all of these bills that are inthe Congress to change the Federal Reserve if we do our basic job offinally getting inflation under control. If we don't do that job,then what the heck is our reason for being. How do we justify ourexistence under those circumstances. It seems to me our basic raisond'etre would be gone. So, I think that's where the credibility issueis: whether we are in fact going to do the job that we were createdto do. We've been criticized in the past, and I think a lot of thatcriticism is proper. But now we're at the point where we have to-28-10/5-6/81carry through and get the job done. I'm certainly not attempting tosay that we ought to crush the economy but we just can't lose sight ofthe basic fact that what we're trying to do is to keep that steadypressure on--we have some luck here in food and fuel prices--and if wekeep the pressure on, we can get some movement in the wage-pricestructure and begin to get this spiral going in the other direction.So, I for one think alternative C is the one that makes thedifference. I agree that M-1B has problems and that M2 has problems,so it seems to me sensible to look at both of them and in some way toincorporate both of them in the directive. I would get terriblyworried about going much faster than [alternative C] on M-1B becausewhat happens, then, when we get to January. Not only do we run therisk of stimulating these latent demands--. Mr. Roos asked whatdifference interest rates make. Well, it strikes me that we've beenkeeping the interest-sensitive sectors of the economy under a greatdeal of pressure. And if interest rates do go down, that has astimulative effect on those sectors of the economy. And then what dowe do when we get to January if we're not going to pick targets thatare lower than what we have here. If we're going to go to 6 percentor even faster [M-1B growth at this point], what happens then. Do wethen tighten the screws and get the up and down effect again. So,anything that's faster than \"C\" would worry me", "MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, I am not as disturbed as somemembers of the Committee are by the so-called shortfall in M-1B, eventhough I would concede in the ideal order of things that M-1B isprobably what we should be looking at. When I look at that aggregatethis year, shifts into money market funds, mutual funds, and even thepossibility that all savers money might come out of there leave mequite comfortable with the general pattern of its behavior,particularly in the context of the broader aggregates, and in thecontext of what it would take to get it back near the bottom of therange for this year.Somebody mentioned earlier that we should be conductingpolicy with an eye on the long haul and I certainly agree with that.I very much agree that we must avoid another of the very sharp swingsin interest rates. And the point that Governor Schultz made about thetrajectory for 1982 is rather critically important in that context.In the current setting, obviously, there is a great deal of attentionand sensitivity focused on this Committee. [There is] a particularelement of sensitivity out there to any major signs of some give onthe part of the Fed. That sensitivity is particularly important amongthe group of people who really are important in determining whathappens over the next couple of years: the business leaders who setprices; the union leaders who negotiate wages; and the institutionalmoney managers who have to make decisions whether to buy some long-term paper or not to buy some long-term paper.Given all of that, when I look at alternative B and see thatthe staff says, for what it's worth, that \"B\" would involve monthlygrowth rates of M-1B shift adjusted of 7-1/2, 10-1/2, and 11-3/4percent out through December, I am very, very troubled by that. Ithink that pattern of monthly behavior, even in the context of theshortfall that we have seen earlier in the year, would run a real riskof compromising what has been achieved to date in this effort to getinflation down. And in the context of that trajectory question, itmight well leave us in the worst of all worlds. In that light, Ithink that we clearly should be taking a very, very go slow attitude.That is reinforced, in my judgment, by the recent behavior of thereserve aggregates. And on a less technical note, it's alsoreinforced by a thought that the law of averages is running against usin some sense. One of these months interest rates and everything elsenotwithstanding, the money supply is going to jump for whateverreasons. And, in terms of the economy itself I draw some consolationfrom the fact that there are very sizable latent demands out there-35-10/5-6/81that will resurface as interest rates come down and will have atendency to surface in any event in the environment of the tax cutsthat are now on board and will be coming on line next year.In the light of all that, I come out rather squarely onalternative C, with some disposition toward initial borrowings ofaround $1 billion or so. As usual, the big question is what do we doif we are not on that track as the period unfolds. There is one othercomment I would like to make, too. We've all been talking about thiscredit problem and financial shakiness or whatever it is out there,and obviously we should be talking about it. When I think about that,the worst of all situations there for me would be for us to findourselves getting blindsided by some development that we have totallymissed in our intelligence gathering and other activities. That, too,could compromise our ability to hang in there. I also would suggestthat there are things that we can do, at least in our intelligencegathering activities, to try to minimize the likelihood of gettingtotally surprised. And I for one would like to see some efforts madein the direction of redoubling that intelligence apparatus to try tosensitize ourselves fully to what may be out there", "MR. ROOS. Well, I think there's a middle course between theexpansionists--I won't use the expression you did--a differencebetween going high and going low. I do see a problem next year. Ifour growth has been very slow this year, we're going to have to raiseit next year, aren't we. Even though it would only be in the lastmonth, we'd have to explain if we took a more expansive approach thatit was merely to get us to or near the lower end of our anti-inflationary targets for the year 1981. I may be off base. Am I", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, on that point, Larry, I think onehas to average through. We can face the question when we get toFebruary as to what we say. One thing would be to base it on thefourth quarter of 1980 and look at the two years combined if we're wayshort. That would also tend to take care of your problem, Fred. Iagree with Jerry that we're going to have volatility in the moneysupply. I just wish we would have some volatility on the up sidebecause it has been quite a while--April I think was the last monthwhen there was a really strong [M-1B] number--and we're about due.I'm a little concerned that we may not get it because if we are infact moving into a somewhat faster decline in business--I avoid theword \"recession\"--it seems unlikely that we're going to have strongmoney growth. So, we may in fact be facing this over the next severalmonths. As I said before, I think we have to fall short on the year.We just can't ask for a 12 percent increase in M-1B from September toDecember, and even that won't quite get us there. The public wouldn'tunderstand. It's just too radical. I could accept \"B.\" I couldshade M-1B in \"B\" to 8 percent, which I think would be a reasonableobjective. I don't think the monthly pattern the staff has in thosenumbers means anything. We could have an 11 percent growth rate forDecember or we could have 3 percent or 18 percent. We don't have anyidea what the month of December is going to bring. But I think thecentral thrust of our policy ought to be to begin to return to thebottom of the M-1B range, and 8 percent seems to me suitably fast toplan for. I'd consider ourselves very lucky if we get that high of anumber in those last three months.I would also agree with several who have suggested that maybethe federal funds rate range ought to be 12 to 17 percent. That's notbecause I don't think rates are going to come in low. Let me pointout to you that the staff projection for the rate of inflation nextyear is 7.1 percent. Now, assume they're wrong. A lot of people-37-10/5-6/81think they're too low. Assume it's 8 percent. Still, these rates aretoo high for that rate of inflation. And in a recession environmentwe can't have much of a real rate and expect to get the stimulus tothe economy that will bring it back. So, we might have a temporaryproblem with borrowers coming into the market because rates are lowerthan they have been. But I don't think it will last if, in fact, therate of inflation does tend to wind down, as most forecasters now areanticipating. So, we really have to get from where we are to a levelof rates, it seems to me, of about 8 to 10 percent. It's a questionof how we manage that reduction in the rate level over a period oftime if we want to have a reasonably bland economy. And I would, ofcourse, change the emphasis, as suggested, away from too much emphasison M2. I think the way that Lyle suggested is a good way of doing it.That $200 million for borrowings is at the end of the period, Ibelieve. Steve has left the room, but I think the idea is thatborrowings might work out to be $200 or $300 million by the end of theperiod. I think the [initial level] ought to be about $800 million orsomething like that", "MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, I get a little nervous about the42-day gap before our [next] meeting with any of these specifications.I don't know how to assess the Sadat situation. I don't know whetherwe're faced with the problem of increasing retardation in businessactivity or whether this is temporary and the economy will bounceback. I'd hate to see us with any of these limits with a negativerate of growth of M-1B in October. That's not viable in terms of thepolitical side. On the other hand, I don't want a precipitous ratedecline. I'd rather put some sort of limit on the M-1B growth and anarrower funds range and in 20 days consult again as to what theimplications some of these rather dramatic events are going to havefor us. To set up wide specifications for a 42-day period I think isa mistake at this juncture. I'd prefer something between \"B\" and \"C\"in terms of the aggregates and I'd like to consult at the 13 percentlevel [on the funds rate]. But I'd sure hate to see that [rate] go upover 16 percent at this time until we have a better feeling as towhich way to turn. By the end of the period we may have to makechanges on both of these", "MS. TEETERS. Does that include a target", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's why I would recommend a fairlytough [floor]--in other words, a 13 to 18 percent range--in order tohave a consultation. Even 13 percent represents a drop of about 2-1/2points and I think we ought to have a consultation at that point toavoid just following it blindly all through the quarter if it looks asif it's going to press way below 13 percent. In summary, where Istand is a 7 to 7-1/2 percent target in M-1B, relaxing the M2constraint language somewhat--although I'm not sure that we should putin a numerical target if there's another way of doing it--a 13 to 18percent fed funds rate range, and an initial borrowing level of $800million. I don't think we're going to end up anywhere near thesenumbers if the economy is as weak as most of us, including the staff,think it is", "MR. MONHOLLON. Oh, by some lower rates of growth in theconsumer price indexes. And I certainly wouldn't want to do anythingthat would worsen inflationary expectations. But, as has beendiscussed around the table, I think there's some danger that theliquidity bind that a number of businesses are in could produce a waveof bankruptcies that might result in a sharp slump. My concern onthis score is reinforced by the extremely sharp and sustainedreduction we've experienced in shift adjusted M-1B this year. As forM2, the possibility that it will come in over target doesn't disturbme as much as it does some. As has been discussed, there is a greatdeal of noise in the nontransactions component of M2 and it'sdifficult to interpret what it means. In addition, it's difficult tocontrol the nontransactions component of M2. Given the changingcomposition of this component, I wonder if we can be sure whether it'spositively or negatively correlated to the funds rate. In some waythe work that we're doing suggests that it may be positively relatedand that efforts to hold down [M2] may produce the principal result ofkeeping M-1B well below the lower limits of its range. And that wouldbe unfortunate. So, I would concur with the idea that the M2 provisobe dropped from the directive. I think there are some distinct risksin failing to get M-1B growth up fairly close to the lower end of ourtarget range.The issue of credibility has been discussed. I don't know onwhat credibility hinges exactly, but I think there's some risk to ourcredibility in failing to hit the 3-1/2 percent [lower end of the]target range that we announced in July. There's a risk, too, ofcontributing unnecessarily to what appears to be a developingrecession. And there's a risk, as was discussed earlier, that a verylow rate of growth for M-1B in 1981 will complicate our targeting for1982. So, this leads me to suggest that we try to get as much growthin M-1B as we can by the end of the year without unduly upsetting themarkets", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's impossible, if I may say", "MR. PARTEE. You mean no matter how weak M-1B is. You'd puta floor on borrowing", "MR. WALLICH. It was up to 2", "MR. PARTEE. And a funds rate [lower limit] of 12 or 13", "MR. PARTEE. We could say \"7 percent or somewhat more,\" orsomething like that", "MR. CORRIGAN. There is another option, which I don't thinkmuch of, but we could do it. And that is to start out the way thatChuck and Lyle are saying but to put in the directive that to theextent M2 departs significantly because of all savers certificates orfor whatever reasons we would have a consultation. So, it would becouched in terms of triggering a consultation rather than triggering ashift in the reserve path", "MR. WALLICH. Cutting interest rates in half is just showingthat we are giving up on inflation and are starting to fightrecession; that's very much what it seems to me we are tempted to do", "MR. WALLICH. No, I'm concerned with the picture that wepresent if interest rates drop sharply. You can say all you likeabout the fact that we are below target on the money supply, but thepublic will perceive this as easing and 90 percent of the commentatorswill say that the Fed has eased very substantially"], "1981FOMC19811117meeting.txt": [" The problem was that not all thecountries were ready to come forward with a rate at that time, so theswaps for those cases were rewritten to say \"an appropriate domesticrate\" which in our case--MR. CROSS. And these three do not correct all of them.There are still some in that unspecified category", "MR. ROOS. So, Steve, we're almost back to where we were whenwe had incompatibility of achieving interest rate targets andaggregate targets. Now we have two aggregate targets that sometimesare incompatible. Is that what you're saying", "MR. AXILROD. Well, yes, in some sense maybe they areincompatible. You can choose one or the other; you can't choose themboth. But given the [recent] changes in financial technology and theway people are behaving, the Committee inevitably has to make thejudgments it has been making: That it's going to take this attitudetoward one in case the other goes off and vice versa", "MR. RICE. Well, I'd like Peter to expand on that laststatement. What makes you so sure that the credibility of the Systemwould have been called into question more vigorously had we tried tokeep money growth closer to the targets. Isn't that just yourimpression. You don't have any hard [evidence]", "MR. STERNLIGHT. It's judgment, Governor--I can't prove it--just from the way that our responses are watched so diligently by anarmy of Fed watchers in the markets. They are watching to see whatour response will be and there are suggestions from various quartersthat money is falling short and we ought to be doing this or that torepair that situation. I had the impression that we were gettingclose to the point where credibility could be questioned each time wemade some overt move, whether it was on the discount rate or puttingin reserves at some particular funds rate level or something. We'vealways run little risks of that kind. We came through it withoutreally setting off any significant reaction but I don't think we werethat far from that on various occasions as we came through thisdeclining rate period", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Also, pumping in more reserves whenthe economy is weak to compensate for a [shortfall] will notnecessarily result in an increased money supply. What one may find isthat it just causes a further drop in borrowing and more downwardpressure on interest rates. We may end up not being any closer to ourmonetary target and it may bring about a more precipitous [rate]decline", " They getyou closer to your monetary target if you move--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but there's a delayed effect", "MR. PARTEE. Yes", "MR. ROOS. I have a question, Steve. As I understood yourrationale, you're concerned that if interest rates fall more quicklythan somehow would be warranted by present economic conditions, thatwould have adverse consequences. Am I not correct in saying that theonly way to stop interest rates from declining at what anyone mightthink is an excessive rate is to withdraw money, which has adepressing effect on M1-B. Is that correct so far. The only way tokeep interest rates from dropping by what anyone might think is aprecipitous amount is to be frugal in the way we supply reserves", "MR. FORD. I'm wondering what is in your modeling. That wasa very unusual period. If we were trying to achieve some step-up inM1-B to get back to our announced targets for this year, I'd besurprised, in the absence of credit controls, if we were to getanything like the kind of precipitous drop in rates that we had undercredit control. Wouldn't you. How does your model generate this", "MR. AXILROD. Well, no. The credit control program[produced] drops in money supply well below what was targeted at thattime. So, in order to hit the target, the declines in rates wouldhave been even more--much, much larger. So, this sort of assumeshitting the targets. Moreover, it does it with only 6 weeks to go; soyou have to get a lot of movement in it", " So, it's below 900,000 on average forthe next--MR. FORD. It has to be. If you have an average of 870,000and you have 918,000 for the first month, where is the bottom. I'mworried. They came circling our statue of the eagle when starts were900,000. What are they going to--", "MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, it disturbs me to sit here and letus contemplate what is really a fiction, which is these numbers thatwe're going by. I'm watching the volume of our check clearings inColumbus suddenly shoot up, which is an unusual phenomenon at themoment. If you look into that, it's unbelievable the money fundtransfers that are being put through by one our Columbus banks. Iwonder if the numbers we are dealing with here were closer to thereality of transactions balances if we'd have the same kinds ofreactions we're having to these numbers. To play these numbers outseems to me to be a serious mistake in terms of transactions balancesagainst the economy. I think these are too low in terms of reality ifwe adjust for the money funds, which are growing very rapidly [basedon] the push being made, at least in our District, not only in termsof large corporations but of individuals moving into these moneyfunds. The pressure is really very great to get individuals toconvert into money funds, which are transaction balances. It seems tome that it would behoove us to move promptly to find out whatproportion of these money funds is in fact transactions balances andto start to factor that into our thinking about these aggregates, ifthis becomes a guide in terms of our policy.My second point is that it seems to me we're stuck not onlywith arbitrary numbers but that our perspective is too short. If wethink a bit longer term about what we're trying to do, we get awayfrom some of these extremes in our thinking concerning this 5-weekperiod. Third, to try to get away from this damn base drift problem,which is going to kill us on the one side as it did last year on theother, I'd put this in perspective by going back to the fourth quarterof '79 and then making some growth rate projections out into theseperiods for what it takes to get us on a reasonable path from thatlevel until the March figure gives us somewhat different numbers thanhave been presented to us here. So, this is a series of things thatwe need to think about in our policy considerations.-10-11/17/81On the economic front, I have a concern which is not sharedby my colleagues, I must confess. I think we've kind of gotten overthe interest rate bulge temporarily here in terms of pressure oncorporations. But I have a feeling that the profits squeeze issetting in and that some managements are going to throw in the toweland that we're going to have more financial problems in the monthsahead than I think are factored into some of these forecasts. I don'tknow what the fallout of that is going to be in terms of psychology[and the effect on] this turnaround that is projected in the monthsahead. This really is causing me concern because of the fallout thatwould have for financial institutions that think they're in prettygood shape and could suddenly wake up with some rather sick loans ontheir hands that really aren't [known by] the public", "MR. PARTEE. Yes", " If itstarts low, then it will end up--MR. AXILROD. Oh, yes. It averages out that over [the two]years they both come out the same, I think", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might also say that I have no confidencein this shift adjusted figure anymore. I think it was an appropriatething to do earlier in the year. But at some point it loses me, interms of significance", "MR. CORRIGAN. But it seems to me that it all works in thesame direction. If you go back to the beginning of the year and lookat the spread between the M1 and M2 targeted growth rates, it wasgoing to be 2-1/2 percentage points. But we had fudged that; it wasreally something like 3-1/2 points. Now, if you look at where theyear is probably going to come out, that spread that we thought wasmaybe 3-1/2 is going to be 7-1/2 percentage points. The 4 percentagepoint difference in the observed spread versus what we thought thespread was going to be suggests to me that the weight of the argumentis overwhelmingly in the direction of M1-B being understated, whetherit's because of money market mutual funds or whatever. While I'munder no illusions that we knew exactly the relationship last Januaryeither, that alone leads me to the conclusion that I simply am notnearly as preoccupied with what the statistical measure of M1-B isversus what I think the reality is", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I just wanted to point something out--noton this subject--[though] I agree that the velocity of M1-B hasincreased because of the money market funds. After all, we'llprobably have a 9 percent increase in nominal GNP this year withgrowth of only a couple percent on M1-B, which is unprecedented. Thathas to mean a considerable shift has occurred.But what I wanted to point out was that when Steve speaksabout the trajectory--plotting a course that would take us through thewinter and into the spring--he has been very careful every time he hasreferred to it in a statement to say \"assuming the economicprojection.\" And I would argue that this begs the question, because Ihave a certain amount of sympathy with Larry's first question. I heldmy hand up when he asked it, though it has been some time since Larrymade his comment. There could be a circularity here that in effecthas a trajectory to no place, or as we say in regard to the discountrate \"a bridge to nowhere.\" That's because, in fact, we may find thatthe nominal GNP numbers fade as we move ahead. We've had a little ofthat, certainly, in the fourth quarter [with GNP] being quite a bit-13-11/17/81weaker than we were anticipating all year. I have a sense of a littleshortfall from our projections as we've gone through the year. We'vecertainly had big shortfalls in relation to our expectations on M1-B.I looked at it and we have been below our expectations of M1-B atthese meetings for six consecutive months, and the average shortfallhas been 7 percent over that 6-month period. We've even been short onM2 compared to our expectations, the paths that we selected when wewent into the period. In the case of M1-B, that's partly because ofthis velocity problem. But I think it's partly because of shortfallsin economic performance, too.It's hard for me to believe that there will not be aneconomic recovery commencing in the second half of next year, giventhe size of the deficit that we'll have and the further cut in taxesthat will occur as of July 1st. But it's a fair piece until themiddle of next year, and I'm not at all sure that we can say withgreat confidence that the economy might not decline a good dealfurther below the projection, [say, by] the end of the first quarter,which could give us quite a serious problem as it occurs. If that istrue, and if we hold up interest rates, then we will get thecontraction in transactions balances that will make possible acontinuation of poor business. So, I just wanted to point out thatSteve has been very careful every time he referred to the longer-runplanning always to assume as a caveat that the economic assumption wasright", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The people say that they'replanning on a 5 to 6 percent wage increase next year. But they arenonunion. They pay relatively low wages; they [start with] theminimum wage, I think", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, at the last several meetings I'vebeen saying that the economy was sluggish, bumping along somewherebetween no growth and very low growth. I thought that was a goodthing in terms of a desire to reduce inflationary pressures and Ithought it would be good if we could keep the economy in that mode.But now we see that the economy has not remained in that pattern.Nearly all of the indicators point to a recession. And, as theRedbook indicates, pessimism is widespread among businessmen. Itappears to me that the only question really is how deep the recessionis going to be. My own judgment is that the staff forecast is aboutright. I would differ only slightly as to the timing of theturnaround. The staff sees a mild upturn in GNP in the second quarterof next year. I do not see a turnaround appearing as early as thesecond quarter. I do not see the mild pickup in housing and inautomobiles and in inventory that the forecast is based upon. I thinka turnaround has to await the tax cut of midyear and that it probablywill be toward the end of the third quarter before we see any realsigns of recovery. So, I would put the recovery further back in time,-15-11/17/81which means that we're likely to see very low economic activitycontinuing longer. In other words, the duration of the recessionwould be longer than is projected. I'm also more optimistic about theinflation picture for next year. In my view the course of inflationwill be somewhat less. The staff is projecting an average inflationrate of something like 8.8 percent, and I would expect it to beslightly lower than that.I was interested to hear Mr. Axilrod say he saw significantdifferences between this downturn and the one that occurred in thespring of last year. I certainly agree with that. This is a muchmore classic recession. I don't think it will be V-shaped; I don'tthink there will be a very quick snapback because the conditions aredifferent and the basis for a quick snapback in consumer and businessspending seems not to be present now. The main issues that seem to bebefore us then are: (1) How much of a drop in interest rates would wefind acceptable in the current circumstances; and (2) How much ofshortfall in the growth of M1-B from its target range would we findacceptable. And related to both of these questions is, of course, thecredibility issue. What happens to our credibility if we allowinterest rates to fall below whatever level we find acceptable andwhat happens to credibility if we continue to allow money growth tofall substantially below the target range. I see our credibilitybeing called into question much more when we are seen as letting up ina situation where inflation is gathering momentum and when interestrates are rising [than if] money is tight and we appear to be lettingup--and I emphasize appear--in a situation when interest rates arefalling and the economy is weakening. In current circumstances it'smuch more important to be perceived as sticking to our objectives andtaking our monetary growth target seriously. Therefore, at present--and I refer now to the period over the next six weeks to two months--it's important to be seen as not contracting the narrowest monetaryaggregate, M1-B, further than we had intended to six weeks ago. Iwould think that our credibility depends a great deal at this time onwhether we are willing to appear to move in the direction of trying toachieve our target for M1-B", "MR. SCHULTZ. That gives [unintelligible] more important. Ifthey hang them all, that's all right", "MR. KEEHN. Just to comment on the situation in the ChicagoDistrict, the problems, of course, have been serious all year butthere certainly has been further deterioration since our last meeting.And it's clear that [just about] all of the sectors have now beenaffected, with very few exceptions. Turning to the auto situation,October can only be classified as a disaster. Any hope for 1981 atthis point, of course, is gone. The optimism that some of them havefor 1982 is significantly eroded and I think the automotive situation,therefore, is very serious. Capital expenditures in our area havebeen further curtailed, particularly in the automotive industry, withsignificant cutbacks. The Christmas shutdown schedules, which werealready going to be heavy, have been extended considerably. Thisrecession is a little different in the Midwest than other recessionshave been. In the past the agricultural sector has offset theindustrial sector. This time that is not the case. Because of highproduction, farm incomes are down and, as a result, the agriculturalarea is also in a very serious predicament. And that has impacts on-21-11/17/81people who manufacture products for that sector, several of whom havegotten themselves into very weakened, precarious positions. In turn,the banks that extend credit to the farms are beginning to see someslowdown in payments, and I think it is inevitable that there will besome problem loans developing among those banks as they go through aforeclosure procedure.I am considerably more pessimistic than most with regard tothe outlook for '82. I admittedly come from an area where there is avery heavy concentration of industries that have been most affected.But I am beginning to wonder if the consensus view that we will allcome to work on the first of July and find that someone has turned thelights on is really going to come to pass. I think we're placing anawful lot of hope that the tax cut will produce significant benefits.I think the recovery will begin to take place as we see a permanent ormore lasting impact on inflation. And until we get into the contractsettlements next year, I don't think one can forecast how that willcome about. I don't want to imply that any of this should indicate asignificant change in policy for us. On the contrary, we continue tohave the broad support of the business and financial industry and Ithink they would encourage us to stay with the general direction ofour current policy. But my hunch is that with the economy as weak asit is rates will continue to come down and we can continue to maintaina fairly restrictive stance on the aggregates without necessarilyhaving a negative impact on the recovery prospects. So, I would urgethat we continue with this. But I do want to report that thesituation in the Chicago District continues to be serious and isdeteriorating", "MR. MORRIS. Finally, looking at the options for thismeeting, two of the options call for a more restrictive policy than weannounced at the last meeting. It's hard for me to envisage whateconomic data have come in over the past five weeks that would lead usto support a more restrictive policy than we did the last time. Icould certainly buy \"B\" because we could still say that we're shootingfor 7 percent growth through the rest of the year, which is a numberwe put out last time. I find it very difficult to figure out how wewould explain coming out with the 5-3/4 percent target underalternative C, after having given our sanction to a 7 percent growthrate before we knew how sharp the decline in the economy was going tobe. I should think that would take some doing", "MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, I certainly would agree that theeconomy is soft. We even have some sense of that in the Ninth FederalReserve District at this point. And that softness is well reflectedin statistics and in business behavior and sentiment. My own personalhunch would be that the fourth quarter at least could be even softerthan the staff is now suggesting. But at the same time I also sensethat there is at least a residue of optimism in terms of the longer-term outlook and expectations. In part that grows out of peoplelooking ahead to the tax cut and in part out of some of these pent-updemands that people have been talking about. There also is still somelingering hope that the inflation rate may be coming down in ameaningful way, although recent events perhaps have not worked in thedirection of reinforcing that. The relevant point here is that if wewant to talk about a sustained recovery--whether it starts in thesecond quarter or the third quarter--the sustainability quotient isgoing to depend on two or three critical things. One is bending downthat inflation rate, including the wage side. Another is the budgetsituation, which hasn't even been mentioned here, and as I would lookat that right now recent events seem to have worked in the directionof making it harder rather than easier to get on with the furtheradjustments that have to be made in that area. The other thing thatis very important in connection with sustainability is that we simplyhave to create and maintain an environment in which some of these veryserious liquidity and balance sheet strains that are all over theeconomy can be turned around. And achieving that turnaround under thebest of circumstances is not something that is going to be donequickly or easily. It's going to take some time, which in turnimplies that it will not be done in an environment in which we havethese zigzag patterns of interest rates and these zigzag patterns ofeconomic activity. That leads me very much in the direction thatGovernor Gramley suggested. And fundamentally it leaves me with theview that we ought to be proceeding slowly and deliberately withrespect to this interest rate situation, even though I, too, obviouslywould conclude that there is some further latitude that can beconstructively used here. But I think we have to be cautious and we-23-11/17/81have to try to avoid some of the problems of the past as we try towalk this very thin line", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Teeters", "MS. TEETERS. Some of my concerns have already beenexpressed. I have a strong feeling that we're monetarists when theeconomy is expanding and we're interest rate targeters when it beginsto collapse. If we move in and put a floor on the interest rate,which is what it sounds like around here, we'll be in real trouble.We haven't kept up with what we said we were going to do. I thinkthere is still latitude to lower interest rates from where they arenow. This staff forecast has a bottom rate on mortgages of 16-1/2percent; that doesn't speak of any revival in the housing market nextyear. I think we can move it down. I agree with Lyle that we havelet interest rates swing both too high and too low. Or rather we letthem swing too high; I have seen very little evidence of theirswinging too low at this point. I think we will probably want to paymore attention on the high side as well as on the low side in the nextcycle. There's also a tendency to be very unconcerned when rates riseand then to sit and agonize for weeks about lowering them. We didthat last summer and a few other times on the discount rate. It seemsto me that we should be symmetrical and not try to fudge or change ourphilosophical point of view as we go along.If you look at this forecast--and we have had a lot ofsurprises in the forecast on a quarterly basis over the past threeyears--it takes until the end of 1982 for real GNP to get back towhere it was at the beginning of 1980. Now, that's a very, very slow-growing economy; and although there have been lots of ups and downs,we end up at the end of 1982 with an 8.8 percent unemployment rate forthree solid quarters. That is not my definition of a revivingeconomy. And we have 8.8 percent [unemployment] projected primarilybecause interest rates are assumed to rise next year. When an economyis growing as little as this one is projected to grow with no impacton interest rates, some policy parameter is wrong. And this is evenafter a very large tax cut at midyear. We're not talking about anexuberant economy next year anyway; we're talking about an economythat is just barely keeping its head above water. If we then comedown and set a floor on interest rates at 12-1/2 percent, we're goingto end up like the supply siders did with the Stockman article;somebody is going to notice that the emperor doesn't have any clotheson and that we aren't accomplishing anything. Our inflation rates forthe past three years have been 9.7, 9.8, and 9.4 percent and this isafter three years of monetary restraint. Every time we think we'regoing to get a dip in the inflation rate, something comes along and[drives] it back up again. I think we should become increasinglyconcerned about the rate of real growth in this economy and do what wecan on inflation. But [we also need to] realize that we don't havecomplete control and that we could do extreme harm if the economycontinues to run at these very low levels of real utilization", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I have to align myself with thosewho think that the downturn is apt to be more serious than the staff-24-11/17/81has suggested. With a sharp deceleration in M1-B growth and the veryhigh real interest rates here in the summer and the point that WillisWinn made that there seem to be a lot of [potential] bankruptcies--which many of our contacts are telling us will surface pretty soon--the downturn may be somewhat greater than the staff is projecting. Bythe same token, I'm somewhat encouraged by the reaction of some of thelabor unions in the softening economy and [by the fact that] the moneysupply has been kept under good control. So, I would be a little moreoptimistic about how much we might be able to do in the way ofcontaining inflation.Now, when we get to the policy issue, I think there are twoclear alternatives here. Everyone recognizes that we can't do muchabout the aggregates issue [this year]. But what we do will make somedifference for next year. Most people have focused on the firstchoice, the desirability of maintaining our credibility by notappearing to have thrown in the towel by overreacting and lettinginterest rates come down too fast. But that deals with only one ofthe two credibility problems we have. That one relates to the beliefon the part of a lot of people that generally we've erred on the sideof ease [in the past]. But there's another credibility problem andthat is that we haven't had a very good record of hitting our targets.And that is the one that impresses me more. So, I'd like to focus onthe risk that the continuation of the shortfall in M1-B might worsenthe recession and thereby impede our efforts to reduce inflation overthe longer run. If this downturn is really serious, the pressures aregoing to be pretty unbelievable for us to ease later on. So, I wouldfavor this second course of action. And if we do follow that, it'scertainly likely that we're going to have to let rates fallsignificantly. I don't know how far and no one else does. But Idon't think the market would necessarily conclude that we have thrownin the towel if this is the path that we follow, so long as M1-B isnot moving above what we set as our long-run target. So, that's theway I would like to go. I'm well aware of the limitations of M1-B;but even with its imperfections, I believe it's a better target thananything else we have. And that preference of mine has beenstrengthened by the considerable weakness we've had in the economyfollowing the weakness in M1-B. We've had strong M2 growth and yetthe economy has weakened pretty considerably. So, my preference isfor alternative A, Mr. Chairman", "MR. ROOS. If I were to express a preference among the threealternatives, I'd lean toward \"A\" or \"B.\" But, as has been statedbefore, this decision is a very short-run decision. If what hashappened in the past few months were to happen over the next twomonths, regardless of whether we choose \"A,\" \"B,\" or \"C,\" we probablywon't hit our choice right on the nose. So, I don't think what we dotoday is all that important. I do think, though, that what we do inour next two meetings is extremely important, and I'd like verybriefly to address myself to a couple of concerns that I've had as Ihave listened to the discussion today.First of all, regardless of the terminology that tendssometimes to disguise it, there is significant sentiment beingexpressed that we should revert to paying primary attention tointerest rate stabilization. That was our practice prior to October1979. This [view] is apparently based on some very real skepticism asto whether the aggregates are meaningful, whether they're definable,and whether they're controllable. I've heard a lot of people say thatM1-B should be discarded because M2 somehow or other fits somewhatbetter today. I would remind those people that if M2 were really themeaningful aggregate and were growing as strongly as it has, wewouldn't be faced with a problem of the slow economy and recessionarycharacteristics that we're facing today.-26-11/17/81However, I think there's an even more fundamental concern aswe look ahead and that is the decision as to whether or not we oughtto revert to our former practices. We know that our mission is to tryto achieve reasonable price stability and to achieve steady economicgrowth. As some of you have said, it's not desirable to have [large]variations or ups and downs in interest rates. Well, I would remindyou that prior to October of 1979 we spent precious hours discussingwhether or not interest rates should be set 1 point or 1/2 pointhigher or lower. We attempted to conduct monetary policy by targetingon interest rates. And I would remind you, unless I misread whathappened, that when we convened on October 6, 1979, after many yearsof carefully attempting to guide the ship by controlling interestrates, we were very concerned that we had seen significantfluctuations, cyclical and other types of fluctuations, in economicactivity and we also were experiencing shockingly high rates ofinflation.Now, even though we may assume that our efforts to controlthe aggregates have not been as fruitful as we might have wanted, ifyou review what has happened since 1979, I think you would concludethat there is some relationship between the behavior of the aggregatesand price stability, lagged, and economic growth. Compare the timeswhen the aggregates grew above our ranges and see whether or not therewas a stimulative effect on the economy a few months afterwards.Indeed, [consider] whether the slow growth we've had isn't reflectedsomewhat in the present weakness in economic output that we'reexperiencing. So, I would conclude my remarks merely by saying that ifwe decide that [what we did in] October '79 was wrong, then let's tellthe world that we're going to go back to where we were prior toOctober '79. I would submit that if we do that, we would have themost violent upward movement in the interest rate pattern imaginableand our credibility would be forever destroyed, because our Chairmanhas done a very effective job of convincing people that we aredetermined to pursue this new course. But if we start equivocating,if we start waffling, I think we're in for severe problems. These aresome of the issues that perhaps we will discuss in the next couple ofmeetings. Certainly today there are a lot of people who would say:\"Let's pitch out [the decision of] October '79 and go back to interestrate stabilization", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I would argue that we should havesomething close to alternative C, say 6 percent, for October toDecember", " Oh, for the two months, October--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Or 5 percent for September toDecember, if you want to use that, but I think it would be silly toformulate it that way in the directive. Secondly, I also think afunds rate range of 11 to 16 percent makes sense because we've hadthis sharp decline of about 300 basis points in the fed funds rate.And if it were to drop to 11 percent from 13-1/4 percent within theremaining six weeks of this year, that's a very substantial drop. Iwould find it surprising that people would want to see it drop fasterthan from 13-1/4 to 11 percent within a 6-week period. I believe thatthe recession will continue into early next year and that there willbe further pressures to continue the downward [trend] of rates, whichI think we have to accept. My only point is that [the decline] bemoderate and orderly or we will have a perverse reaction in the bondmarket. Now, I would assume we would start with an initial borrowingof $350 or $400 million. I also would agree that if growth in themoney supply comes in higher, we could accept that. The disadvantageof targeting higher monetary growth is that there's a greaterlikelihood that we will get a decline in interest rates at the frontend of the period at a much more rapid rate, instead of spreading itout over a period of months in a more moderate way", "MR. BOYKIN. But isn't there still a question of whetherit's interstate or intrastate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It doesn't", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON", " That's why a shortfall--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've used language of this sort before,Chuck. That's ridiculous, if I may say so", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are not when you take account of M2.That's just wrong", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I agree with Chuck, but for differentreasons. My concern is that the markets will assume that we mean onlya very modest shortfall if we say a shortfall will be accepted.Secondly, I'm concerned about the [possible] interpretation of thecaveat about declining rates. We'd have to say at least an \"orderly\"decline of rates, or something like that, which doesn't imply thatwe're pushing gung-ho for that. I think on balance there's lessdanger of misinterpretation if we use the other alternative--if we putin something like alternative C and say we will accept something lowerthan that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What are you going to do in yourconception if growth comes in less than alternative C", "MS. TEETERS. I would prefer alternative B with the 10 to 15percent. I think there is a real problem of perception in that itlooks as if we've tightened monetary policy at the wrong time if we gowith the 5-3/4 percent target for M1-B", "MR. PARTEE. $200 million is awfully low as a start forborrowing", "MS. TEETERS. I don't like next year's targets; I thinkthey're too low. I hate to commit myself to them; it gets to thepoint that we can't do anything about them in February. We'resupposed to take a new look at them in February. This freezes us inconcrete as to what we're going to do for next year's target", "MR. WALLICH. Well, I'm concerned mostly about thepossibility of the funds rate falling below the discount rate and ofvery low borrowing. Then things could get out of hand and confront uswith the need to keep lowering the discount rate in order to preventthat. For that reason, I would start off with a [relatively high]borrowing assumption and I would like to consult at a somewhat higher[funds rate] level on the way down. Consulting doesn't mean that onestops there. But at least at a time when much higher mobility ofinterest rates is a possibility, we ought to look at it earlier ratherthan later. So, I would go for $400 million for borrowing and 12 to16 percent on the funds rate without any expectation that it would goto 16 percent. But neither would I like it to drop below 12 percentwithout talking about it", "MR. CORRIGAN. The next six weeks matters, too, if we getborrowings down to whatever that frictional level is. I agree withGovernor Schultz; I have a hunch that the frictional level ofborrowing is higher than Steve was suggesting, although I can't besure", " Well, roughly it would be $200 million lower onthat, having started the path at---42-11/17/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It would be $200 million lower by thelatter part of December", " Did you sayconstruct a path on \"A\" or--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that is one alternative one couldtake. But we would not be very quick about making discretionaryadjustments. It depends upon where we start off or what people thinkabout this. If we start off at $400 million and it fell to \"B\" or \"C\"or a little less, we're going to end up with $200 million. If it fellmore sharply than that to well below \"C,\" we're going to end up at alower level and we may run into the federal funds rate constraint.That's what the operational decision is. Now, if we set it up theother way, it depends upon where we set the initial level ofborrowing. In either case, I think we're saying that if it runsabove, we don't do a thing--we accommodate it--which we've done oftenin the past", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I'm assuming the same range of$350 to $400 million. If you construct the nonborrowed reserve pathon \"A\" rather than \"C,\" then there's a greater risk that we'll get thedownward pressure earlier and to a larger degree", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The discount rate will be an importantconsideration in where the market [goes]; in fact, that's going to bemore important than this other thing. I'm afraid that the only twothings that are going to make any real difference here, in the rangethat anybody is talking about, are if somebody says we want to go allout and make sure we're going to hit 7 percent M-1B growth and weought to start with zero borrowings. Then we'd be talking about avery different kind of approach. But with the initial borrowing levelsomeplace in the range that we're talking about, these otherdifferences are going to be minuscule in a mechanical application ofthis [directive]. What is going to make the difference is if and howquickly the discount rate is changed and whether we make adiscretionary adjustment as we go along", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What you're saying, \"in a deliberate,orderly way\" makes a difference of maybe $25 million in borrowings inthe second week in December", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is that wrong, Mr. Axilrod", "MR. FORD. The appearance matter that Nancy mentioned is theone that keeps coming up in my mind. If this reads that we tightenedthe bands for the aggregates and we did not lower [the funds raterange]--we're at 12 to 17 percent now and you say we're going to go to11-1/2 percent or stay at 12 percent, as a number of people haverecommended--it's going to come off that the economy is crashing downand the Fed is cheering it on, possibly. Possibly", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Chuck, if we move in your directionto the 7 percent for October to December--I don't mean September,[but] October to December--would you accept a funds rate range of 11to 16 percent", "MR. WALLICH. Because it should be $1 billion", "-48-11/17/81CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you telling me the difference in thetheoretical money supply--not the actual--for December between 6percent and 8-1/2 percent is only $400 million in December", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Unfortunately, with all due respect, thatisn't worth much", "MR. SCHULTZ. That's where it begins to bother me", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, it seems to me the more we go for thereserve path under alternative A, the greater the likelihood thatwe're going to run into the frictional level of borrowings very soon.If you can agree with the staff's forecast that the actual moneygrowth is more likely to be \"C\" than \"A,\" and then you say to yourselfthat, if anything, we're more likely to come in below that than aboveit, you've really compounded the problem that I've been worrying aboutby selecting 8 or 8-1/2 as the money number on which we calculate thenonborrowed reserve path. Although it's true that it's only $40million on average for the full month of November, it's going toaccumulate to a lot more than that on an ongoing basis by the fifthweek of this period. I think it gets to be a rather significantdifference", "MR. PARTEE. Yes, I think the question is: Should we haveserious downward pressure on rates, if we have shortfalls--not only,as Lyle says, from 8-1/2 percent down to 5 percent, but below 5percent or whatever it is. Shouldn't we be having serious downwardpressure on rates because of the weakness that that implies for theeconomy", "MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I have an instinct--Mr.Sternlight may have a different one or may share it--that when we'retalking about borrowings between $100 and $350 million, neither of uscould argue that the funds rate would be--. At the low end there's alittle greater odds that it will drop below the discount rate. At thehigh end there may be a little greater odds that occasionally it willbe trading a point above the discount rate. But basically it would bearound the discount rate, I think", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Or we'll have our consultationearlier if we agree on an 11 percent floor rather than a 10 percentfloor", "MR. PARTEE. Well, that's not the same as we had the lasttime. \"A\" is what we had last time", "MR. SCHULTZ. Yes", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I would go with Fred'sproposal. To me it's really important that we not repeat what we didlast year. That's the one time I dissented and I'd have to dissentagain, I think, if the fed funds floor were put so as to permit such asharp drop in the funds rate over a short period of time", "MR. PARTEE. It couldn't be", " My feeling in substance isthat we ought to consult at 11 percent, but I--MR. FORD. I don't think we should do this now. With a rangeof 6, then 5, and then 4 points, we're going to be charged with comingevery time closer and closer to managing interest rates. Whether ornot they perceive it correctly, that's what is going to be said", " [Unintelligible] the language--MS. TEETERS. It sounds as if we're trying to pull [money]down so we can make next year's target, and we're already below wherewe want to be next year--or where you guys want to be next year", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I don't understand why we want to deviateso drastically from the kind of operational directive we typically setup. In effect, we're using language that doesn't have any meaning tome. And I don't know how it will have any meaning for somebody on theoutside. Why [don't] we go along the lines of what Fred wassuggesting of specifying for the directive that we're seeking M1-Bgrowth of 7 percent between October and December", " Then we know what we're talking aboutCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think you're going to getagreement on that. I'm allergic to [unintelligible] down everymeeting, if I may say so, some target for the next 5 weeks that hasnothing to do with [unintelligible]. It's just the law ofdistribution; we don't come very close to it, whether we're above orbelow it. I'd like to relate the actions in one meeting to theactions of the previous meeting. It's just presentational. We didthat, I guess, last time. I forget what we did last time insubstance, but it was some kind of reiteration of the target at thebeginning of the quarter", "MR. WALLICH. Then do we accept it if gets higher", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, we're talking about $400 million, as Itake it", "MR. CORRIGAN. What if we took your language there--I'm notsure I have it right--and got rid of the business about the generallydeclining interest rates and next year's targets, and just had theinitial reference to 7 percent growth for the quarter. We could putin a phrase that said the Committee sought growth in the monetaryaggregates consistent with the 7 percent, taking account of theshortfall in October, and said nothing else", "MS. TEETERS. But affirm the target for the last two months", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Mr. Chairman, if I may say so, in response toPresident Solomon's comment: I'm not an expert on public relationsbut the Committee had put down a third-quarter number of 7 percent; itwas missed and I think it was understood. For the fourth quarter anumber of 7 percent also was put down, which will probably be missedand probably will be understood. But if the Committee then decides toput down a November-December number that is also 7 percent, people aregoing to wonder after you've missed that one. This would be yourthird try", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We keep promising these short-term resultsthat we don't get. That is precisely what bothers me", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, what we're trying to do isstructure a compromise, Si. We're most likely to hit alternative C orbelow, but that's not acceptable to a substantial number of people,Chuck and others.

They had a poor October-November. Since thenthey've done reasonably well with all these sales; they ran a 12percent increase in nominal terms.

Generally speaking, thebusiness CEOs I've been speaking with, as distinguished from thefinancial CEOs, are much gloomier and expect a greater-than-averagerecession and, some of them [are especially gloomy]. I'm not talkingabout the interest rate sensitive industries but, for example, carloadings on the railroads. The head of one of those railway outfitssaid that it was the worst he'd seen in--I forget the period of time--many, many years; it was worse than in the 1974-75 drop.

I'd be interested to know what people arehearing about the labor situation. Jim puts together some tables onwage concessions, every week or so I guess, and they are lengthening.I was on the plane Friday with a fellow who recently retired as headof one of the major trucking companies, and he said that a lot of theTeamster locals are likely to go with just a cost of living increasebecause the competition is just tremendous and, indeed, a lot ofunionized trucking companies look as if they are not going to make it.What kind of noises do you hear as you talk to CEOs", "MR. BOEHNE. I hear throughout my District a sense that labornegotiations are not going to be as tough--that there will beconcessions and that there may even be some inroads into cost ofliving indices. But as far as the outlook goes, what I hear is thatthey think the unemployment rate is going to go higher than in theGreenbook forecast. I hear more and more stories of lay-offs; and itis that fear of lay-offs that I think is affecting the climate inwhich these wage negotiations are taking place. I share Tony's viewthat there seems to be more pessimism in the manufacturing area thanin the retail and financial areas, but what I get is uncertainty. Weare in the phase of the business cycle where there is a downward slideand nobody has a good feeling about whether that slide is going toaccelerate or taper off. There is a feeling that the economy willrecover in the middle of the year, but I would guess the sentiment isthat the recession will be average to worse. And that, too, iscontributing to a more favorable [climate for] wage negotiations", "MR. KEEHN. On the specific question--I'll comment [on mygeneral views] later--I think there has been within the last 30 to 45days a decided shift on the part of labor out our way. Their focus isnow shifting from concentration on the financial aspects of thepackage to the job per se. For example, the UAW has indicated awillingness to reopen the auto workers contract; the Teamsters havereopened [their contract] and the trucking people that I talk toexpect some significant concessions there. The UAW has specificallysaid they will reopen the Harvester contract; there they are going totry to get rid of the last increase that was given in October andthere is going to be a discussion about the COLA increase coming up inthe next couple of months as well as the pension increase that isscheduled for April. Harvester expects to get a hundred milliondollars a year out of the renegotiation the union has authorized. Iwould echo Tony's comments; the industrial CEOs I have talked to areextremely gloomy and are expecting a very difficult 1982--a far deeperrecession than most of the financial people I've talked to anticipate.Therefore, I think they are going to go into negotiations with atougher attitude than they might have had six or eight months ago.

They will have even a greaterbearing than what recent conversations with people in business mightindicate for the future. If we choose to set targets that imply afaster rate of money growth than we are presently experiencing, we areinevitably going to have a step-up in economic activity after a fewmonths.

On some of the points you have mentioned, in ourend of the so-called Sun Belt things are not really all that sunny.Specifically, for example, on Nancy's point about the pre-sales in theretail area, we are definitely seeing a whole lot of that. We have 45board members in our District and a number of them are retailers; theyhave been telling us that their sales are flat to down in real terms.They may have a nominal increase in dollar sales, but a lot of that iscoming on white sales that were taking place in December and Novemberinstead of in January and later. So, they are a little depressedabout that. The tenants in the large Atlanta malls are concernedabout their inventories being high and are having to do heavypromotions to keep their sales up. On the employment side, we areseeing some rather heavy layoffs in the more industrialized areas ofour District, particularly in the housing-related carpet industry. Weproduce half the carpets in the United States in northern Georgia andthey have experienced a 50 percent drop in production in the last fewmonths. So, we are seeing big problems there. Some of our major-13-12/21-22/81employers, like Fruehof in Florida and even Excel in Orlando and theFord glass plant in Nashville, are all laying off big chunks of theirlabor force. In the service industries, which someone else askedabout, we are finding some problems. Air Florida, one of the morerobust regional airlines, has had a very heavy cutback on itsemployment, as some of you may have noticed in the newspapers. So, weare seeing pretty much across the board in both the service and themanufacturing industries that the recession is deepening throughoutour area. In some of the [most depressed] parts, in Alabama in theindustrialized areas, we have unemployment rates approaching 12 to 13percent. They are a little [higher] than the northern version inDetroit and that area. So, we are seeing the recession come down inthe Southeast pretty heavily", "MR. BALLES. It used to be that second perhaps only to Texas,the West was fairly recession proof, but that doesn't seem to be thecase today. Looking around for some elements of strength, I have beenhard pressed to put my finger on them. Alaska is the only one of ournine states that still seems to be adding to payrolls. Nonresidentialconstruction, which has been very strong, is still above a year agobut the growth is definitely slowing. And across a wide range ofareas there is developing weakness or a going downhill, even in theaerospace industry, on balance, strangely enough. Lockheed justannounced getting out of the production of the 1011. They are hopingto pick up something in defense orders. The semiconductor high-techbusiness that had such a strong growth trend has turned sour. Some ofthe semi-conductor firms from Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the Westare having extended shutdowns because of excessive inventories. EvenBoeing, which has a huge share of the commercial airline market, isgetting increasing numbers of cancellations. There is morecompetition from the Airbus, etc., and even though they are rollingout a couple of new models in the very near future--the 767 is aboutto come out and the 757 is expected a year later--their sales aredefinitely down and so is their employment. So, it is hard to see thebottom being reached in the near future. The trend is still downwardacross a pretty broad front", "MR. GRAMLEY. [I'd say] that, if anything, we are likely togo through a recession this time which is worse, or somewhat worse atleast, than the average postwar decline. We are talking aboutsomething that is quite pervasive and quite deep. If memory servesme, the average postwar decline in real GNP is about 2-1/2 percent.What we are looking at is a forecast of about a 2 percent decline,which is a milder recession than the average in the postwar period.Now, recessions come in all different sizes, so this is still aclassic recession; there's no question about that. But I have a hunchthat if things work out differently--and they always work out somewhatdifferently than anybody expects--the area I worry about thathappening in is business fixed investment. And I think Mr. Kichlineis right that if we are in for a surprise there, it will be a surprisein which the drop in business fixed investment is significantly worsethan the decline of about 4 percent we are now forecasting. I thinkbusinessmen are very, very pessimistic for a variety of reasons. Oneis that they look for a future of real interest rates that potentiallywill stay up at extremely high levels because of huge deficits in thefederal budget. And they are pessimistic because they have beenthrough a 2- to 3-year period in which each time the economy hasgotten off the ground it has gotten slugged in the head again and goneright back down. They are pessimistic because they are looking atvery, very low levels of capacity utilization. And they arepessimistic because in some areas of the country we have had such[economic] devastation. So, I think we are going to see a bigger dropin business-fixed investment than this [forecast]. We are likely tosee a first quarter that looks very, very bad--considerably worse thanwhat we are now forecasting--and it may stretch out into the secondquarter before we begin seeing things turn up again", "MR. AXILROD. Yes, to the degree that this year might havehad an unusual amount of shift into money market funds [from] marketinstruments or back into depository institutions that would nototherwise have been there, we would have less of that in store nextyear. In any event, maybe somewhat optimistically, we worked our waydown to a growth of just under 9 percent for M2 and M3, but it couldvery well be a little higher", "MR. WALLICH. But why is that", "MR. PARTEE. One of my problems with talking about moneydemand is, as you say, that we don't know what it will be beforehand.I never know what it was afterwards. It seems to me that what we saywas a change of money demand is just the residual that one can'texplain. So I am a little reluctant to do a lot of changing on thebasis of that, although I suppose one could say that this year thereseems to have been a better economy until recently than one would haveexpected, given the very low money growth that we had in M1-B. Iassume you are talking about M1-B", "MR. BALLES. Yes", " It will widen the spread between M1 andM2, but--MR. MORRIS. I think sooner or later we have to recognizethat we can't measure transactions accounts anymore. We ought tostart looking at other things. I think that is a clear message", "MR. GRAMLEY. I just want to say a word about credibility andwhat it means in terms of selecting targets for next year. I thinkcredibility is terribly important. I do think we have improved ourcredibility enormously but we ought to understand why and what thathas to do with the selection of targets next year. We have gonethrough a two-year period in which the first year M1-B ran way overthe target and the second year it ran way under the target. M2 ran-26-12/21-22/81over in both years. The fluctuations in the money stock have beengreater since October of 1979 than they ever were before; so have thefluctuations in interest rates. And somehow we have come out ahead.I think the reason we have come out ahead is because in the pre-October 1979 period, whenever the System was faced with a choice oferring on the side of opting for a lower unemployment rate and moreinflation or the reverse, it opted for the former; and in the post-October 1979 period, we have said we are going to opt to hold the lineon prices and take a higher unemployment rate. That is basically whatthe markets are telling us. That is basically why we have had theimprovement in confidence. We have run a much, much tighter policy.So, what we ought to do is try to figure out what sorts oftargets we need for 1982 to run the kind of monetary policy we thinkis sensible and worry less about the announcement effects or thereactions of the financial markets or the public. On M1-B, althoughFrank has a point that we need to worry about the possibility thatdemand for M1-B will run over a 5-1/2 percent upper end, I think thebigger likelihood is that we will have trouble holding M1 growth up to2-1/2 percent because so many of these innovations, which have justgotten started, will continue. So, I would be prepared to live withthe 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent range [adopted tentatively in July]. Andif it runs below, I don't think that is going to hurt our credibility.On M2, though, so many things are happening that to hold to a 6 to 9percent range runs the danger of having an M2 figure that is againway, way above the target. And I think we could raise that range to 7to 10 percent or 6 to 10 percent or something like that without doingour credibility any damage at all", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have three more names on my list. Iwill not accept any more. And if any of the three on the list--Messrs. Wallich, Solomon, and Black--wish to wait until tomorrow, thatwould be acceptable. If you have an urge to say something, GovernorWallich is first", "-31-12/21-22/81MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think it is ironic thatthe Federal Reserve has switched to monetarism at the very time whenour ability to measure the money supply has eroded dramatically andour ability to differentiate money from liquid assets is rapidlydisappearing. And, therefore, the relationship between what we callmoney and nominal GNP, which is really what we are after, is becomingincreasingly unstable. I think we've lucked out [this past] year. Wehave one target below [our objective] and a couple above and bankcredit barely within", " We only have a month and a half ofexperience--MR. AXILROD. I have not made a thorough research of the pastrecords. I would have to do that", "MR. MORRIS. It is more than that, Larry. If you look atM1-B last year, its relationship to nominal GNP is not what one wouldhave forecast at the beginning of the year by any model that I knowof. And it seems to me that the situation is going to get moredifficult in the future as banks begin sweeping consumer deposits intomoney market funds. So, it seems to me, Mr. Chairman, that the timeis ripe to appoint a new committee on the directive. That committeeshould be charged with finding some target for monetary policy whichis more stably related to GNP than the targets we are currentlystruggling with", "MR. RICE. Do you think we have given monetarism a fair test", "MR. ROOS. May I ask Frank a question very quickly, Mr.Chairman. If we had a shortfall in M1-B this year and we have a weakeconomy, how does that add up to the conclusion that there is littlerelationship between the growth of M1-B and output. I think thatstrengthens the case for the fact that M1-B is a predictor of economicactivity", "MR. KEEHN. With regard to M1-B, based on the results forthis year as a whole and the expectations for next year, I fail to seeany compelling reason to expand the width of the target range. Andlacking any compelling reason to do it, in my view we would make amistake to do that. Therefore, I would be in favor of keeping thespread at 2-1/2 percentage points as it is currently. Lendingcredence to the credibility theme that any change might be regarded astinkering at this point, I would keep the spread at the samemagnitude. But I would continue the program of restraint, which Ithink has been effectively established and, therefore, I would be infavor of moving the range down to, say, 3 to 5-1/2 percent.With regard to M2, again given the results of this year--withgrowth running at or near the top of the range all year long--it seemsto me that the relationship between M1-B and M2 this year has [not]12/21-22/81been terribly tight. And because of the questions about what islikely to occur next year in the components of M2, which we havetalked about a good deal, and the fact that we have established enoughpress regarding the \"noise,\" if you will, in M2, I think this would bean appropriate time to make a change. Therefore, I would be in favorof maintaining the 3-point spread but moving the range up a bit to,say, 7 to 10 percent as a way of trying to get it back to a morecomfortable level for an uncertain year", "MS. TEETERS. We can try", " That is why I hope we [won't] waituntil--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I interjected my question because Iam not sure the research supports anything. And I am not sure we willhave the research that is going to support anything. The nature ofthe problem is that we don't know", "MR. RICE. I don't think we ought to give up on the principleof how to treat these various [monetary measures]. We ought to decidewhere they ought to be", "MR. WINN. I would like to join the chorus of those who arecalling for a re-examination of these measurements because I think weare just playing mumbo-jumbo with the numbers game now. I think wecan do a better job of providing measurements of what money is allabout. And until we do that, Fed targets don't make much sense to mebecause we just explain them away by all these deviations. InColumbus, for example, our money market fund clearings have gone from25,000 a day to 115,000; that gives you some idea of the kind ofactivity that is going on in that area. This is the Merrill Lynchclearing setup. And here is a backward way of getting into thatmeasurement", "12/21-22/81MR. WINN. I think we have to get on with the measurements.[As for] Frank's point on seeking other measurements, unless we havesome measure of the reserve base or something else, we don't reallyhave reserveable assets involved in the money concept. I just thinkwe must get on with an attempt to remeasure some of these magnitudes.They may not be very accurate, but they are a lot better than reachingin the dark for some numbers that really don't mean anything. Andthen if we don't hit them, we explain it away because of all thesedeviations. In view of that uncertainty, I would prefer to stay rightwhere we are with these targets but to get on with the recalculationof some of these numbers. Unless we do that, we won't have any way ofestablishing a reserve basis for these items. We are playing more andmore an inequitable game in terms of those who participate in theconventional forms. It just behooves us to get on with the problem ofmeasurements. I don't think we have any real basis for our shiftadjustment; it [involves] numbers that we had some time ago but Idon't think those are accurate. I urge that we get on with theproblem of a re-examination of these targets", "MR. WINN. Yes, I will make an effort", "MR. BOYKIN. Back to the credibility problem: In terms ofthe long-term ranges, it seems to me that the tentative ranges that wehave published and that have been discussed and seem to be understoodon the outside probably should not be changed at this point simplybecause I don't think we know enough to improve that in any way. I amnot saying they are the best; I doubt that we know what is the bestright now. But M1-B and M2 at least as of midyear seemed to be givingmore consistency in terms of a relationship. Whether that will holdup remains to be seen. I think we should hold to [seeking] a gradualreduction [of these ranges] over time; it's a perception that I stillthink is very important, particularly to those who are lesssophisticated, and we should hold to that. What is actually going tohappen with regard to the innovation that is coming is merespeculation on our part, as we can tell from going around the tablehere. And I agree very much with Tony Solomon that the time to makean adjustment is when we have some pretty firm facts or a basis fordoing it and doing it in a supportable way rather than by conjecture.The idea of giving the first signal that this will be rethought has alot of appeal to me. I don't think the fact that we have never made amidyear shift should [mean] that we never would, if the facts arethere and a change is supportable. So, I would be inclined to staywhere we said tentatively we were going to be and let events unfold;and I'd be ready to make adjustments or changes in definitions, orwhatever will be necessary, but based on more knowledge than we havenow", " And it came out toabout a little less than 2 percent the last time we--MR. KOHN. It was 4 percent, Mr. Chairman", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, 4 percent of the money market funds,but adding 2 percent or a little less than 2 percent or a little lessthan 1 percent is a very [unintelligible]. There are all kinds ofquestions that can be raised about the methodology. There is someturnover to savings accounts that we don't put in at all; there issome turnover to CDs that we don't count at all. On the other hand,it makes no allowance for the fact that if somebody owns a moneymarket fund, even if he doesn't write any checks on it or doesn't takethe money out except rarely, the fact that he has it and knows he canwrite a check on it induces him to hold a lower cash balance than hewould otherwise keep. Now, how do we measure that. I think it is-43-12/21-22/81basically immeasurable, and it is undoubtedly there. We have aspectrum of assets and we are trying to draw an arbitrary line throughit and say this much is M1 and that much is M2 or M3; in fact thearbitrary line doesn't mean anything because it's a spectrum. Iunderstand the frustration. We ought to know all that we can knowabout it; but in fact we are dealing with a spectrum and there isn'tany answer. Nothing is going to fall neatly into what is M1 and M2and M3. We'd have a little trouble if we sat around this table tryingto rationalize the distinction between M2 and M3 and M3 and L. Anysense that after that discussion we're going to get a clean,conceptual difference between these Ms I'm afraid is an illusion", "MR. PARTEE. Well, just so we have everything in front of us,I also would like to point out that there is the problem of choosingthe base in doing next year's targeting. We've rather easily slippedover the fact that there was a considerable shortfall in M1-B thisyear. In fact, Jerry had an interesting explanation for it--and Ithink it's something we ought to work on--that involves a 2-year lookat the expansion of M1-B. But there are a good many people who havebeen greatly afflicted by high interest rates and poor business andbankruptcy who won't quite understand why it is that we just disregardthe shortfall entirely and go on and assign the same old lower growthrate to M1 in the year to come. I think it is a very serious problemthat we have to deal with in explaining, if that is what we want todo, why it is what we want to do. Most people would say we ought toadd our shortfall in 1981 into the 1982 expectations", "MR. PARTEE. No, the law doesn't say that. It says the year", "MR. PARTEE. Well, if we wanted to take that 4-1/2 percent[year-over-year growth] for '81 and have, say, 4 percent for '82 forthe annual average, I think we'd find that the quarterly growth ratewould have to be quite a bit more than that", "MR. AXILROD. Yes. With regard to the implications of thesealternatives for credit markets (and assuming less of a demand shift,so to speak, than took place in 1981) our analysis suggested that theodds were--unless the economy was considerably weaker than is beingprojected--that there would be not much room for further interest ratedeclines under either alternatives B or C, which call for really quitemodest growth in money consistent with the Committee's long-run range.Under alternative A it looked to us as if there was more of apossibility for declines in interest rates given the GNP projection.So, in a sense, one way of putting it is that the Committee's choicewould be to set a target depending on how it tends to lean in itsattitude toward credit markets at this time, before the recovery hasstarted. To the degree that the Committee wishes to give a littleimpetus to easing in credit markets in order to encourage therecovery, that tends to argue, of course, for the more liberal [fourthquarter to March] alternative within the Committee's range. To thedegree that the Committee would want to leave more room for expansionlater and believes the recovery has enough momentum and can turnaround on its own, that tends to argue for an alternative of lowergrowth, leaving a little more room later to finance the expansion asit develops.I should mention one other point, Mr. Chairman, with regardto the borrowing assumption. We have assumed borrowing in alternativeB of around $450 million, which is a little higher than we haveactually attained in recent weeks. Again, to the degree that theCommittee wants to lean toward a little easing in credit markets insetting its monetary target, consideration could be given to loweringthat more toward the levels of borrowing that are suggested foralternative A, which would be around $250 million. That leaves arange, obviously, in between", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I think there's a difference ofview among the technical people as to whether initial borrowing of$350 million means a lower rate or the same rate as we've been seeinglately. Borrowings have been running on average less than the $450million. We might ask both Steve and Peter to comment on what theythink the implications are", "-55-12/21-22/81MR. PARTEE. I am looking at page 2; I can't work with thesealternatives which don't have the correct figures on that. So I amtrying to look at what experience has been recently as against whatwe're plotting for the period ahead. It shows an increase fromSeptember to December--but if anything December is raising it just alittle--and that goes into our numbers that we're calculating lookingahead as maybe something like 7-1/2 percent in M1 as newly defined and12-1/2 percent in M2. You are cutting those to 4 and 9 percent.That's a pretty sharp cut in the growth rate compared with what wehave been experiencing recently. And I think that's too abrupt. Iwould prefer an M1 of 5 percent and an M2 of 10 percent as a centerpoint for November to March. I don't think anybody would be surprisedat that or regard it as being unduly expansive; in fact they mightregard it as being pretty restrictive compared with recent experienceand [given] the shortfall we've had", "MR. PARTEE. You know, it makes a difference. I think Lyleis right that we want to watch that carefully to see whether [NOWaccounts] continue to be the source of strength in M1 and regard thata little differently than if it is in corporate balances or intraditional demand accounts where one might think that a build-upwould be a predecessor, as Larry likes to say, to an expansion inactivity, which also could be the case. We might be right on the edgeof a recovery in the economy and not know it. But it is just not-5612/21-22/81clear to me which is the case. Nevertheless, my basic point is that 4and 9 percent are so far below what we recently have had that they aretoo low to shoot for, and I would rather have 5 and 10 percent butwith your parameters on the funds rate and initial borrowings, Tony", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends", "MR. GRAMLEY. Wasn't this partly a consequence of very littledemand for excess reserves", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it didn't happen in the last part ofNovember and December. I just don't know. It depends upon that funnydemand for money that we can't fully explain in the very short run. Iwould agree with you that it is not likely [to continue] over a longerperiod of time, but I don't know what is going to happen in the veryshort run.I wonder whether [my summary] is consistent in substance withwhat everybody in varying degrees seems to be saying. Well, let meapproach the funds rate first, where there isn't much disagreement. Iwould think 10 to 14 percent makes a lot of sense just in terms of theform. We're about in the middle of that now range and it allows [adecline of] 2 percentage point or slightly more in the federal fundsrate. I don't say that with any feeling that 10 percent ought to bean absolute floor in any sense; it hasn't been in the past and thisseems a logical range to put down. Almost everybody has said thatwith some exceptions. I guess everybody on the Committee has saidthat. I have no problem with that. I wonder a little whether theborrowing level that people were talking about isn't a little high interms of the balance of risks and possibilities here. I'd be a littlemore comfortable with, let's say, a $300 million number than the $350or $350 to $400 million that people mentioned, considering where weare now and considering this average pattern in the past, in order toprovide a little more assurance that rates are not going to rise evenif these numbers come in more or less as projected. So, I would raisethat question.We have a clear majority for around 4 and 9 percent [for M1and M2] on a November-to-March basis. In any event, I think thatwould be interpreted, if that's where we alight, as our not beingunduly concerned by a somewhat higher number than that. If we putdown a higher number, I'd feel more strongly that if it came in lowerand interest rates were declining appreciably, we shouldn't push anyharder than necessary just to hit the 5 and 10 percent numbers. Butthe 4 and 9 percent numbers suit me all right with the understandingthat we're not going to be very upset by some overrun and startingwith a slightly lower borrowing number than the weight of opinion hassuggested here. I'm just a little worried about that borrowing numberbeing a bit too high. And I think we do [need to] interpret thesenumbers--I don't know how to put that in the directive--somehow in thelight of what is going on in NOW accounts, if we can make any sense ofit, as opposed to a general increase", "MR. AXILROD. Well, I don't think much", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm a little bothered by the 5 and 10--more by the 10 than the 5--which is above our long-range target and,unlike M1, coming off a high number not a low number", "MR. PARTEE. But what is going to bring down M2 growth in theperiod", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I was just going to ask. What, ifanything, is your estimate of M2 based upon here, Mr. Axilrod. Whatis the estimate for December", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but what is this number we put down--the 4 or 5 percent or whatever", "MR. BLACK. It's M1", " Well, there's roughly a 12--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We have to be consistent. If thebase is going to be M1-B unadjusted, then December has to be treatedthat way", " That's why we all--MR. AXILROD. Well, that number we know. It's the shift-adjusted number that's a little doubtful", "MR. SCHULTZ. If it doesn't work out that way, we'll kill themessenger", " I was going to say put it in--MR. BOEHNE. If it doesn't work out that way, raise theborrowings", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know how to interpret that commentbut.... The only reason I hesitate a little on the 5 and 10 percentis that the 10 looks a little high to me, just visually. I think thatis what we are talking about here", "MR. BOEHNE. Without being too precise", " But I think a disadvantage of saying \"around 4to 5 percent\" is--MR. BLACK. Well, M1 for last year is estimated to come outat 4.7 percent, and some little downward movement looks a littlebetter cosmetically. I think the 4 percent is a little better than 5percent and I am forced to settle on it for that reason. But Iwouldn't be disturbed if it hit 5 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Would you like to read it", "MR. BALLES. Well, there is virtue in the Chairman'sproposal. We've missed every short-term path this year by aconsiderable margin and I don't know why we should insist on misplacedprecision when we will be lucky to come even close to the intermeetingpath, if the past record is any indication", "\"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, all right. [Our preferences] arealmost symmetrical. It sounds to me as if everybody ought to be ableto live with the \"around 4 to 5", "MR. WALLICH. It is the principle of it that bothers me", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Again, I just want to say that if wedo 9 to 10 percent, then that does imply very strongly a case--and Ithink the markets will definitely read it that way--that we're goingto come out in February with a revised figure that is somewhat higherthan 9 percent on M2", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You know, we are now talking about verysmall differences here. I am inclined to think that we are best offwith the 4 to 5 and 9 to 10 [formulation]. Whether we set that pathat 4 or 4-1/2 percent is going to make what--a $50 million differenceby 3 or 4 weeks from now", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. My concern is not with the substance.We all know the difference is very small. My concern is that I thinkwe are loosing a certain sense of respect because of how outsidepeople see these things. They see an overrun in M2. They see ustargeting 9 to 10 percent, which is over our preliminary M2 target.It seems to me that there will be an immediate feeling in the market--I don't see how we could avoid that--that we probably will move the M2target up in February and there will be talk about some easing. If weare willing to do that, all right; but I don't see how we can avoidthat impression. If we had had a shortfall in M2, sure, we could getaway with 9 to 10 percent", " I don't see how we can escape that marketreaction; if that market reaction doesn't bother you, all right, but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But there will be an explanation in therethat we were high in December, which encompasses this period", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. You are talking about the short term", "MR. PARTEE. There will be a longer projection [horizon],too, won't there. You will have to give us some look at 1983", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I remember that discussion, but Ithought the whole thing was dropped"]}
