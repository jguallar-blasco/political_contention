Approval of the minutes of the 222nd meeting  The Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 222nd meeting, on the understanding that the editorial amendments suggested would  be incorporated in the final text.  Il. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on: - Preparation by the 'Dalgaard Group" and discussion by the Committee  of Alternates; - Statistical charts and tables  A. Statement _by Mr. Dalgaard  The main feature in February and the beginning of March had been the remarkable stability on the foreign exchange markets: the dollar and the yen had been stable and there had been no tensions within the EMS. On the whole there had been only slight fluctuations in both exchange rates and interest rates, and interventions, too, had been on a small scale. There was one smal] difference, however: whereas in January most of the countries with comparatively weak currencies had been able to lower their interest rates and purchase foreign exchange, this had occurred to a very much smaller degree in February.  The stability of the dollar seemed to have been linked to the improvement in the trade balance of the United States and to the feeling that the US authorities considered the dollar to be low enough. This Stability had been achieved without significant support interventions since net dollar purchases had totalled approximately 2 billion in February, compared with 7.5 billion in January and a monthly average of the order of 10 billion in December, November and October 1987. There was nothing to guarantee, however, that the situation would last. In fact, the US trade balance was healthier owing to essentially seasonal factors and could deteriorate again; moreover, a tightening was highly unlikely for monetary policy and virtually out of the question for fiscal policy.  Within the EMS, currency fluctuations had been very limited. The Belgian franc had firmed slightly, enabling interest rates to be lowered and purchases of foreign exchange to be made. The French franc had weakened  slightly against the Deutsche Mark, but this was a very minor change in  view of the growing internationalisation of the French currency and the resultant increase in capital movements.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage mainly provides a list of the participants present at the meeting and discusses the stability of foreign exchange markets and interest rates. There are no conflicting views or arguments presented.


Passage number 2.
 A similar increase had, moreover, been registered in most of the EMS countries, and it was satisfying to see that it had been possible to meet it by means of minor adjustments to the currencies within the band and to interest rates and with the aid of modest interventions.  Outside the exchange rate mechanism sterling had been subjected to strong pressure. For several months in 1987/7 its exchange rate had been maintained within a narrow band, just below the DM 3 threshold, solely by means of substantial interventions. Following a slight weakening in December/January a rise had been recorded in February despite a slight slipping of long-term interest rates, the drop in oil prices and a poor trade balance. However, as the British economy was experiencing strong growth and public finances were in an excellent state, investments in sterling were attractive and free of risk because the market felt that any fall in the exchange rate would be offset by a rise in interest rates. At the beginning of March it had been possible to maintain the DM 3 exchange rate only by means of substantial interventions made, for the most part, in Community currencies, Deutsche Mark, French francs and ECUs.  The Spanish peseta had been firm at the beginning of February, and sizable interventions had been made. As from 10th February the tighten- ing of the swap arrangements offered to banks had resulted in a marked  weakening of the exchange rate and halted interventions.  B. Statement _by Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply stating facts and observations about exchange rates and interventions in different currencies.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 3.
 Janson  The analysis carried out by the Alternates had dealt with:  - the behaviour of the dollar in recent weeks and its prospective development in the months to come;  - the specific development of certain European currencies within  the EMS exchange rate mechanism or outside it.  The Alternates had placed their analysis in a broader context, taking into account not only developments in the foreign exchange markets but also macro-economic developments (summarised in the Secretariat's monthly publication) and prospects for the immediate future.  The Alternates had expressed their satisfaction at the stability which the dollar had exhibited in the preceding weeks. This stability had  shown itself not only in the very small fluctuations in the dollar exchange  rate but also in a sharp reduction in the volume of interventions in sup- port of the dollar (which seemed to indicate that the US current account had been financed by spontaneous flows during the preceding weeks). It seemed that the steadiness of the dollar was due both to underlying and to technical factors. However, the situation was still delicate. The adjust- ment of current-account disequilibria could only be a slow process (given the size of the disequilibria) and, in view of the marked extent to which the trade balance of the United States was affected by seasonal factors, it could not be ruled out that the figures in this respect would, in nominal terms, be less favourable in the coming months. This could have repercus- sions on the standing of the dollar, and the authorities might be faced with choosing between accommodating the downward pressure and supporting the dollar by means of interventions and/or an adjustment of monetary policies. Conversely, a tendency to appreciate might also create problems. The German Alternate pointed out in this respect that in that case the downward trend of yields on long-term securities in Germany might be halted or even reversed. This would be a Situation analogous to that observed in the summer of 1987.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The author presents both the possibility of the dollar's value decreasing in the coming months and the possibility of it appreciating. The German Alternate also points out a potential problem that could arise if the dollar were to appreciate, suggesting a difference in opinion or concern.


Passage number 4.
  Within the EMS the Belgian franc had benefited from a quite sub- stantial current-account surplus and from inflows of funds in connection with the events centred on the -"Société Générale de Belgique" and the in- crease in share prices on the Brussels Stock Exchange. However, these in- flows had been offset, to a large extent, by outflows of funds as Belgian residents had sought high-yielding foreign bonds. The proceeds of the in- terventions effected by the Banque Nationale de Belgique were not reflected in an increase in foreign exchange reserves but were used by the Treasury to reduce external indebtedness.  The strong position of the Dutch guilder was attributable to a combination of structural and temporary factors. The latter included expec- tations of a further lowering of key rates in the Netherlands. The expecta- tions were fuelled by the frequency of the reductions decided on during recent months; a further cut in interest rates would, however, carry the risk of the level of interest rates in the Netherlands falling too far and subsequently necessitating an adjustment in the opposite direction.  The upward pressure on the pound sterling posed serious problems for the British authorities. The upward trend of domestic prices, the sus-  tained growth rate of domestic demand, the risk of the economy overheating  and the prospect of a significant current-account deficit were all reasons for maintaining and perhaps even raising the current high level of interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 5.
 If sterling persisted in its tendency to appreciate as a result of inflows of funds, the authorities would be faced with the choice of either allowing the pound to appreciate beyond the DM 3 threshold, which they had just done the day before, or to continue their diversified interventions in ECUs and certain EMS currencies, or to combine both approaches to some extent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is simply presenting different options or courses of action that the authorities may have to consider. There is no indication of disagreement or contention between different parties or perspectives.


Passage number 6.
 The British Alternate pointed out in this connection that the Bank of England would ensure that the interventions were made in close co- operation with the central banks of the currencies concerned and with due attention to the cohesion of the EMS currencies.  The Alternates also noted that the Banco de Espana had not inter- vened for almost a month. This development reflected, on the one hand, the fall in interest rates in Spain and, on the other, the new foreign exchange policy being applied by the Spanish central bank (which was no longer present in the market on a permanent basis) and the effect of the limits imposed on Spanish banks' spot positions in foreign currencies.  Finally, the Alternates stressed the importance of not restrict- ing the discussion to an analysis of developments on the foreign exchange markets but of taking into consideration also the data on the real economy and the possible repercussions on the behaviour of the foreign exchange and financial markets. In their view, such an approach would meet the objective of the strengthened monitoring procedure, viz. the detection of risks which  might affect the cohesion of the EMS.  C. Discussion by the Committee  Mr. Leigh-Pemberton pointed out that, after the sterling exchange rate had been kept below DM 3 for almost a year, the upward pressure in the early days of March had been such that it had become impossible to carry on and the threshold had been crossed. Basically, however, the exchange rate policy remained the same, i.e. its aim was to ensure the stability of the exchange rate as far as was possible in the context of general monetary policy. This exchange rate policy had been put into effect in 1987, with allowance for certain adjustments to the sterling exchange rate from time to time. The pound was to be prevented from appreciating too much, but also from depreciating too much to stop the “accommodation" of the increase in  domestic prices.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 7.
 On Monday, 7th March, the Bank of England had had to intervene again, taking up fairly large amounts of Deutsche Mark, French francs and ECUs, and it was grateful to its partners for their understand- ing and co-operation, in particular during the past few weeks; it under- stood the problems to which such interventions could give rise, and these interventions had been carried out specifically with a view to ensuring that the EMS parity grid was not disturbed. The interventions in ECUs had again given rise to problems. The Treasury had wished to have greater recourse to this type of intervention, believing such an approach to be more Community-spirited and, moreover, that it would enable certain diffi- culties encountered with interventions in specific currencies to be avoided. But the composition of the ECU was such that in purchasing ECUs, it was inevitable that more than 40% of the purchase would consist of strong currencies and the remainder comprise weaker currencies. That raised in any case the issue of the use of the ECU as a valid intervention instru- ment within the EMS.  Mr. de Larosiere thanked Mr. Leigh-Pemberton for having done the utmost to ensure that the interventions by the Bank of England were carried out smoothly and did not disturb the relative positions of the currencies within the narrow band, and for the co-operative attitude shown over the past few days. However, that was not the only problem. The United Kingdom's intervention to purchase currencies such as the Deutsche Mark, the French franc or the component currencies of the ECU posed a fundamental problem for relations between the European countries and for operating practices within a fragile international monetary system. There was a general agree- ment to stabilise the dollar, but it needed to be appreciated that the equilibrium was extremely delicate: the US current-account deficit was substantial and would continue for a long time to come, while economic adjustment in the United States had made a modest start and was likely to be unconvincing when the foreign trade figures were published every month. Given the situation of unstable equilibrium, the purchase by the central bank of a major country of substantial amounts of non-US currencies, but particularly EEC currencies, constituted a further threat of dollar weaken- ing (it had, incidentally, fallen slightly on Monday, 7th March). It might be asked whether it was sensible to risk rocking the entire international monetary system by making purchases of already strong currencies when a country reached, or thought it was reaching, certain limits. In this  respect one could only applaud the fact that the United Kingdom had  abandoned the DM 3 limit, but the movements which were taking shape on the foreign exchange market as a result of this action were worrying.  Mr. Pohl pointed out that it was precisely upward pressure that the Deutsche Mark was being subjected to that day (8th March) and asked Mr. Leigh-Pemberton why, if he considered sterling to be too strong, he purchased European currencies, even via the ECU, but not dollars, which would have more or less the same effect.  Mr. Leigh-Pemberton, in reply, pointed out that intervening directly in Deutsche Mark had a greater impact on the pound sterling/Deutsche Mark rate than purchasing dollars. It was true, as Mr. de Larosiére had said, that world monetary equilibrium was fragile, but it should not be forgotten that the Bank of England had made dollar purchases totalling nearly 25 billion in 1987. In January 1988, as had already been mentioned, the UK authorities had been of the opinion that in order to influence the pound sterling/Deutsche Mark rate and also because of the vast quantity of dollars accumulated, a diversification of reserves was desirable. To understand this attitude, it had to be borne in mind that the United Kingdom had already contributed substantially to the stability of the international monetary system.  Mr. Pohl observed that the Bank of England had purchased US$25 billion in 1987 but had resold some of this as the official reserves had increased by less. It was understandable that nobody wanted to invest in a currency that was depreciating. However, the G-/7 agreements could not function if one country, like the United Kingdom, expected other countries to purchase more dollars while it diversified its reserves, i.e. sold dol- lars and purchased Deutsche Mark in exchange.  Mr. Leigh-Pemberton acknowledged that 5 to 6 billion dollars had been converted into other currencies, which nonetheless left a net increase in dollar reserves of approximately 19 billion, far more than was the case in a number of other countries. The objective now was not to let the pound rise too high and too quickly. The interventions on Monday, 7th March were intended precisely to control the market and avoid excesses. It was hoped that the pound would quite quickly reach a level at which interventions would no longer be necessary and which would not be too much higher than  the previous exchange rate of DM 3.  Mr. Pohl emphasised that the Deutsche Bundesbank was not prepared to purchase dollars while other banks were selling them or purchasing Deutsche Mark.   Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The disagreement is between Mr. Pohl and Mr. Leigh-Pemberton regarding the purchase of European currencies versus the purchase of dollars. Mr. Pohl questions why Mr. Leigh-Pemberton purchased European currencies instead of dollars, which would have a similar effect. Mr. Leigh-Pemberton explains that purchasing European currencies, particularly the Deutsche Mark, has a greater impact on the pound sterling/Deutsche Mark rate.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 8.
 Hoffmeyer recalled that in an initial report on a common policy in respect of the dollar the Governors had already agreed in 1975 that in the event of dollar weakness vis-a-vis the EMS the central banks should not intervene in the system's strong currencies. But even purchases of ECUs represented interventions of which approximately 50 per cent. was in strong currencies, not 40 per cent., since sterling was one of the strong ECU currencies, which meant, moreover, that the Bank of England was purchasing its own currency.  Mr. de Larosiére thought that a large part of the Bank of England's dollar purchases was not so much an intervention aimed at sup- porting the US currency as a move to rebuild UK official reserves, which had previously diminished. If this interpretation was correct, it should be taken into account. In any case, when a country, for reasons of its own based on the elements of its overall economic policy (growth, interest rates, monetary policy, etc.), considered that it had to prevent its cur- rency from appreciating too much vis-a-vis the dollar or another currency, it was obvious, under the prevailing circumstances and in the context of the Louvre Accords, that its interventions should not involve the strongest currencies. If this was not the case, the very logic of any move to stabi- lise the dollar would be destroyed. The Governors should give this matter serious thought and also take note of Mr. Péhl's comments.  Mr. Janson expressed his satisfaction at the Governors' discus- sion, the outcome of which should be a clear exchange rate policy for the central banks, in particular with regard to their action in the framework of concertation. Thus, if there was a consensus that further falls in the dollar should be avoided, this meant that central banks with strong curren- cies which had to purchase foreign currencies should acquire dollars, and that those with weak currencies should not sell dollars. The problem for the latter was, therefore, to know which currencies they could use to sup- port their own currencies.  Mr. de Larosiére pointed out that central banks with weak curren- cies should sell strong currencies, for example Deutsche Mark, to the  extent that they had any, for one could not demand the impossible.  Mr. Doyle recalled the problem of interventions in ECUs at times of simultaneous sterling and Deutsche Mark strength.  Mr. Janson considered that it was very important that the Gover- nors' agreement on this principle concerning intervention - viz. dollar purchases by those central banks with strong currencies and Deutsche Mark sales for those with weak currencies - should become a clear brief for central bank exchange dealers until there was a complete reversal in the foreign exchange market.  Mr. Duisenberg said that he shared Mr. de Larosiere's concern.  The action on the pound was a sort of unilateral realignment; it illustrated very clearly that one should not try to cope with such a situation using only interventions and realignments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The disagreement arises between Mr. de Larosiére and Mr. Hoffmeyer regarding the interpretation of the Bank of England's dollar purchases. Mr. de Larosiére believes that the purchases were aimed at rebuilding UK official reserves, while Mr. Hoffmeyer argues that they were interventions to support the US currency.


Passage number 9.
 Interest rates should also be used, as the participants in the EMS exchange rate mechanism had agreed, supplemented, if necessary, by budgetary instruments.  The Chairman thanked Mr. Leigh-Pemberton for having opened a very interesting debate which demonstrated the extent of the co-ordination of central bank policies and the means which could be employed to achieve the desired convergence. The observations which had been made contained the seeds for an improvement in the methods of co-operation.  Mr. Dalgaard said that the monitoring group would take account of  the views and comments of the Governors.  III. Adoption of the Committee's report to the EEC Ministers of Finance on developments on the foreign exchange markets of the nineteen countries participating in the concertation procedure during February and the first few days of March 1988  The Chairman took note of the Committee's approval of the  “concertation report", which would be submitted as usual to the EEC Ministers  of Finance.  IV. Continuation of the discussion on the Commission's proposals concerning the full liberalisation of capital movements on the basis of Report No. 63 prepared by a group of experts under the chairmanship of Mr. Dalgaard  The Chairman recalled that the oral report on this question which  he had presented to the ECOFIN Council on 9th February 1988 had been amended - 10 -  to take account of the comments made by a number of Governors at the meeting on 9th February 1988. A text had accordingly been drawn up after that meeting and distributed to the Governors.   Mr. Dalgaard briefly presented Report No. 63, drawn up by a group of experts under his chairmanship, noting that it had been an unusually difficult report to prepare owing to the fact that capital movements raised many complex issues, particularly for exchange rate policy and monetary policy; moreover, even though the experts had met on three occasions, the  report did not contain a consensus on all the issues addressed.  A. Statement by Mr. Janson  The Alternates had found the concluding remarks of Report No. 63 of the "Dalgaard Group" to be a useful basis for drawing up the final  opinion of the Committee of Governors.  1. The Alternates had noted that the conclusions of Report No.

 63 reiterated certain principles that had already been stressed in the oral report by the Chairman of the Committee of Governors to the ECOFIN Council in February:  - the aim of liberalisation in itself met with unanimous support;  ~ in order to ensure that liberalisation did not jeopardise the achievements of the EMS with regard to internal and external stability, it was necessary to follow policies which would foster stability of prices and costs and eliminate excessive external imbalances;  - the participation of all Community currencies in the exchange rate mechanism on equal terms remained a highly desirable objec- tive even if, in conjunction with the liberalisation of capital movements, it could make the management of the EMS more diffi- cult;  - some of the countries in which liberalisation was less advanced stressed the importance they attached to the adoption of adequate measures to improve economic and social cohesion within the  Community.  2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The principles and objectives stated are presented as agreed upon by all parties.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 11.
 It was now agreed that the liberalisation of capital movements as such did not at present seem to necessitate any adjustment of the EMS oper-  ating mechanisms as strengthened in 1985 and 1987. This was not to say that  - }]] -  further strengthening might not be found necessary at a later stage once  more experience had been gained with the technical improvements introduced  recently.  3.  The Governors should address the issues below with a view to  arriving if possible at a common position to submit to the Ministers.  (a) While it was generally recognised that greater co-ordination of  (b)  monetary policies was required in a context of full liberalisa- tion of capital movements, there was disagreement on the appro- priate means of achieving it. Some Alternates were in favour of establishing a framework for the ex ante co-ordination of mone- tary policy for the whole system at Community level and treating any deviations symmetrically.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, there is disagreement on the appropriate means of achieving greater co-ordination of monetary policies in the context of full liberalisation of capital movements. Some Alternates are in favor of establishing a framework for ex ante co-ordination of monetary policy for the whole system at the Community level, while others may have different ideas or opinions on how to achieve this goal.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 12.
 Under this approach a role might be played, for example, by commonly agreed targets for domestic credit expansion and a rule whereby the money creation effects of intra-EMS interventions were not offset by changes in credit to the domestic sector.  Other Alternates favoured a pragmatic approach, stressing that, firstly, too formal an analytical framework was not suited to the unforeseeable and complex nature of the problems associated with co-ordination and that, secondly, the existing procedures were a sufficient basis for improving the co-ordination of monetary policies.  The Alternates were of the opinion that, while noting these divergences of views at the present stage, the Committee of Governors could suggest to the ECOFIN that it pursue its work in this area. Specifically, the Governors could ask the “Raymond Group" to elucidate the proposals made concerning the establish- ment of a framework for the ex ante co-ordination of monetary  policies.  The Alternates were in agreement with the Commission in recom- mending that the conduct of monetary policy, which remained a national responsibility, should continue to be able to rely on instruments and markets designed or organised to ensure its effectiveness. However, the provisions proposed to this end - in effect Article 2 of the proposed Directive and the relevant recital - called for two sets of comments on the part of the  Alternates.  ~ ]. -  The first concerned the room for manoeuvre left to the authori- ties to take measures, for monetary policy purposes, that might run counter to liberalisation and non-discrimination. A deroga- tion limited to the two instruments mentioned in Article 2 did not adequately cater for the range of measures that might be adopted to meet monetary policy needs. In the view of the Alternates a more general formula should be adopted in order to leave room for the conduct of monetary policy.  Secondly, the Alternates shared the Commission's concern to ensure that monetary policy grounds could not be cited in order to introduce disguised restrictions on capital movements. Surveillance therefore had to be exercised in this connection, on the responsibility of the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors, in which the Commission was represented. The form taken by this surveillance must not, indeed, be such as to indirectly result in the conduct of monetary policies being placed under Community jurisdiction, as would be implied by the notification requirement under Article 2 and the reference to a “framework of appropriate Community procedures" in the preamble. The Commission representative had noted that it was at all events the responsibility of the Commission to ensure compliance with the obligations laid down in the Treaty and the secondary legis-  lation.  (c) Diverging views had been expressed on the need for a specific safeguard clause as proposed in Article 3 of the Directive. Some felt that the safeguard provisions contained in the Treaty of Rome were sufficient to cover all conceivable eventualities and an additional clause would do more harm than good. Others, on the contrary, considered that such a clause should form part of the available arsenal of defensive measures and that its drawbacks could be limited by means of appropriate conditions: use only in exceptional circumstances, limited duration, and Community sur-  veillance.  4, The Alternates retained their doubts as to the usefulness of extending the 1972 Directive on regulating international capital flows and neutralising their undesirable effects. The Commission representative had  pointed out that, regardless of what became of the 1972 Directive, the real  - 13 -  question was that of finding the appropriate vehicle to give expression to the following three concerns: the economic and technical justification of the “erga omnes" principle of liberalisation, the possibility for the Community to revoke this principle if necessary, and the indispensability of Community procedures for monetary and exchange rate policies with a view to monetary union.  Mr. Janson concluded by saying that the Alternates could prepare a draft report for discussion and approval by the Governors on the basis of the experts’ Report No. 63, the Alternates’ discussions, the substance of  which had just been outlined, and the Governors' subsequent deliberations.  B. The Committee's discussion  Mr. Ciampi noted that it was not surprising that the work carried out by the experts and the Alternates had not culminated in unanimous reports, given the differences of opinion which still existed; he paid tribute to the quality of this work and made the following remarks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage mentions divergences of views, and the Alternates express their doubts and concerns regarding certain provisions and proposals. They also mention differing opinions on the need for a specific safeguard clause.


Passage number 13.
 The concern, already expressed in January, that the liberalisation of short- term capital movements might involve risks for the EMS found little support within the Committee, and it was to be hoped that events would prove this fear to be unfounded.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage describes a concern that was expressed but states that it found little support within the Committee. It also expresses hope that events would prove this concern to be unfounded. There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 14.
 All possible misunderstandings should be dispelled: as it has demonstrated in the past, the Banca d'Italia favours a further strengthening of the EMS and growing integration in EFurope; its concern is that the proposals or measures which are currently being examined could lead to incoherencies or imbalances which might turn out to be dangerous in the future.  There had been a choice between progressing along the path lead- ing to the liberalisation of capital movements and that leading to the enlargement of the exchange rate mechanism. The choice had fallen on a decisive advance along the former, which would necessarily mean a delay on the latter. The liberalisation of short-term capital movements will pose problems both for exchange rate stability and for the autonomy of national monetary policies.  With regard to the first issue, the Banca d'Italia was anxious to limit the risks of exchange rate instability in order to avoid unnecessary realignments. Two measures appeared to lend themselves to this purpose. Firstly, a recycling instrument which would not be a financing mechanism in  the traditional style but which would be designed and managed in the general  - 14 -  interests of the EMS. Secondly, a new safeguard clause whose existence, instead of undermining the credibility of the objective of liberalisation, would, on the contrary, serve this goal by making it possible to cope with difficult situations.  The liberalisation of capital movements would reduce the scope and autonomy of national monetary policies. As it was not reasonable to think that a single central bank would be able to determine monetary policy for the whole system, with the other member countries being content to follow suit, ex ante co-ordination had to be developed with a view, firstly, to defining and, secondly, to implementing a genuinely Community-wide mone- tary policy. In this respect the Alternates' proposal that the Raymond Group study the issue in depth could only be supported.  Article 2 of the draft Directive was directly concerned with the powers of the central banks, and the Governors should voice their opinion on this. The monetary authorities might be permitted to use instruments other than those listed under Article 2 subject to prior verification that the instruments complied with the spirit of the obligation of liberalisa- tion.  The aim of monetary policy co-ordination could not be restricted to convergence towards low inflation rates; growth was absolutely essential to genuine and sound monetary stability. In addition, the elimination of persistent disequilibria in the trade balance and the balance of payments on current account could not rely on non-monetary policies alone. Finally, it was difficult to accept, as stated in Report No. 63 (page 14), that the co-ordination of monetary policies could work only if there was sufficient support from other policies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage states that there was a choice between progressing along the path of liberalization of capital movements and the enlargement of the exchange rate mechanism. The choice fell on advancing along the former, which would necessarily mean a delay on the latter. This implies a disagreement or contention between those who prefer liberalization and those who prefer enlargement.


This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number15
 A co-ordination of the various policies was of course necessary, but if that argument had been put forward from the out- set, the EMS and convergence would not have become what they were, aided, in part, by the action taken by the central banks.   Mr.  Duisenberg began by pointing out that on Tuesday, 12th April, most of the Governors would have to leave the BIS very early (at 11 a. m. ) to travel to Washington for the meeting of the Interim Committee, and that it would therefore be advisable to organise the times of the meetings so as to leave sufficient time for the Committee's discussions.   The Chairman said that arrangements would be made to take account  of these exceptional] circumstances.  -~ 15 -  Mr.  Duisenberg addressed the fundamental issues raised by the liberalisation of capital mo.

It simply mentions the need for coordination of various policies and the organization of meeting times to accommodate the governors' travel plans.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************vements, commenting on three points, namely the co-ordination of monetary policies, the instruments of monetary policy and the specific safeguard clause.   Regarding monetary policy co-ordination, the Governors had reached an important agreement in Basle and Nyborg in September 1987 which established, in particular, the principle of combining the utilisation of interest rate differentials and a flexible and full-scale use of the fluc- tuation margin, with a minimum of realignments.  Of course, in time, the central banks would have to go beyond the terms of this agreement, but in a pragmatic way.  On the other hand, it would not be sensible to start drawing up and adopting new rules straight away.  The degree of pragmatism to be desired might be illustrated by the example of the Deutsche Bundesbank.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage regarding the need for new rules. The passage states that it would not be sensible to start drawing up and adopting new rules straight away, suggesting a disagreement on the timeline for creating new rules., which displayed great flexibility when in 1987, in the interests of ex- change rate stability, it allowed an overshooting of its monetary targets for the second year running.  It was very unlikely that the Deutsche Bundesbank would have agreed to this overshooting ex ante, even if it had been approved collectively within the Committee.  As Mr.  Ciampi had suggested, the group of experts under the chairmanship of Mr.  Raymond could, nonethe- less, analyse and clarify the issue of the methods or procedures of mone- tary policy co-ordination.   What monetary policy instruments were chosen had to remain the preserve of the relevant national authorities, and, consequently, those instruments likely to have an external impact should be excluded from the Directive.  The Directive, in Article 2, provided.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It primarily discusses flexibility in monetary policy and the need for coordination. for a derogation in favour of two instruments of this type, which had the disadvantage of making this provision seem like a permanent derogation from the obligation to liberalise capital movements.  Article 2 of the Directive should limit itself to empha- sising the competence of the national authorities, which, moreover, had already been recognised in the Treaty.  In this connection the assertion contained in Report No.  63 (Section IV, 1(c)), that derogations other than those specified in Article 2 would only be possible under safeguard clauses, was unacceptable.  However, in order to ensure that the liberalisation of capital movements was not thwarted by monetary measures introduced by indi- vidual countries, it was imperative that the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors examined.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It discusses different aspects of a Directive and the need to ensure that the liberalisation of capital movements is not hindered. the justification for these measures on a  case-by-case basis.  In this context it might be useful for both committees to be notified of certain measures taken by national authorities.  The requirement of notification to the Commission should nonetheless be omitted from Article 2 of the Directive and the list of monetary policy instruments should not be restrictive.  Moreover, the preamble should be amended accord- ingly; more precisely, in the second recital, the expression "Whereas Member States should be able to take, within the framework of appropriate Community procedures" might be replaced by "Within the framework of the restrictions imposed by their Community obligations".   The specific safeguard clause provided for in Article 3 of the Directive did not appear necessary, given the existen.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply suggests some changes or amendments to certain aspects of the directive.Passage number 16.
 Everyone was aware that the Agreement was a compromise in which the Deutsche Bundesbank had gone as far as it could; it had even been harshly criticised by highly respected circles in Germany, whose opinion it was that discipline within the EMS would be weakened by the Agreement, in particular by the increase in the already generous credit facilities. The new facilities had since been used and had contributed to the stability of the system.  Several of Mr. Balladur's and Mr.

 Amato's proposals, in particular those relating to symmetry and asymmetry, had been discussed ever since the inception of the EMS and had invariably provoked differences of opinion. The endless repetition of such proposals did not contribute to the stability of the system. Neither did statements such as that by Mr. Amato, who, according to an Italian newspaper, had claimed that the Deutsche Mark was structurally undervalued, implying that the other currencies were overvalued and that a realignment was in the offing, perhaps even inevitable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention and disagreement in the passage. The mention of Amato's proposals and the fact that they have consistently provoked differences of opinion indicate that there is disagreement among those discussing the proposals. The statement about the stability of the system not being contributed to by the endless repetition of such proposals further suggests contention. Additionally, the mention of Mr. Amato's claim about the Deutsche Mark being undervalued implies disagreement with his assessment, as it suggests that the other currencies are overvalued, which could be seen as a controversial statement.


Passage number 18.
 It was necessary to avoid making this sort of pronouncement in public and also to avoid announcing regularly that the EMS needed to be improved, which only gave the impression that the system was unsound and unable to function effectively.  Mr. Pohl said that he was, however, prepared to discuss the ideas put forward in the memoranda circulated: in particular, the question of how the convergence and the co-ordination of both economic and monetary poli- cies could be improved, given that it was impossible to isolate the one from the other. As Mr. de Larosiere had suggested, the countries partici- pating fully in the exchange rate mechanism should set themselves common ex ante targets. For the time being, and because the Ministers had submitted a request to the Governors, the Alternates could study these issues in depth by taking into consideration the memoranda by Mr. Balladur and Mr. Amato, but not Mr. Genscher's note, which was a personal opinion and not a German Government paper.  Mr. Duisenberg was also of the opinion that discussion of these  issues, which were so high on the agenda elsewhere, could not be avoided - 323 -  and that, as Mr. Janson had said, the Committee should not be caught off guard. It was not easy, however, to decide what should be discussed and what could be disregarded. For a start, in addition to Mr. Balladur's memo - randum was Mr. Amato's paper to be taken into consideration and that of  Mr. Genscher which, although representing personal views, did come from the German Minister of Foreign Affairs. As for Mr. Balladur, should his inter- view with the Wall Street Journal also be taken into account. If so, it should be noted that this article put the accent on promoting currencies'  internal and external stability, whereas in his paper on the monetary  structure of Europe Mr. Balladur emphasised the sharing of the burden within  the EMS, which it might not always be possible to reconcile completely with the commitment to internal and external stability.  The Chairman emphasised that the Governors should turn their attention to these issues because, for one thing, they had been given a mandate by the ECOFIN Council and, for another, they could not remain silent on subjects which involved them and which had been generating various ideas for some time, even if, among themselves, they had differing views as to the practicability of some of the ideas and the timetable of possible implementation. It therefore seemed useful to start the discussion off within the Committee of Alternates, rather than create a new group of experts. With a view to these discussions, the Chairman's office would draw up a document indicating the various questions which should be raised.  Asked by Mr. Janson if the French side wished to add anything with regard to Mr. Balladur's memorandum, Mr. de Larosiére said that, to his mind, monetary stability was a pivotal objective for every central bank and it received top priority at the Banque de France, as at its partner central banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It discusses different views and opinions but does not present any conflicting arguments.
