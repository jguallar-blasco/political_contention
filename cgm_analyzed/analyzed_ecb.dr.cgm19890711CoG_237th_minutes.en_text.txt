I * Pinal text approved at the meeting on 12th September 1989, which incorporates some drafting changes.  The Chairman opened the meeting by welcoming Mr. Verplaetse, the new Governor of the Banque Nationale de Belgique. The Governors were familiar with the important role which Mr. Verplaetse had been playing for many years in shaping Belgium's economic policy and they looked forward to bene- fiting from his wide experience.

  It was also fitting to welcome the peseta into the EMS exchange rate mechanism.  In taking this decision, Spain was aiming to achieve low inflation and promote stability and was therefore contributing towards strengthening the co-ordination and convergence of monetary policies within the Community.   Mr.  Rubio thanked the Governors for their co-operation which had made the peseta's entry into the exchange rate mechanism possible.  Despite the doubts that might have existed regarding the procedure to be followed, the operation had in fact been executed with the necessary speed and efficiency.  The Spanish decision might have appeared somewhat rash, give.

In this context, a few days after the European Council meeting in Madrid, the Government had announced a tough budget for 1990.  The policy mix, which had hitherto been somewhat problematic in that monetary policy had been bearing most of the burden, should therefore improve.  The Government had already taken fiscal measures on /7th July aimed at re.

The passage discusses actions taken by the Spanish government to address inflation and improve economic stability, with a focus on both monetary and fiscal policy measures.ducing domestic demand by approximately 1% of GDP.  On the same date the Banco de Espana had adopted measures to siphon off liquidity by raising its money market inter- vention rate by 0. 75% to 14. 5% and increasing the minimum reserve requirement from 18 to 19%.  The Spanish authorities were aware of the need to reduce inflation as quickly as possible in order to avoid creating problems within  the EMS.   VI.  Exchange of views on the follow-up to the European Council  The Chairman proposed that the agenda be re-arranged to begin with item VI, "Exchange of views on the follow-up to the European Council", for, at the ECOFIN Council meeting held on 10th J.

Passage number 3.
 It had appeared that, if the report's definitions of EMU were accepted, five main questions were open to discussion and debate and might be the subject of counter-proposals from certain Member States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes.

The passage implies that there are points of contention or disagreement concerning the definitions of EMU, as well as potential counter-proposals from certain Member States.



Passage number 4.
  (1) To what extent was EMU to be centralised and, depending on what was decided in that regard, how was this to be reflected at the institutional level (creation of a European system of central banks, strengthening of existing economic institutions or the creation of a new institution). In this respect, the binding rules proposed in the report in the budgetary field had :ed in Madrid to fears that this would lead to a state with a federal structure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. The passage does not show any clear indication of contention or disagreement. It simply discusses different options regarding the centralisation of EMU and how it might be reflected at the institutional level.



Passage number 5.
 In fact, in a federal state 60 to 70% of public spending took place at federal level, while under EMU in the form proposed the proportion would be only 3 to 4%. This put the problem of centralisation into perspective and showed that governments would, via their fiscal policies, remain master of their policies to a large extent, for example in the areas of internal security, education, social security and health.  (2) Democratic accountability, i.e. the question of who was accountable to whom. This question was very important, particularly to the United Kingdom, and simply to say that the powers of the European Parliament would be strengthened was no answer. It was more complicated than that, since the national parliaments had to be involved in this process, given the present conception of Europe.  (3) The role of supporting policies. This question had been dealt with in the report, in which the various criteria determining the location of investment and economic activity had been set out. However, it was as 1992 approached that one would know whether the structural policies introduced with the European Council's Decision of February 1988 had produced the anticipated positive  effects. (4) The content of the compulsory economic and monetary rules.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is discussing various aspects of fiscal policy, democratic accountability, and supporting policies within a federal state and under EMU. It is providing information and discussing potential challenges and considerations, rather than presenting conflicting viewpoints.

 Two governments were somewhat alarmed by the scope of the obligations arising from EMU as conceived in tne report, judging it to be excesSive insofar as they were concerned.  (5) The common currency. Was one necessary and would it be the ECU. This too was a controversial question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The mention of two governments being alarmed by the scope of obligations arising from Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) indicates disagreement or contention regarding the perceived level of obligations. Additionally, the mention of the common currency being a controversial question further suggests disagreement or differing perspectives on the necessity and nature of the currency.

Passage number 7.
  These questions, which had emerged more clearly in Madrid than in S'Agaro, were inherent in the definitions of EMU given in the report. It seemed that one country at least, namely the United Kingdom, was going to make counter-proposals which would call these definitions into question. There could be other approaches to EMU, entailing a redefinition of the concept. It was therefore necessary to distinguish between the controversial questions inherent in the definitions given in the report and the questions which might be raised by another general approach to EMU.  In Madrid the future of the construction of Europe had also been discussed in connection with EMU.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes. The passage indicates that there is potential for contention or disagreement over the definitions and approach to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), particularly with the United Kingdom possibly making counter-proposals that could question the definitions provided in the report. Additionally, the mention of potential alternative approaches to EMU suggests that there may be differing viewpoints on how to define and implement EMU.

 Some would have liked a more binding timetable, because they wanted to go further in the construction of Europe and for them EMU was a necessary step in that direction.   Mr.  Delors said that he was at the Governors.  disposal if they wanted further details of the European Council's discussions and that the Commission was at the Committee's disposal to assist in the review of the Decision of May 1964.  Of course, as had been said to the Ministers, it was for the Committee to take the initiatives required in this area.  T.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply addresses the willingness of Mr. Delors and the European Commission to assist in the review of the Decision of May 1964.hey would all be working under the constraint arising from the decision of the Ministers of Finance to devote the whole of the next informal ECOFIN Council meeting, to be held in Antibes on 9th and 10th September, to discussion of these questions.  The political objective was that at the European Council meeting in December in Strasbourg the Heads of State or Government should be able to note that the preparatory work for the first stage had been completed and that the new texts would be adopted before the end of 1989.   T.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply outlines a planned meeting and political objective regarding the discussion of certain questions at an upcoming ECOFIN Council meeting.he Chairman thanked Mr.  Delors for the very interesting information he had presented and proposed that they commence discussion of the work programme.  First of all, it should be stressed that the Committee should participate in all phases of the preparations for the implementation of the first stage of EMU, which meant that the Committee should examine and give its opinion on the Commission working paper and the draft legal texts,  particularly regarding the monetary aspects, before they were referred to  the Council Pre.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The Chairman is simply expressing gratitude towards Mr. Delors for the information presented and suggesting that discussion on the work programme begin, emphasizing the importance of the Committee's involvement in all phases of preparations for the implementation of the first stage of EMU.Passage number 9.
 This was one of the fundamental elements of the report on EMU and, from that point of view, the multilateral surveillance exercise which the Ministers of Finance had just undertaken was very important. If progress was to be made on both fronts - economic and monetary - it was necessary for the Council of Ministers to take care of the Community's macro-economy and for the Committee of Governors to deal with monetary policy. The more these two bodies were strengthened, the better. The standard of the first multilateral surveillance exercise which had taken place at the ECOFIN Council meeting on 10th July was therefore gratifying,  and it was to be hoped that the Ministers of Finance on the one hand and  the Governors on the other would emulate one another to create two centres for economic and monetary action that would enable progress to be made.  Mr. Ciampi endorsed the Chairman's remarks and had noted with pleasure the information given by Mr. Delors. It was now necessary to work swiftly and in depth, in order to mark out the way ahead in accordance with the principles adopted in the report for the first stage of EMU. The Alternates therefore had an urgent job to do, the broad lines of which could already be laid down today, leaving further details until later. The Governors had to be well-prepared and ready for the next ECOFIN Council meeting and, to begin with, for the informal meeting on 9th and 10th September. If problems raised by the Alternates had to be resolved, the Governors could hold a teleconference, given the conclusive experience in connection with the entry of the peseta into the exchange rate mechanism. The consensus that existed on moving from ex post analysis to an ex ante approach could only be welcomed. The Banca d'Italia had long been strongly recommending this approach, which was necessary to make progress towards a common economic policy and, above all, a common monetary policy. It would also be necessary to take administrative measures and establish a nucleus of young and enthusiastic staff, which would support the office of the Chairman of the Committee of Governor; and report directly to it. The three sub-committees would have to co-ordinate their activities with this general staff and would present their proposals, which the Governors could be called upon to adopt as the work proceeded.  Mr. Duisenberg thanked the Chairman and the President of the Commission for the explanations they had given and agreed with Mr. de Larosieére and Mr. Ciampi regarding the work to be done immediately. The timetable adopted by the Ministers of Finance was tight but it was necessary to adjust to it. The first job was to revise the Decision of 8th May 1964. This text already gave a very wide mandate to the Committee of Governors and would enable it to do virtually everything proposed in the report on EMU. However, paragraph 52 of the report provided for the replacement of the Decision of 8th May 1964. The new Decision should reaffirm the broad principles under- lying the Committee's tasks and would have to be followed, as had been done in October 1964, by the adoption by the Committee of rules of procedure corresponding to the new framework.  Strengthening the Committee's role in the texts did not seem to  present any difficulties, as the main points were already contained in the - 10 -  three indents of paragraph 52 of the report. The Alternates should begin immediately with the drafting in collaboration with the Commission, so that the Governors could come to an agreement before the informal ‘ECOFIN Council meeting. The main aim was to strengthen the Committee; the procedures, the reinforcement of the Secretariat with a small number of additional staff were also necessary, but this had to be left to the Committee, which would decide when the time came.  Mr. Duisenberg turned to the letter from Mr. Bérégovoy to the Chairman of the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speakers are all in agreement about the importance of strengthening the Council of Ministers and the Committee of Governors, as well as the need to move forward swiftly on the tasks outlined in the report on EMU.



Passage number 10.
 He noted that the basic principle in the report on EMU was that a future European system of central banks should be autonomous and independent. In the Netherlands, for example, the independence of the central bank was highlighted by the fact that its President carefully refrained from participating in government meetings. If this national example was taken as a basis, it would be sufficient for the Committee to be represented at ECOFIN Council meetings by its Chairman, who would express the collective opinion of the Governors. Mr. Duisenberg indicated that he was not particularly in favour of participating in or being present at the Council's multilateral surveillance exercises and that he would consider himself to be fully represented by the Chairman. If the Committee agreed, a reply along these lines could be made to Mr. Bérégovoy.  The Chairman broadly shared Mr. Duisenberg's view on participation by the Governors in the multilateral surveillance exercises and wanted to know what the other Governors felt about this, so that he could reply to Mr. Bérégovoy. The amendments to be made to the Decision of 8th May 1964 could be fairly minor and, as in 1964, the Committee could determine the rules of procedure at a later date.  Mr. Pohl thanked the Chairman and Mr. Delors for the very useful information they had given and agreed with most of what had been said around the table, except for the idea of urgency, however. There was no emergency at present and it was very important to discuss the consequences of the decisions to be taken by the Governors very carefully. The Council Decision concerning the Committee of Governors and how it should be strengthened was perhaps the only relatively urgent item; however, this was a legal text, which had to be prepared very seriously in view of the wide-ranging consequences it could have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants seem to be mostly in agreement with the proposal to be represented by the Chairman at ECOFIN Council meetings and the idea of not participating in multilateral surveillance exercises. They are also in agreement about the importance of carefully discussing decisions and preparing legal texts seriously.



Passage number 11.
 It would be possible to do without a new text and accomplish what was proposed in the report on EMU with the Decision of  8th May 1964, but a new Decision might be of greater symbolic importance if - jl -  the Council not only confirmed the content of the 1964 text but also clearly affirmed the objective of a Committee of Governors with a higher profile both in the eyes of the public and in the decision-making process in Europe, and if, moreover, it expressed the desire of the governments, particularly the Ministers of Finance, to strengthen the independence of the national central banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is discussing the possibility of achieving the proposed goals with either the 1964 Decision or a new Decision, highlighting potential benefits of a new Decision for symbolic importance and clarity on the objectives of a Committee of Governors.



Passage number 12.
 This last aspect was also referred to in the report on EMU but had not been raised in the public discussions. And yet it was a very important point, as a more independent Committee of Governors, representing a kind of nucleus of the future European system of central banks, was not possible unless its members enjoyed sufficient independence in their own countries. This point was crucial and must be taken into account by the President of the Commission and all those responsible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states that an independent Committee of Governors for the European system of central banks would require members to have sufficient independence in their own countries.



This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number 13
  The main aspects of the new Decision had been described in the report on EMU and could be briefly summarised as follows: the Committee would be empowered to formulate opinions for the Ministers on those policies that might affect, in particular, the operation of the EMS; it would also formulate opinions on national monetary policies which, although not binding, would certainly carry moral weight.  Finally, the Committee should be invited to draw up not a common monetary policy right away, but a convergent monetary policy.  Domestic monetary policies would remain the responsibility of the individual central banks, but the Committee would satisfy itself that those policies were consistent, in particular with the basic objectives contained in the report, especially price stability.  It would be useful for all these aspects to be formalised in the new Council Decision.  Once it had been adopted, thr Cornittee would be ab.

It simply outlines the main aspects of a new decision regarding the European Monetary Union without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.le to decide freely, without instructicas from the Council, how to organise its work, i. e.  what sub-committees should be set up and what staff would be needed.  As had already been said, a kind of intellectual basis seemed necessary in order to prepare the groundwork for the formulation of convergent monetary policies.  This could of course be done within the Committee itself, but it might be useful to have a small competent, independent group of, say, economic advisers, to prepare that formulation.  Careful thought would have to be given to the status to be assigned to the staff in question.  For example, should they be BIS officials or, preferably, have a rather more independent status.  All these aspects would have to be discussed by the  Alternates.  - 12 -  It would be very important to find ways of expressing in an appropriate manner the views of the Governors, both at ECOFIN Council meetings and publicly.  If .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************the Governors never appeared in public but'left that to the Ministers, they could not expect to be known or to be perceived as being involved in the development of a European system of central banks.  This aspect perhaps reflected more the experience in Germany but it was important; for example, if the Governors obtained the support of public Opinion in formulating a prudent monetary policy geared to stability, governments could not ignore it.   From that point of view, Mr.  Bérégovoy's letter was not an appropriate approach and was at odds with the report's proposals for a more independent Committee of Governors in the process leading to economic and monetary union.  The participation of all the Governors in these ECOFIN Council meetings would weaken the Committee.  The reply to Mr.  Bérégovoy should therefore indicate that at least some of the Governors felt that they were quite satisfactorily represented by the Chai.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. 

The passage suggests that there is disagreement between the idea of the Governors staying behind the scenes and leaving public appearances to the Ministers, contrasted with the proposal for a more independent Committee of Governors. The mention of Mr. Bérégovoy's letter also indicates disagreement or differing opinions on the appropriate approach to involve the Governors in the process leading to economic and monetary union. Additionally, the concern that the participation of all the Governors in ECOFIN Council meetings would weaken the Committee further highlights the potential for disagreement.rman of the Committee.  It could also be pointed out that the Governors met the Ministers twice a year at the informal ECOFIN Council meetings.  Furthermore, a question of principle arose: it was not acceptable that the multilateral surveillance exercises undertaken by the Ministers of Finance and prepared by the Commission should include monetary policies.  In Germany, it would be totally inconceivable that monetary policy should be subject to surveillance by the Minister of Finance, and the same should apply in Europe.   Mr.  Pohl concluded by saying that he agreed that the Alternates should begin their discussions on the organisation of the Committee's work but that, in the immediate future, the most important thing was to prepare the new Council Decision replacing that of May 1964 in the right spirit of co-operation emphasised by Mr.  Delors, taking into account the points already described and approved by the Gove.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It primarily discusses the importance of collaboration and cooperation in preparing a new Council Decision, as well as the need to consider certain principles related to monetary policy.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************rnors.   The Chairman suggested that the Governors should hold a meeting, in conjunction with the informal Antibes meeting, perhaps on Friday, 8th September, in order to review all the subjects, but this suggestion would have to be looked at again, as certain Governors were not sure whether they would be free to attend.   Mr.  Hoffmeyer shared Mr.  Duisenberg's view that they should confine themselves to amending the Decision of 8th May 1964 by incorporating the three indents of paragraph 52 of the report.  He would like to know whether - 13 -  the Commission also shared this view and whether it was necessary or expedient to inform the ECOFIN Council that the other points contained in paragraph 52 would be taken into account at a later stage, when the Committee revised  its rules of procedure.   Mr.  Crockett expressed Mr.  Leigh-Pemberton's regret at being unable to attend and thanked the Chairman and the President of.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The Chairman suggested holding a meeting to review subjects, but some Governors were unsure if they could attend. Mr. Hoffmeyer and Mr. Duisenberg suggested amending a decision, but Mr. Crockett expressed regret on behalf of Mr. Leigh-Pemberton for not being able to attend. This shows differing opinions and conflicting schedules, indicating contention. the Commission for their very illuminating statements.  The United Kingdom was prepared to proceed in accordance with the set timetable, tight though it was.  However, as Mr.  Pohl had pointed out, there was no need to rush the decisions on procedures, structures and organisation.  Building for the future should not be done hastily but on the contrary time should be taken to do a meticulous, responsible job.  The Alternates should therefore deal with the questions, even if this meant holding meetings in the summer in order to make progress according to schedule.   With regard to participation by the Governors in the ECOFIN Council meetings, Mr.  Crockett understood the reasons put forward by certain members against such participation, but he wished to reserve the Governor's position on this point and would therefore prefer a qualified response to Mr.  Bérégovoy's letter.   Mr.  de Larosiére came back to this question .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statements are all in agreement with each other, discussing the importance of taking time to make decisions carefully and build for the future responsibly.Passage number 14.
  As far as the other EMS currencies were concerned, attention had been concentrated on the peseta, which had joined the exchange rate mechanism on 19th June with the wider 6% band. A change had been noted owing to the fact that two currencies and not just one were now using the wider band. This was apparent from the new ''monitoring" graph on positions within the EMS, which showed that currently the lira would not be able to fall much below the lower limit of the narrow band or to return to the level which it had maintained for most of 1988. It could also be noted that the peseta would be unable to reach its intervention rate against the Deutsche Mark while the latter was at the upper limit of the narrow band. In fact, given the current pattern of exchange rates, the maximum level for the peseta against the Deutsche Mark would be about Pts. 62.3, which was not far off the rate of Pts. 62.8 which had been reached on 10th July. The Banco de Espana had explained that the Spanish banks had not properly understood the working of the exchange rate mechanism and the fluctuation band, which accounted for the large interventions required on the first day.  The economic situation in Spain had changed little, save for the recent fiscal tightening of which Mr. Rubio had just spoken. The economy was still overheating, with very strong domestic demand, inflation of the order of 7% and a deteriorating current-account balance. In spite of the appreciation of the peseta in the last two years and the relatively sharp rise in costs, the Spanish authorities did not think that industry lacked competitiveness. Exports had in fact been performing very strongly. In reality, it was demand which needed to be brought under control, and, since fiscal policy had been insufficient, monetary policy had had to be especially tight. Recently, however, the Government had tightened fiscal policy; a first set of measures had been taken in May, and a second set had been implemented in June. Although these measures had not been very forceful, they were steps in the right direction, and they would take a few months to produce their effects. In the meantime, the Banco de Espana intended to maintain a firm monetary policy.  The experts had only been able to touch briefly upon other major problems, such as the sharp decline in sterling and the difficulties  related to the overheating of the Italian and Portuguese economies. - 23 -  B. Statement by Mr. Papademos  The Alternates’ discussion had concentrated on the entry of the Spanish peseta into the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS, recent develop- ments in the dollar exchange rate, the effectiveness of interventions and economic developments in a number of EEC member countries.

  The Alternates had congratulated their Spanish colleague on Spain's decision to join the EMS exchange rate mechanism.  The Spanish Alternate had discussed the reasoning behind the choice of the central rate of Pts.  65 to DM 1 and had described some of the difficulties encountered in the first few days following the entry of the peseta, which had been partly due to the Spanish commercial banks' limited understanding of the functioning of the system.  In addition, he had described the policy measures that the authorities had introduced to manage the overheating economy.  The Banco de Espana had raised the intervention rate by 0. 75% and had increased the reserve requirement from 18 to 192.  In the fiscal area, the withholding tax had been increased from 20 to 252%, the price of petroleum products had been adjusted upwards, and plans had been introduced to reduce ministries' expenditure.  It was expected that, b.

Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement; it simply describes the actions taken by Spain in response to joining the EMS exchange rate mechanism.y improving the policy mix, these measures would reduce the need for further interest rate increases.   The recent weakening of the US dollar had been welcomed by several Alternates as facilitating the international adjustment process and contributing to the moderation of inflationary pressures in the Community.  The dollar's weakness had been attributed to the following factors: less favourable growth prospects for the US economy relative to Europe, antici- pations of an easing of US monetary policy, a further narrowing of interest rate differentials and the turn-round in long-term capital flows in Germany after the decision to abolish the withholding tax.  It had been argued that interventions had not played a major role in reversing the rising dollar trend.  The view had also been expressed that, if the dollar continued to decline, central banks should not act to stop such a decline too soon, but only when te.

It simply presents various factors contributing to the weakening of the US dollar and suggests that interventions may not have been a major factor in reversing the trend.nsions arose and in a co-ordinated fashion.   On the issue of the effectiveness of interventions, it had been pointed out that, although co-operation in carrying out interventions could be improved further, central banks should not convey the impression to the markets that they were aiming at preserving nominal exchange rate stability at all costs and thereby lessening exchange rate risks.  Interventions could  be effective in some circumstances but not in others; their effectiveness  - 24 -  was enhanced if they were co-ordinated, carried out in large amounts and in  a timely fashion, pushing with the market trend and supporting other develop- ments.  In any case, interventions could never replace fundamentals.  The German Alternate had explained that the Bundesbank had abstained from joining intervention efforts on some occasions because, under the circumstances in which they had been carried out, they had bee.

The Alternates had also discussed the issue of the choice of intervention currencies.  The existence of two fluctuation bands could, in certain cases, create problems when a currency which was close to its upper limit in the narrow band was used for interventions and there was thus a danger that the weak currencies might hit their lower limits.  It had been suggested that the use for interventions of the weakest currencies in the exchange rate mechanism, or currencies outside it such as the pound sterling, might lessen these problems.   The Alternates had examined economic and exchange rate developments in a number of Community countries.  The pound sterling had come under pressure mainly for two reasons: firstly, the published economic statistics had given mi.

Passage number 16.
 France was an  exception, and, since the drafting of the report, data on M, had been pub-  lished in Germany showing that it was getting closer to cha 5% growth target. In most countries, even the most prudent ones, domestic lending was being fuelled by a dynamic real sector - consumption, investment and production.  Apart from a few specific responses, such as the adoption of restrictions on the growth of bank lending in the Netherlands, the central banks' general reaction to the following three interrelated factors - rising inflation, the relative depreciation of European currencies on the foreign exchange markets and the strong growth of monetary and credit aggregates - had consisted in a series of increases in the central banks' intervention rates on their money markets. And indeed, the latest move to tighten official rates in Germany and other countries had come just after Report No. 35 had been completed on 27th June.  It should be noted that long-term interest rates had risen less than short-term rates and less than current inflation, which was a reas-  suring sign with regard to the credibility of monetary policies.  (3) Questions posed by the experts  The experts had asked ~- and commented on rather than answered -  the following questions:  Question 1. With respect to imported inflation, the experts had noted that if the dollar continued to appreciate - a development not in keeping with fundamentals (and for once the economists' arguments seemed to have been heard by the markets) - the EEC countries would be faced with the dilemma of having either to raise interest rates appreciably or to import inflation; the choice could not be evaded.  Differences of interpretation had emerged regarding the effec- tiveness of intervening on the foreign exchange markets independently of movements in interest rates, with the representatives of the Bundesbank  expressing doubts based on a now familiar reasoning.  Question 2. On the subject of domestic inflationary factors, it was too early to say whether the recent increases in interest rates, say those of the first half of 1989, would be sufficient or not to reverse the  price trend. On the one hand, a further tightening might prove necessary if  -~ 3] -  after some time pressures were seen to persist, but equally there might be a downturn in activity in the second half of the year and an easing of  \  inflationary pressures.  Question 3. The divergences in fundamentals between countries were still marked on the prices front and were widening in the case of current-account balances. They had not yet jeopardised the credibility of the parity grid in the exchange rate mechanism. However, if the danger of a rude awakening on the markets was to be avoided the divergences between member countries would have to be reduced. In this respect the Group had noted that at present it appeared difficult to implement a greater differentiation of interest rates, except perhaps in the case of the United Kingdom, since this would risk provoking an even greater overvaluation of the currencies of countries with high inflation and a large external deficit. This was what some had called the paradox of the exchange markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The passage highlights differences of interpretation and doubts expressed by the representatives of the Bundesbank regarding the effectiveness of intervening in the foreign exchange markets independently of movements in interest rates. Additionally, there are divergences in fundamentals between countries noted in Question 3, suggesting potential challenges in implementing policies to address these differences and avoid market disruptions.



This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number 17
 Admittedly, there had been instances in which currencies with a high rate of inflation had seen their nominal exchange rate rise, like the dollar between 1982 and 1984, but the philosophy of the EMS prohibited members  from exporting their inflation to their fellows.   Question 4.  The experts had noted that among the non-monetary policies, little use was currently being made of incomes policies in most of the member countries, and that structural measures had been slow in terms of either their implementation or their effects, but that, in contrast, the policy mix was often being guided in the wrong direction.  Thus, fiscal policies had tended to move towards restrictiveness in the low-inflation and surplus countries and to become more (and even highly) expansionary in overheating economies.  In the overheating economies the conflict betwee.

Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.n fiscal and monetary policies partly explained the need to raise interest rates and the overvaluation of exchange rates.  The Spanish delegation had requested that the Report mention that, to mark the peseta's entry into the exchange rate mechanism, the Spanish authorities planned to improve the policy mix, and, as Governor Rubio had reported, measures had already been taken to this end.   In conclusion, the experts considered that the central banks had done their duty in the first half of 1989.  They were now at a crossroads.  They might be required either to maintain for a time, or even step up, their restrictive stance or, conversely, to relax it.  The choice would have  to be made on the basis of a country-by-country analysis of economic  - 32 -  indicators, taking into account the time required for monetary policy to  act, and in the l.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The experts are discussing the need for central banks to make decisions about maintaining or relaxing their restrictive stance based on economic indicators and the time required for monetary policy to act. The mention of the Spanish delegation's request to improve the policy mix and the measures already taken by the Spanish authorities does not introduce any disagreement in the passage.ight of the development of the dollar exchange rate.   \  B.  Statement by Mr.  Papademos  The Alternates had congratulated the Chairman of the Group, the experts and the Secretariat on the highly professional analysis which they had produced, and in general they had endorsed the conclusions of the report on developments in public finance and of that on monetary policies in the EEC countries.  The Alternates had considered that these documents highlighted some unsatisfactory features of macro-economic developments within the Community.  The discussion had focused principally on fiscal policies, their co-ordination and their contribution to macro-economic convergence within the EEC.  It had been felt that some countries had adopted fiscal policies which placed an excessive burden on monetary policies.  In some countries the policy mix was cle.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The Alternates are congratulating the Chairman, experts, and Secretariat on their professional analysis and generally endorsing the conclusions of the report. The passage goes on to discuss concerns about fiscal policies and their coordination within the EEC, but there is no indication of disagreement among the Alternates on this issue.Passage number 18.
  The EMS remained without tensions and relative positions were on the whole little changed. The Spanish peseta entered the exchange rate mechanism where it stabilised in the upper part of the wide band.  The Deutsche Mark firmed against most of the currencies officially quoted in the Federal Republic; its weighted index vis-a-vis eighteen industrial countries rose over the month by 0.9% to stand at 174.6 at the end of June (1972=100). Much of the strengthening can probably be attributed to the announcement of the abolition of the withholding tax and the consequent slackening of capital outflows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply describes the stability of the EMS and the strengthening of the Deutsche Mark against other currencies due to certain government announcements.



Passage number 19.
 The Deutsche Mark's performance vis-a-vis the currencies participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism was uneven, with gains counterbalanced by losses. With effect from 30th June the Bundesbank raised its discount and lombard rates by 0.5 percentage point to 5% and 7% respectively.  The French franc remained relatively stable for the greater part of the period under review against the background of an upsurge in domestic interest rates. However, the announcement on 29th June of a marked deterioration in the trade balance in May (a deficit of Fr.fr. 6.64 billion in seasonally adjusted terms, compared with a deficit of Fr.fr. 3.69 billion in April) caused the exchange rates to fall slightly. With effect from 30th June the money market intervention rates were raised by 0.5 percentage point to 8.75% and 9.5% respectively.  The Belgian franc remained stable. In the wake of the decision taken by the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banque Nationale de Belgique raised its discount and lombard rates by 0.5 percentage point to 9.25% and 9.5% respectively. Its interventions resulted in some net sales of currencies.  The position of the Dutch guilder near the top of the band remained virtually unchanged. In line with similar moves elsewhere in Europe, the Nederlandsche Bank raised its official interest rates by 0.5 percentage point effective 30th June, bringing the discount rate to 6% and the lombard rate to 6.752.  The Danish krone remained the weakest currency in the band. Following the rise in official German interest rates, Danmarks Nationalbank raised its main interest rates by 0.5 percentage point, effective 30th June 1989.  Outflows by residents, having moderated in May, resumed on a substantial scale in June.

 No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. All the statements are factual and descriptive, each focusing on the monetary policy actions taken by different central banks in response to developments in their respective currencies.



Passage number 20.
 While allowing the Irish pound to weaken somewhat in the upper half of the EMS band, the Central Bank also responded with sizable net sales of foreign currency. On 30th June, following increases in official interest rates by other European central banks, the Bank increased its Short-Term Facility lending rate by 1 percentage point to 102%.

 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.



Passage number 21.
  During the period the Italian lira remained relatively stable in the upper part of the EMS band and the Banca d'Italia conducted limited interventions to smooth the oscillations of the exchange rate.  Up to 9th June the Spanish peseta continued the depreciation initiated at the end of the previous month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes the stability of the Italian lira and the depreciation of the Spanish peseta.

Passage number 22.
 Later on, after a period of stability, the inclusion of the peseta in the EMS exchange rate mechanism on 19th June gave rise initially to strong capital inflows and subsequently to a stabilisation of its rate in the upper part of the wide band. In all, it ended 0.6% higher with respect to the ECU and 1.9% higher with respect to the US dollar.  Sterling came under pressure in June as the market perceived signs of dissension within the government over UK economic policy. In spite of persistent official support, it fell sharply against all currencies during the first half of the month. Although sterling subsequently recovered against the softer dollar, the atmosphere remained nervous and the Deutsche Mark cross-rate continued to edge lower. The publication of better than expected UK trade figures for May on 26th June sparked a strong rally, but the pound later fell back towards its low in the wake of the increases in European interest rates. Sterling's trade-weighted index fell by 2.2% to 90.2 (1985=100).  The first half of the month the Greek drachma came under some pressure, mainly due to the national elections. However, following the national elections this pressure diminished. On balance the drachma depreciated vis-a-vis the ECU by 0.5% while against the US dollar it appreciated by 0.8%. In effective terms the drachma declined by 0.62.  In effective terms, the Portuguese escudo depreciated by 0.252, in line with the objectives defined by the authorities. Against the US dollar the escudo rose by 0.92%.  The interest rate shock that had been induced by the introduction of the flexible lombard rate eased at the beginning of June and euro-franc rates dropped by more than 1 percentage point. Despite this development the Swiss franc stabilised at an increased level; it firmed by about 1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes, there is contention in the passage. 

The passage describes fluctuations in various currencies against the ECU and the US dollar, indicating changes in trade-weighted indexes and effective exchange rates. The varying movements of different currencies suggest disagreement in the foreign exchange market regarding the strength or weakness of each currency.

5% vis-a-vis the EMS currencies and by 2.5% against the US dollar. On an export-weighted basis, the rise amounted to 2.25%.  In line with other central banks the official discount rate was raised by 1 percentage point to reach 5.5% with effect from 30th June 1989. The purpose of this step was not to tighten further central bank money supply but to adapt the discount rate to the domestic interest rate level. Nevertheless, this measure was received by the market with rising interest rates.  The Austrian schilling appreciated vis-a-vis the US dollar by 1.7%. It fluctuated against the Deutsche Mark by only 0.07%. In line with the corresponding interest rate increases in other countries, the discount rate was raised from 5% to 5.5% and the lombard rate from 6.5% to 7.5% with effect from 30th June. The higher rate of increase in the lombard rate is primarily intended to provide scope for fine-tuning of interest rate policy in the context of the open market policy. The rate for short-term open market operations was increased from 6.25% to 6.5%, also with effect from 30th June.  The Norwegian krone moved within a fairly narrow range around the central value of the currency index. On 22nd June Norges Bank reduced its overnight lending rate by 0.5 percentage point to 10.0%. The krone weakened somewhat towards the end of the month and the central bank intervened in order to stabilise the market. The krone ended 0.2% weaker in effective terms.  The Swedish krona traded in a narrow range and the currency index fluctuated between 130.4 and 130.8. On lst June the Riksbank announced that it would abolish virtually all the remaining currency regulations effective from lst July.  The Finnish markka weakened in effective terms by 0.5% towards the end of the month as interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the major currencies decreased.  The Japanese yen depreciated sharply against the US dollar in the first half of the month mainly due to heavy speculative dollar buying reflecting the political turmoil in China. However, massive and aggressive  intervention by the Japanese and foreign monetary authorities pulled the yen back up in the second half for it to close at Yen 143.95/US$. Meanwhile, the yen depreciated by 2.2% against the ECU.  The Canadian dollar closed the month at US$ 0.8355, up 0.927 against the US dollar. The appreciation of the Canadian dollar took place against the background of a widening in interest rate spreads between comparable Canadian and US money market instruments and, later in the  month, the sharp drop of the US dollar against the major currencies.  Il. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Net sales of US dollars amounted to US$ 15.5 billion, compared with net sales of US$ 19.1 billion in May. The main sellers were the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The Banco de  Portugal and the Banco de Espana were the largest net purchasers.  B.

Passage number 24.
 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies and private ECUs by Community central banks amounted to the equivalent of US$ 0.4 billion, compared with US$ 3.7 billion in May. The interventions consisted mainly of purchases of ECUs by the Banco de Espana. The Sveriges Riksbank purchased a substantial  amount of Deutsche Mark.  III. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH, UP TO 7TH JULY  Downward pressure on the dollar continued during the first few days of July as a result of persistent expectations of an additional easing of monetary policy in the US.

 The middle rate of the currencies participating in the EMS represents the daily average of the excnange rates of those two currencies which nave the largest divergence from their current bilateral central rates, with a maximum fluctuation of 2.25%.  7.7.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes. 

Explanation: This passage is discussing the middle rate of currencies in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, and it states that the middle rate is calculated based on the exchange rates of the two currencies with the largest divergence from their central rates. The maximum fluctuation allowed is also mentioned. This could potentially lead to contention or disagreement as different parties may have varying opinions on the calculation methodology or the maximum fluctuation allowed.
