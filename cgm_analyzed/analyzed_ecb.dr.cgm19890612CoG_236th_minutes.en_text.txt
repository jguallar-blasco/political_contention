  The situation within the EMS had remained calm. The Deutsche Mark had still shown a weak trend up to late May, despite a widening of interest rate differentials and large intervention purchases by central banks. None- theless, the Deutsche Mark remained the strongest currency in the exchange rate mechanism and still had the lowest interest rates in the Community; in late May there had seemed to be signs of a change in favour of the German currency. The French franc had weakened slightly from early May, primarily owing to a contraction of interest rate differentials. These had stood at 1 3/4% in late May, compared with 5% a year ago. Though weakening a little, the French franc still held a position around the middle of the band, which was a sign of greater strength than during most of the last two years. The upward trend of the lira had continued until late May; it had then been subject to a bout of weakness but remained relatively strong. The Banca d'Italia had therefore not considered it necessary to raise interest rates to defend the exchange rate, particularly as interest rates were already fairly high so as to ensure the necessary sales of government securities.  In Ireland, the position of the Irish pound had stabilised after the increase in interest rates in April. The net capital outflow had ceased. Residents were continuing to invest abroad following the measures to liberalise capital movements early this year but, attracted by high interest rates in Ireland, there had been inflows from non-residents.  Sterling had been weak, primarily as a result of high inflation, strikes and the unfavourable balance-of-payments position. When the weakening had become more pronounced the base rate had been raised by 1 percentage point to 14% on 24th May and some intervention had been undertaken. The pound had nevertheless continued to weaken and in early June had stood 52% below the January/February peak. The Spanish peseta had undergone a pronounced change. In early May it had still been subject to upward pressure; the Banco de Espafia had countered this with large-scale intervention, which had held the rate at a ceiling of Pts. 62 to DM 1. The market had finally accepted that the exchange rate would not rise further and it had begun to soften. Some fiscal measures might also have contributed to this. Subsequently, rumours that the peseta would join the exchange rate mechanism led to a Significant weakening of the Spanish currency as the market believed that it could not join at too high a level. In early June it had stood at about Pts. 65 to DM 1. The Spanish Minister of Finance had announced that the peseta would join the exchange rate mechanism before mid-1990 with the  wider margin of 62.  III. Adoption of the Committee's report to the EC Ministers of Finance on developments on the foreign exchange markets of the nineteen countries participating in the concertation procedure during May and the first few days of June 1989  The Chairman took note of the Committee's adoption of the “concer- tation report", which would be sent to the EC Ministers of Finance in the  usual way.  IV. Other matters falling within the competence of the Committee  There was no other business.  V. Date and place of the next meeting  The Committee's next meeting would be held in Basle on Tuesday,  lith July 1989 at 9.30 a.m. Annex  Committee of Governors of the 12th June 1989 Central Banks of the Member States  of the European Economic Community Confidential  BRIEF REPORT ON DEVELOPMENTS ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS OF THE COUNTRIES WHOSE CENTRAL BANKS PARTICIPATE IN THE CONCERTATION PROCEDURE  MAY 1989  This report summarises developments on the exchange markets of the countries whose central banks participate in the concertation procedure and briefly describes their interventions during May and the first few days of June 1989.  I. EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS  The main features of the foreign exchange markets in May 1989 were: - an appreciation of the US dollar, despite heavy interventions; - a decline of sterling; - a further weakening of the Swiss franc followed by a strengthening towards the end of the month.  The US dollar rose sharply during May amid continuing reports that corporate and investor interests were persistently bidding for dollars to increase their dollar exposure, either through investments or hedging operations. News of a smaller US trade deficit during March, as well as political uncertainty abroad, gave support to the dollar exchange rates. The dollar reached its period highs of 2.0260 against the Deutsche Mark and 144.00 against the Japanese yen. During the last ten days of the month the dollar fluctuated below this level. The US and foreign monetary authorities  intervened in substantial amounts to counter the dollar's rise. The dollar  i The central banks of the EEC, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada and the United States. closed the month approximately 7.5% higher against the Japanese yen and 5.754: higher against the Deutsche Mark.  There were no tensions within the EMS. The most significant movement was the appreciation of the Italian lira which reached the upper part of the narrow band.  The Deutsche Mark strengthened vis-a-vis some currencies but lost ground against the majority, in particular the US dollar and the Swiss franc.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. The passage describes various exchange rate developments, interventions, and currency strengths in a factual manner without any indication of contention or disagreement.



Passage number 3.
 It remained, however, the strongest EMS currency. The weighted index of the Deutsche Mark vis-a-vis the eighteen most important trading partners (1972=100) declined from 174.4 at end-April to 173.1 at end-May despite a _ rise in market interest rates.  The French franc remained in the middle of the narrow band but weakened somewhat during the month following a further contraction of interest rate differentials between France and Germany.   The position of the Belgian franc was virtually unchanged. In order to check an excessive narrowing of the interest differential between the franc and the Deutsche Mark, the Banque Nationale de Belgique raised its three-month Treasury certificate rate on two occasions (by a total of 0.35 percentage point).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply outlines the changes in currency values and interest rates for the mentioned currencies without presenting any conflicting opinions or viewpoints.



Passage number 4.
  The Dutch guilder firmed slightly against most EMS currencies and joined the Deutsche Mark at the top of the band. Short-term guilder interest rates rose less strongly than Deutsche Mark rates. As a result the interest rate differential between the two currencies narrowed considerably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply presents information about the relative strength of the Dutch guilder compared to the Deutsche Mark and how the interest rate differential between the two currencies narrowed as a result.



Passage number 5.
  The Danish krone was stable but remained the weakest currency in the EMS band.  In Ireland, following the increase in official interest rates at the end of April, foreign exchange flows were somewhat more favourable in May than in earlier months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states two pieces of information about the stability of the Danish krone and foreign exchange flows in Ireland.



Passage number 6.
 As a result, the Irish pound appreciated in the upper half of the EMS band and there were small net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank of Ireland.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply describes the appreciation of the Irish pound and the net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank of Ireland as a result.



Passage number 7.
  The Italian lira appreciated significantly towards EMS currencies, reaching the upper part of the narrow band. Large capital inflows occurred during the month. In order to smooth the appreciation of the currency, the Banca d'Italia made fairly large intervention purchases in the first week of May. Purchases of Deutsche Mark against US dollars were also carried out in concerted interventions.  Sentiment towards sterling became very bearish against the back- ground of growing industrial unrest in the United Kingdom. An unexpected  jump in inflation to the 8% level and the continued weakness of the balance of payments provoked sharp outflows from sterling. Although base rates were raised by 1 percentage point to 14% on 24th May and considerable official support was provided, the weakness persisted. With the market perceiving some divisions within the Government over economic policy, sterling's trade- weighted index fell by 3% to 92.3 (1985=100).  The Greek drachma came under some pressure during the month partly related to the forthcoming national elections. The Bank of Greece intervened several times, while domestic interest rates firmed. The drachma depreciated by 5.8% against the US dollar and it remained stable against the ECU. In effective terms the drachma weakened by 0.5%.  The Spanish peseta was under considerable upward pressure at the beginning of the month, which was met by substantial purchases of foreign exchange reserves by the Banco de Espana. Later on, sentiment towards the peseta changed and the Banco de Espana reversed its intervention with sales of foreign reserves. It ended 2.5Z lower with respect to the ECU and 8.62% lower with respect to the US dollar.  The depreciation of the Portuguese escudo in effective terms was 0.25%, in line with the foreign exchange policy defined by the authorities. Against the US dollar the escudo lost 5.72.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.  The passage simply describes the exchange rate movements of various currencies and the interventions made by their respective central banks.



Passage number 8.
  Up to 24th May the Swiss franc weakened against the US dollar by about 7% and vis-a-vis the EMS currencies by roughly 1%. In the last business days in May a marked interest rate increase in the domestic money market resulted in a change in trend and the value of the Swiss franc against all major currencies rose by 3% to 4%. In the domestic money market the call money rate went up by 2 percentage points to 8.5%. The euro-franc rate for investments with maturities of 1 to 12 months increased by 1 to 1.75 per- centage points to reach 7./5% to 8.25%. The fact that short-term rates rose more pronouncedly than longer-term rates has led to an inverse interest rate structure. The interest rate increase is also attributable to the introduction of the flexible lombard rate, which, with effect from 26th May, is calculated on a daily basis and on the strength of market developments. Its rate lies 1 percentage point above the average call money rate of the two previous working days. The lombard rate is fixed and published every working day before 9.00 a.m.  The Austrian schilling weakened by 5.72 vis-a-vis the US dollar. Against the Deutsche Mark it fluctuated by only 0.062.  The continued stability of the Norwegian krone, together with moderate credit demand and reduced inflation, gave room for a 0.5 percentage point reduction in Norges Bank's overnight lending rate to 10.5%, effective  Oth May. The interest rate differential versus the basket currencies on three-month placements is now slightly more than 1 percentage point, the lowest differential since 1982. On 9th May the Norwegian bond market was reopened to foreign investors. The krone strengthened somewhat after the announcements but only temporarily. Norges Bank intervened on several occasions to stabilise the market. The krone ended the month unchanged in effective terms.  The Swedish krona remained stable during the first half of the month but weakened somewhat towards the end of the period when the dollar strengthened against most currencies.  The Finnish markka remained rather stable in effective terms. Short-term interest rates fluctuated markedly but on average they were roughly at the same levels as in April.  The Japanese yen depreciated by 7.2% against the US dollar to close at 142./0. This was due mainly to the heavy buying of dollars by speculators and institutional investors worldwide, reflecting the large interest rate differentials between the United States and Japan. The yen also depreciated against the ECU. In its effort to support the yen, the Bank of Japan entered the market at various times throughout the month, selling US dollars against the Japanese yen. Effective from 3lst May, the Bank of Japan raised the official discount rate by 0.75 percentage point to 3.25% in order to achieve a continuing sustained growth promoted by domestic demand while maintaining price stability.  The Canadian dollar closed the month at US$ 0.8284, down 1.82 against the US dollar after trading quietly for most of the period. The currency weakened in the latter part of the month as the strength of the US dollar against the major overseas currencies gave rise to short-term  capital outflows from Canada.  II. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Net sales of US dollars amounted to US$ 19.1 billion, compared with net purchases of US$ 0.5 billion during the month of April. Some of the dollar sales were made in concerted interventions. The major net sellers were the Federal Reserve, the Bank of Japan and, to a lesser extent, the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the Banco de Espana and the Swiss National Bank. The Banque de France, Norges Bank, the Banca d'Italia, the Nederlandsche Bank and the Banque Nationale de Belgique  also made considerable sales. The Banco de Portugal was the largest purchaser. B.

Passage number 9.
 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies and private ECUs by Community central banks amounted to the equivalent of US$ 3.7 billion, compared with US$ 2.3 billion in April. The interventions consisted almost entirely of purchases of Deutsche Mark by the Banco de Espafia, the Banca d'Italia, the Banque de France, the Banque Nationale de Belgique and the Central Bank of  Ireland. Norges Bank also made substantial purchases.  IIl. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH, UP TO 9TH JUNE  The dollar eased during the first days of June. Weaker-than-expected US employment data that pointed towards a slowing economy led to expectations of lower US interest rates and major US banks lowered their prime rates on 5th June from 11.5% to 11%. However, markets remain volatile due to the political situation in China and, at the end of the week, the dollar firmed again as a result of the publication of a higher-than-expected producer  price index.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply provides information about interventions in Community currencies and private ECUs and developments in the current month up to 9th June, focusing on the dollar's performance and factors influencing it.
