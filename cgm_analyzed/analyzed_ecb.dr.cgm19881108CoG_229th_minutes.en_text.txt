I IN I  I. Approval of the minutes of the 228th meeting.  The Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 228th meeting, on the understanding that the editorial amendments suggested would be in-  corporated in the final text.  II. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the '"Dalgaard Group" and discussion by the Committee of Alternates;  - Statistical charts and tables.  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  Mr. Dalgaard began by pointing out that the basic "monitoring" documentation (tables and statistical charts) was now drawn up by the Secretariat of the Committee.  During the two months which had passed since the September meeting there had been no acute tensions on the exchange markets but there had been a number of important developments.  The position of the dollar had changed markedly. Since the low reached at the end of 1987 and until September 1988 the dollar had firmed or remained stable. Intervention sales had totalled approximately $25 billion in the three months July, August and September. In October/early November the dollar had weakened by about 3% against the Deutsche Mark and intervention purchases had been made for a total of some $3 billion. This reversal of trend appeared to be connected with the fact that US growth seemed to be less vigorous and that, as a result, interest rates were unlikely to rise as had been expected. Moreover, the external imbalance was provoking renewed concern. However, the weakening of the dollar against the European currencies had not been very pronounced; its level vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark in early November, for example, was the same as in January-October 198/ and more than 10% higher than its end-198/7 level.  The weakening of the dollar had been more pronounced vis-a-vis the yen, whose current level was about the same as that recorded at the end of 1987. Concerted interventions had been undertaken by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan to check the fall of the dollar, the latter intervening for the first time after a long period. The yen had thus strengthened against  the Deutsche Mark, its appreciation amounting to approximately 10% since the beginning of the year. The outlook for the dollar was even more uncertain than usual owing to the US elections, but a further decline following the elections was widely anticipated. Within the EMS, the situation was currently remarkably calm. There had been two periods of tensions: in early September, in connection with rumours of a realignment, and in mid-October, when the French franc had been subject to some pressure. The tensions had never been acute and the narrow fluctuation band had not been utilised to the full at any time.

 After a relatively weak performance until September, the Deutsche Mark had firmed again markedly within the EMS in October, while German interest rates, particularly long-term rates, had fallen and sales of Deutsche Mark had been undertaken.  This development was to be seen against the background of the weakening of the dollar and the improvement in economic growth in Germany.  Mention should also be made of the change in the repo tender technique in combination with an increase in rediscount quotas.  These changes had been aimed at making the existing instruments more flexible without modifying the basic stance of monetary policy.  .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is providing information about various developments and changes in the Deutsche Mark and German monetary policy. There is no clear contention or disagreement expressed.The French franc had experienced two bouts of weakness.  Firstly in early September with the rumours of a realignment.  The Banque de France had responded with intervention sales, by allowing the franc to weaken somewhat within the band and by raising short-term interest rates slightly.  This had rapidly restored calm to the markets and the exchange rate and interest rates had returned to normal.  Subsequently, towards mid-October, labour disputes and poor August foreign trade figures, combined with the fall of the dollar, had caused the franc to weaken again.  Once more the Banque de France had responded with the three instruments.  .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating the facts of the French franc experiencing two bouts of weakness and the actions taken by the Banque de France in response to restore calm to the markets.In addition, the French and German authorities had issued very clear statements opposing any realignment.  The markets had again been calmed and the interventions had ceased.  The situation in early November was that the franc was the weakest currency within the narrow band, quite close to its lower limit, that the real interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark was wider than in the summer but smaller than it had been in 1987, and that there had been no return flows of capital following intervention sales totalling approximately  $4 billion.  The Italian lira had also been affected by the rumours of a realign- ment in ear.

Passage number 4.
 The stability of exchange rates within the EMS could not be said to have been seriously impaired during the period under review. Some tensions had emerged, and rumours of a realignment had been heard, but they had been well controlled.  In particular, the downward pressure on the French franc had been successfully countered in accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the Basle/Nyborg Agreement: with interventions, a weakening within the exchange rate band  and action on interest rates.

The passage is stating that the stability of exchange rates within the EMS was not seriously impaired and any tensions or rumors of realignment were well controlled. It also mentions successful actions taken to counter downward pressure on the French franc.

  The need for vigilance lay in the size of the current-account imbalances between countries participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism.  These disequilibria could not be expected to disappear in the near future under the effect of differentiated demand policies.  In the short term, therefore, they would have to be financed in one way or another.  It was very widely felt that the necessary capital flows should continue to be a spontaneous response to market stimuli, which meant maintaining appropriate interest rate differentials.  From this point of view, it would be as well to be cautious before contemplating unilateral action that would lead to a Narrowing of the French franc/Deutsche Mark interest rate differential.   3.  The Alternates’ attention had been drawn to the situation in Spain, where.

The author is presenting a situation and providing an explanation for why certain actions should be taken. the continued very fast growth of economic activity was accompanied  by an acceleration of inflation and widening trade and budget deficits.  The authorities had found it necessary to tighten monetary policy in order to counteract this development.   4.  Finally, it was satisfying that the fall of the dollar had taken place in an orderly manner, bringing the US currency back to a level judged to be more in keeping with the requirements of the international adjustment process.  There were, however, obvious uncertainties surrounding the development of the dollar in the near term.  Some Alternates thought that the dollar had stored up potential for a fall that might be released following the elections, but it could also be that the market had already anticipated the fall and was adopting a wait-and-see at.

It might even be desirable, at the dollar's present level, if some stabilisation  were encouraged.   C.  Discussion by the Committee  Mr.  de Larosiére thanked Mr.  Rey for his statement, which had been extremely clear and concise.   Mr.  Ciampi noted that the Banca d'Italia was delighted that the liberalisation of cross-border capital movements was now a reality after more than fifteen years of controls.  The experience of just over a month had been without hitches, and it was not to be forgotten that the last realignment had taken place almost two years ago.  A tribute should be paid to those in Italy who for so many years had tenaciously worked for progress along the path of liberalisation without its giving rise to imb.

However, problems persisted for Italy and the EMS.  The inflows of funds in October had followed upon September's outflows in connection with the rumours of a realignment.  Interest rates were on average higher in Italy than in the other member countries, in both nominal and real terms.  This situation had at the same time a cyclical component (the very strong growth of bank lending necessitating a policy of high interest rates) and a structural component (the government having to offer attractive rates of interest in order to raise the resources needed to finance a very large budget deficit).  Two other factors had favoured the implementation of the latest stage in the liberalisation of capital movements: firstly, the good performance of the Italian balance of payments in response to buoyant .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The passage states that interest rates were higher in Italy than in other member countries, both nominally and in real terms. This suggests that there is a disagreement or discrepancy between Italy and the other member countries in terms of their interest rates.Passage number 6.
  With respect to inflation it was remarkable that economic growth had accelerated in the countries participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism, without any appreciable sacrifice of internal stability. Outside the mechanism, however, some countries were facing relatively strong inflation- ary pressures.  The Alternates were of the opinion that the current~account imbalances within the EEC were at present the main cause for concern. The forecasts hardly held out hope of any appreciable reduction of these imbalances in 1989. This fact was particularly important for the choice of monetary policy stances.  As regards the third question examined by the Alternates, they had first of all noted that the possible contribution of fiscal policies to - 13 -  greater convergence, in particular at the balance-of-payments level, would be very limited. The criticisms voiced in the report by the majority of experts regarding the fiscal measures taken in two member countries had been countered by the Alternates concerned. For the German Alternate, the raising of indirect taxes in 1989 could not be divorced from the cut in direct taxes planned for the following year. The British Alternate had emphasised that the strong growth of domestic demand in the United Kingdom was wrongly being attributed to fiscal policy (it should be remembered that the budget showed a comfortable surplus); rather, it reflected the easing of monetary policy in the last few months of 1987 and early 1988, for well- known reasons. The tightening of monetary policy, as subsequently observed, had therefore been an appropriate response.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily discusses various observations and opinions regarding inflation, current-account imbalances, and fiscal policies, without any explicit arguments or conflicts between different viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 7.
  The report thus proposed a differentiation of monetary policies between countries participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism according to their balance-of-payments positions and suggested a differentiated response depending on whether the dollar moved up or down. The discussion held by the Alternates had not enabled them to reconcile the diverging views expressed on this subject by the experts. In particular, the German Alternate had suggested that in the event of a rise in the dollar an increase in German interest rates might be the appropriate response, whereas if the dollar fell one should hardly expect a lowering of rates but rather interventions, to the extent that their impact on domestic liquidity could be neutralised by other means. Other Alternates had remarked that the situation in their countries, and in the EEC as a whole, would not justify a tightening of monetary policy.  Being unable to agree in advance on a co-ordinated monetary policy strategy, the Alternates recognised the need to respond flexibly to develop- ments and consequently to ensure a certain continuity in the joint monitoring of monetary policies. It had also been pointed out that the Bundesbank should be more attentive not only to the risks of liquidity expansion but also to the counterparts of any such expansion. If it were to occur, for example, as a result of capital inflows, it would be inappropriate to respond with a policy of raising interest rates.  As for the proposal that an announcement affect should be aimed for when the monetary targets for 1989 were published by referring to the work carried out by the Committee of Governors, the Alternates were not  greatly in favour of it under the present circumstances. Apart from the  ~ j4 -  institutional difficulties which this proposal could create in certain countries, the Alternates thought that it would lack credibility in a situation in which it had not been possible to eliminate significant differences of opinion as to the appropriate approaches. The Alternates did not, however,  rule out for the future the idea of a joint public announcement of approaches  on which the monetary authorities had reached a genuine consensus.  C. Discussion by the Committee  Mr. Duisenberg agreed with the Alternates in their assessment of Report No. 33, which provided a very balanced analysis of economic and monetary developments within the Community and the problems arising. The report usefully focused on the co-ordination of monetary policies and the lack of convergence, but perhaps devoted too much attention to the past and not enough to the future. The Group should be more forward-looking and suggest some options for suitable corrective measures; it might indicate how monetary policies could contribute within the member countries to the process of disinflation and the restoration of external equilibrium. The experts could, for example, discuss desirable monetary targets for 1989, including that for the growth of domestic lending which formed part of the mandate.  The report stressed that monetary growth had been vigorous in the majority of the EEC countries, above all in the last few months, and that this was chiefly due to the strong growth in bank lending to the private sector in the context of very buoyant domestic demand. Moreover, the average rate of inflation within the Community had increased, reaching 5% in August. Determination was therefore required with regard to monetary targets, but greater attention needed to be given to the internal and external counterparts of money creation.  At a more general level, a few points were worth making. In 1989 economic growth would remain strong in some countries, while in others there would be an appreciable rise in wages. There would thus be an obvious risk of new inflationary pressure which policies should combat as quickly as possible so that productive capacities were not exhausted and so as to reduce excess liquidity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident when the passage states, "The discussion held by the Alternates had not enabled them to reconcile the diverging views expressed on this subject by the experts." Additionally, there are different views presented by the German Alternate and other Alternates regarding the appropriate response to changes in the value of the dollar.


Passage number 8.
 Finally, a sharp depreciation of the dollar leading to tensions within the EMS could not be ruled out; rapid action would then  have to be taken on interest rates and differentials suitably widened. - 15 -  Mr. Ciampi endorsed the opinions expressed about the quality of the study submitted by the "Raymond Group". The process of liberalisation of capital movements in which the Community was engaged involved risks unless simultaneous progress was made in the conduct of monetary policy, which, moreover, could no longer be seen in a narrow national context but had to take account of the situation of the other member countries. It was clear that the studies should not be confined to retrospective observations, commenting on the past, but should look to the future. Such an approach, which had already been advocated by Italy, should be followed by everybody, independently from the stage reached in the liberalisation of capital movements. The ‘Raymond Group" should go further in the direction desired by Mr. Duisenberg, i.e. it should provide pointers and options for co-ordination for the future.  At the procedural level, Mr. Ciampi proposed that the new mandate given to the "Raymond Group" should be confirmed and if possible that part of it which was forward-looking and prepared the ground for the future should be reinforced.  Mr. Pohl thought that Report No. 33 represented an excellent analysis of the situation and the problems arising. The experts appeared to be a little pessimistic in saying that the adjustment process had been marking time, especially as far as the United States was concerned. Actually, the US representatives thought that the reduction of their country's deficit would continue, albeit perhaps at a slower pace. In fact, the bilateral relations between the United States and Germany had seen a decrease in German exports of around 13% and an increase in German imports of roughly the same order of magnitude since the beginning of 1988. The problem obviously arose within the EEC: since the beginning of 1988 exports from Germany to its partners, notably Italy and France, had risen much more rapidly than German imports from the other member countries. The problem was thus tending to worsen, and gave all the more cause for concern in that the scope for expanding domestic demand in Germany was limited.  The question was, therefore, how these imbalances might be corrected, bearing in mind that exchange rate adjustments should only be a last resort and could in any case only be modest. Hitherto the growth in the German trade surplus had not caused any problems, since it had been offset by capital movements. It was possible that, with different exchange rate expecta-  tions, capital flows would be reversed, as had been the case for some time. - 16 -  Were such a trend to persist or to intensify, tensions would be bound to emerge within the EMS. A widening of interest rate differentials risked being insufficient, and so it would be better to bring about capital exports from Germany to those countries with relatively weak currencies. These countries had, in fact, to adopt policies conducive to attracting capital. Italy provided a convincing example in this regard: the liberalisation of capital movements there had given rise not to outflows but, on the contrary, to inflows of capital, which were a sign of confidence. This kind of policy designed to make the country more attractive to foreign capital was the only way of achieving progress, given that the cohesion attained now ruled out any major parity changes.

 Pohl noted that the EEC countries with the highest inflation rates and the largest current-account deficits did not participate in the EMS exchange rate mechanism.  Membership of the exchange rate mechanism had a disciplinary effect that appeared to be conducive to closer convergence.  This was a situation which might merit examination in greater depth.   Mr.  de Larosiere offered a few remarks and a suggestion as regards method.  The size of the current-account imbalances was currently a major factor.  The existence of surpluses or deficits within a regional grouping such as the Community was not abnormal, but the size of these imbalances, for example a surplus equal to 4Z of GNP, and their persistence.

The monetary policies of the EEC countries could not fail to be influenced by this basic fact.  The countries with large surpluses and low inflation should not therefore envisage any tightening of their monetary policy but should rather consider a slight relaxation, especially if the dollar weakened.  Moreover, the restrictive stance of fiscal policy in Germany in 1989 was to be regretted.  The structural reasons for raising indirect taxes were understandable, but the decision was wholly out of line with the cyclical situation.   The risks of inflation in the second group of countries, as described by Mr.  Raymond, should lead them to exercise very strict vigilance in t.

This applied both to fiscal policy and to monetary policy and meant, for example, that interest rates had to be maintained at relatively high levels.  In France the narrow monetary aggregates were developing along fairly satisfactory lines, but the growth in lending, of the order of 11%, was too strong and demanded the continuation of a vigilant and rigorous  monetary policy.  With regard to the dollar, close attention had to be paid to the international aspects of its development.  As long as US fiscal policy failed to bring about a significant easing of domestic demand pressures, a sharp decline in the dollar, in the current context of very high capacity utilisation in.

The passage suggests that there is disagreement over the monetary policy and the growth in lending in France. It also indicates that there might be disagreement over the US fiscal policy and its impact on the dollar's development.Passage number 10.
 Leigh-Pemberton agreed with the drafting of three reports a year; he noted that even though April was the better month for the United Kingdom -  as the budget was then established ~- March seemed preferable to him, given that in April the Governors were often under pressure owing to ECOFIN Council and IMF meetings.

 EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS  The main features of the foreign exchange markets in September and October 1988 were: ~ a sharp decline of the US dollar during October, the depreciation being more pronounced with respect to the Japanese yen; - a short period of nervousness in the EMS at the beginning of  September, which did not give rise to major tensions.  After an initial weakening in early September, the US dollar moved higher against most major currencies during the rest of the month. The dollar benefited from the release of US trade statistics for July, as well as from expectations that any emerging signs of economic overheating would lead to higher US interest rates. Also, the Berlin summit communiqué and subsequent official commentary were interpreted by some as suggesting  that the G-7 monetary authorities would tolerate a further rise in the  1 The central banks of the EEC, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada and the United States.  dollar. Towards the end of the month, the US authorities sold dollars against Deutsche Mark in concerted intervention that restored the view that monetary authorities would resist a further dollar rise. From late September, the dollar has declined in a move prompted by various indications that US economic activity was not expanding as vigorously as had been thought, suggesting that upward pressure on dollar interest rates might subside. Market sentiment towards the dollar became increasingly negative as con- cerns about the pace of external adjustment resurfaced. As the dollar came under strong selling pressure at the end of October, the US authorities bought dollars against yen to limit the dollar's decline. The dollar closed the two-month period under review down 5Z on average against European cur- rencies and 8.6% lower against the Japanese yen.  At the beginning of September and for the second time this year, some nervousness appeared in the EMS, although the pressures abated easily. Subsequently, there was some movement in currencies' relative positions, mainly the strengthening of the Deutsche Mark to the top of the band and the weakening of the French franc to the bottom of the narrow band.  The Deutsche Mark continued to firm against almost all currencies, appreciating most strongly - by 5.7Z - against the US dollar. During the second half of September this development was temporarily interrupted when the decline of the dollar gave way to an upswing. Late in September this rise was, however, halted by concerted intervention, and in October the Deutsche Mark firmed strongly.

Passage number 12.
 In the second half of October the weighted index of the Deutsche Mark vis-a-vis the EMS currencies reached the highest levels yet recorded; overall (vis-a-vis fourteen major industrial countries), however, the Deutsche Mark's index was still approximately 3Z% below the peak values recorded at the beginning of the year.  In the period under review the French franc was subject to certain pressures. At the beginning of September, as a result of rumours of a realign- ment associated with the dismantling of Italian exchange controls, the franc weakened against the Deutsche Mark, but the decline was checked by the statements made by the French and German monetary authorities ruling out the necessity of a parity readjustment. The announcement at the end of September of a substantial August trade deficit (of Fr.fr. 9 billion), followed at the beginning of October by social disputes, gave rise to new pressures on the franc, in particular by inducing French residents to cover  forward their commercial operations. The firming of the Deutsche Mark exchange rate, accompanied by an increase in French short-term interest rates, subsequently made the taking of positions more costly and dissipated these pressures. Thereafter the resolution of the social disputes and the announcement of a Fr.fr. 0.4 billion trade surplus in September gave an incentive to purchases of francs by non-residents.  The Belgian franc remained relatively stable. The Banque Nationale intervened occasionally in the market, above all in the form of sales in the first fortnight of September. On four occasions it was able to reduce the rate for three-month Treasury bills, which currently stands at 7.25%, corresponding to a reduction of 0.35% over the last two months.  The Dutch guilder firmed slightly against the Deutsche Mark in September, due to a somewhat larger short-term interest rate differential.

  The Irish pound was relatively stable at the top of the EMS band during September, with continuous small net inflows of currency. However, during October, the Irish pound weakened slightly within the band, in response to currency outflows, resulting in intervention sales.

  During the first half of September the Italian lira was weakened by substantial short-term capital outflows, fuelled by expectations of an EMS realignment, necessitating the Banca d'Italia to intervene with sizable sales of foreign currencies.  Since mid-September and throughout October the stabilisation of exchange rate expectations induced substantial capital inflows and made possible a replenishment of official reserves while the lira appreciated slightly in the EMS.   Helped by modest intervention, sterling recovered from an uneasy start to Sept.

In the event, the figures (published on 27th September) were not as bad as feared and sterling advanced strongly in their wake.  With the Chancellor ruling out an early fall in UK interest rates, the pound displayed a firm tone during October until balance of payments concerns again resurfaced ahead of the UK trade figures  for September.

 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies and ECUs by Community central banks amounted in September and October to the equivalent of US$ 5.0 billion, compared with US$ 5.7 billion in July and August. The interventions consisted of sales of Deutsche Mark by the Banca d'Italia in the early part of September which were reversed later in the month, and of sales of Deutsche  Mark by the Banque de France in October.
