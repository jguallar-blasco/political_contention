Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the 'Dalgaard Group'' and discussion by the Committee of Alternates; ~ Statistical charts and tables.  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  The ‘Monitoring Group" had concentrated its discussion on two topics: the US dollar and the development of the Danish krone and its effect on the EMS.  The dollar had strengthened by more than 3% in March to a level not far from the summer 1988 peak; in early April it had weakened again a little. The dollar had now remained within the DM 1.80-1.90 range for three months, while since the beginning of 1987 it had generally stood between DM 1.65 and 1.90, which represented a certain degree of stability over a period of more than two years. However, compared with its weakest position at the end of 1987, the dollar had appreciated by almost 20%, and even more in real terms. This development had undoubtedly contributed to the reversal of the adjustment process, with the current-account surpluses in Japan and Germany and the current-account deficit in the United States all increasing. The latest figures showed that in Germany, for example, the trade surplus was growing strongly and the current-account surplus even more so with the increase in German investment income.  There were a number of reasons for the continuing dollar strength:  - for domestic reasons US interest rates were kept at a high level, which resulted in sizable interest rate differentials vis-a-vis  the Deutsche Mark and Japanese yen at a time when there was little  expectation in the market of any serious decline in the dollar;  - this market perception was reinforced by the fact that central banks' intervention operations had been less convincing in recent months, whereas last summer there had been more impressive concerted  interventions; - the yen and the Deutsche Mark had weakened for political reasons, the former more appreciably because of the "Recruit affair" and the latter to a lesser degree on account of certain election results;  - the withholding tax and a number of other factors had made the German capital market less attractive for resident and non-resident  investors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply provides a summary of attendees at a meeting and a statement by Mr. Dalgaard about the monitoring of economic and monetary developments.


Passage number 2.
  Within the EMS the Danish krone had been subject to some pressure and had reached its lower limit shortly before Easter, giving rise to the first compulsory intervention at the margin since January 1987. The krone had, in fact, weakened gradually since last summer in connection with the decline in interest rate differentials, which vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark had narrowed from 6 to 3 percentage points at the long end and to only 1 1/2% for short-term rates. In view of the weakness of the Danish economy, the central bank had decided not to follow the interest rate increases undertaken abroad unless this were to prove necessary for external reasons. From late February the krone had stood close to its lower intervention point, but without necessitating any interventions. The situation had changed just before Easter: although there were no expectations of a realignment, some market participants had decided to adjust their positions, perhaps because of a certain unease since the Danish market was closed on more days than other markets, but also because covering positions was not very costly. As a result, the krone had reached its lower limit vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark, and Danmarks Nationalbank and the Deutsche Bundesbank together had had to sell Deutsche Mark and purchase Danish kroner for the equivalent of almost $1 billion within the space of three days. The experts in the "Monitoring Group" had noted that these compulsory interventions had involved sizable sales of Deutsche Mark, which the Bundesbank normally tried to avoid when the Deutsche Mark was weak internationally. Fortunately the interventions had lasted only a few days; moreover, they had not entailed use of the very short-term financing facility as Danmarks Nationalbank had made immediate settlement using its Deutsche Mark reserves. As soon as the markets had reopened after Easter the krone had moved away from its lower limit and further interventions had not been necessary. The central bank had, however, tightened its policy somewhat in the days that followed; this modest tightening had resulted in a 1/2 percentage point firming of money  market rates. The French franc had performed very well; despite a further narrowing of the interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark, its exchange rate had firmed to such an extent that the Banque de France had decided to make intervention purchases. The reasons for this development were very positive fundamentals in terms of inflation, employment, etc. and the market's favourable reaction to the recent measures to liberalise capital movements.  The Italian lira had strengthened in early March as a result of the increase in interest rates. The Banca d'Italia had also made substantial intervention purchases. Subsequently, interest rate differentials had narrowed and there had been no further interventions. The situation continued to be stable, however.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply providing information about the performance of different currencies within the EMS.


This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number3
  The Irish pound had remained in the upper part of the EMS band, but the Central Bank of Ireland had recently carried out some intervention sales to cover net capital outflows.  The fundamentals were still very favourable in Ireland: low price rises, a surplus on current account and a considerable budget improvement.  Interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark were, however, very small - even narrower than those in France.   The pound sterling had been relatively stable vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark in recent weeks.  It was still hoped that economic activity would begin to cool off but there was as yet no evidence of this.  The publication of rather poor foreign trade figures had led to a weakening of the pound, which the Bank of England had countered with substantial inter- ventions.   The Spanish peset.

It is providing information and observations about various currencies and their performance.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************a had experienced a period of relative calm.   In Portugal, the policy of a steady devaluation of the effective exchange rate of the escudo by 1/4% a month had been pursued.  The Banco de Portugal had recently raised its interest rates by one percentage point and increased reserve requirements in response to an acceleration of the rate of inflation, which amounted to more than 10% since the beginning of the year, and to a deterioration in the current account.   The Greek drachma had been subject to some pressure, chiefly of a seasonal nature.   As regards the private ECU, it was to be noted that the Banque de France had undertaken interventions for the first time, on a modest scale and with no change in its overall holdings of ECUs.  Other central banks'  holdings had continued to increase, by around 1 billion in Ma.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The opposing viewpoints come from the different actions taken by the Banco de Portugal and the Banque de France. The Banco de Portugal raised interest rates and increased reserve requirements, indicating a response to inflation and a deteriorating current account. On the other hand, the Banque de France undertook interventions for the first time, implying a different approach or strategy.rch, bringing  the total to ECU 13 billion.  These purchases had been made principally by the Banca d'Italia, as part of a general build-up of its reserves, and to a  4  lesser extent by the Bank of England.   B.  Statement by Mr.  Papademos  The Alternates had had a detailed discussion which had focused on two points: a general assessment of exchange rate developments and of the adjustment process, and developments in economic performance and policies in a number of Community countries.   Some Alternates had expressed satisfaction with the relative stability of nominal exchange rates.  Although the dollar had appreciated further in March, it had fluctuated vis-a-vis the major currencies within reasonable limits for several months.  This had been interpreted as demonstrating the success of international policy co-or.

It simply presents information about purchases made by the Banca d'Italia and the Bank of England, and a statement by Mr. Papademos regarding exchange rate developments.dination.  The recent interventions by the Bank of Japan and the more active role of the Federal Reserve on the exchange markets had underlined the improvement in co- ordination.  Interest rate movements had also been stabilised and competitive interest rate increases had been avoided.  In addition, the European Monetary System had been free of tensions, with the exception of the bout of weakness affecting the Danish krone, which had temporarily reached its lower limit within the band.   Several Alternates had stressed, however, that too much emphasis should not be placed on the relative stability of nominal exchange rates.  Real exchange rates, which were more relevant for the international adjustment process, had been moving in the wrong direction and the adjustment process had not only come to a standstill, it ha.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply provides information about recent interventions by central banks and the stability of interest rates and exchange rates, along with a mention of concerns over real exchange rates.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************d been reversed.  In the first quarter of this year the Deutsche Mark and the Japanese yen had continued to depreciate in real terms vis-a-vis the dollar and Germany's current-account surplus had grown further.   There were three possible interpretations as regards the current- account imbalances.  Firstly, they were sustainable in the medium term and should not therefore give cause for concern.  Secondly, the markets might at some point conclude that the policies being implemented were inadequate and that the imbalances were unsustainable, thus provoking a crisis.  According to a third view, the external imbalances had reached unsustainable levels and active measures were required to correct the situation.  In particular,  it would be necessary to change the policy mix in a number of countries,  and especially in t.

The three interpretations mentioned present different viewpoints on the sustainability of current-account imbalances and the required measures to correct the situation.he United States.  In many cases monetary policy had not been sufficiently supported by fiscal policy.  As a resuit, the interest  rate level had been higher than it would otherwise have been and had led to real currency appreciation and a worsening of the external imbalances.  The situation had been more acute in the United States since, although the budget deficit was not very large as a percentage of GDP, the private savings ratio was low and had not been sufficient to finance the public deficit and investment.   The Alternates had made the following points regarding developments in economic performance and policies in certain Community countries.   In the United Kingdom, the significant increase in interest rates in 1988 should eventually dampen domestic demand.  The Bank of England would resist downward pressur.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents information about the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy in the United States and the effects it had on interest rates and external imbalances. It also mentions the situation in the United Kingdom and the actions of the Bank of England. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.Passage number 4.
 EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS  The main features of the foreign exchange markets in March 1989 were:  - a sharp appreciation of the US dollar against most other currencies, despite several rounds of concerted central bank intervention;  - in the EMS the French franc appreciating significantly and the Danish krone exhibiting continued weakness;  - a substantial weakening of the Swiss franc.  The US dollar came under upward pressure, closing the month over 4.5% higher against the Japanese yen and 4% higher against the Deutsche Mark. Upward pressure picked up during the month as market participants came to the view that, given continued price pressures in the US economy, interest rate differentials would remain favourable to dollar investments.  Other factors, including rising oil prices and quarter-end demand for  1 The central banks of the EEC, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada and the United States.  dollars, also gave support to the dollar. The US monetary authorities, at times in concertation with some European central banks, intervened during the month to counter the rise of the dollar which closed the month near its highs for the year at 132.80 against the yen and 1.8975 against the Deutsche Mark.  In the EMS, the narrow band was temporarily expanded to the full width when the Danish krone touched its lower limit against the Deutsche Mark, and for the first time since January 1987 there were interventions at the limits. The French franc strengthened markedly throughout the month.  The Deutsche Mark weakened against almost all the currencies officially quoted in Frankfurt, as short and long-term capital outflows, largely interest-rate related, still tended to exceed the high, and even rising, current-account surpluses. The weighted index of the Deutsche Mark vis-a-vis Germany's fourteen most important trading partners (1972=100) declined from 169.1 at end-February to 168.0 at end-March.  The French franc strengthened significantly and regained its levels of the middle of 1988. At the beginning of the period, the official announcement of an easing of exchange controls was very well received by the markets. Subsequently, the publication of favourable economic indicators further strengthened the position of the French franc, which benefited from substantial switching into francs, notably from Deutsche Mark.  The Belgian franc demonstrated considerable stability, which made it possible to lower short-term interest rates slightly and to effect modest purchases of foreign currencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about exchange rate developments.


Passage number 5.
  The Dutch guilder remained in the upper part of the EMS band, strengthening slightly against the Deutsche Mark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact about the Dutch guilder's position within the EMS band and its slight strengthening against the Deutsche Mark.


Passage number 6.
  The Danish krone weakened further, and shortly before the Easter holidays it temporarily touched the bottom of the EMS band despite sizable intervention in support of the krone. The Nationalbank tightened the borrowing facilities for the private banks on 30th March, leading to an increase in money-market rates of around 0.5%. The krone subsequently strengthened somewhat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes the weakening of the Danish krone, intervention by the Nationalbank, and subsequent strengthening of the krone.


Passage number 7.
  Following some downward pressure in early March, the Irish pound appreciated in the upper half of the EMS band for most of the remainder of the month.

Explanation: The passage simply states actions taken by the Central Bank in response to commercial outflows, without mentioning any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 9.
  The Italian lira strengthened to a level in the nartow EMS band after the discount rate was raised by 1 percentage point to 13.5% on 6th March. Short-term capital inflows continued during the period and sizable purchases of Deutsche Mark by the Banca d'Italia were made in order to smooth the appreciation of the lira.  Sterling came under downward pressure at the beginning of March following the publication of worse-than-expected trade figures for January and amid fears of increases in interest rates in other European centres. Some official support was provided at the time and sterling recovered, particularly following the Chancellor's Budget speech. After Easter, however, sentiment turned against sterling and, despite official support, it fell sharply following publication (on 29th March) of February's trade figures. Sterling's trade-weighted index fell by 0.3% to 95.5 (1985=100).  The Greek drachma came under some pressure, possibly reflecting the narrowing of interest rate differentials. The drachma depreciated by 3.9% and 0.8% against the US dollar and the ECU respectively, and by 0.9% in effective terms.  The Spanish peseta rose slightly against most currencies at the beginning of the month, driven by increases in the intervention rate for overnight funds to 13.75% on 3rd March and in the three-month repurchase agreement rate to 13.25% on 6th March. For the rest of the period it showed remarkable stability, in spite of a further increase in the three-month repurchase agreement rate to 13.35% on 14th March. In all, the peseta ended the month 0.32% higher against the ECU and 2.8% lower against the US dollar.  In line with official objectives, the Portuguese escudo depreciated by 0.25% in effective terms, while vis-a-vis the US dollar, it decreased by 3.1%. On 20th March, to counter inflationary pressures and moderate excessive growth of domestic demand, the Banco de Portugal's discount rate was raised by 1 percentage point to 14.5% and the reserve requirements were increased.  The Swiss franc experienced increased downward pressure depreciating by 6.0% against the US dollar and by just under 32% vis-a-vis most remaining currencies. The export weighted index at month end was 3.22 below the level reached a month earlier. Interest rates in the domestic  money market remained stable at a relatively high level.  The Austrian schilling weakened by 3.5% vis-a-vis the US dollar. Against the Deutsche Mark it fluctuated by only 0.03%. With effect from 2nd March the rate for short-term open market operations was raised from 5.25% to 5.752.  The Norwegian krone moved within a fairly narrow range around the central value of the currency index and ended the month unchanged in effective terms.  The Swedish krona has been stable on the upper side of the index benchmark due to higher domestic interest rates. The Riksbank absorbed small inflows, mainly in early March, but also on the last day of the month when revaluation rumours resulted in a large inflow of foreign currency.  The Finnish markka appreciated in effective terms by 3.3% after the fluctuation limits of the currency index were lowered by 42% on 17th March. This made it possible to increase short-term interest rates by more than 2 percentage points.  The Japanese yen declined by 4.0% against the US dollar, mainly as a result of higher oil prices and large interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States. The yen also weakened slightly against the ECU.  The Canadian dollar firmed rising by 0.5% against the US dollar to close the month at US$ 0.8386. Over the period, the currency was supported by firming domestic interest rates, expectations of a continued tightening in monetary policy to combat growing inflationary pressures, and by news of a widening in the trade surplus in January. Further gains have been forestalled, however, by caution ahead of the Federal Budget expected  in late April.  II. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Net sales of US dollars amounted to US$ 4.4 billion, compared with US$ 3.3 billion during the month of February. A significant proportion of sales, about one half of which were effected against Deutsche Mark, took the form of concerted interventions. The Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, Finlands Bank and the Central Bank of Ireland were the major sellers while Banco de Portugal and Sveriges Riksbank were the largest  purchasers. B.

Passage number 10.
 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies by Community central banks amounted to the equivalent of US$ 2.9 billion, compared with US$ 1.9 billion in February 1989. While the bulk of the interventions consisted of intramarginal purchases of Deutsche Mark, with the Banca d'Italia and the Banque de France being the main buyers, there were also substantial sales of Deutsche Mark at the limits by Danmarks Nationalbank. Sveriges Riksbank also made some intervention purchases of  Deutsche Mark.  III. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH, UP TO 7TH APRIL The US dollar eased in early April following the G/ meeting and subsequent Bank of Japan intervention. The publication on 7th April of  March employment data had little impact on the currency.
