I. Approval of the minutes of the 230th meeting.  In view of the late distribution of the draft the Chairman proposed that approval of the minutes be held over until the next meeting in February.  In the meanwhile the suggested amendments could be passed on to the Secretariat.  II. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the “Dalgaard Group" and discussion by the Committee of Alternates;  ~ Statistical charts and tables.  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  The most notable development on the exchange markets since the December meeting had been the renewed firmness of the dollar following its decline in October and November. The dollar's appreciation had been partic- ularly marked in early January; on 9th January it had shown a rise of 52% over the end of November, to a level about the same as that observed during most of 1987 but lower than that of summer 1988. Continuing growth in the United States and consequent expectations of further increases in US interest rates appeared to be the main reasons for the dollar's recovery. The US authorities seemed fairly content with their currency's present level, although the strong appreciation in early January had prompted the Fed to undertake some intervention. Within the EEC, the Deutsche Bundesbank was not very pleased with this development; it believed that, with a widening German current-account surplus, the depreciation of the Deutsche Mark was the contrary of an appropriate adjustment, and it had responded by selling over $2.5 billion since the beginning of December. The greater part of these sales did not represent traditional intervention but a more discreet rechannelling of dollar receipts. The increase in German interest rates had also been a response to the development of the Deutsche Mark.  The other EEC central banks seemed more concerned about the dollar's fluctuation than about its present level. The sharp appreciation on 9th January had, however, led to substantial concerted intervention in dollars.  The future performance of the US currency remained very difficult to predict; it would depend to a large extent on the rate of growth, interest rates and the trade balance in the United States and on the new Administration's  economic policy, particularly on the fiscal front. If US growth was sustained interest rates could rise further, pushing up rates in Europe as well; if growth slowed US interest rates could fall and this could lead to a weakening of the dollar.   The yen had attracted much less attention on the exchange markets recently; it had moved less than the Deutsche Mark vis-a-vis the dollar and was now close to its end-1987 level. It had, however, appreciated by some 10% vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark in 1988 and in early January stood at a record level against that currency.

Passage number 2.
  The situation within the EMS had been generally calm; two years after the last realignment there seemed to be less expectation of a parity adjustment today than for a long time. The main event in December had been the increase in German interest rates and its repercussions on other currencies. As could be seen from the graphs drawn up by the Secretariat, short-term DM interest rates had risen by about 1/2 percentage point and long-term rates a little less. The direct effect had been to reduce the interest rate differ- ential in favour of other EEC currencies; a number of these had come under pressure, some intervention had been necessary and their exchange rates had weakened slightly. The French franc, the Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder had been particularly affected and the response in the three countries concerned had been the same: seeing, after one, two or three days, that the intervention alone was not able to remedy the problem, they had raised interest rates in order to restore differentials vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark, and this had sufficed to relieve the tensions. Ultimately, the increase in German interest rates had been transmitted in full to interest rates in the countries in question. However, the main impact had been on short-term rates, and long-term rates had, for example, continued to decline in France.  In the other countries participating in the exchange rate mechanism the repercussions of the German measures had been less marked. In Denmark the krone had weakened slightly but interest rates had remained unchanged and no intervention had been necessary. In Italy interest rates had not risen, so that the differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark had narrowed.  The lira had nonetheless firmed and moved back into the narrow band. This positive performance was due to the continuing high level of interest rates maintained for domestic reasons and to increased capital inflows as a result of the liberalisation measures taken in the autumn. The effect of these measures had been to raise confidence in the Italian economy and the central bank had been able to demonstrate to the market that a two-way risk attached to the lira. Overall, there was at present great confidence in the stability of exchange rate relationships within the mechanism and interest rate movements therefore assumed great importance. The increase in DM interest rates had, for example, been enough to create problems for several currencies, though these problems had quickly been resolved with the restoration of interest rate differentials.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The information presented is factual and describes the impact of the increase in German interest rates on various currencies within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.

  Outside the EMS exchange rate mechanism two currencies, sterling and the peseta, presented a number of similarities.  In both of the countries concerned the economy was overheating, fiscal policy had not been able to calm economic conditions and a restrictive monetary policy was bearing the burden.  Interest rates had therefore risen, attracting inflows of capital which pushed up the currency.  The peseta had appreciated by 3 to 4% since the beginning of December and in 1988 as a whole the Deutsche Mark had depreciated in real terms by abo.

It is simply stating facts about the similarities between the economies of the two countries and the effects on their currencies.ut 10Z against the peseta and sterling.   Table 3 of the monthly series of “concertation" statistics showed the central banks' activity in the private ECU market.  The growth in investment in private ECUs described in Report No.  64 had continued; in December 1988 alone the central banks' holdings of private ECUs had increased by some 2 billion; half of this amount had been accounted for by the Banca d'Italia, and the Bank of England had also added to its holdings with the sale of ECU Treasury bills.  The central banks of Spain, Portugal and.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply describes the central banks' activity in the private ECU market without any indication of contention or disagreement. Norway had also purchased private ECUs against other currencies, probably in order to diversify their reserves.  In 1988 as a whole the central banks' holdings of private  ECUs had risen by 7 billion, from 4 to 11 billion.   B.  Statement by Mr.  Papademos  Following Mr.  Dalgaard's summary of the discussion which took place earlier at the EEC Monitoring meeting, the Committee of Alternates focused their attention principally on three topics: - the recovery of the US dollar and its implications for the adjustment process; - recent developme.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides information without indicating any disagreement or contention.Passage number 4.
 Interventions in EMS currencies  In addition, the German Alternate reminded his colleagues of the written agreement existing among the EEC central banks regarding intervention. It was pointed out that, prior to an intervention, the intervening central bank should first discuss the matter with the central bank whose currency  is to be used in the transaction. Such conduct is essential to ensure that  the use of that currency in interventions will not jeopardise the cohesion  of the EMS.  The Chairman thanked Mr. Dalgaard and Mr. Papademos for their  statements and noted than the Governors had no comments.  III. Adoption of the Committee's report _to the EEC Ministers of Finance on developments on the foreign exchange markets of the nineteen countries participating in the concertation procedure during December 1988 and the first few days of January 1989.  "concertation  The Chairman noted that the Committee approved the report", which would be sent to the EEC Ministers of Finance in the usual  way.  IV. Exchange of views on the Committee's work programme for 1989  The Chairman pointed out that an outline work programme for the Committee for 1989 (see annex) had been distributed at the same time as the draft agenda for the meeting. Before asking Mr. Papademos to report on the Alternates.’ discussion, he noted that the programme was based on decisions or commitments already undertaken by the Committee and also contained a number of items that were still open. It was not, of course, definitive, as it was impossible at this stage to predict all the questions which might arise and which the Chairman or the Governors would wish to examine or the  subjects on which the Committee might be asked to give an opinion.  A. Statement by Mr. Papademos  The Alternates reviewed the Work Programme of the Committee for 1989. There was general agreement on the proposed outline.  The Alternates discussed certain procedural issues relating to the forthcoming re-examination of the ECU basket (items 3 and 8 of the outline). In this context, it may be useful to recall that the revision of the composition of the ECU should be determined by the Council by September, acting on a proposal from the Commission after consulting the Board of Governors of the EMCF and the Monetary Committee. However, it is not yet  clear when the Board of Governors will have to submit its opinion on this matter. Indeed, the date will depend on the calendar for the review of the composition of the ECU basket. As already pointed out in Report No. 64 of the Dalgaard group, there is the idea of proceeding in two stages, i.e. the Council would announce the new weights some months before the basket is effectively changed. In this case, the Board of Governors might have to deal with the matter before September.  There will be greater clarity with respect to the calendar after the Governors have discussed the Dalgaard group's new report on the expected impact of the revision of the ECU on the markets. The Commission representative pointed out that an opinion from the Governors on the procedure to be followed and the calendar would be much appreciated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. The passage describes the discussion and agreement among the Alternates regarding the work programme for 1989 and procedural issues related to the re-examination of the ECU basket. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.

  Finally, it was noted that the Work Programme, on subjects related to the strengthening of the EMS and monetary integration, would have to be finalised after the completion of the Report of the Delors Committee and the meeting of the European Council in June.  Furthermore, it was mentioned that, apart from the follow-up of the Delors Committee Report, the Committee of Governors could assess the functioning of monitoring and co-ordination  of monetary policies following the implementation of the Basle/Nyborg agreement.   B.  Discussion by the Committe.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of finalizing the Work Programme after the completion of the Delors Committee Report and the meeting of the European Council in June, as well as assessing the functioning of monitoring and co-ordination of monetary policies following the implementation of the Basle/Nyborg agreement, are both presented as logical steps and part of the Committee's planned actions.e  Mr.  de Larosiére thought that, given the importance that the markets were increasingly attaching to the definition and composition of the ECU, an examination of this question only at the Governors' meeting on 12th September 1989 appeared too late.  It would be better to take up the question of a re-examination of the ECU basket earlier, for example in June or July.  It was a matter of great importance for the markets, for the function- ing of the financial system in Europe and for the activities of the financial centres.  It would therefore be pref.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no direct contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. de Larosiére is expressing his belief that it would be better to discuss re-examining the ECU basket earlier, in June or July, rather than waiting until September. His reasoning is based on the importance of the issue for the markets, the financial system, and financial centers.erable to take the decisions fairly quickly so as not to leave too much uncertainty in this respect.   Mr.  Godeaux wondered whether the Governors needed further time beyond the study which the '"Dalgaard Group" was to present in February.  On the basis of that study, i. e.  Report No.  65, the Committee could discuss the question of a re-examination of the ECU basket in depth.   The Chairman pointed out that, concerning the re-examination of the weights of the currencies making up the ECU, which appeared as item 8 in the outline work programme, it was.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents a discussion among Mr. Godeaux, the Committee, and the Chairman regarding the need for further time to study a report before making a decision. There is no direct indication of contention or disagreement among the parties involved.Passage number 6.
 EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS  The main features of the foreign exchange markets in December 1988 were: - a recovery of the US dollar, which regained its early November level; - a continued high degree of overall stability in the EMS, with on  balance only slight variations in positions in the EMS band;  a further marked strengthening of the Spanish peseta.  The US dollar gradually firmed against all major currencies during the month. Throughout much of the month, the dollar benefited from statistics which provided evidence that US economic growth was continuing. The dollar was also supported by rising short-term US interest rates and year-end corporate demand for dollars in increasingly thin holiday markets. The dollar closed the month about 22 higher against the Japanese yen, the  Deutsche Mark and sterling.  1 The central banks of the EEC, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada and the United States.

 No. The passage provides a description of exchange rate developments in December 1988 without introducing any contention or disagreement.



Passage number 7.
 i i) {  In the EMS the French and Belgian francs came under some pressure in the middle of the month as German interest rates rose; the respective central banks countered this by increasing interest rates to restore the differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark, and the situation subsequently stabilised again. The Italian lira continued to be fairly firm, while the Danish krone weakened slightly.  The Deutsche Mark depreciated by 1.9% against the US dollar despite some rise in market rates. On 15th December the lombard rate was increased by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5%. The Deutsche Mark was broadly unchanged against other currencies overall, so that its weighted index (1972 = 100) declined only to 169.9% from 170.4% at the end of November.  The French franc, which had been affected by the unwinding of positions at the beginning of the period owing to the narrowing of the interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark, recovered appre- ciably thereafter. The raising of the key rates by the Banque de France on 14th December and the encouraging economic forecasts for 1989 were the main factors behind this improvement.  Although the Belgian franc had performed well at the beginning of the period, enabling the Bangue Nationale to acquire foreign exchange on the markets, around mid-December onwards it was temporarily affected by pressure, mainly on account of the narrowing of the interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark. The Bangue Nationale thus intervened with the sale of foreign exchange and given the general upward movement in interest rates, it also decided to raise its official rates in two stages. The discount and lombard rates were thus increased to 7.75% and 8% respectively. In the last two weeks the Belgian franc staged a recovery, enabling the central bank to resume its purchases of substantial amounts of foreign currency and even to lower the Treasury bill rates for several maturities.

 No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The information provided is factual and does not present any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.



Passage number 8.
  On the whole, the position of the Dutch guilder in the upper part of the EMS band underwent little change. There was a slight weakening vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark due to a further narrowing of the short-term interest rate differential in the first part of the month. Coinciding with similar moves elsewhere, the Nederlandsche Bank raised its discount and lombard rates with effect from 16th December by 0.5 percentage point to 4.5 and 5.25% respectively.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

Explanation: The passage simply provides a factual statement about the position of the Dutch guilder in the EMS band and the adjustments made by the Nederlandsche Bank. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.



Passage number 9.
  The Danish krone weakened slightly and ended the month well below  the middle of the EMS band.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. It simply states a fact about the Danish krone weakening and ending the month below a certain level in the EMS band.



Passage number 10.
 Money market interest rates were relatively stable, leading to a decline in interest rate differentials vis-a-vis other EMS currencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this statement. It simply presents a fact about the stability of money market interest rates leading to a decline in interest rate differentials compared to other EMS currencies.



Passage number 11.
  The Irish pound remained relatively stable in the upper half of the EMS band. Net inflows of foreign currency over the month resulted in net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank of Ireland.  Following persistent capital inflows, the Italian lira continued to appreciate; from the middle of the month onwards it fluctuated around the lower margin of the narrow band.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply provides information about the stability of the Irish pound and the appreciation of the Italian lira.



Passage number 12.
 To contain the expansion of the monetary base the Banca d'Italia did not counteract this upward trend and made only limited interventions in EMS currencies in order to smooth the movements of the lira.  Sterling was in strong demand at the beginning of December in the wake of November's 1% rise in UK base rates, but, by mid-month, it had surrendered its gains amid expectations of European interest rate rises. In the quiet markets which prevailed over the Christmas period, sterling lost ground to the dollar, but strengthened against most other currencies. Sterling's trade-weighted index fell by 0.8% to 77.7 (1975 = 100) and 97.4 on the new basis (1985 = 100).  The Greek drachma depreciated by 1.9% against the US dollar but remained unchanged vis-a-vis the ECU. In effective terms the drachma depreciated by 0.42.  The Spanish peseta continued its appreciation during the period, ending 2% higher with respect to the ECU and virtually unchanged with respect to the dollar. The strength of the peseta was caused by both long-term and short-term capital inflows, fostered by a further rise in interest rates intended to moderate the expansion of domestic demand. On 13th December the Banco de Espana raised its intervention rate for overnight funds by 1 per- centage point to 12.4%; it also raised the three-month repurchase agreement rate from 11.75% to 12% on 7th December and to 12.5% on 13th December.  In effective terms the depreciation of the Portuguese escudo amounted to 0.2% in December and 3.5% for the whole of 1988, in line with the foreign exchange policy defined by the authorities. Against the US dollar the escudo weakened by 1.72.  After firming temporarily in October and November, the Swiss franc weakened again in December. It depreciated by 3.3% against the US dollar and by 1.5% vis-a-vis the major European currencies. On an export-weighted  basis the decline amounted to 1.7%. Euro-Swiss franc rates stabilised at a higher level between 4.5Z and 5%. In mid-December the money supply target for 1989 was fixed at 2%. At the same time the discount and lombard rates were raised by 0.5 percentage point each to 3.5% and 5.5% respectively.  The Austrian schilling weakened by 1.9% vis-a-vis the US dollar, with a monthly spread of 3.9%. Against the Deutsche Mark it fluctuated by only 0.1%. On 16th December the lombard rate was increased by 0.5 percentage point to 5.5%. The sharp decline in the foreign exchange position of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank is attributable to the purchase of Miinze Osterreich AG for Sch. 8 billion. In order to avoid a temporary surplus of liquidity on the domestic money market, this amount is being invested in foreign currency in the interim and will be used in the course of the year to service the country's foreign debt.  The Norwegian krone showed a tendency to appreciate during the course of the month. Norges Bank's overnight lending rate was reduced by a further 0.4 percentage point to 12% with effect from 5th December, a move which was widely anticipated in the market. The demand for kroner also gave room for further intervention purchases, enabling over half of the sudden reserve reduction in mid-November to be recovered.  The Swedish krona was stable on the strong side of the index band. In the middle of the month some capital inflows occurred as a result of non-residents' operations.  The Finnish markka fluctuated, in effective terms, within a nar- row band. Towards the end of the month it firmed slightly in the thin pre-year-end market as short-term money market rates rose marginally.  The Japanese yen depreciated by 2.22 against the US dollar to close at Yen 124.90 per US dollar. This movement was in line with a slightly less bearish sentiment towards the US dollar, reflecting the higher oil prices, wider interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States, and year-end dollar remittances by subsidiaries of US multinational corporations. At the same time the yen also weakened slightly against the ECU.  The Canadian dollar fluctuated over a wide range, ending the month at US$ 0.8386, down 0.4% over the period. After touching a seven- year high of US$ 0.8444 early in the period against the background of strong positive sentiment in favour of the Canadian dollar following the federal  election on 21st November, the currency weakened by mid-month to a low of  US$ 0.8278 in response to commercial year-end demand for US dollars and  profit-taking on the speculative investment inflows which had underpinned the Canadian dollar's recent strength. Subsequently, the Canadian dollar firmed in seasonally thin trading, reflecting the completion of corporate year-end requirements for foreign currency and renewed investment inflows  from abroad.  Il. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Central bank interventions in December were sharply lower than in the preceding month. Net purchases amounted to US$ 0.6 billion, compared with US$ 7.9 billion in November. The largest interventions were those by the Bank of Canada, which carried out both sales and purchases, giving net sales of approximately US$ 0.2 billion. The Banque de France was also a  relatively major seller.  B.

Passage number 13.
 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies by Community central banks, at the equivalent of US$ 1.4 billion, were virtually the same as in November (US$ 1.3 billion).  The interventions were almost exclusively in Deutsche Mark. On a net basis the largest purchases were reported by the Banque Nationale de  Belgique, while the largest sales were made by the Banque de France.  IIT. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH, UP TO 6th JANUARY  In the first few days of January the dollar initially weakened, but thereafter appreciated beyond its end-1988 level on further evidence of continued strength in the US economy. The situation remained stable in the  EMS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No.  The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information about interventions in Community currencies and private ECUs, specifically in EMS currencies, and developments in the current month up to 6th January.
