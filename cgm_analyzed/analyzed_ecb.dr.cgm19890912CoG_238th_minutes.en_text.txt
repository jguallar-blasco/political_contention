I. Approval of the minutes of the 23/th meeting  The Committee approved the minutes of the 237th meeting, on the understanding that the editorial amendments suggested would be incorporated  in the final text.  II. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the 'Dalgaard Group" and discussion by the Committee of Alternates;  - Statistical charts and tables  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  The "Monitoring Group" had focused its attention on matters relating to the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta, after briefly discussing the situation of the dollar. After weakening slightly from mid-June onwards, the dollar had strengthened again since early August to a level of DM 2; almost the same level as the peak recorded in June. This trend was attributable to a number of factors, in particular the considerable confidence in the dollar, which stemmed perhaps from the fact that for two and a half years it had on average seemed more profitable to invest in dollars than in Deutsche Mark or yen. The interest rate differentials in favour of the dollar were relatively narrow, more so than early in the year, and thus were not the reason for the dollar's strength. The dollar was, however, supported by market expectations that the US economy would continue to grow and that monetary policy would therefore not be relaxed.  As far as the short-term outlook was concerned, the possibility could not  be ruled out that signs of an appreciable slowdown in the US economy or  poor foreign trade figures might lead to a sharp fall in the dollar.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED******************* This might then create problems for the EMS exchange rate mechanism, given that the ensuing deterioration in the balances of payments in Europe would not  be sustained equally easily by the countries concerned.  However, it seemed more likely that growth would continue in the United States and that interest rates would remain at their present level.  Renewed upward pressure on the dollar could not be ruled out, and this would not be helpful to the adjustment process given the US fundamentals.  Opinions differed as to possible courses  of action.  Some thought that it would be necessary for the central banks to show that they wished to keep the dollar exchange rate below DM 2. 03, its June peak, to prevent it from rising above that level again.  Others considere.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

The passage suggests that there are differing opinions on the possible courses of action regarding the dollar exchange rate. Some believe that central banks should work to keep the dollar exchange rate below a certain level, while others consider a different approach.d that intervention had little likelihood of success if the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan, whose enthusiasm had so far only been lukewarm, did not participate wholeheartedly.   The heavy interventions by the Banca d'Italia had been discussed.  Very strong growth in Italy coupled with too weak a fiscal policy necessitated a tight monetary policy and led therefore to high interest rates, which attracted capital.  The Banca d'Italia had allowed the lira to appreciate slightly - by around 4% since autumn 1988 - which assisted price stability but was bad for competitiveness.  This appreciation had been halted at a level corresponding roughly to the upper limit of the narrow band, which was in fact a way of shadowing the narrow-band currencies.  Some experts h.

The statement simply discusses the actions and decisions made by the Banca d'Italia regarding monetary policy and exchange rate management.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************ad found that pursuing this policy was probably more difficult than actually being in the narrow-band system, where the fact that the rate could not rise further would limit expectations.  The experts at the Banca d'Italia were not convinced by this argument.  In fact, very substantial interventions - amounting to about US$ 5 billion since early July - had been necessary to halt the decline of the lira, and the Banca d'Italia was aware that such interventions could not continue for long.  It was expected, however, that fiscal policy would soon be tightened: the budget for 1990, which would be presented by the end of September, should contain measures in that direction, and others should already produce an effect in the fourth quarter of 1989.  If this did occur,.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The experts at the Banca d'Italia are not convinced by the argument that pursuing a specific policy would be more difficult than staying in the narrow-band system. This implies a difference of opinion between the experts and the proponents of the policy. interest rates, and hence also the lira exchange rate, should weaken.  This was precisely the reason why the Banca d'Italia did not wish to see a further appreciation of the lira now, when it was hoping that the rate might soon come down again.  The Banca d'Italia would, however, reconsider its policy if the measures to tighten fiscal policy did not work out as planned.   The situation in Spain was in some respects similar to that in Italy: growth was buoyant, while fiscal policy was inadequate and therefore had to be augmented by a tight monetary policy.  The high interest rates had at times resulted in very large intervention purchases (of the order of US$ 27 billion in 1988 and 1989) and a substantial appreciation of the peseta (of around 10%).  Lately, the .

Interest rates were still high, but it was expected that they might gradually come  down, for, over the months, fiscal policy had become less expansionary, and  - 4 -  measures to tighten it had been taken in July.  Finally, it was expected  that the Government would be re-elected at the forthcoming early election  and that it would tighten fiscal policy.  This was probably the reason why  no significant intervention had been necessary since early August.  Moreover, the Banco de Espana had contributed to this development by allowing the peseta to move very close to its upper limit, thereby reducing possible exchange rate gains and increasing potential losses.  On 8th and 11th September interventions had been carried out at .

The passage simply outlines various factors that contributed to a more balanced situation in the economy, such as expected decreases in interest rates, tightening of fiscal policy, and expectations of the government being re-elected.This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number 3
 The markets had confidence in the Italian real economy, the lira and the EMS and did not expect any early realignment.   Mr.  Rubio stated that, as Mr.  Dalgaard had mentioned, fiscal policy had been tightened in Spain in recent months, which should enable  the public sector deficit to be reduced to 2. 5% of GDP in 1989 compared - 10 -  with 3% in 1988 and 42 in 1987.  The Government could be considered to have done what it could for the immediate future.  Moreover, the Prime Minister had announced that the budget for 1990 would be tougher than‘the 1989 one and that an early election would take place at the end of October.  However, fiscal measures alone would certainly not be able to solve all the problems, for the current public sector deficit was relatively moderate compared with other countries, and experience had shown that even with a. smaller deficit, or even a surplus, the same problems existed in certain countries.

The information is presented as a statement of fact and analysis of the fiscal situation in Spain.tary policy had therefore also been brought into play and had been tightened.  There were, however, limits for interest rates and reserve ratios, which could not be increased disproportionately.  Last July the Banco de Espajfia had asked the banks to restrain the growth of their lending and to reduce the rate of increase from 22% in the first half to 12% in the second half of the year.  It was still too early to predict the outcome of this action, but there was hope.  In July there had already been a deceleration in the growth of broad money, and this movement had continued in August.  The economy, which was clearly overheating, should therefore gradually calm down, and the curbing of demand should make it possible to lower interest rates and ease the tensions affecting the peseta.   In this context the liberalisation of capital movements would certainly not be a solution.  The majority of capital imports were invest- ments, and t.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses the implementation of monetary policy and measures taken to control lending growth and reduce inflation.herefore the liberalisation of short-term capital movements would not have any effect.  Capital exports might be encouraged, but the essential measures had already been taken in this area, and complete liberalisation of lending in pesetas to non-residents would surely not have any impact, given the very high interest rates.  It should also be noted that interventions had become much more modest in August, which was reassuring.   In conclusion, Mr.  Rubio did not think there were any alternative policies at the moment: efforts to check domestic demand should continue, and the right moment should be awaited before starting to bring down interest rates, which did not, however, seem possible before the election at the end of October.   Mr.  Tavares Moreira said that the Banco de Portugal had indeed purchased dollars in July and particularly in August, when the total had exceeded US$ 1. 2 billion.  The structural weaknesses and rigidit.

The speakers, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Tavares Moreira, seem to be in agreement on the economic situation and the measures that need to be taken.ies of the Portuguese economy were the reason for using the exchange rate as an  instrument of adjustment.  In fact, the escudo had appreciated considerably - 1li -  in real terms despite the gradual devaluation which was being undertaken but which only partially offset the interest rate differential of approxi- mately 7% vis-a-vis the Community average.  Real interest rates were relatively low in Portugal and were even slightly negative in the case of rates on time deposits.  The Banco de Portugal had resold on the market a large proportion of the dollars purchased to correct the composition of its currency portfolio.  It was probable that the central bank would continue to purchase currencies, but it planned to diversify and revise its intervention policy and would keep the other central banks informed within the framework of the "Dalgaard Group".   The Portuguese authorities had recently taken an important measure to liberalise.

  Within the EMS there were no tensions and the respective positions altered moderately. The Spanish peseta, which entered the exchange rate mechanism in June, almost reached the upper limit of the wide band against the Danish krone. The Italian lira stabilised in the upper part of the narrow band as a result of massive intramarginal interventions of the Banca d'Italia during August.  While the Deutsche Mark firmed somewhat vis-a-vis most of the currencies officially quoted in the Federal Republic, its weighted index recorded a slight decline of 0.5% over the two months under review to stand at 173.7 at the end of August (1972=100). The end-June increase in key interest rates thus had no visible impact on the exchange rates. A weaker tendency was recorded against most of the European currencies, whose positive interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark was considered to be sizable compared to the perceived exchange risk (sterling, Spanish peseta, French franc and Italian lira).  The French franc firmed progressively vis-a-vis most currencies of the EMS, showing an average rise of 0.7%. This development became more pronounced from mid-July onwards due mainly to securities purchases by non-residents and increased foreign exchange sales by exporters.  During the whole of July the Belgian franc was characterised by marked stability. In the course of August the Belgian franc tended to appreciate gradually vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark and the Dutch guilder. However, at the end of the period under review a slight decline set in due to the narrowing of the interest differential between the Deutsche Mark and the Belgian franc. The Banque Nationale de Belgique pursued a cautious monetary policy, only lowering the rate on 3-month Treasury certificates once - by 0.05 percentage point to 8.45% on Ist August.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The text simply outlines the respective positions and exchange rate movements of various European currencies within the EMS during the time period discussed.



Passage number 5.
  The position of the Dutch guilder vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark underwent little change as both currencies remained in the upper part of the narrow EMS band.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. The statement simply mentions that both the Dutch guilder and the Deutsche Mark remained in the upper part of the narrow EMS band, indicating stability rather than contention or disagreement.



Passage number 6.
  The Danish krone remained stable and continued as the weakest currency in the EMS band. During the period as a whole interest rates declined slightly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply provides information about the stability of the Danish krone and the trend of interest rates during a certain period.



Passage number 7.
  The Irish pound appreciated in the upper half of the EMS band  during July, as, following the rise in official interest rates at end-June, substantial net capital outflows gave way to modest net inflows.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

Explanation: The passage presents a straightforward statement about the Irish pound appreciating within the EMS band during July due to a change in official interest rates leading to a shift from capital outflows to inflows. There is no contention or disagreement present in this statement.



****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************
Passage number 8.
 The currency remained steady in the upper half of the EMS band during August, with substantial capital inflows being offset by net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank.  In July, the Italian lira appreciated significantly, due to a seasonally favourable current account, reaching the upper limit of the narrow band.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes, there is potential for contention in the passage. The mention of substantial capital inflows being offset by net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank could be seen as a discrepancy or potential disagreement.



Passage number 9.
 In August, as short-term capital inflows resumed, the Banca d'Italia intervened, purchasing large amounts of US dollars and various EMS currencies, in order to contain the upward trend of the lira and to keep it close to the top of the narrow EMS band.  The Spanish peseta firmed during the first part of July, after a round of monetary tightening, which consisted mainly of an increase of 0.75 percentage points in the intervention rate for overnight funds to 14.52 on 6th July and an increase of 1 percentage point in the reserve requirements to 19%. Later on, the peseta stabilised close to the upper limit of the wide band through the end of August. On the whole, it finished 1.3% higher against both the ECU and the US dollar.  Sentiment towards sterling improved considerably during July as UK economic data tended to confirm the growing impression that the UK economy was cooling. However, rumours that the Bank of England had been restraining the rise sparked a sudden fall at the beginning of August and, as the feeling developed that UK interest rates had peaked, the pound dipped to mid-month lows. Well-publicised official support arrested the decline and attitudes towards sterling became more positive towards the end of the period. This was despite disappointing UK trade figures for July which, with the help of prompt overt intervention, were quickly seen as probably an aberration. Sterling's trade-weighted index rose by 1.4% to 91.5 (1985=100).  The Greek drachma fluctuated within a wide range against the US dollar, while it remained relatively stable versus the ECU. On balance, it depreciated both against the US dollar and the ECU by 0.3% and 0.42% respectively. In effective terms, the drachma depreciated by 0.2% in July and by 0.1% in August.  Net inflows of capital, together with the objectives defined by the authorities for the exchange rate policy of the Portuguese escudo, resulted in large net purchases of foreign currency by the Banco de Portugal. The escudo depreciated by 0.5% in effective terms and by 0.2% against the  US dollar in the course of these two months. The Swiss franc depreciated slightly against all major currencies. Compared to the US dollar it lost roughly 1%. Measured by the trade-weighted index it depreciated by 1.2%. The Euromarket rates stagnated at a high level of around 7.252.  The Austrian schilling weakened vis-a-vis the US dollar by 0.4%. Against the Deutsche Mark it fluctuated in both months by 0.1%. In July there were fairly large capital inflows.  The Norwegian krone showed a slightly weaker tendency and ended the period 0.2% weaker in effective terms. Norges Bank intervened on several occasions buying or selling foreign exchange in order to limit the short-term fluctuations.  High interest rates and the decision to abolish the main parts of the foreign exchange control from lst July led to a strong demand for the swedish krona for most of the period under review. The krona strengthened as the Riksbank's index fell from 130.50 to 130.15 and the Riksbank was forced to intervene on several occasions.  The Finnish markka remained relatively stable close to the strong end of its fluctuation band until mid-August. Towards the end of the month it eased slightly and the short-term interest rates rose by almost one per- centage point.  The Japanese yen appreciated against the US dollar to Yen 138.40 in July due to expectations of lower US interest rates. However, these expectations faded somewhat in August reflecting the so-called “soft landing" of the US economy. This pushed the yen down to Yen 144.28 in August. The Bank of Japan entered the market at various times, selling US dollars against Japanese yen to shrug off the dollar-bullish momentum. Meanwhile, the yen depreciated slightly against the ECU throughout July and August.  - The Canadian dollar appreciated to a 9-year high of US$ 0.8548 in early August, before easing back to close the month at US$ 0.8484. Over the period, the currency strengthened by 1.5% against the US dollar. Attractive Canadian/US interest rate differentials and expectations that Canadian monetary policy would remain firm brought about strong foreign investor demand for Canadian securities as well as renewed activity in Euro-Canadian issues. Late in the period, the publication of a worse-than-expected current  account figure for the second quarter caused the currency to ease.  II. INTERVENTIONS  A. Interventions in US dollars  ‘  Dollar interventions resulted in net purchases both in July and August, totalling US$ 0.9 billion compared with net sales of US$ 15.5 billion in June. The net figure was the result of gross purchases of US$ 6.5 billion and gross sales of US$ 5.6 billion.  The most important buyers were the Banco de Portugal and the Banca d'Italia. Major sellers were the Bank of Japan and the Federal Reserve  Bank.  B.

 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECU's  Interventions in EMS currencies and private ECUs corresponded to . US$ 3.5 billion in July and August compared to US$ 0.4 billion in June. Most of the interventions were Deutsche Mark purchases primarily carried out by the Banca d'Italia; there were also some purchases of French francs and Danish kroner. Substantial purchases of private ECU were carried out by  the Banca d'Italia and the Banco de Espana.  III.
