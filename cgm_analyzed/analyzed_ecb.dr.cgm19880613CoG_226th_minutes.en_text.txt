The Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 225th meeting, on the understanding that the editorial amendments suggested would be in-  corporated in the final text.  * Final text approved at the meeting on 12th July 1988, which incorporates a drafting change. II. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the “Dalgaard Group";  - Statistical charts and tables.  4  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  The "Monitoring Group" had not met in Basle because of timetable problems, but, as usual, it had held a telephone conference on the after- noon of Friday, 10th June, which formed the basis of this statement.  The main conclusion was that the authorities had now convinced the markets that there would not be any major changes in exchange rates in the near future. The result was that funds were tending to flow to countries with high rates of interest. This was true both for the relations between the dollar and the other currencies and within the EMS.  During May and the beginning of June the dollar had risen by approximately 3% against the Deutsche Mark and had reached its highest level since the end of October 1987. However, the fluctuations had been moderate compared with those in the past, and over the last five months the  dollar had, in fact, been moving within a quite narrow band around DM 1.70.  This appreciation of the dollar was principally due to the rise in US interest  rates and to the market's perception, based on statements and interventions made by the central banks, that the dollar would not be allowed to fall much lower than DM 1.67 or rise much higher than DM 1.73. The firming of the US currency had, nevertheless, been limited by quite substantial sales of dollars by the Deutsche Bundesbank. The Bundesbank did not consider that these constituted interventions, as the sales, effected outside the market, corresponded to dollars acquired previously in the form of customer transac~- tions, for example US and UK payments for the maintenance of troops in Germany and interest income on reserves. The amounts sold did not appear in the intervention tables, but they were included in Table 2, which showed an outflow of US$ 3.4 billion in the form of customer transactions in May. The "Monitoring Group” and the "Concertation Group" had briefly discussed the best way of dealing with this type of dollar sale in the statistical systen, but they had not reached a conclusion and would come back to this question. The EEC experts were, however, of the opinion that it would be sensible to curb the strengthening of the dollar, given that a further increase would  probably not be sustainable. In any case, the appreciation of the dollar since the beginning of May should not be exaggerated; on the one hand, it reflected the rise in US interest rates, which had brought the differential vis-a-vis German rates to more than 3 points, and, on the other, the apprecia- tion had only occurred against the European currencies, the dollar having remained more or less stable vis-a-vis the yen. In short, the sales of dollars by the Bundesbank had only neutralised or offset the purchases made by other central banks.

Passage number 2.
  Within the EMS a total absence of expectations of a realignment in the near future had been observed for some time. This was a very satisfying development, almost surprising if it was considered that elections had been held in France and Denmark. In May and early June there had been no tension, Save some changes in the relative positions of currencies reflecting interest rate differentials. Three currencies, the Danish krone, the French franc and the Irish pound, had performed particularly well. The Danish krone had risen by 1% against the Deutsche Mark; the market interest rates had fallen by between 0.5 and 1 point without any variation in the official rates, and the central bank had purchased approximately US$ 750 million. The French franc had also firmed, by between 0.5 and 0.75% against the Deutsche Mark, while the interest rate differential between these two currencies had been reduced. The Banque de France had accepted quite marked variations in the exchange rate, which had proved very effective in stabilising the market, so that there had been no need for intervention. The Irish pound had also appreciated against the Deutsche Mark, while interest rates had declined slightly in Ireland and intervention purchases had amounted to approxi- mately US$ 500 million. It should be noted, however, that despite the decreases in interest rates that had occurred, the interest rate differentials vis-a-vis Germany remained relatively high: 5 points for Denmark and 3 to 4 points for France and Ireland. The Italian lira had shown little movement against the Deutsche Mark and had firmed slightly at the beginning of June. Interest rates had remained more or less unaltered, but there had been substantial changes in interventions: the Banca d'Italia had sold US$ 1.5 billion by llth May and had repurchased almost the same amount over the weeks that followed. This turn-round partly reflected the stabilisation of the political situation in Italy and also the influence of the elections in France. The Belgian franc and the Dutch guilder had moved only slightly against the Deutsche Mark, the interest rates had also remained very stable, and some  moderate intervention purchases had been made.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply outlines the relatively stable exchange rate situations of various European currencies within the EMS during a specific time period.


Passage number 3.
 The Deutsche Mark had weakened within the EMS in spite of the reduction in interest rate differentials, purchases of German currency by the central banks in the region of US$ 3 billion and sales of dollars by the Deutsche Bundesbank totalling more than US$ 3 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a series of facts without any indication of contention or disagreement.

  Outside the EMS exchange rate mechanism, the pound sterling had continued to appreciate in May, only to fall quite sharply at the beginning of June.  The Bank of England had actively used interest rates, lowering them in April and May when the pound had been very firm and then raising them twice by half a point when the exchange rate had weakened.  This use of the interest rate instrument had made it possible virtually to dispense with interventions in the market.  The Spanish peseta had remained fairly stable against the Deutsche Mark between the end of April and the end of May, during which time there had been no change in the interest rates, and no interventions had been made.  At the end of May and the beginning of June there had.

It is simply stating facts about the exchange rates and actions taken by the Bank of England. been new inflows of funds, which had led to interventions despite a fall in Spanish interest rates.  As forecast, the Portuguese escudo had depreciated by 0. 3% in effective terms.  The Greek drachma had also depreciated slightly, but its effective depreciation since the start of 1988 only amounted  to 2. 3%, which was very little.   B.  Discussion by the Committee  The Chairman recalled that on account of the special timetable of meetings at the BIS in June, the Alternates had not convened, and conse- quently Mr.  Janson was not required to present the usual report on the discussions held by the Alternates.   Mr.  Pohl said that the description of recent developments given by Mr.  Dalgaard was correct.  The absence of expectations of.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing a description of recent developments and a discussion by the committee members. a realignment had led to substantial outflows of funds from Germany, which have almost reached DM 50 billion since the beginning of 1988.  The result of this had been strong pressure on long-term interest rates, and the slope of the yield curve had steepened markedly.  The discount rate stood at 2. 5%, while the capital market rates were between 6 and 7Z.  Tensions were also affecting short-term interest rates; it had to be realised that differentials of 3 to 4 points vis-a-vis France and Ireland and of 5 points vis-a-vis Denmark meant that, in fact, the interest rates in these countries were twice as high, or even higher, than in Germany; this in turn  created a strong incentive for capital movements as long as there were no  expecta.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes the outflows of funds from Germany and the resulting pressure on interest rates, particularly in comparison to other countries such as France, Ireland, and Denmark.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************tions of exchange rate changes.  In this context the lowering of interest rates in France and Denmark was welcome, but some increase in short-term rates in Germany was possible in the coming weeks.   Mr.  de Larosiere emphasised that the present situation was frag- ile; there were no expectations of exchange rate changes, but this stabil- ity was based on enormous external disequilibria.  It was therefore neces- sary to do nothing to disturb this stability.  No country would benefit from provoking a fall in the dollar.  Mr.  Greenspan had recently said, with good reason, that if the dollar should fall, the nominal US balance-of~-payments figures would deteriorate.  In fact, the capacity of export-oriented production was already under s.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions that there may be an increase in short-term rates in Germany, which suggests potential disagreement or contention about the direction of interest rates. Additionally, the passage also discusses the importance of maintaining stability and not provoking a fall in the dollar, which could imply differing opinions on how to handle exchange rate changes.Passage number 5.
 EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS  The main features of the foreign exchange market during May 1988  were:  - a strengthening of the US dollar vis-a-vis most currencies, in particular against the Deutsche Mark, together with a roughly unchanged position vis-a-vis the yen;  - an absence of tension in the EMS despite political elections in some countries;  - a continuing strengthening of sterling until the end of the month when it began to weaken;  - some uncertainties concerning the trend of interest rates related mainly to the pace of economic activity in the United States and  other industrial countries.  1 The central banks of the EEC, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada and the United States. The US dollar edged higher against most major currencies. It was supported by rising US interest rates, expectations of a further tightening of US monetary policy, and the perception that there was a developing con- vergence of policy requirements for domestic stability and external adjust- ment. In addition, the dollar benefited from the report of much better- than-expected US trade figures for March. The dollar closed the month 3 1/4% higher against the Deutsche Mark, 2% higher against the pound sterling and 1/4% higher against the yen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage describes the strengthening of the US dollar against most currencies and the reasons behind it. There is no contention or disagreement mentioned.

  The EMS was generally stable. The changed market mood after the French and Danish elections, together with a firmer US currency, contributed to an appreciation of the Danish krone and, to a lesser extent, of the French franc.  The Deutsche Mark weakened vis-a-vis most of the major curren- cies, with a decline of 3.1% and 2.92% against the US dollar and the Japanese yen respectively and one of 0.6% within the EMS. The main reason was the renewed attention given to interest rate differentials between the Deutsche Mark and the other currencies. The Deutsche Mark's weighted index vis-a-vis fourteen industrial countries stood at 170.6 at the end of May, 1.3% below its end-Apri® level of 172.8 (1972=100).  The French franc strengthened in the second half of the month, approaching its central rate vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark. One of the main reasons was the considerable foreign capital inflow on the French bond market induced by attractive long-term interest rates. The particularly stable position of the French franc allowed the reduction of the Banque de France's intervention rate from 7.25% to 7% and a further liberalisation of exchange controls. A 0.5% increase in prices in April did not prevent these developments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage describes a weakening of the Deutsche Mark and a strengthening of the French franc, which indicates a disagreement or contention within the EMS.


Passage number 7.
  As in the previous month the Dutch guilder remained in top position within the EMS band. The Nederlandsche Bank bought moderate amounts of Deutsche Mark and lowered its rate for special advances by 0.12% to 3.92%.

Passage number 9.
  The Danish krone rose by approximately 1% within the narrow EMS band after the general election on 10th May. Simultaneously market interest  rates declined and the Central Bank made some intervention purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply presents a statement of facts without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 10.
 The Irish pound remained relatively stable in the upper half of the EMS band during the month. In response to continuing net: inflows the Central Bank of Ireland effected net purchases of foreign currency and reduced its rate for overnight funds by 0.5 percentage point to 8%.  The Italian lira was subject to some pressure in the first part of the month in connection with market uncertainty ahead of the French Presidential elections. Since then, the change in market sentiment has allowed the Banca d'Italia to rebuild some of its reserves and the lira to stabilise in the EMS.  Although sterling softened a little at the beginning of the month as oil prices fell, underlying sentiment remained good and periods of heavy overseas demand were seen. Official sales of sterling and a further 1/22 reduction in UK base rates (to 7 1/2%) on 17th May stemmed the appreciation of the currency. The publication of an increased UK trade deficit for April and the recovery of the dollar caused the pound to end on a softer note. Its trade-weighted index fell by 0.5 to 77.9 (1975=100).  The Greek drachma ended the period unchanged vis-a-vis the ECU, while it depreciated by 2.6% against the US dollar. In effective terms the drachma depreciated by 0.32.  The Spanish _peseta ended 0.4% lower with respect to the EEC currencies in effective nominal terms. Most of this depreciation took place during the first half of the month, while renewed capital inflows in the last few days led to additional purchases of foreign currencies by the Banco de Espafia. The Banco de Espafia reduced its rate for overnight funds by 0.5 percentage point to 10.52.  In effective terms, the Portuguese escudo depreciated by 0.32. Vis-a-vis the US dollar it decreased by 2.6%. As from 6th May the Banco de Portugal's rediscount rate was lowered by 0.5 percentage point to 13.52.  The downward trend of the Swiss franc continued during the month. Exchange rate losses vis-a-vis both the US dollar and the Japanese yen amounted to roughly 3.5%.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information about the stability and changes in various currencies. There is no contention or disagreement presented in the passage.


Passage number 11.
 Against the EMS currencies the franc's weakening proved to be less pronounced. The export-weighted value of the Swiss currency dropped by 1.4%. Despite rising interest rates in the domestic money market the interest rate level remained comparatively low.  The Austrian schilling weakened vis-a-vis the US dollar by 3.42, the monthly spread amounting to 3.5%. Against the Deutsche Mark it fluctu- ated by a mere 0.042%.  Higher interest rates led to heavy selling of foreign currencies against the Swedish krona by non-residents as well as by domestic compa- nies. The index for the krona remained at the intervention point of 130.0 for most of the period and the Sveriges Riksbank was forced to buy large amounts of foreign currencies almost on a daily basis.  The recent strength of the Norwegian krone, together with signs of less rapid credit expansion, allowed for a reduction in the interest rate on banks’ daily borrowing facilities at the Central Bank by 0.5 per- centage point to 13.3% from 9th May. The inflow of foreign exchange never- theless resumed and Norges Bank had to intervene regularly during the latter part of the month in order to prevent the currency index from becoming stronger than 109.5, the lower limit of the band.  The Finnish markka strengthened slightly as a result of a con- tinuing capital inflow. The base rate was raised from 7Z to 8% as from 16th May.  The Canadian dollar traded in a fairly narrow range influenced by the narrowing and widening of short-term interest rate differentials vis- a-vis the United States.  The Japanese yen was relatively stable, remaining within a narrow range of Yen 124-125 against the US dollar in thin and quiet trading. Vis- a-vis European currencies the yen appreciated by 2.5% against the ECU. This was mainly in response to Japan's strong economic performance against the  background of the stability of the dollar/yen exchange rate.  II. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Net purchases of US dollars by central banks amounted to US$ 3.3 billion compared with US$ 4.6 billion in April. Gross purchases amounted to US$ 4.5 billion and gross sales to US$ 1.2 billion. The main buyers were the Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and Scandinavian central banks. The  main sellers were the Banca d'Italia and the Bank of Canada.  B.

Passage number 12.
 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies and ECUs by Community central  banks amounted to the equivalent of US$ 4.3 billion compared with US$ 2.8 billion in April. These interventions mainly consisted of purchases of Deutsche Mark by the Banco de Espana, the Central Bank of Ireland and  Danmarks Nationalbank.  III. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH, UP TO 10th JUNE  The US dollar remained relatively stable during the first days of June as the exchange rate appeared to be influenced by interest rate differentials.

Passage number 13.
 The EMS was also stable. Sterling weakened further allowing the authorities to induce two half-point increases in the base lending rate  to 8.52%.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It simply states that the EMS (European Monetary System) was stable and that the weakening of Sterling allowed the authorities to increase the base lending rate by two half-points to 8.52%.
