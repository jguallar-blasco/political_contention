  Within the EMS exchange rate mechanism there had been no tensions but there had been some slight changes in the positions of certain currencies. The relative weakness of the Deutsche Mark had not been reflected in the fluctuation band but in substantial interventions and a rise in interest rates. Most of the other currencies had performed better. The Dutch guilder, for once, had suffered a brief bout of weakness attributable to the increase in German interest rates at a time when the money market in the Netherlands was too liquid to enable the central bank to influence interest rates. The situation had then returned to normal, with the guilder at parity with the Deutsche Mark and the interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany almost zero. The Belgian franc had also been subject to some pressure in June when interest rate differentials had narrowed because Belgian rates had not been raised so as not to complicate the issue of a government loan. Rates had subsequently been raised and the Belgian franc had firmed. The French franc  had remained very strong; there were continuing large capital inflows,  mainly at long term and directed into both bonds and shares, with the share index recovering to its pre-October 1987 level, which was not the case everywhere. The Banque de France had preferred to maintain the same or a lower level of interest rates rather than let the exchange rate appreciate. The Danish krone had firmed within the band under the influence of continuing capital inflows attracted by relatively high interest rates. Danmarks Nationalbank had undertaken some intervention purchases and had lowered its interest rates. Market rates had also fallen, so that the differential vis-a-vis German rates had been narrowed in two months from 6 to 4 percentage points. The Italian lira had been stable, as had interest rates, and interven- tion purchases by the central bank had been modest. The Irish pound had benefited from capital inflows and favourable fundamentals, in particular inflation and the balance of payments, which had contributed to the firming of its exchange rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The information is presented as factual statements about the changes in currency positions and interest rates within the EMS exchange rate mechanism.


Passage number 3.
  In all, the situation within the EMS had been calm and the central banks had demonstrated their willingness to use all instruments - the position of their currency within the band, interest rates and interventions - to stabilise the exchange rate.  The pound sterling had been rather volatile. The authorities had made frequent use of interest rates; following three 1/2-point decreases in May, rates had been raised by 1/2 point on five occasions between early June and early July in order to stabilise the exchange rate and above all to counteract inflationary pressures and signs of overheating. Upward pressure had been exerted on the Spanish peseta during the first three weeks of June, and the Banco de Espana had carried out some intervention purchases.  The peseta had weakened towards the end of June but, as Spanish interest rates were still high, the situation should return to normal. The Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo had continued to depreciate at a slow and orderly pace, and over the first half of 1988 as a whole these two currencies had remained more or less stable vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark.  The use of the private ECU had increased, as could be seen from Table 3 of the concertation statistics. The total balances held by the central banks participating in the concertation procedure had amounted to more than ECU 6.2 billion at the end of June 1988, compared with approximately ECU 4 billion at the end of December 1987. In June the Banca d'Italia's holdings had risen appreciably following a government loan issue in ECUs,  and the Central Bank of Ireland had acquired ECUs for the first time.  B. Statement by Mr. Janson  The discussion had been dominated by the recent rise in the dollar, which had amounted to almost 10% in two months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It primarily provides information about the situation within the EMS and the actions taken by central banks to stabilize exchange rates. The statement by Mr. Janson is separate from the preceding information and does not indicate any disagreement or contention either.

 Could such a development be considered compatible with the Louvre Accords, and did it pose problems for  EMS cohesion.   1.  The Louvre Accords  While concerned about the rapid appreciation of the dollar, the Alternates of the G-7 member countries thought that this rise, and the  varied reactions it had evoked, were still consistent with the flexible framework of the Louvre Accords.  The different views which had been expressed in the markets and in the media were therefore unfounded.   Nonetheless, these Alternates did not think that it would be advisable to make the agreed arrangements more transparent.  The fixing and publication of target zones would make speculation easier.  However, they recognised that in the absence of formal or explicit exchange rate objectives the credibility of the Accords rested on a consensus among the participants as to the objectives to be attained, and required vi.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is discussing the views and thoughts of the Alternates of the G-7 member countries regarding the compatibility of a development with the Louvre Accords and whether it posed problems for EMS cohesion.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************sible concerted action pursued with steadfast resolve.  Recent developments did leave something to be desired in this respect when compared with the action undertaken at the start of the year, when it had been a question of halting the dollar's slide.  It had to be said that the required consensus did not seem assured for the moment.  In this pre-election period the US Administration seemed to welcome a strong dollar in the hope that it would remove the prospect of a further increase in interest rates.   The Alternates noted, however, that the fundamentals observed in the United States, in particular the current-account balance, made a rise in the dollar seem both inappropriate and extremely perilous.   The German authorities, for their part, considered the weakness of their currency undesirable on both domestic and external grounds.  They believed that monetary conditions in their country called .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The passage presents contrasting viewpoints on the strength of the dollar and its impact on various countries. The US Administration seems to welcome a strong dollar, while the Alternates and German authorities believe that it would be inappropriate and undesirable. This disagreement is evident in the differing opinions on the consequences of a strong dollar.for a tightening of monetary policy.  Defending the DM exchange rate could not therefore be based solely on interventions, even if these had the advantage of offsetting the impact on domestic liquidity of the large dollar purchases made in the past.   Some of the Alternates feared that to continue the policy of a progressive strengthening of the Deutsche Mark following the appreciation  of the dollar was fundamentally incompatible and unconducive to restoring calm in the markets.  In any event, it went against previous hopes of a decline in interest rates, seen as desirable from the point of view of the  global economy.   2.  Cohesion in the EMS  As far as the European Monetary System was concerned, the devel-  opments observed and the action undertaken with regard to both interventions  and interest rates had not so far created tensions within the system.  The  Banque de France and Danmarks Natio.

It is providing different perspectives and considerations on the policy of tightening monetary policy and defending the DM exchange rate.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************nalbank, which were faced with inflows  of foreign capital, had even been able to lower their interest rates slightly.  The Banque Nationale de Belgique had raised its rates because of the narrowing of the interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark and had intervened in support of the Belgian franc.   Several Alternates, however, emphasised the need for close co- ordination of the policies implemented in the present circumstances.  They feared that a sharper rise in interest rates in Germany and large-scale interventions would create problems in the functioning of the EMS.   The UK Alternate had stressed that the successive increases in the UK base rate had only brought this rate back to the level recorded in August 1987 and had to be seen in the context of the UK authorities' desire to stabilise sterling's exchange rate.   To conclude, the Governors were confronted with a difficult si.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The Banque Nationale de Belgique raised its rates while other central banks were able to lower their rates. The Alternates also had differing opinions on the need for close coordination of policies and the potential problems that could arise from higher interest rates in Germany and large-scale interventions.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************tuation which necessitated choices of objectives and choices of instruments:  - should efforts to check the rise in the dollar be continued.  - was the interest rate the right instrument to achieve this.   - were there alternative solutions.   B.  Discussion by the Committee  Mr.  de Larosiére pointed out that towards the end of 1987 France had built up a fairly wide interest rate differential vis-a-vis its neighbours and that there had therefore been some scope for reducing it, which had been done in two stages.  Firstly, at the end of May, the key rate had been lowered by 1/4 point, but this had been offset by an increase in banks' compulsory reserves.  In early July the firmness of the franc and inflows of capital had made it possible to reduce the tender rate by 1/4 point.  The French authorities had thus acted cautiously, and a substantial interest  rate differential remained vis-a-vis German.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The discussion by the committee implies disagreement about whether efforts to check the rise in the dollar should continue, whether the interest rate is the right instrument to achieve this, and whether there are alternative solutions. Different members of the committee may have different opinions on these issues.Passage number 5.
  The EMS remained stable. There was some movement in currencies’ relative positions in the wake of the appreciation of the Irish pound and the Danish krone which moved to the top of the band with a slightly wider spread vis-a-vis the Belgian franc.  The performance of the Deutsche Mark was mixed. It depreciated by 5.2% against the dollar despite occasionally substantial dollar sales by the Bundesbank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply describes the stability of the EMS and some movement in currencies' relative positions. The performance of the Deutsche Mark is also mentioned without any conflicting information.


Passage number 6.
 In contrast, within the EMS it was able to register slight exchange rate gains against most other currencies. It also improved its position vis-a-vis the pound sterling and Japanese yen. Overall, however, its index against the currencies of fourteen major industrial countries declined by 0.4%. Interest rates on the money and capital markets rose. The Bundesbank increased its repo rate in two stages of 1/4 percentage point each to 3.75% and its discount rate from 2 1/2 to 3% per annum on the last day of the month. The rises in interest rates had no visible effect on the valuation of the Deutsche Mark on the foreign exchange markets.  The French franc moved within narrow limits and continued to benefit from non-resident investment due to the buoyant bond markets. The strong position was bolstered by the announcement of a small retail price increase (+ 0.2%) in May and the holding of the trade deficit to Fr.fr. 1.4 billion in May and was not affected by the narrowing of the short-term interest rate differential vis-a-vis the major European cur- rencies at the end of the month.  Due to very liquid money market conditions short-term guilder rates declined substantially during the month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is providing information about various economic indicators without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 7.
 Consequently the Dutch guilder weakened vis-a-vis all EMS currencies. The Nederlandsche Bank made some intervention sales and partially followed the rise of interest rates abroad by raising its discount rate and rate on advances by 0.25 percentage  point to 3 1/2% and 4% respectively with effect from lst July. The Belgian franc was fairly stable at the beginning of the month, but weakened progressively during the second half, chiefly as a result of the narrowing of the interest rate differential vis-a-vis the major currencies, and the. Banque Nationale intervened repeatedly in order to defend the currency. On the last day of the month the central bank sup- plemented this by raising its discount and lombard rates by 0.25 percentage point to 6 3/4Z% and 7Z respectively following the general upward movement in interest rates.  The Danish krone strengthened further ending the month as the strongest currency in the EMS. Reflecting the strong krone the Central Bank made some intervention purchases and lowered its lending and deposit rates by 1/4 percentage point to 8 3/4% and 8% respectively on 16th June.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating the actions taken by different central banks in response to changes in interest rates and currency strength.


Passage number 8.
  Continued sizable intervention purchases helped to maintain the Irish pound relatively stable within the EMS band for the first half of the month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that continued intervention purchases helped maintain the stability of the Irish pound, indicating agreement and support for the intervention.


Passage number 9.
 Subsequently, having been allowed to firm towards the top of the band in response to continued inflows of currency, the Irish pound traded in a narrow range within the EMS band for the remainder of the month.  The Italian lira slightly improved its position in the EMS. The Banca d'Italia was a net buyer on the exchange market as Deutsche Mark purchases exceeded dollar sales.  Sterling weakened sharply, particularly following the publication of the record UK trade deficit for May. Despite four separate 1/2 percentage point increases in the clearing bank base rates (raising them to 9 1/22) sterling bore the brunt of the return flows to the dollar which followed the improved US trade deficit in April. Sterling's trade-weighted index fell by 3.4 to 75.2 (1975=100).  The Greek drachma weakened vis-a-vis the US dollar by 5.6% while against the pound sterling it strengthened by 2.22. Measured against the ECU the drachma remained almost stable and in effective terms depreciated by 0.42.  The Spanish peseta remained firm during most of the period due to continued capital inflows which led in the second and third weeks of the month to substantial purchases of foreign currencies by the Banco de Espafia. However, this tendency weakened in the last two weeks. In all, the EEC index ended 0.5% lower in effective nominal terms.  The depreciation of the Portuguese escudo in effective terms was  0.3%, in line with the exchange rate policy defined by the authorities. Due to the US dollar recovery during the second part of the month the escudo depreciated by 5.5% against this currency.  The Swiss franc weakened vis~a-vis the US dollar by 4.6%. Against most European currencies there was a firming of the rate of roughly 1%. In the domestic money market interest rates for all maturities rose by 1/2 percentage point. In view of the market trend the lombard rate was raised by 1/2 percentage point to 4 1/2% with effect from lst July. The discount rate was left unchanged for the time being considering the fact that - following the introduction of the new liquidity regulations - discount policy is being reviewed in a fundamental manner.  The Austrian schilling weakened vis-a-vis the US dollar by 5.42, the monthly spread amounting to 6.7%. Against the Deutsche Mark it fluctu- ated by a mere 0.1%. There were capital outflows induced by interest dif- ferentials. In line with the corresponding measures taken by other European central banks the discount rate was raised by 1/2 percentage point to 3.5% with effect from lst July. In addition, the money market rate for short- term open market transactions was increased as from 22nd June by 1/4 per- centage point to 3 7/82%.  The Swedish krona remained strong during the period. In the first week of June the Riksbank sold currencies as market participants, mainly foreign banks, covered part of their short positions in foreign currencies. The currency index has varied between 130.39 and 130.90.  Continued strength of the Norwegian krone and reduced credit expansion gave room for a further 0.5 percentage point reduction in Norges Bank's overnight lending rate to 12.8% with effect from 10th June. The currency index later showed relatively large fluctuations and central bank interventions took place on several occasions to stabilise the market. The krone weakened towards the end of the month and closed about 1% lower in effective terms.  In effective terms, the Finnish markka weakened by about 12. Interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the major currencies continued to narrow.  The Canadian dollar ended the month having risen by more than 22 against the US dollar and almost 3.0% on a trade-weighted basis. Through most of the period the Canadian dollar appreciated, buoyed by the strong performance of the Canadian economy and significant short-term interest  rate differentials which encouraged strong foreign interest in Canadian dollar-denominated securities and led to large net intervention purchases of US dollars. Towards the month-end the currency eased, reflecting the broad strength of the US dollar against the major overseas currencies.  The Japanese yen weakened sharply against the US dollar towards the end of June, depreciating by about 6% during the month. The yen's decline was attributable mainly to active dollar purchases by speculators overseas and domestic institutional investors against the background of the improved US external balance. Meanwhile, the yen depreciated by 0.7% against the ECU due to a reversal of long positions in yen against the Deutsche  Mark.  II. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Net sales of US dollars by central banks amounted to US$ 0.2 bil- lion compared with net purchases of US$ 3.3 billion in May. Gross purchases amounted to US$ 4.6 billion, the main buyer being the Bank of Canada and, to a lesser extent, the Banco de Espana. Gross sales, which were generally carried out on a co-ordinated basis, totalled US$ 4.8 billion; the main sellers were a number of European central banks (particularly the Deutsche  Bundesbank) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

Explanation: The passage provides factual information about currency movements and central bank interventions. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 10.
 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies and ECUs by Community central banks amounted to the equivalent of US$ 2.6 billion compared with US$ 4.3 billion in May. These interventions mainly consisted of purchases of Deutsche Mark by the Banco de Espafia, the Banca d'Italia, Danmarks  Nationalbank and the Central Bank of Ireland.  III. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH, UP TO 8th JULY  The US dollar remained around its end-June levels, albeit with greater daily fluctuations against the yen than against the Deutsche Mark, the market for the latter being regularly controlled by Bundesbank inter-  ventions.  The pound sterling, stimulated by a further 1/2% increase in interest rates (to 10%), and the Japanese yen strengthened.
