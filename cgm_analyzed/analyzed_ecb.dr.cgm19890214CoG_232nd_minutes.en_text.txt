Also present at the meeting were Mr. Raymond and Mr. Dalgaard, Chairmen of the Groups of Experts. The Secretary General of the Committee, Mr. Morelli, his Deputy, Mr. Bascoul,  Mr. Scheller and Mr. Giles, and Mr. Bockelmann and Mr. Dagassan also attended.  * Final text approved at the meeting on 14th March 1989, which incorporates some drafting changes.  I. Approval of the minutes of the 230th and 23l1lst meetings.  The Secretariat had received no suggestions for amendments to the two drafts. As no comments were made at the meeting, the draft texts of the minutes of the 230th and 23lst meetings were approved by the Committee  unchanged.  II. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the '"Dalgaard Group" and discussion by the Committee of Alternates;  - Statistical charts and tables.  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  Since the Committee's last meeting the dollar had remained volatile but on a firm upward trend. It had appreciated by 10% vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark since the beginning of December, moving back to its level of the summer of 1988. Against the yen, the dollar was still 10% lower than in early 1987. Several factors accounted for the strengthening of the US currency: high and rising interest rates in the United States; expectations regarding the policy of the new Administration; a perception on the markets that the central banks' stance had not changed, which had been confirmed by the G-7 meeting on 3rd and 4th February and the actions of the monetary authorities. Recently the central banks' interventions had been less convincing and the regular, moderate sales of dollars had not proved effective. Over the last few weeks the Deutsche Bundesbank had intervened only when the initiative had been taken by the Fed. Although the interventions had had only limited effect, they had added up to a sizable total. During January and the first ten days of February dollar sales had amounted to US$ 5.5 billion and purchases of Deutsche Mark to the equivalent of US$ 11 billion. In 1988 as a whole the Bundesbank's interventions had reduced its reserves by DM 35 billion.  The rise in interest rates in the United States had been followed by increases in the Federal Republic of Germany and in other European countries. However, these increases had also been dictated by domestic considerations. Domestic factors had been the primary concern in Germany, where inflation  was now running at an annual rate of 2.6%, high for that country, though  the raising of indirect taxes had played a role. Moreover, M., growth was still above target.  Not least, the appreciation of the dollar brought the adjustment process to a halt. The German trade surplus was rising again, in particular vis-a-vis its European partners but also vis-a-vis the United States. A further firming of the dollar could not be ruled out. If US growth continued or inflation accelerated a rise in US interest rates would become likely, which would push up the dollar even further and thus aggravate the present problems. On the other hand, a slowdown in US growth would probably lead to a decline in interest rates, which could push the dollar down. This would to some extent be welcome, but if the movement went too far other problems would arise. For the immediate future, however, it seemed more likely that US interest rates would continue on an upward trend.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The minutes of the meeting were approved without any comments or suggestions for amendments, and the statement by Mr. Dalgaard regarding economic and monetary developments was a neutral presentation of facts and analysis without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.



Passage number 2.
  Within the EMS there had been no tensions and no realignment rumours. There had, however, been a number of developments. The Deutsche Mark had remained at the top of the band but had shown signs of weakness: interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the other currencies in the exchange rate mechanism had narrowed and it had been supported by large-scale interven- tion. German economic fundamentals remained strong but there had been substan- tial capital outflows, triggered largely by the interest rate differentials but perhaps also under the influence of the withholding tax. The Dutch guilder had as usual closely followed the Deutsche Mark; it had weakened slightly because the intervention purchases of Deutsche Mark had not been matched by foreign purchases of guilders. De Nederlandsche Bank had stabilised the exchange rate vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark by intervening on a moderate scale and in particular by adjusting interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The writer is describing various developments within the EMS without presenting conflicting viewpoints.



Passage number 3.
 The Danish krone had declined quite significantly, moving to the bottom of the EMS band. The reason for this was that the authorities had decided not to match the interest rate increases elsewhere since the situation in Denmark was different, with zero growth and rising unemployment. The narrowing of interest rate differentials had caused the krone to weaken somewhat, but it had stabilised without any need for intervention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states facts about the decline of the Danish krone and the reasons behind it without presenting conflicting viewpoints.

 The French franc had firmed within the EMS even though interest differentials had contracted.  In Belgium, the central bank had been able to make some purchases of foreign exchange.  For both currencies, the French franc and the Belgian franc, interest differentials vis-a-vis other currencies were now back at the same level as in December 1988, when  the two countries had had to intervene and raise their interest rates.  The Irish pound had remained stable.  The Italian lira had shown the strongest performance within the EMS, despite substantial intervention purchases and a narrowing of interest rate different.

Response from the model: No. The passage provides a description of the economic performance of various currencies within the EMS without any indication of contention or disagreement.ials.  The firmness of the lira was due not to economic and political developments, which were not particularly favourable in that there were no signs of a determined fiscal policy, but to the high level of interest rates, combined, since the liberalisation of capital movements, with easier access to foreign borrowing.   Turning to the other EEC countries, mention was to be made of the continued strength of sterling.  The UK economy was still experiencing strong expansion and rising inflation, now running at an annual rate of 7% (5% exclu- ding the effect of mortgage rates).  The authorities were reluctant to r.

The passage simply provides a factual analysis of the economic situation in different countries without presenting conflicting viewpoints or arguments.aise interest rates further before the effects of the previous increases had worked through.  The peseta had strengthened further.  Spain had the strongest economic growth in the Community, but as a result inflation had accelerated (+5. 82 in 1988) and the current account had deteriorated.  As fiscal policy could not be tightened interest rates had been raised, and this had led to large- scale capital inflows and a firming of the peseta.  Monetary policy had been tightened on Ist February with an increase in reserve requirements, combined with the introduction of special deposits against new foreign borrowing. .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply explains the economic situation in Spain at the time.Passage number 5.
  Overall, the EMS had been free of tensions, thanks in particular to good management of interest rate differentials. The behaviour of the Danish krone had been an exception, but the Danish Alternate had said that the possi- bility of a realignment had not been considered at all, both because inflation and the current account were moving in the right direction and because the authorities wished to show their commitment to exchange rate stability, especially at a time when employers and trade unions were negotiating wage increases for the next two years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It describes the overall stability of the EMS and the specific reasons why a realignment of the Danish krone was not considered.



Passage number 6.
  Because trade imbalances within the Community had not improved, the stability of the EMS might be threatened in the future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. This statement does not suggest any disagreement or contention. It simply discusses the potential threat to the stability of the EMS based on trade imbalances within the Community.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED******************* The current exchange rate of the Deutsche Mark vis-a-vis other EMS currencies could exacerbate the imbalances.  Some Alternates had suggested that a realignment  when it was not expected by the markets could correct certain disequilibria.  Others, however, had pointed out that a realignment would be counter-productive; moreover, an unexpected realignment could be successful only the first time.   The Spanish Alternate had explained in detail the reasons which had led the Spanish authorities to adopt exceptional measures to curb credit and liquidity growth.  The Alternates had discussed whether some of these measures were wholly compatible with the Directive on the liberalisation of  capital movements.  3.  The effectiveness of interventions  Some Alternates considered that interventions could only be effective .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage regarding the potential realignment of exchange rates and whether it would be counter-productive. Some Alternates believe it could correct imbalances, while others argue against it. Additionally, there is a discussion on the compatibility of certain measures with the Directive on the liberalization of capital movements.if they were accompanied by appropriate monetary policy measures.  If central bank interventions could be anticipated by the markets they lost their effec- tiveness; the techniques employed were therefore of critical importance.  Interventions were more effective if they were carried out when the markets were uncertain about the prospects for exchange rate movements or when the pressure on an exchange rate lost its momentum.  Other Alternates had noted that interventions could be effective if the exchange rate movements were temporary.  If, on the other hand, these movements reflected changes in fundamentals then interest rate adjustments should be employed.  The effec- tiveness of interventions could be enhanced if they were carefully organised, concerted, visible and sizable.  One Alternate had wondered whethe.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply provides various strategies and considerations regarding the effectiveness of central bank interventions, without presenting conflicting viewpoints.r the smaller volume of interventions during the present rise of the dollar had reflected decisions taken by the G-7.  Some Alternates had regretted that the Bank of Japan had not participated in the recent round of interventions; in their  view this would have been helpful, if only for symbolic reasons.   C.  Discussion by the Committee  Mr.  Rubio set out the reasons for the recent monetary measures.  There had been a change of direction in Spanish monetary policy since the summer of 1988 in response to domestic developments, which had seen very buoyant economic growth (+5%) leading to problems on the prices front, with a rate of price increase of 5. 8% in 1988, well above the original target (+3Z%).  The Banco de Espana had raised its principal rate by 2 percentage points during the summer but it had quickly .

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply presents information about the reasons for recent monetary measures taken by the G-7 and the changes in Spanish monetary policy.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************become apparent that this was not enough.  Monetary expansion had, indeed, accelerated in the last few months of 1988 and the objective set for the growth of ALP last year (8-11%) had been exceeded (the objective for 1989 was 6. 5-9. 5%).  The Banco de Espafia had been faced with substantial capital inflows in 1988; the peseta had appreciated by about 7% vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark and large-scale intervention had led to an increase in reserves of around US$ 10 billion.  The increase in interest rates of 1 percentage point in early February 1989 had had to be flanked by other measures, as capital inflows were becoming excessive and the appreciation of the peseta intolerable in view of the deterioration of the current account, which had swung from surplus in 1987 to a deficit of almost US$ 4 billion in 1988.  The.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates a disagreement over the effectiveness of monetary policy measures taken to control capital inflows and currency appreciation. On the one hand, the acceleration of monetary expansion and increased reserves suggest that the initial measures were not sufficient. On the other hand, the decision to raise interest rates and implement additional measures implies a belief that more action was necessary to address the issues at hand.se measures included the introduction of a compulsory deposit on foreign borrowing; in the opinion of the Commission they were not incompatible with Spain's obligations with respect to the liberalisation of capital movements.  It was not certain that the measures taken would in fact curb domestic demand.  In addition, the 1989 budget projections did not foresee any notable reduction in the deficit; the borrowing requirement was estimated at 2. 9% of GDP, which was much the same as in 1988.  Moreover, while the deficit was expected to be relatively modest, public expenditure would rise sharply (+13%), which meant that overal] the budget would in fact have an expansionary influence.   A firm policy was also important with a view to the current wage negotiations; corporate profitability was in general high, which m.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************  There was general agreement among the Governors on emphasising that the ECU central rates, bilateral central rates and compulsory inter- vention rates of the currencies participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism should remain unchanged when the composition of the ECU basket was revised.  Any confusion with a realignment was to be avoided.  With regard to the expertsâ second recommendation, viz.  a two-stage procedure, the Governors were not unanimously in favour.  In these circumstances Report No.  65 should be sent to the Commission and the Monetary Committee with a letter from the Chairman of the Committee of Governors.  This letter would, firstly, emphasise the importance attached by the Governors to the stability of central rat.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. While there was general agreement on certain aspects, such as the need for stability in central rates when revising the ECU basket, there was not unanimous support for the experts' second recommendation of a two-stage procedure. This indicates some level of disagreement among the Governors.****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************es and intervention rates and, secondly, mention that technical considerations, described at length in the experts' report, argued in favour of a two-stage procedure but that a minority of Governors felt that a single-stage procedure, as in 1984, was to be preferred.   The Chairman wondered whether his letter should also note that a balance should be maintained in setting the currenciesâ weights by taking account of their relative economic importance, the need for a stable ECU and that giving too great a weight to non-ERM currencies might weaken the  ECU.  - 15 -  Various comments were made by some of the Governors on the Chairman's question.   Mr.  Rubio pointed out that it was difficult at present to make a distinction between strong and.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The mention of a minority of Governors preferring a single-stage procedure while others may prefer a two-stage procedure, as well as various comments made by some of the Governors on the Chairman's question, indicates potential contention or disagreement in the passage. weak currencies and that, in particular, it was not possible in reality to attach a weak-currency label to the new currencies that would enter the ECU basket.   Mr.  de LarosiÃ©re agreed with Mr.  Rubio that one could not speak of weak currencies.  Moreover, that was not the point.  It could, however, be said that the Governors wished to preserve the attractiveness of the ECU and that one factor in this attractiveness was that certain component currencies had close exchange rate relationships with one another, which did not necessarily mean that there was no place for the other currencies in the ECU.   Mr.  Delors wished to reassure the Governors.  Firstly, the Commission was aware of the delicate aspect of the revision of the ECU, and the.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both Mr. de LarosiÃ©re and Mr. Rubio agreed that it was not accurate to label the currencies as weak, and Mr. Delors sought to reassure the Governors about the delicate nature of the ECU revision.Passage number 9.
  The Dutch guilder weakened slightly vis-a-vis most EMS currencies, but remained in the upper part of the intervention band. In line with similar moves elsewhere, the Nederlandsche Bank raised its official interest rates by 1/2 percentage point with effect from 20th January, bringing the discount rate to 5% and the lombard rate to 5.752%.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating that the Dutch guilder weakened slightly compared to other EMS currencies, and that the Nederlandsche Bank raised its official interest rates.



Passage number 10.
  The Danish krone declined somewhat and ended the month as the weakest currency within the EMS band as interest rates remained relatively stable despite the increases in many countries. The interest rates were kept stable because of weak growth in Denmark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply explains that the Danish krone declined and ended the month as the weakest currency within the EMS band. It then goes on to mention that interest rates remained stable due to weak growth in Denmark. The two points presented in the passage are related and do not contradict each other.



Passage number 11.
  The Irish pound remained relatively stable in the upper half of the EMS band. Net inflows of foreign currency continued for most of the month and resulted in net purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank of Ireland. At the end of the month there were some outflows of foreign  currency, offset by sales by the Bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes the stability of the Irish pound within the EMS band and the actions taken by the Central Bank of Ireland in response to inflows and outflows of foreign currency.



Passage number 12.
 The Italian lira continued its upward movement within the EMS narrow band, as short-term inflows continued despite the narrowing of the interest rate differential. The Banca d'Italia resisted this trend by purchasing Deutsche Mark and selling US dollars in concertation with other central banks.  Sterling was on the sidelines for much of the month, losing ground to the dollar but edging quietly firmer against most European currencies.  It dipped briefly when rises in continental interest rates were not matched in the United Kingdom, but moved up again on the back of the rising dollar to end the month at its high against the Deutsche mark. Sterling's trade-  weighted index rose by 0.8% to 98.2 (1985=100).  The Greek drachma depreciated by 4.7% and 0.2% against the US dollar and the ECU respectively. In effective terms the drachma weakened by 0.62.  The Spanish peseta firmed further due to substantial short-term capital inflows, driven by the existing positive interest rate differential. It ended 2.8% higher against the ECU, but depreciated 1.8% against the dollar.  The Portuguese escudo depreciated by 0.252% in effective terms in line with the foreign exchange policy defined by the authorities. Against the US dollar, the escudo fell by 3.82.  The Swiss franc weakened further vis-a-vis most currencies. Against the US dollar it fell by more than 5Z; against the Deutsche Mark it fell by 0.32. By the end of the month the export-weighted index of the franc was 1.5% below its December level. Interest rates in the domestic money market rose once again by almost 1 percentage point to 5 1/2%-6%. Official discount and lombard rates were raised by 1/2 percentage point to 4% and 6% respec- tively, from 20th January.  The Austrian schilling weakened by 4.4% vis-a-vis the US dollar, with a monthly spread of 6%. Against the Deutsche mark, however, it fluctuated by only 0.2%2. On 20th January the discount and lombard rates were raised by 1/2 percentage point to 4 1/2Z% and 6% respectively, and at the end of January it was announced that the rate for short-term open market operations was to be increased from 4 3/4% to 5 1/4Z.  The Norwegian krone continued its gradual appreciation, ending nearly a full percentage point stronger in effective terms. A deceleration in domestic credit expansion and inflation rate, together with firm oil  prices and improvements in the external balance, allowed a further  - 4 -  1/2 percentage point reduction in the Central Bank's overnight lending rate to 11 1/2% to be made from 10th January.  The Swedish krona, unaffected by somewhat lower interest rates resulting from the government's proposal to abolish exchange controls in Sweden, was restricted to a narrow trading range.  The Finnish markka remained, in effective terms, rather stable at the strong end of its fluctuation range. Short-term money market rates fell by about 1 percentage point during the first three weeks of the month, but subsequently rebounded strongly.  The Japanese yen depreciated by 2.5% against the US dollar to close at Yen 129.13. This was due mainly to active dollar purchases by speculators overseas and Japanese institutional investors, reflecting wider interest rate differentials between Japan and the United States, and higher oil prices. Meanwhile, the yen appreciated slightly against the ECU.  The Canadian dollar appreciated by 0.8% against the US dollar and by 1.6% on a trade-weighted basis. It continued to be supported by firm domestic interest rates, associated with robust economic growth, and by a record level of new Euro-Canadian dollar bond issues. Several large trans- actions relating to corporate take-overs in Canada were undertaken during  the month, resulting in some net demand for Canadian dollars.  II. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Concerted sales of dollars were made on several occasions from mid-January. Net sales during the month amounted to US$ 4.1 billion, compared with net purchases of US$ 0.6 billion in December 1988. They consisted of gross purchases of US$ 1.7 billion and gross sales of US$ 5.8 billion (of which US$ 4.1 billion were against Deutsche mark). The US monetary authorities and the Deutsche Bundesbank were the major sellers of dollars; the largest purchases were made by the Banco de Portugal, Finlands Bank and, at the  beginning of the month, by Norges Bank.  B.

Passage number 13.
 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies by Community central banks amounted  to the equivalent of US$ 4.2 billion compared with US$ 1.4 billion in December 1988. The interventions consisted mainly of purchases of Deutsche Mark,  with the Banca d'Italia and the Banco de Espana the main buyers.  Itt. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH, UP TO 10th FEBRUARY  Fresh advances by the dollar in the wake of strong US employment data and the G/7 meeting on 3rd and 4th February were checked by rounds of concerted intervention; and the US currency fell back in the wake of President Bush's budget address. However, it recovered strongly following news of a larger-than-expected increase in US wholesale prices as dealers foresaw some tightening of monetary policy to counter inflationary pressures. On 10th February the US prime rate was increased by 0.5 percentage point to 112%.  In a bid to curb rapid private sector credit growth, the Banco de Espafia increased the amount of reserves that institutions are required to deposit with the Central Bank from 16 1/2% to 18%. In addition, in order to limit the effect on the exchange rate, the Banco de Espana imposed a 302 zero rate deposit requirement for all new foreign exchange credits taken up by non-bank residents and imposed a 20% zero rate deposit requirement for increases in banks' foreign exchange indebtedness. The peseta weakened  sharply on lst/2nd February but quickly recovered.
