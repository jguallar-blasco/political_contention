The Secretary General of the Committee, Mr. Morelli, his Deputy, Mr. Bascoul, Mr. Scheller and Mr. Cook, and Mr. Bockelmann and Mr. Dagassan also attended.  The Chairman opened the meeting by announcing that the meeting of the Committee chaired by Mr. Delors would begin in the afternoon at 2 p.m. as planned; the time of the meeting could not be brought forward, but it  should end at 5.30 p.m. to enable the participants to depart as planned.  * Final text approved at the meeting on 8th November 1988, which incorporates some drafting changes. I. Approval of the minutes of the 22/th meeting.  The Committee unanimously approved the minutes of the 227th meeting, on the understanding that the editorial amendments suggested would be in-  corporated in the final text.  II. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the "Dalgaard Group'' and discussion by the Committee of Alternates;  - Statistical charts and tables.  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  The firming of the dollar which had started in May had continued until mid-August. This appreciation had been due, as before, to strong — economic growth in the United States, leading in particular to a rise in interest rates and some improvement in the trade balance.  The Deutsche Bundesbank had attempted to check this movement by selling dollars, firstly alone, and subsequently together with other central banks, including the Federal Reserve. These sales had been very considerable: over $20 billion in the three months June, July and August. At the same time, interest rates had been raised in Germany and elsewhere. This had taken the German three-month money market rate from below 3.5% to 4.52%. In spite of these moves the Deutsche Mark had remained weak, even within the EMS, owing to large outflows of long-term capital.  August had seen a change of sentiment towards the dollar, doubtless as a result of the cumulative effect of the very heavy intervention, the rise in interest rates in many countries and some indications of a slackening of growth in the United States. The Deutsche Mark had firmed against the dollar and within the EMS. Money market rates in Germany had, in fact, begun to fall when the discount rate was raised. It had no longer been necessary to support the Deutsche Mark with interventions and, indeed, some central banks had actually begun selling Deutsche Mark in early September.  The yen had moved through different phases, from weakness to stability and, more recently, firmness.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 2.
  The situation within the EMS had been calm as long as the dollar had remained firm. At the end of August/beginning of September some tensions  had surfaced in connection with the firming of the Deutsche Mark, rumours of a realignment linked with the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council,  and a number of special factors in certain countries. The tensions had been most marked in France and in Italy. In France the interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark had narrowed from 4 points in early June to 2 points at the end of July. Pressure on the French franc had led to an increase in interest rates, a slipping of the exchange rate within the band and substantial interventions, totalling approximately $2 billion, around the  end of August/beginning of September.  In Italy the deterioration in the balance of payments had added to downward pressure on the lira and the Banca d'Italia had also made use of the three instruments: the fluctuation band, interest rates and interventions. The interventions had been comparable to those undertaken by the French authorities, totalling $2 billion. The important capital liberalisation and deregulation measures scheduled for October did not seem to have contributed to the pressure on the lira.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The tensions and pressures on the French franc and Italian lira suggest disagreement or conflict within the EMS.


Passage number 3.
 -  Other participants in the EMS exchange rate mechanism had also been affected by these movements. The Belgian franc had been subject to the same influences as the French franc and the Italian lira, but in addition had suffered the repercussions of the Société Générale affair, i.e. capital outflows following the inflows of early 1988. The Banque Nationale de Belgique had raised its interest rates and had intervened regularly from mid-June onwards, for a total of approximately $2 billion.  The Dutch guilder had been less robust than during the first half of 1988. The exchange rate had weakened, interest rates had been raised and fairly regular support interventions had been undertaken for a total amount of over $2 billion. The interest rate differential vis-a-vis Germany had returned to its normal level of 0.5 points.  In Denmark capital inflows had been much smaller and the Danish krone had weakened slightly. The announcement of the abolition of the last exchange controls as from lst October 1988 had had no effect on the market.  The Irish pound had remained firm even though there had been a slight narrowing of the interest rate differential vis-a-vis other countries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply providing information about the effects of certain movements on various currencies in the EMS exchange rate mechanism.


Passage number 4.
  In all, the tensions which had surfaced recently within the EMS appeared to be linked to the fact that interest rate differentials had been reduced further than the market considered appropriate. The central banks concerned had coped with these tensions by making use of the three traditional  instruments and had obtained satisfactory results.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It states that tensions have surfaced in the EMS, which is linked to reduced interest rate differentials. It then explains that the central banks have addressed these tensions using traditional instruments and achieved satisfactory results. There is no conflicting viewpoint or debate presented in the passage.


Passage number 5.
 There were, however, more fundamental differences between the EMS countries, in particular in current-account positions, and these could be a factor in keeping certain tensions alive.  The performance of those currencies not participating in the exchange rate mechanism had varied. In the United Kingdom interest rates had been raised chiefly for domestic reasons, and the announcement of a record trade deficit had caused some nervousness in regard to sterling. Its rate of exchange had fluctuated somewhat, but it should be noted that since March it had remained within a fairly limited range of between DM 3.10 and 3.22.  The Spanish peseta had been stable, but since the beginning of the year it had recorded an 82% appreciation vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark in spite of intervention purchases in excess of $20 billion. At the end of August, however, the peseta had weakened in connection with the pressures on the French franc and the Italian lira, the deterioration in the trade balance and the narrowing of interest rate differentials vis-a-vis other countries, and the Banco de Espana had carried out intervention sales.  The Greek drachma and the Portuguese escudo had continued to  depreciate slightly in effective terms.  B. Statement by Mr. Janson  The Alternates' discussion had focused on the following main points:  1. How were recent developments on the markets, which reflected a certain nervousness but which could not be called major tensions, to be interpreted.  2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating different current-account positions and fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies. There is no disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 6.
 What could be done to strengthen market confidence in the stability of exchange rate relations between EMS currencies and thus confirm the recent important and concurring statements by the German and French authorities.  3. How were the particular developments observed in the case of the  pound sterling and the Spanish peseta to be evaluated.  1. Market nervousness Recent conditions on the exchange markets had to be placed in the  context of developments in the fundamentals.  (a) Growth was strong in most European countries, including Germany, where it had recently accelerated. Since it was considerably stronger still in a number of other European countries, this was reflected both in the development of current-account balances within Europe and in Germany's bilateral trade relations with its partners.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing the current conditions and developments in the exchange markets and the fundamentals. It is not presenting any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 7.
 From the point of view of the EMS there was no call for particular concern. Where a current-account deficit existed, as in France or Italy, it remained at a level which gave no great cause for concern in itself, particularly as price and cost developments  did not seem to be in any danger of getting out of control.  (bd) On the price front, some Alternates observed that the climate was in the process of changing slightly. The concern to avoid any depreciation of the Deutsche Mark was to be seen in this light and in the light of furthering the adjustment process.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents information and observations from different perspectives without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 8.
 The action taken by the German authorities to this end had been followed by the other EMS member countries, which had made use  of the various mechanisms put in place by the Basle/Nyborg Agreement.  (c) This combined action had somewhat influenced expectations of stable exchange rates which, together with appropriate interest rate differentials, had encouraged long-term capital movements and thereby helped to finance the current payments imbalances. It had been emphasised that, in some cases, these movements were adequately financing the varying rates of investment growth in different regions of the Community and augured well for the positive effects of the liberalisation of capital movements. However, when there was a resurgence of rumours about exchange rate relationships between major currencies, simply re-establishing interest differentials was not necessarily enough to calm market expectations. Moreover, some Alternates were concerned about the levels interest rates had reached, and saw limits  to any realistic scope for further upward adjustments.  2. The policies to be followed  (a) Some Alternates had expressed the fear that speculative pressures on the markets could grow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily describes actions taken by the German authorities and their influence on expectations and capital movements. The mention of some Alternates expressing concerns about interest rates does not indicate a clear disagreement, but rather a potential point of discussion or concern.


Passage number 9.
 With the rise of the Deutsche Mark to the top of the EMS and the slight decline of the French franc, market operators were reminded of the long history of realignments between these two important EMS currencies in particular. It was therefore essential to give the markets  a clear and convincing signal to quell realignment rumours.  (b) These rumours should be quelled for a number of other reasons: price-competitiveness relationships were little changed. The trade-account imbalances in Europe largely reflected the structural advantage of the German economy, in an upward phase of the cycle, in exports of capital goods. Moreover, it was important not to shake confidence in the declared intention to continue efforts towards closer convergence in domestic and external stability. It was essential, particularly during the present period of international meetings, that any official statements should help strengthen  confidence in the stability of exchange rate relationships.  (c) In an attempt to give concrete shape to the signals of cohesion judged desirable, the following ideas had been put forward on the basis of assumptions regarding the dollar. It had been noted that US economic fundamentals continued to hold out a real threat of dollar depreciation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The first sentence is presenting information about the rise of the Deutsche Mark and the decline of the French franc. The second sentence is providing reasons for why it is important to quell realignment rumors and maintain stability in exchange rate relationships. The third sentence is continuing the discussion about maintaining stability and suggests that concrete ideas have been put forward based on assumptions about the dollar.


This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number10
 If the dollar were to decline, co-ordinated action to preserve stability in the EMS and recover room for manoeuvre should take the form of a signal in the direction of a relaxation of interest rates, initiated by Germany.   Any upward trend shown by the dollar should be countered not by a further increase in interest rates but by co-ordinated interventions in  dollars only.   3.  Sterling and the Spanish peseta  (a) Sterling  The size of the UK trade deficit in August reflected the strength of domestic demand in that country.  In the view of the UK Alternate this had justified the policy of progressively tightening interest rates.  He acknowledged that sterling was vulnerable at its present level and hoped  that further increases in interest rates could be avoided.   (b) The Spanish peseta  The weakening of the peseta had to be seen in the context of a rate of.

The passage is presenting different perspectives and opinions on the current economic situation and potential actions to take, but there is no direct conflict or argument between the statements. inflation higher than the 3% target, the sharp deterioration on current account and the cut in interest rates.  The depreciation only partially offset the considerable appreciation of the peseta vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark (of the order of 8% since the beginning of the year) in real terms.  The decline of the peseta primarily reflected short-term capital movements, in particular under the contagious influence of pressures on the French  franc and the Italian lira.   C.  Discussion by the Committee  Mr.  Hoffmeyer added a few comments on the abolition of the last exchange controls in Denmark to which Mr.  Dalgaard had referred.  This would end fifty-five years of controls and would enter into force on lst October.  From that date capital movements would be free of restrictions, save for two rules: firstly, a rule on financial institutions’ external positions, w.

It is providing information and discussing the topic without any conflicting viewpoints.hich was liberal and was intended to ensure that the financial intermediaries did not speculate against the Danish krone, and secondly a tax provision whose principle was that Danish residents had to ensure that the Danish tax authorities received the same information about their deposits abroad as about deposits in Denmark.  Danish residents were themselves responsible for supplying this information, so that there would be no conflict with the national legislation of those countries in which the deposits were held.   As had already been mentioned, the announcement of the abolition of exchange controls as from lst October 1988 had had no effect on the exchange market.   The Chairman noted that there were no further comments on the  reports given by Mr.  Dalgaard and Mr.  Janson.   Til.  Adoption of the Committee's report to the EEC Ministers of Finance on devel.

The Chairman took note of the Committee's approval of the “concertation report", which would be submitted as usual to the EEC Ministers  of Finance.   IV.  Exchange of views on recent developments in public finance and policy implications.   The Chairman pointed out that the Committee had not been able to hold this exchange of views at its previous meeting.  Although Mr.  Raymond had already introduced the note on public finance in July, he might now wish to repeat one or two points or perhaps bring his introduction up to  date.   A.  Statement by Mr.  Raymond  There was no need to bring the introduction given in July up to date, since the note on public finance basically dealt with 1987, b.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The Chairman is simply mentioning the agenda items for the meeting and suggesting that Mr. Raymond may want to provide an update on the note on public finance.ut the substance of what he had said in July and of the note itself could be summarised again.   The evolution of public finance in 1987 could be characterised by three welcome developments and three that gave cause for concern.  The welcome developments highlighted in the note were:  - a slight overall contraction, as a proportion of GNP, in expenditure and in the aggregate budget deficit for the Community as a whole;  - a slight improvement in convergence among member countries;  - a lessening of the conflicts between fiscal and monetary policies, primarily as a result of a sharp reduction in direct monetary financing of the budget deficits.   The three areas of concern were:  - the progress that had been made was very limited;  - no significant, lasting progress had been made in those countries whose positions were the least favourable, i. e.  those in which.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply presents three welcome developments and three areas of concern, without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.Passage number 11.
 Masera was leaving the Banca d'Italia to take up the office of Director General of the IMI as from ist October. The Chairman thanked Mr. Masera for his valuable contribution to the work of the Committee over a number of years and, on behalf of the Governors, wished him every  success in his new responsibilities. - 415 -  VII. Date and place of the next meeting.  The next meeting would take place in Basle on Monday, 8th November  1988, beginning at 10 a.m. Committee of Governors of the 13th September 1988 Central Banks of the Member States  of the European Economic Community  Confidential  BRIEF REPORT ON  DEVELOPMENTS ON THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS OF THE COUNTRIES WHOSE CENTRAL BANKS PARTICIPATE IN THE CONCERTATION PROCEDURE  JULY AND AUGUST 1988  This report summarises developments on the exchange markets of  the countries whose central banks participate in the concertation proce-  dure. and briefly describes their interventions during July, August and the  first few days of September 1988.  I. EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS  The main features of the foreign exchange markets in July and  August 1988 were:  a further strengthening of the US dollar against most currencies in July and early August followed by a certain decline in late August against European currencies;  increased, concerted intervention sales of dollars mainly against Deutsche Mark;  good demand for sterling and yen which stayed in a relatively narrow range against the US dollar up to the end of August when they weakened against most currencies;  increases of official interest rates in many countries.  The US dollar continued to move higher against most foreign  currencies during July and August. Throughout the period the dollar bene-  fited from signs of strength in the US economy which were thought likely to  1 The central banks of the EEC, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada and the United States. lead to a tighter monetary policy and thus to higher dollar interest rates. The Federal Reserve's commitment to containing inflationary pressures was evident in the early August decision to increase its discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 6.5%. Market participants were also encouraged by the belief that the international adjustment process was proceeding, a belief reinforced by the release of better-than-expected US trade statistics for May and not dispelled by less favourable trade statistics for June. On various occasions during the two months the US authorities intervened to limit the dollar's rise, operating at times aggressively in co-operation with other central banks. Late in August the dollar moved slightly down- wards against European currencies. The dollar closed the period 2.3% higher against the yen and 3.2% higher against the Deutsche Mark.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 12.
  Having been stable in July the EMS experienced some movements in August.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The statement could be interpreted as indicating that there was stability in July followed by movements in August. However, some may argue that even stable systems can still experience movements, therefore the two concepts are not necessarily contradictory.


Passage number 13.
 The Irish pound and the Deutsche Mark moved to the top of the EMS band while the Danish krone, the French franc and the Italian lira weakened somewhat.  The Deutsche Mark continued to weaken sharply in July and the first few days of August. Despite sometimes substantial intervention, it lost considerable ground against the US dollar in particular. This weakness was caused by capital outflows from the Federal Republic, for the most part induced by higher interest rates on most foreign markets. From the second third of August onwards the Deutsche Mark recovered appreciably vis-a-vis the US dollar and all other currencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It provides a factual account of the movements and trends in various currencies.


Passage number 14.
 As a result, it moved to the top of the EMS exchange rate band. On 25th August the Central Bank Council of the Deutsche Bundesbank raised the official discount rate from 3% to 3 1/2Z% per annum, thereby consolidating the increase in DM interest rates on the money markets in recent weeks in the wake of the rise in US dollar interest rates.  The further 1/4 point cut in the intervention rate of the Banque de France at the beginning of July had no effect on the strong position of the French franc throughout July and the first few days of August. The general rise in interest rates that followed, first in the United States and subsequently in Europe, was reflected in particular in a further nar- rowing of the differential between German and French market rates, which this time resulted in arbitrage in favour of the Deutsche Mark and some weakening of the position of the franc. These pressures abated in the last  few days of August. The Belgian franc weakened as a result of the tensions which developed at the beginning of the period under review. The policy of the Banque Nationale was, on the one hand, to support the currency with rela- tively substantial interventions and, on the other, to raise its discount and lombard rates by 1/4 percentage point. After some weeks of calm, the tensions re-emerged following the general upward movement in interest rates. The Banque Nationale thus made further sales of foreign currency and twice raised its discount and lombard rates by 1/4 percentage point to bring them to 7.5% and 7.75% respectively.  The Dutch guilder eased somewhat further against the Deutsche Mark, notwithstanding substantial sales of dollars by the Nederlandsche Bank and a recovery of the interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Mark after the marked fall that had taken place earlier. In view of the develop- ments in interest rates abroad the Nederlandsche Bank increased its dis- count rate on 29th July and 26th August by 0.25 percentage point on each occasion to 4.02% and its interest rate on advances by 0.5 and 0.25 percen- tage point respectively to 4.752.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is mainly describing the actions taken by various central banks in response to changes in interest rates and their effect on exchange rates. There is no clear contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 15.
  The Danish krone declined from the upper end to the middle of the EMS band. Danmarks Nationalbank lowered its official lending and deposit rates by 1/4 percentage point to 7 3/4% and 8 1/2% respectively on 8th July. Market rates were almost unchanged, but interest rate differentials in favour of the krone narrowed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is stating facts about the Danish krone and the actions taken by Danmarks Nationalbank. There is no conflicting information or opposing viewpoints presented.

  Despite occasional fluctuations, the Irish pound was positioned at the top of the EMS band for most of the period.   Seasonal factors and short-term capital inflows supported the Italian lira throughout the summer leading to substantial intervention purchases by the Banca d'Italia.  The situation changed in the second half of August following the Federal Reserve's discount rate hike as market uncertainties developed about the future evolution of interest rates in Europe.  Such conditions have continued to prevail also in the aftermath of the 1/2 point discount rate increase to 12. 5% by the Banca d'Italia on 25th August.   Underpinned .

However, sentiment turned against the pound on 22nd August amid growing unease about the direction of the UK economy, and the release of UK trade figures for July showing a record current account deficit caused sterling to fall abruptly.

Over the period, sterling's trade-weighted index rose by 0. 8% to 75. 8.   The Greek drachma weakened by 3. 8% and 0. 7% against the US dollar and the ECU respectively.  In effective terms the drachma depreciated by 1. 22.   The Spanish peseta remained firm during most of the period, weak- ening slightly at the end of August.  The Banco de Espana's interventions were sporadic and, on the whole, much smaller than in any other period of the year.

 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ECUs  Interventions in EMS currencies and ECUs by Community central banks amounted to the equivalent of US$ 5.7 billion compared with US$ 2.6 billion in June. The interventions consisted mainly of purchases of Deutsche  Mark with the Banca d'Italia and the Banco de Espafia as the main buyers.  III.
