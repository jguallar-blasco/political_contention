The Secretary General of the Committee, Mr. Morelli, his Deputy, Mr. Bascoul, Mr. Scheller and Mr. Giles, and Mr. Bockelmann and Mr. Dagassan also  attended.  ee ec i  * Final text approved at the meeting on 12th December 1989, which incorporates some drafting changes.  I. Approval of the minutes of the 238th meeting  The Committee approved the minutes of the 238th meeting on the understanding that the editorial amendments suggested would be incorporated  in the final text.  II. Monitoring of economic and monetary developments and policies in the EEC based on:  - Preparation by the "Dalgaard Group'"' and discussion by the Committee of Alternates};  - Statistical charts and tables  A. Statement by Mr. Dalgaard  The experts had noted that the dollar had weakened by almost 7% since the beginning of September and that there was no longer any talk of an upward trend. There were several reasons for this decline, in particular the narrowing of interest rate differentials and the declaration by the Group of Seven, which had been followed up by sizable interventions. A further weakening of the dollar appeared more probable than renewed firmness if various factors came into play, for example if there was no improvement in the US trade balance and budget, if interest differentials narrowed further and if the political situation in Europe stabilised.

 No.



Passage number 2.
  As far as the EMS was concerned, the experts had focused on two events, viz. the interest rate rise in Germany and the rumours of a realignment. German market rates had risen gradually by 1% at the short-term end and 0.5% for the long term; official rates had been raised by 1% on 6th October. The majority of the other EEC countries had immediately followed this increase. Spain and Italy, with already high rates and firm currencies, had not raised their official rates and had allowed their currencies to weaken.  Rumours of a realignment had begun to be heard in the first half of October and had become very strong around the 15th of the month3 based on statements made in Germany, the rumours had been felt in most ERM countries, and especially in Denmark, Italy, France, Spain and Ireland.  These countries had had to undertake at times massive interventions, such ~3-  as Denmark's record sale in a single day of DM 3 billion on Friday, 13th October.  The experts' views had differed as to the conclusions that could be drawn from the last two months' experience in the EMS. An optimistic view had been that the exchange rate mechanism had handled the problems without too much difficulty, despite the advanced stage reached in the liberalisation of capital movements and the long interval of almost three years since the last realignment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply presents a series of events and expert opinions without conflicting information.



Passage number 3.
 Another view had held that recent experience had shown that the situation in the EMS might be precarious} even relatively vague rumours could trigger very large interventions. This highlighted the need to ensure that exchange rates were convincing at all times. In this connection the Bundesbank expert had mentioned that the Deutsche Mark had depreciated by 5% in real terms in the period since the last realignment, in the course of which Germany had had a very large and  increasing current-account surplus.  B. Statement by Mr. Papademos  The Alternates had first had an exchange of views on the recent weakening of the US dollar. It had been noted that the market sentiment towards the dollar appeared to have turned neutral or even bearish, which was a welcome development. There had been general agreement that the further narrowing of interest rate differentials had contributed to the recent decline of the dollar, but there was less agreement on whether it had been the main contributing factor. Some Alternates had emphasised the important role that concerted interventions and public statements had played in triggering the dollar's fall, following the G-7 meeting. It had been pointed out that the importance of reduced interest rate differentials should not be over-emphasised, as there had been periods in which lower interest rate differentials had been associated with a strengthening of the dollar.  The Alternates had also discussed the appropriate policies for dealing with the large and growing intra-Community current-account imbalances. The German Alternate had stressed that the imbalances reflected fundamental disequilibria and should be remedied through a realignment of exchange rate parities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement by Mr. Papademos reflects a discussion among Alternates, where different views are presented, but there is no clear indication of disagreement or conflict among them.



This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number 4
 Without a change in parities, Germany would be importing inflation and its role as stability anchor in the EMS could be  jeopardised.  Most Alternates had considered that current-account imbalances -4-  could be addressed more effectively by employing domestic policy measures and by closer policy co-ordination.  The importance of improving the policy mix in some countries had also been stressed.  Exchange rate ad'justments should not be ruled out, but they should play a secondary role.  Demand management produced its impact with a time-lag, but its effects in lessening disequilibria were more permanent.   In connection with this discussion, reference had been made to the effects on the markets of public statements concerning the desirability of a realignment.  The markets' interpretation of these statements as relating to particular currencies had been unfortunate; nevertheless, it had been a free expression of public opinion.  A number of Alternates had pointed out.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is discussing different approaches to addressing current-account imbalances in the EMS without taking a stance on any particular viewpoint. that the utmost restraint should be exercised in discussing the issue of a possible realignment.   The Alternates had, finally, discussed interest rate policies in some Community countries and the use of intervention currencies.   The recent weakening of the Belgian franc, despite the positive economic developments in Belgium, had appeared to be due to the narrowing of the differential between Belgian and German interest rates.   The British Alternate had reiterated the UK policy-makers’ commitment to continue the fight against inflation by pursuing a policy of high interest rates and maintaining a strong currency.  However, the recent depreciation of sterling would contribute to the adjustment process, while the slowing-down of the domestic economy would free resources for an expansion of net exports.   With respect to the use of intervention currencies, the German Alternate had underlined that, according to the Basle-Nyborg Agreement, intra-marginal interventions .

Response from the model: No.  The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement as it primarily reports on the discussions and positions of the participants regarding interest rate policies, currency interventions, and economic developments.could be carried out only with the consent of the central bank issuing the intervention currency.  However, he had pointed out that it would be unfortunate to reopen the debate on the use of  currencies in intra-marginal interventions.  The Bundesbank had accepted the Basle-Nyborg Agreement on the condition that other countries respected the requirement of prior notification of the issuing central bank of intra-marginal interventions in its currency.  If there were some technical difficulties in meeting this requirement during fixing sessions, they should be tackled, and to this end the German Alternate had suggested  examination of this issue by the Dalgaard Group.  The Spanish Alternate had endorsed this proposal and had said that in certain cases during the fixing session compliance with the notification requirement would imply a compromise of exchange ‘rate objectives which was not acceptable.  He had suggested that the present rules and procedures had become out.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The discussion is focused on the technicalities and requirements related to intra-marginal interventions and the notification process, with different parties making suggestions and endorsements for further examination and possible solutions.dated and would have to be re-examined.  Interventions could in practice be carried out in a disguised manner, but the Banco de Espana did not intend to resort to such practices.   It had also been stressed by the French Alternate that conditions in the foreign exchange markets changed rapidly and intervention decisions had to be taken quickly, and this might make it difficult to communicate interventions prior to their implementation.  A possible solution to the problem might be the establishment of minimum amounts of balances for interventions in different currencies for which notification would not be  required.   Replying to a remark by Mr.  Rubio, the Chairman indicated that  the Group of Experts under the chairmanship of Mr.  Dalgaard would indeed be examining the problems that had been mentioned with regard to interventions  and would be reporting to the Governors.

IV.  Examination of the Report from the Committee of Alternates on the Organisation of the Committee of Governors in view of Stage One of Economic and Monetary Union  The Chairman said that in view of the limited time available to the Governors and the fact that the issues dealt with in the Alternates' Report required in-depth study, he proposed to postpone discussion of this  item until December.  He reported briefly on the discussion which had taken - 6 -  place on Monday, 13th November at the ECOFIN Council meeting on Economic and Monetary Union, confining himself to the part which he had attended, viz.  Stage One.  Mr.  Delors might then present some comment.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The Chairman is simply reporting on the adoption of the "concertation report" and proposing to postpone discussion of the Alternates' Report until December due to time constraints and the need for in-depth study. The Chairman also reports on a previous discussion at the ECOFIN Council meeting, focusing on Stage One of Economic and Monetary Union.s regarding the Ministers’ discussion of Stages II and III, which had taken place later.   As far as Stage One of Economic and Monetary Union was concerned, the ECOFIN Council had indicated its agreement in principle to the texts of the two proposals concerning the 1964 and 1974 Decisions, it having been understood that formal adoption should take place at the next meeting on 18th December 1989 once the necessary opinions from the European Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee had been delivered.   The texts agreed by the Ministers reflected the versions including the amendments suggested by the Monetary Committee with a few exceptions; those mentioned below were of direct interest to the Governors and concerned in particular the 1964 Decision.   Firstly, in the second recital of the 1964 Decision, the Commission had added the word "social" (which had not appeared in the Governors’ draft) to the idea of economic cohesion between the Member States.  The Mon.

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the passage.etary Committee had suggested deleting the word but, at the request of the Commission, the Council had agreed to reinstate it.   Secondly, in Article 2(a) of the 1964 Decision, the Council had adopted the Governors’ wording, viz.  "the Chairman of the Committee [and not the members] shall be invited to participate in the meetings of the Council of Ministers, whenever it deals with issues involving the tasks of the Committee of Governors".  The Council had adopted the same position regarding the representation of the Committee of Governors in the Council's multilateral surveillance (Article 7 of the 1974 Decision), with the following entry to be made in the minutes of its meeting: "The Council agreed that at each of its informal meetings, where the Governors of the central banks of the Member States participate, an exchange of views will take place on the economic and monetary policy in the Community”.   Thirdly, in Article 3, paragraph 1, of the 1964 Decision, the wo.

  Other Alternates had expressed different views:  in view of the growing external surplus of Germany vis-a-vis most other EMS countries, persistent undervaluation of the Deutsche Mark would continue to generate structural problems in Germany and in the Community. Delaying corrective action could exacerbate the problems and might necessitate the adoption of more drastic measures later}  those not favouring a realignment argued that the devaluation of their currencies would import inflation into their countries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No.
This passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It simply presents two different views on the potential repercussions of a persistent undervaluation of the Deutsche Mark. One group believes that delaying corrective action could exacerbate problems, while another group fears that devaluing their own currencies could bring inflation to their countries.



This passage was too long for model to process and thus had to be split: Passsage number 6
 However, the undervaluation of the Deutsche Mark was importing inflation into Germany, which undermined the function of the Deutsche Mark as an anchor of stability in the EMS;  if a realignment were eventually required, the credibility of the EMS would be damaged more if the realignment were forced by the  markets rather than if it were decided by the authorities.  - 19 -  C.  Discussion by the Committee  Mr.  Rubio agreed that it was necessary to slow the growth of demand in Spain and pointed out that the Government had already taken action.  The budget deficit was likely to fall from 2. 7% of GDP in 1988 to 2% this year and to 1. 5% in 1990.  The new Government would be formed in a few weeks and was expected to ensure continuity in matters of fiscal policy.  Th.

It simply discusses the potential consequences of the undervaluation of the Deutsche Mark and the actions taken by the Spanish government to slow demand.e development of the monetary aggregates had changed radically in the course of the last three months.  Thus the growth of lending was now only 6% at an annual rate, compared with 22% in the first quarter of 1989.  The current~account deficit was still substantial, at around USS 6 billion for the first nine months of 1989, but in this period direct investment had represented twice that amount.  The current-account deficit thus seemed almost necessary, otherwise the peseta would be much too strong.   Mr.  Leigh-Pemberton, referring to Mr.  Papademos' comments, was of the view that a realignment forced by the market would be very bad; it would, for example, be extremely unfortunate if a realignment were to take place around lst July 1990, the moment when the liberal.

Mr.  Pohl understood the arguments of the countries which did not want their currencies to depreciate against the Deutsche Mark.  But it had to be recognised that Germany's trade and current-account surpluses were growing rapidly while the deficits in several countries were also rising or remained high.  This, moreover, was a purely European problem: Germany's surplus with the United States had greatly decreased in the past two years, whereas that with the EEC countries was continuing to widen, having risen from DM 52 billion for the first eight months of 1988 to DM 65 billion for the same period in 1989.

Such a solution was rather unrealistic given the very high level of production capacity utilisation, and it was dangerous in terms of inflation, which was a major concern of the central bank.  The other solution would be to reduce the deficits in the high-inflation countries, i. e.  principally in the wider-band countries or those which did not participate in the exchange rate mechanism.  The markets had already penalised, in exchange rate terms, the build-up and the size of the current-account deficit in the United Kingdom.  Other countries, such as  Spain and Italy, were opposed to a realignment so as not to import - 20 -  inflation but to import stability inst.

Passage number 7.
 Despite the advanced stage reached in the negotiations, the IMF was reluctant to pledge US$ 570 million instead of the US$ 700 million planned a few weeks ago. Monetary reform of the kind undertaken in Germany in 1948 appeared to be necessary, for the flight out of the zloty had assumed enormous proportions: in a matter of months, the zloty had lost 54% of its value, the dollar being worth Zl. 3,100 on the official market in mid-November and between Zl. 5,000 and 7,000 on the black market. Monetary reform should therefore be a priority and could be supported by the creation of a stability fund, as proposed by President Bush. The United States had promised a contribution of US$ 200 million and the Federal Republic of Germany DM 500 million. The external balance was also a serious problem: the current-account deficit was likely to increase from US$ 2 billion in 1988 to US$ 3 billion this year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes, there is potential for contention or disagreement in the passage. The IMF's reluctance to pledge the full amount of financing requested, as well as the differing contributions promised by the United States and Germany for the stability fund, may indicate disagreements or conflicting priorities among the parties involved in the negotiations. The passage does not explicitly mention any disputes or arguments, but the described situation suggests that there could be disagreements over the proposed financial support and reforms.

Passage number 8.
 The USSR had decided to freeze its 6 billion rouble loan until 1995, and this raised the question of what the Paris Club could do in conjunction with the IMF effort. Finally, the Polish Prime Minister had written to the President of the Commission to propose the establishment of a Euro-Polish bank. The latter could serve as a foundation for aiding the modernisation, or even the re-establishment, of a banking system in Poland. It could also provide guidance for investors, in order to try and revitalise the fabric of the Polish economy. Such a bank should not be a new public institution but should be established with the assistance of Western banks.  In Hungary, the main difficulty was of a political nature. There  were currently 106 parties, and the main ones had failed to agree on the - 25 -  economic measures to be taken during an election campaign which was likely to be protracted. Inflation was increasing and now running at 17 to 182, and the external balance was deteriorating, the current -account deficit rising from 2 to 4% of GDP. Chief among the current problems was the political agenda. A referendum was to take place on 26th November, the main issue being whether the election of the president of the republic should be held before or after the parliamentary election. If the Hungarians chose to elect the president first, the successful candidate would have more power, but this would also have the effect of postponing the parliamentary elections and hence of delaying the bold decisions that needed to be taken. Furthermore, an agreement with the IMF, which the Fund considered essential, would probably not be accepted by the political parties because of their failure to agree among themselves and would be put off until after the elections, i.e. until March or June 1990.  If there were no agreement with the IMF, Hungary would be faced  with a liquidity problem in the months ahead, since its official reserves equalled only three months’ imports.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 Yes

Explanation: The passage describes various political and economic challenges in Poland and Hungary, including disagreements among political parties, inflation, and the need for agreements with the IMF. There is evident contention and disagreement among the political parties in Hungary about economic measures and the timing of elections, as well as potential delays in reaching an agreement with the IMF.



Passage number 9.
 The IMF and Hungary differed, however, as to the content of the agreement, for example on devaluation of the Hungarian forint (the IMF wanted 50%, instead of the 10% agreed to by Hungary) and the cutting of subsidies. The Hungarians were currently seeking one of two things: the first was a US$ 1 billion bridging loan, of which the Belgian Minister of Finance had spoken as representative of the "constituency" in which Hungary was situated. Since such a loan was linked to an agreement with the IMF, if the agreement was not concluded Hungary would instead request cash aid to see it through the first quarter of 1990, which was the most difficult one for seasonal reasons (energy purchases and low revenue from tourism). Such exceptional cash aid was criticised by the financiers, who felt that it would create a precedent for granting assistance prior to the conclusion of an agreement with the IMF. Thus there  was a dilemma.  The Chairman thanked Mr. Delors for his very interesting  statement, which had described two very difficult economic situations.  % %  *&  The Chairman informed the Committee that Mr. Pégo Marques was  taking part in a meeting of the Committee for the last time; the Governors had greatly benefited from Mr. Pégo Marques' experience and his contribution, and they expressed their gratitude for his collaboration and offered him their best wishes for the future.   Mr. Pégo Marques thanked the Chairman and made the observation that everyone, no matter what their role, had a part to play in the construction of Europe. However, those in the market-place did not always have all the information at their disposal and had to act on the basis of their interpretation of the facts. Mr. Pégo Marques offered the Governors and the Alternates his professional and personal good wishes for success at a time of great challenges presented by monetary union and relations  between eastern and western Europe.

Passage number 10.
 EXCHANGE RATE DEVELOPMENTS  The main features of the foreign exchange markets in September and October 1989 were:  - a limited further appreciation of the dollar to period highs until mid-September, followed by a strong depreciation in the remainder of the period;  - a round of increases of official rates in most European countries in early October;  - the emergence of temporary tensions in the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS in connection with rumours of a realignment;  - a pronounced decline of the Japanese yen and sterling against  most other currencies.  The US dollar moved lower during the September-October period as  market participants responded to official statements and actions indicating  1 The central banks of the EEC, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Switzerland, Austria, Japan, Canada and the United States.  ~.2-  concern at the dollar's rise. After reaching period highs of DM 2.0035 and Yen 148.95 by mid-September, the dollar began to ease as market participants grew cautious ahead of the 23rd September G-7 meeting. The dollar then declined more forcefully after the release of the G-7 communiqué and subsequent visible intervention operations. As the period progressed, narrowing interest rate differentials favouring dollar assets and concern about financial market volatility following a decline in equity prices in the United States on 13th October also served to lessen the market's positive sentiment toward the dollar. By the end of October, the dollar was trading narrowly about 6.5% lower against the Deutsche Mark and 1.5% lower against the Japanese Yen from its early September levels.

 No. The passage does not contain any clear points of contention or disagreement. It primarily provides a factual overview of exchange rate developments during September and October 1989.



Passage number 11.
  In the EMS the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira declined strongly. The Danish krone reached the lower limit vis-a-vis the Spanish peseta in September and vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states facts about the decline of the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira in the European Monetary System (EMS), as well as the Danish krone reaching its lower limit against certain currencies.



Passage number 12.
 Tension emerged in mid-October because of rumours of an EMS realignment giving rise to substantial central bank interventions, some of which at the margins. The tension abated towards the end of the period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No

Explanation: There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes a situation where tension emerged due to rumours of a realignment in the EMS and central bank interventions, which later abated towards the end of the period.



Passage number 13.
 Official interest rates were increased in most EMS countries, effective 6th October; interest rate differentials remained unchanged except for the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta whose differentials vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark narrowed.  The Deutsche Mark firmed appreciably. Its effective rate vis-a-vis the currencies of eighteen major industrial countries rose by 2.9%.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that official interest rates were increased in most EMS countries, with specific changes in interest rate differentials for the Italian lira and the Spanish peseta. Additionally, it mentions that the Deutsche Mark firmed appreciably and rose by 2.9% against other major currencies.



Passage number 14.
 Vis-a-vis the currencies of the countries participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism, its appreciation amounted to 1.0%. The 1 percentage point increase in key German interest rates effective 6th October led to a corresponding rise in money market rates (day-to-day to six-month money).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply explains the 1% appreciation of the currencies in the EMS exchange rate mechanism due to the increase in key German interest rates.



Passage number 15.
 This resulted in a narrowing of interest rate differentials vis-a-vis some currencies, for example the US dollar, but no change vis-a-vis the majority of the EMS currencies as most EMS central banks followed the Bundesbank's move.  During the first half of September the French franc remained firm while it was later affected by substantial purchases of foreign currencies by French companies for investment abroad. After a slight improvement at the end of the month, the French franc was somewhat influenced by tensions within the EMS. The increase in official rates effective 6th October and the subsequent high level of domestic rates close to the upper limit (10.25%)  favoured the stabilisation of the French franc for the rest of the month.  - 3 -  The modest increase in the retail price index (0.2% in September, 3.42% on an annual basis) had a positive influence on the market.  Due to the firming of the Deutsche Mark, the Belgian franc lost some ground in the EMS. This movement took place despite substantial inter- ventions by the Banque Nationale de Belgique. Several increases in the official rates of the Treasury certificates, aimed at maintaining an appropriate interest rate differential vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark, also had limited effect. Effective 6th October the discount rate was increased by 1 percentage point to 10.25% while the rate on advances was raised to 10.752 increasing by 1.25 percentage points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The text simply describes the movements and changes in various currencies, interest rates, and official rates without presenting conflicting viewpoints or arguments.



Passage number 16.
  The Dutch guilder lost a little ground vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark as the latter currency moved towards the top of the narrow EMS band in September. Since then, however, there have been no significant changes in exchange rates between the two currencies. Effective 6th October, the Nederlandsche Bank raised its discount and lombard rate by 1 percentage point to 7% and 7.75% respectively.   The Danish krone continued to be the weakest currency in the narrow band. In early September the Danish krone touched its lower intervention point vis-a-vis the Spanish peseta; this led to modest inter- ventions. In connection with the increase in German interest rates Danmarks Nationalbank raised its lending rates by 1 percentage point to 10.50% and 11%.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No.  The passage describes changes in exchange rates and interest rates for the Dutch guilder and Danish krone, but there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement.



Passage number 17.
 On Friday, 13th October the krone came under heavy pressure due to rumours of an EMS realignment. The krone reached the compulsory intervention rate vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark and substantial intervention sales of Mark were made. During the remaining part of the month there was no need for further interventions and the krone strengthened gradually in response to a sharp rise in market interest rates. On 3lst October Danmarks Nationalbank increased its lending rates to a unified rate of 12% with effect from lst November.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply provides a chronological account of the events related to the krone currency.



Passage number 18.
  The Irish pound remained steady in the upper half of the EMS band during September. Capital inflows continued for most of the month and were offset by purchases of foreign currency by the Central Bank. Capital outflows re-emerged towards the end of September and intensified in October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes the trends related to the Irish pound's stability within the EMS band and the actions of the Central Bank to manage capital inflows and outflows.



Passage number 19.
 The Central Bank responded with substantial sales of foreign currency, by raising its Short-Term Facility lending rate by 1 percentage point to 11%, effective 6th October, and by permitting the Irish pound to decline to the middle of the narrow EMS band. - 4 =  During the first half of September, the Italian lira continued to appreciate in the EMS, reaching the upper limit of the narrow band. This trend was partly contained by substantial interventions by the Banca d'Italia. Since the beginning of October, changing expectations on the dollar and monetary policy changes in some European countries resulted in a reversal of this movement as the Banca d'Italia did not raise official rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as it solely describes the actions taken by the Central Bank and the Banca d'Italia in response to currency fluctuations.



Passage number 20.
 The lira also depreciated somewhat because of rumours of an EMS realignment but central bank interventions kept the movement within the narrow band. At the end of the period the lira stabilised without further interventions as market sentiment improved.  In the first part of September the Spanish peseta firmed further, driven by an increase in the positive interest rate differential, and reached the upper limit vis-a-vis the Danish krone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model:
 No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply provides information about the movements of the lira, central bank interventions, market sentiment, and the exchange rate between the Spanish peseta and the Danish krone.



Passage number 21.
 Later on, sentiment towards the peseta changed substantially, due to the round of interest rate rises in other European countries, the rumours of a realignment in the EMS and the uncertainty surrounding the result of the general elections. Consequently, the peseta experienced strong downward pressures. After the election in late October the Spanish currency recovered some ground. In all, it ended 0.2% lower with respect to the ecu.  After being sidelined for much of September, sterling fell sharply against most currencies following the publication of worse-than-expected trade figures for August. Aggressive intervention and a 1 percentage point rise in base rates (to 15%) effective 6th October briefly stemmed the downward pressure, but bearish sentiments resurfaced following renewed speculation about a rift between the Prime Minister and the Chancellor. Nervousness over the Government's political position and over fragility of the equity markets called into question the continuation of a high interest rate strategy, and the pound fell sharply. The weakness of the dollar subse- quently helped sterling recover some of its losses, but the Chancellor's resignation caused a further sharp reversal and although modest support was provided, the pound fell to its lowest level against the Deutsche Mark since March 1987 before stabilising. Over the two months, sterling's trade- weighted index fell by 3.3% to 88.4 (1985=100).  The Greek drachma appreciated by 2.7% against the US dollar and depreciated by 2.5% against the ecu. In effective terms the drachma depreciated by 0.9% in September and by 1.1% in October. The Portuguese escudo declined by 0.5% in effective terms in line with the objectives defined by the authorities. Against the US dollar the escudo rose by 42.  The Swiss franc strengthened by 5% against the dollar while vis-a-vis sterling and the Japanese yen its value increased by 3 to 4 per- centage points.

Passage number 22.
 Measured against the majority of the EMS currencies, the exchange rate tended to be lower. On an export-weighted basis the value of the Swiss franc rose by 0.6%. The Euro-franc rate went up from 7 3/8% to roughly 7 7/8%. In reaction to the market developments and in co-ordination with the measures introduced by other central banks, the official discount rate was raised by 0.5 percentage point to 6% on 6th October. However, central bank money supply was not tightened any further.  The Austrian schilling firmed by more than 6% against the US dollar. Vis-a-vis the Deutsche Mark it fluctuated by only 0.07%. Short-term liquidity support was given in October with DM 1.8 billion of DM/schilling swaps with an average maturity of ten days. In line with the corresponding interest rate increases in most European countries, the discount rate was raised from 5.5% to 6.5% and the lombard rate from 7.5% to 8.5% with effect from 6th October. The rate for short-term open market operations was also raised from 6.5% to 7.252.  The Norwegian krone moved within a fairly narrow range of 112.00 to 112.50 measured by the basket index. The krone stayed mostly in the stronger end of this range in September but weakened towards 112.50 during October.  After a period of heavy inflows in September, partly due to non- residents’ purchases of krona-denominated bonds, which at times brought the index for the krona to its limit of 130, the Swedish krona weakened to 130.5 in the second half of October when interest rate differentials vis-a-vis many foreign currencies narrowed.  In effective terms the Finnish markka continued to fluctuate within a narrow margin. Market interest rates have increased by almost 22%. The base rate was raised by 1 percentage point to 8.5%, effective lst November.  The Japanese yen appreciated by 3.5% against the US dollar and closed at 139.35 in September. This was due to the concerted action of the central banks implementing the agreement of the G-/ of 23rd September. The  Bank of Japan stepped into the markets selling US dollars against Japanese yen for a protracted period. However, the impact of these interventions was absorbed by the markets which pushed the Japanese unit down to 142.15 in October. Meanwhile, the yen depreciated somewhat against the ecu. Effective llth October, the Bank of Japan raised the official discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 3.75Z, taking into consideration the developments of the exchange rate, interest rates abroad, domestic business activity, prices and money supply, as well as a rise in market interest rates. Over the period as a whole, the yen appreciated by 1.

7% vis-a-vis the US dollar while it depreciated by about 5% vis-a-vis the EMS currencies.  The Canadian dollar traded in a narrow range for the period under review, appreciating slightly to close on 3lst October at US$ 0.8522. The strength of the Canadian dollar continues to result from the capital inflows associated with relatively high short-term interest rate differentials vis-a-vis the United States, and an expectation among participants that Canadian interest rates will remain firm in the near term. The currency's strength has been tempered somewhat by concerns about Canada's current  account deficit which has been increasing in recent quarters.  II. INTERVENTIONS A. Interventions in US dollars  Net dollar sales by the central banks amounted to US$ 22 billion in September and October compared with net purchases of US$ 0.9 billion in July and August. The major part of these interventions took place in the last week of September and the first half of October. The main sellers were  the Bank of Japan, the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England.  B.

 Interventions in Community currencies and in private ecus  Interventions in EMS currencies and private ecus by Community central banks amounted to the equivalent of US$ 7.2 billion (US$ 1.9 billion at limit), compared to US$ 3.5 billion in July and August. The greater part of interventions was sales of Deutsche Mark (US$ 2.8 billion); the main seller was Danmarks Nationalbank. Intervention sales of ecus (US$ 2.3 billion) were greater than in previous periods; the main sellers were the Banca  d'Italia and the Bank of England.  III. DEVELOPMENTS IN THE CURRENT MONTH UP TO 1OTH NOVEMBER  Exchange markets were quiet during the first days of November. The dollar stayed in a narrow range; market participants remained cautious against the background of narrowing interest rate differentials favourable to dollar assets.
