I\u2018m saying that we ought to keep it at the $5 billion [we authorized for this past intermeeting period1 because I think there is a possibility that we may get a very sharp movement in float, especially if the weather happens to clear up, and the Desk will need to do some rather sizable offsetting purchases. 2 / 6 / 1 9  -4- And, anyway, this is a 6-week intermeeting period. So I would suggest we keep it at $5 billion", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, we had [increased it to $5 billion and then raised it $1 billion more, which] put it at S6 billion. So, when you say \"keep it,\" YOU really mean \"set it\" at $5 billion", " MR. MAYO. Jerry, 1 find myself quite comfortable with almost every page of this fine presentation except the unit cost indicators. I'm just wondering if you're whistling [in the dark] a bit both on compensation per hour and on productivity. On the trend in productivity, I suppose there's a natural inclination to say: Well, we really don't understand It, so let's level it out. Yet there's also a natural tendency, if things continue tight this year, as projected in other parts of this forecast, for output per hour to decline further. And, of course, if both compensation and productivity should move in the wrong direction, unit labor costs are going to look rather sick", " MR. MAYO. I find it optimistic. That's my problem, I guess. I hope you're right, but I don't believe it at this point", " MR. BALLES. Jim or Jerry, in an otherwise exceptionally well done presentation, I was startled by only one thing and that was your figures with respect to the impact of fiscal policy. You have a chart that shows the full employment surplus for this fiscal year at $8.7 billion, which is a startling contrast to the Administration's high employment deficit figure of $23 billion. In fiscal 1980, the Administration's so-called high employment deficit, based on a 5.1 percent high employment unemployment rate, is $ 8  billion and you show a [full employment] surplus of $23 billion. Your expenditure and income figures are moderately different but not enough to account for that vast difference. I'd like you to explain that if you will", " MR. ZEISEL. All right. There are differences between our estimates of the change in the high employment surplus/deficit and those of the Council [of Economic Advisers]. These are not projections of levels; we specifically did not project levels because 2/6/79 -6- there is a pretty universal sense that one can get almost any level one likes depending upon the assumptions used. And, in economic terns or analytic terms, a change in the full employment surplus or deficit is more significant. But even taking that into consideration, for 1979 the numbers from the Council suggest a somewhat more stimulative situation than we have [in our forecast]. We have looked into this very carefully and have talked to them in great detail. Part of the answer is that we have higher inflation assumptions than they do, but that's only part of it. The rest is apparently a rather technical problem involving the fourth quarter of 1978 and the first quarter of 1979 in the sense that they got locked into a fourth-quarter estimate of GNP which turned out to be weak, as you will recall. They were assuming something like 4 percent, and we got 6 percent. They had built up their high employment levels from that and then brought them down. I won't go into the details, but basically we feel we're right for 1979. We're trying to work it out. For 1980, we're really not very far off; the change is in the same direction and the differences are not major", " MR. AXILROD(.). Yes. That's right", " MR. PARTEE. That's assuming that the bank gives credit for funds not received", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But they do to big corporations", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In any event, this makes it particularly difficult. We've had this big increase in money market funds along the lines of a change in appraisals of cash balances versus other media. But, in looking at numbers for the long-term aggregates, I come up with ranges for M2 and M3 about like those in alternative A, but the M1 range in \"A\" looks too high to me. Just adding the 3 percent for ATS produces an upper limit that seems much too high to me. I would suggest something like 1 to 4 percent for M1. So, these numbers that I'm suggesting are about 1 percentage point lower than what Mr. Axilrod just suggested", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, I think the staff can guarantee that their dotted lines will not be achieved", " MR. PARTEE. And the staff has 6 quarters of industrial production increases of 1-1/2 percent or thereabouts. Similarly, for consumption and investment and business inventories, the [growth] rate numbers are all very stable and really quite moderate. The question I 2 / 6 / 7 9  -12- suppose a business cycle economist would have to ask is whether we can have 6 quarters of such low growth without something happening--either [the economy1 tipping into recession because of a lack of momentum or something coming, say, from the international area in military preparedness [spending] or something like that which would in some way speed up the [expansion] process. I have to say that I\u2019m inclined to think that we\u2019ll tip into recession during this period. But even if we do [not] tip into recession, there is a second problem as I see it. And that is that if the staff forecast is correct--and I still think it\u2019s on the optimistic side rather than the pessimistic side from the standpoint of real activity--it is below the Administration\u2019s goals, particularly for 1980, and we do have to associate what we\u2019re doing with the short-run goals of the Administration. I looked it up, Nancy, and it is clearly two years. M S .  TEETERS. At this time", " 2 / 6 / 7 9  -15- MR. MACDONALD. Following in Bob's vein, let me say that business activity is relatively strong in our District. Many businessmen, however, are apprehensive about [the economy] later in the year. People are especially concerned about the consumer being over-extended in the housing market. The strengths in our District include steel and machine tools, but inflation continues to be the overriding source of concern for everybody from the consumer to the manufacturer. Among the unknowns are energy, the Iranian situation, and wage settlements coming up this year. For these reasons I would not suggest easing policy; I'd wait until we can better judge the economy and the slowdown in the Ms. I agree with President Volcker on a 1 to 4 percent M1 range and a 4 to I percent M2 range, and [then] following alternative B in the Bluebook", " MR. FOSSUM. We certainly see no signs of impending recession in the Sixth District, and this view is supported by almost all of our directors at our head office and branches who seem by and large to feel that their own areas of business are apt to fare better than the national economy. This attitude is particularly prevalent in Florida which, unlike the situation in '73 and '74. has seen little or no speculation or overbuilding. however, in that our projections on the economic outlook are somewhat less optimistic than the Greenbook's. We expect real growth more in the 1 to 1-1/2 percent range and we think 6-1/2 to 6-3/4 percent on unemployment seems more likely. But our chief disagreement would be on the inflation outlook where we see it somewhat worse than the Board's staff; we estimate that it will probably be in the 8-112 to 9 percent range. I would add our voice to Bob Mayo's, 2/6/19 -16- As for the long-term ranges, for M1 we would be inclined to go with the 1 to 4 percent that Paul Volcker and others have suggested. But we'd be inclined to support the ranges in alternative C for the other aggregates; those somewhat higher ranges I think would be consistent with our appraisal of the outlook", " MR. PARTEE. But you do understand M1", " MR. BAUGHMAN. That\u2019s where I had most of my conservations. And this is on the grounds that they are playing their cards close to their chests. They would much rather fix up, patch up, or put in a new machine when an old one breaks down and in fact go to overtime on their labor costs as compared with expanding basic capacity. It leaves them in a much more flexible situation. Also, they are able to pass on cost and price increases without much difficulty. The market takes it. So they just feel that\u2019s the better way to go in the present environment. That substantially increases the possibility that we may have a sustained low growth situation, at least until that attitude is changed, because that seems to me to be a key element in [downturns]. And a major determinant of periods of economic expansion has been a surge in capital investment, which has brought very heavy pressure on the labor markets, materials markets, and credit markets. we do not see that at this time and, if our forecast is reasonably dependable, we are not projecting that we will see it for some time yet to come. There is another element in the picture that seems to increase the possibility [of a low growth outlook], and that is that neither consumers nor businessmen nor financial managers have yet fully adjusted to an expected ongoing rate of inflation somewhere near what we have forecast and, therefore, I think we will see a continued rapid buildup of debt. I\u2019m concerned that the debt structure will become increasingly shaky and that to me is one of the bad aspects of a sustained period of either high optimism or rapid inflation. It means that when [inflation] does come to an end, we will have much more widespread debt distress and a much more difficult economic problem to handle. But it seems to me that we are likely to see that [buildup of debt1 continue for the next couple of years before we get into the painful adjustment part of it. 2/6/79 -22- One other general comment is that I think a set of economic programs and policies proposed by the government, which contemplates I to 8 percent ongoing inflation, is quite inadequate and quite unacceptable, particularly in this country. I believe there is a set of policies that could enable us to move promptly to wring inflation out of the economy without going through a recession and without substantially increasing unemployment, but thus far we seem to be committed to the idea that we must disavow using it. Well, having accepted the economic prospects and what seems to be a consistent set of monetary data along with them, I would opt for alternative B. Nevertheless, I am somewhat concerned about the sort of thing that Mark Willes mentioned--namely, that it's possible if we were at the top of the range on M1 to have growth that I think would be too much. That's all I have, Mr. Chainan", " MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I have a very different perception of the economy than the staff has presented to us. I would like to think we could fine-tune the economy as nicely as our projection. But it seems to me that in the past month we have seen a very unusual combination of numbers. We've seen indicators not only in December but continuing in January that suggest the economy is coming on very strong. At the same time we have had an unusual deceleration in the growth of the monetary aggregates and bank credit. And the latest unusual phenomenon to add to these other two is that we have seen, despite a steady federal funds rate, a decline in short-term money rates. Now, this combination of a very strong economy, very weak monetary growth, and a decline in short-term money rates is rare. I looked back in history to find out when we usually get this combination, and I find that it typically occurs in months immediately preceding a business cycle peak. I think the closest parallel was January, 1960, when the economy was charging ahead following the resumption of steel production. Everybody was talking about the sizzling '60s. Both monetary and fiscal policy were moving toward restraint. And to me the first indicator of the 1960 recession was the surprising weakness in short-term money rates in January of that year. cycle peak in the second quarter and a mild recession in the last half of this year. the demand for money is not going to happen. So, Mark, I don't think you have to worry too much about that 2 percent. I was concerned, too, when I looked at the Bluebook. I think we should lower the ranges modestly. But the Bluebook reductions looked awfully big to me, given my expectations. But Steve has saved the day, after writing the Bluebook, by immediately disavowing it as imprudent", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Join the others. M R .  COLDWELL. The prospects are highly uncertain but still couched on the favorable side. The hard evidence we have had to date is for a strong economy with a very high rate of inflation. As for the monetary aggregates, I must admit I have never had much hope for them. And what they\u2019re showing right now I would say is of doubtful validity. We are uncertain as to the implications and we can\u2019t even describe why the changes are occurring. The information we have about the Administration\u2019s estimates for 1979-80 suggest that those projections are unrealistic. I don\u2019t think we are going to get a reduction in the rate of inflation, the rate of unemployment being held down, and a resumption of growth as promptly as they show. Even our own staff\u2019s forecasts I would quarrel with in terms of the rate of inflation; I don\u2019t think it will go down that smoothly. In my view the possibility is high that our rate of inflation will be in the 9 percent range. On net, then, the result is that we may face a problem of communication with the Congress, a little communications gap. In terms of [our objectives], I hope the Committee comes out somewhere in the area of 1 to 4 percent on M1, 5 to 8 percent on M2, and 6 to 9 percent on M3. I\u2018m coppering my bets a bit but I wouldn\u2018t go as far as Mark has. I don\u2018t think it is desirable to hold out to the rest of the world that there is the potential of a 6 to 10 percent increase in M1 if we are going to tell them that we have a 3 percent shift because of ATS and another 2 percent downward shift; that I think is unrealistic. I don\u2019t like the idea of narrowing the ranges in a period of extreme uncertainty. C H A I W  MILLER. Thank you, Phil. Henry", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. We should [adopt] that, I think, although that's short term", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That may not be the most reliable projection", " On the other hand, if we get a cyclical decline of the kind Frank was talking about-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. We'll have lower rates. M R .  PARTEE. --rates are going to come down", " MR. WALLICH. We were essentially ratcheting it up by first going to the upper side of it and then by chosing a range that would make the upper side fall in the middle", " Vice Chairman Volcker President Baughman Governor Coldwell President Eastburn Governor Partee Governor Teeters Governor Wallich President Willes President Mayo Yes Yes Yes Yes oh, I guess so Yes NO No Yes CHAIRMAN MILLER. Now let's take an official vote", " MR. COLDWELL. Yes", " MR. EASTBURN. All right, the relationship", " They MR. COLDWELL. I'd tell them it's unrealistic even to try", "] CHAIRMAN MILLER. So are you suggesting alternative I for M1 or are you suggesting 4 to 9 percent", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Just whether you'd be interested in--not that you are voting for it--what's on page 21. If there is no reason to discuss it, we needn't waste our time. One, two, three, four, five. How many would not be interested in it. Okay. We'd better do that again with voting members, hadn't we. HOW many voting members would not be interested in the directive type on page 21. One, two, three, four, five. That's going to make it tough. Why don't we see if we can work out the other [directive formulation] to everyone's satisfaction. If I could give you a little guidance, my preference, if we go for the directive language on page 19, is to have the same sort of asymmetrical directive we had last time. My reasons are simply that all of the discussion today, taking into account both domestic and international considerations and the confusion about what the real economy's performance means in relation to the performance of the aggregates, would indicate that we should be in an even keel stance until we see some reason to change. Or to put it another way, when you don't know what to do, do it very cautiously. Therefore, that would be my approach. Do you want to say something, Chuck. I was going to say if that is the case, then I think Steve's suggestions of 4 to 9 percent for M1 and 5 to 9 percent [for M21, looking at the possibilities indicated on page 14, would seem to be reasonable. That would mean that if we got toward the upper end of those ranges we'd be 2/6/19 -33- looking at tightening; but we'd have to go to the bottom and through it before we thought of relaxing. I would also like to say that, considering the time between this meeting and the next, if there is any real reason to shift policy, it seems to me that we should have a telephone conversation. I feel that we shouldn't get ourselves too locked into these numbers with the situation so fluid. We have a good telephone set-up now--it seems to work well--so it's not so hard to get everybody on [a conference call] to discuss [a policy move]. Now, if we do what I've just described, the question I'd like to hear discussed is: Should we leave the fed funds range at 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent or should we change it to 9-3/4 to 10-1/4 percent, looking at the fact that an even keel approach means we're not going to be putting much room on either side. Why don't we just get inputs. M R .  PARTEE. I was simply going to point out that I agree totally with what you said about even keel--that is, I think this is a time for a sticky funds rate unless we see something big happening. But then your specific proposal was a biased proposal, that we raise the funds rate if the aggregates are strong in the range and not [reduce] it if they are low. I see no reason for that asymmetrical treatment when, looking at that table on page 14, we are well below the lower end and indeed won't be getting up to the midpoint of the [longer-run] range by March unless we are at the very top of the [February-March] M1 range. I'm speaking of M1 now", " 2 / 6 / 1 9  -35- MR. ROOS. I just can't resist pointing out that, as I read this, there isn't very much sentiment within this group to use the Humphrey-Hawkins situation to signal a relatively important change in how we [handle] this--in other words, to widen the fed funds ranges significantly. By doing so we can be masters of the aggregates' destinies to a greater extent than we are. Apparently a great majority of us is still committed to pretty much sticking to doing business as we have in the past on these fundamentals", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, Larry, I don't know what the sentiment is. but I have a bit of a trouble thinking that we know enough about these aggregates and their stability to operate that way. We have this phenomenon that at some point, for some reasons, the money function shifts around on us. And how one measures that in a particular week or at a particular time I think is a very tricky business", " Louis guru would suggest targeting more on the base but-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes, but you keep adjusting the base so that you go back to a constant situation and give no effect to the shifting around of the demand function of money. I would have very deep trouble [with that] because that isn't what is happening in the economy. The economy is shifting its preference as to how it holds these funds. If we say we're going to ignore that, yes we can operate that way. But I think we'd be out of touch with reality", " MR. WILLES. I have a feeling that I'm about to vote for a money market directive, which means that in the years I've contested with this Committee the Committee has won and I've given in", " MR. WILLES. I understand. I just think we ought to have a not ion-- CHAIR\" MILLER. Well, we ought to have an understanding and I don't know how best to articulate that understanding. Each of you sees the money numbers as they are published each Thursday. Having seen them, if we haven't called a meeting and you think we need to talk, just call us. I think we can leave it to communication; if anybody feels that it's time to talk, we'll talk. That's one way to do it. Then we don't have to [set] numbers", " MR. PARTEE. I think we want to look even-handed, too, and that [Bluebook] directive would not look even-handed", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. No. they really haven't: they've been very good about that. reference [to neutrality] in the directive but the fact is that I don't feel neutral. And to word the directive like that sounds as if we're operating entirely biased against any change at all and that the only thing that's going to [trigger a] change is the aggregates. It ignores the foreign exchange market aspects entirely and ignores the fact that the risks to the domestic economy are on the inflationary side anyway", " MR. AXILROD. We've ignored the asymmetry. It was written with asymmetrical wording", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. All right. Let\u2018s go around to the voting members and ask what you want to do. I\u2019m not talking about the range now but I think we need to crystalize this one way or the other. Are we going to have a money market directive, are we going to have just an understanding, or are we going to have an asymmetrical directive or what. Let me go right down the list. Ernie. M R .  BAUGHMAN", " Mark MR. WILLES", " MR. BAUGHMAN. I share that feeling; I think 9 or 9-1/2 percent [money growth] is too high for a money market directive", " MR. PARTEE. Both ends", " I must say, Mark, that I really do think we\u2019re talking about an arithmetic-- MR. WILLES. I\u2019m just trying to understand, Chuck, what the numbers are. I think we\u2019re talking about policy and not arithmetic", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Here is a proposal, and you've got 3 minutes to decide and then we're going to lunch. Steve is suggesting that we could say this: \"System open market operations are to be directed at maintaining the weekly average funds rate at about the current level, provided that over the February-March period the annual rates of growth of M1 and M2, given approximately equal weight, appear to be within ranges of 3 to 7 percent and 5 to 9 percent, respectively. If growth of M1 and M2 for the two-month period appears to be outside the indicated ranges, the Manager will promptly notify the Chairman, who will then consult with the Committee for supplemental instructions", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. But he compromised; he gave you 3 to I", " Vice Chairman Volcker President Baughman Governor Coldwell President Eastburn Governor Partee Governor Teeters Governor Wallich President Willes President Mayo No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay, we have two recalcitrants who can finally redeem themselves by shifting their votes", " MR. PARTEE. Who cares about the domestic economy. We're only concerned about the foreign exchange rates", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. I don't think we will either. But we have [acquired] a billion dollars of D-marks in a couple of days which was very favorable to us. And we might have other occasions where we want to continue-- M R .  PARTEE. Well, I don't think we ought to get ourselves into a substantial long exposure willy nilly, but I think what Alan is suggesting is within the range of operating necessity. Nevertheless, I would hate to see us acquiring $500 million, [going] up to $1 billion and then to $1.5 billion. Those things sometimes happen", " 2 / 6 / 1 9  -46- CHAIRMAN MILLER. Also, we don't want to make such a decision unless we intend to look at it in depth; this is not something we are trying to sneak up on. I just think we need some operating room"], "1979FOMC19790320meeting.txt": [" MR. PARDEE. Some people feel there is, yes", " Nor do I believe these data are very consistent with MR. BALLES. Thanks a lot", " 3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -7- MR. EASTBURN. I think I understood. I\u2019m not sure I agree. Steve, we did calculations similar to the ones you did, although not as sophisticated. trying to find what these other sources of funds might add to the aggregates--the money market funds, the RPs, and the ATS. We added them back in different ways and just didn\u2019t find enough money there to add to the actual figures for either M1 or M2 to make that look as if it could be the full explanation. Then the question is: What is left. My inclination is to look at what happens to money as an indicator of what is happening to the real economy. If one looks at the shortfall in that respect, I think one might come to a different weighting of these policy conclusions than you did. My own conclusion, even after all these adjustments one might want to make, is that the weak money supply is telling us that the economy is going to be weaker in the future, and that that would call for a different policy prescription", " MR. BALLES. I\u2019ll just pick up for a minute on the comment that Dave made. We\u2019ve looked at these same numbers, Steve, and frankly, we come out more on Dave\u2019s side than yours. We have here an array of the different Ms going up to M7. And in a nutshell what the facts seem to say is that they\u2019ve all been decelerating since last fall, though to varying degrees, of course. Even if we look at the latest monthly growth numbers on MI, which includes all these money market funds, RPs, commercial paper, and so forth, the percentage growth now is less than half--or at least it\u2019s no bigger than half-- what it was last fall. And in some cases growth is about a third as big as it was last fall. So I don\u2019t see a simple tradeoff between, say, M1 and M2 and something in M7. The bottom line is that this is a very difficult and slippery area, as you well know, and judgments can differ looking at a set of facts. From my standpoint, I suspect that you may be overestimating the shift in the demand for money. I\u2019m not at all sure it\u2019s going on to the degree that would seem to be implied by your analysis, and I say that with all due respect. Judgments can differ on these things. The alternative explanation is that we\u2019ve simply been very stingy in the provision of reserves. I think some combination of those two might explain where we\u2019re coming out. But as I say, if one looks at the actual components of what goes into the so-called substitutes for money, it\u2019s true that money market funds have surged, but the RPs have not. They haven\u2019t grown proportionately any more than they did in 1974. And the sum of those two has not grown proportionately any more 3/20/79 -9- than it did in 1974, based on our look at the data. S o ,  I have to register some skepticism, to put it mildly, on the extent of the shift in the demand for money. It remains a judgment rather than a fact, as far as I\u2019m concerned", " MR. MAYO. Both", " MR. BALLES. Your footnotes and documents say that it includes both, Steve. Am I wrong", " MR. PARTEE. Yes, netting out their certificates, and they mainly hold CDs. Of course, that\u2019s double counting not to net out the CDs ", " Right, short of specifications VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if I look far enough ahead, Mr. Chairman, meaning through the year, I think the odds are better than 5 0 / 5 0  that we\u2018re going to run into a recession by [year-end], and I\u2019ve thought that for some time. I think the odds are being increased by 3 / 2 0 / . 9  -10- the oil situation and by what's going on in inflation generally. Having said that, I don't think we can change that much by any modest adjustments in monetary policy. I believe a real easing in monetary policy is likely to make things worse. My reasoning is that in the short run--and I'm mainly impressed by the evidence of the last six weeks or so--1 think we're much more up against capacity [constraints] and growing shortages, caused in part by those GNP figures you just read and the continuous upward revisions in those figures for the fourth quarter. I don't see that the economy has any real margin to grow here without seriously aggravating our inflationary problem. I think the growth we had late last year is already aggravating our inflationary problem. And I believe an attempt to [induce] very fast growth here would increase the odds not only of a recession but a more serious recession as we go along. One doesn't have to speculate to see that inflation is a lot worse. In my view we'll be lucky if that Commerce figure stays at 10 percent for the first quarter when the final number comes out. Commodity prices are rising; through the latest information we have them rising at alarming rates. I suspect the oil price increase that the staff has projected in a very uncertain situation is, if anything, low; and it might be substantially low. Essentially, I think we're in retreat on the inflation side; if there's not a complete rout, it's close to it. And in my view that poses the major danger to the stability of the economy as we proceed. It's an obvious danger for international stability despite the welcome respite we've had in the last three or four months. That remains a major problem not only in terms of economic stability but in the dimensions beyond that if the dollar stability should give way not just to an erosion but the panicky situation we had earlier. So, without getting into any more details, there's no doubt in my mind that even if we didn't look at the aggregates at all, this is the time for some firming rather than the reverse. I think we are at a critical point in the inflation program, with the tide against us. ~f we don't show any response at all, we are giving an unfortunate signal in my judgment. I believe those concerned about inflation would find no response during this period almost inexplicable in terms of what we say regarding our worries about inflation. I do think there is some risk of a boomlet. I don't think it would go very far in real terms because I doubt the economy has the capacity to meet it. But it could add to those inflationary pressures, lead to excess ordering, and potentially to excess inventory building that would only make a recession worse if indeed we are going to have a recession later this year or in early [19801. So, without getting into the real complications caused by the money supply figures, but noting that I pretty much share M r .  Axilrod's conclusions in that respect, it seems to me that the real factors point in the direction I've indicated", " MR. PARTEE. Mr. Chairman, last week I appeared before the House Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs to discuss monetary policy in the context of our Humphrey-Hawkins report, but the discussion soon turned to current monetary policy. Steve and I did our best to defend current monetary policy before the Subcommittee. The reason I mention this is that I'm obliged to report to you that the Chairman of the 3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -11- Subcommittee, Parren Mitchell, wants the FOMC to know that he is concerned. He says he\u2019s concerned not as an economist because he isn\u2019t an economist, not as a monetarist because he doesn\u2019t understand the arcane area of monetarism, but as an historian because he has noted that every time there is substantial and sustained weakness in the money supply, a recession follows. He wonders why the current situation would differ from previous situations. Now, I must say that I\u2018m not a monetarist either, but I do have some sympathy with Chairman Mitchell\u2019s view of this. It does seem to me that we\u2019ve had a sustained period of weakness in the money supply. It has been five months, October through February. Perhaps that\u2019s marginal; it may need another couple of months to be truly sustained, but it\u2019s getting pretty close to a sustained weakness now. I think it is also true that the weakness in money supply growth is substantial. If one makes the adjustment for ATS and NOW accounts, which I think is appropriate, one gets about a 1-1/2 percent average rate of increase in the narrow money supply over this five month period, compared with the 8 percent rate of increase recorded for a good many of the preceding months. That is a significant step down in the rate of expansion. I don\u2018t really believe much in taking these developments such as money market funds and money market certificates and RPs and that kind of thing as an explanation because they have occurred in the past. That\u2018s simply the reflection of what happens when interest rates are high; the rate of return on cash money is zero and people try to find substitutes. It\u2019s the process of finding substitutes, as I said on the phone the other day, that we\u2019re really describing when we look at this. Turning to the economic situation, I, too, think there are indications that we are in the last stage of a boom. Consumer spending has flattened; it has declined in real terms since the first of the year. There\u2019s a little push in car sales, but that\u2018s simply a matter of clearing out the small cars because of the prospect that gas prices will certainly be higher and gas may be in short supply. Housing has clearly turned down. I don\u2018t think there\u2019s any way one can read the decline of the last two months as being an entirely weather-related phenomenon because those developments are too widespread. There are too many other indications of weakness developing in that area, and we\u2019ve just taken an action that will assure that the big lenders are not going to have as much money as they did before to put into the mortgage market. I don\u2019t think capital spending is going anywhere. I\u2019m quite impressed by the decline in contracts; I think all we\u2019ve had is a little bubble in new orders for capital equipment that isn\u2019t going to last very long and can, after all, be reversed by cancellations. One should always remember about those new orders that a great many of them are subject to cancellation; many orders were cancelled after there was a bubble in \u201874 and then the recession of \u201875. So, that can happen. It is conceivable that we will have a period of rapid business inventory accumulation and we may have some scare buying of materials; that seems to have been going on, but I don\u2019t think it will last very long. So, I would have to say, looking at the real economy as well as the monetary numbers, that I now believe a recession is very likely--a recession which at this point the Federal Reserve will have done nothing about. We will have made no effort to block it in any way. We will have sat here again, seeing very weak monetary 3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -12- aggregates as a precedent to the recession phase. I believe we're in considerable danger of that happening. You often ask us to give our views on [economic] growth over the policy period [relative to the staff's views], which are at the bottom of page 8 [of the Summary and Outlook part of the Greenbook]. I don't think we're going to have 1.7 percent real growth this year. It could possibly be a bit above zero, but not very much. I don't think we're going to have 8.7 percent inflation. I think the staff has finally managed to predict a number that is higher than the one we will realize. That's partly because of my weaker scenario, but partly because I'm also very convinced that businesses are raising prices in anticipation of wage and price controls. And whether or not wage and price controls occur, these firms have taken their action and there will be a moderation in those markups in the period to come. And, of course, I don't expect the unemployment rate to be 6.3 percent at the end of the year: I think it will be 7 percent or above. So, that's the situation as I see it", " MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I've looked over the numbers and I've looked over the projections and I also think we're in the final quarters of the boom. I had the staff put together for me a variety of indicators in the last three quarters before a peak. One thing that stands out is that they're never the same. There is very little similarity between the various peaks that we've had. We seem to do better [predicting] troughs and recoveries than we do with [the end of] expansions. I think we're headed toward a recession. As I look at the data and the projections, I think the disintermediation and its impact on housing are finally taking place. However, I won't feel comfortable until I see a March housing starts number [in trying to determine] where we really are in that area. The other elements of the economy still appear to be relatively well balanced. With the possibility that we could dip into a recession and the high costs of that in a variety of areas, I would take the position that we ought to wait another month until we have some better data. The first quarterly estimate by the Commerce Department is notoriously bad. It can bounce from here to over yonder in a month's time: in another month's time we'll have some more real numbers on the economy and that would be an appropriate time to move. I don't think we need additional restraint at the present time. For heavens sakes, our policies are finally beginning to work. Now is the time to sit back and let them work and not make it seem as if we're panicking about what's going on in the economy currently, which I think some people are doing. Also, I doubt that most of the spot prices are going to hold; some of them have been pushed up and are now beginning to recede somewhat. So, my recommendation is no change in policy at the present time", " MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I come out somewhat less optimistic than the staff. Like many, we've been impressed by the strength we've had in the economy. It has been much greater up until now, as far as the statistics show, than we had expected. But I'm becoming increasingly concerned by the appearance of scattered signs that we frequently do see before a major downturn. The Redbook mentioned a number of these, [including] a lengthening of delivery times, high capacity utilization, tight supplies in the market for skilled labor, 3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -13- and the inventory figures. The last inventory figure, though partly explainable, coupled with an apparently heavy shift toward short-term borrowing on the part of businesses is certainly the sort of thing one might expect. And I'm especially concerned about the probability that in view of the petroleum situation we'll have some spawning of a general shortage psychology, which will lead to inventory buildups and probably heavy demands for short-term credit. And that will make it pretty difficult to keep M1 under control without pushing interest rates up rather high. Coupling this with the latest price data and the impending labor negotiations, I have to rate the possibility of stagflation or worse as pretty high. So my figures would come out lower than the staff's, somewhere in the neighborhood of what Chuck Partee said. Turning to the policy question, I think we have a difficult choice this morning. The weakness in the aggregates has persisted for about five months and this weakness has been a source of increasing concern to many of us, both within and [outside] the System. It seems to me that one could make a pretty good case for some easing this morning. But on the other side of the coin, there are three reasons why maybe we ought not take any action this morning. One, of course, is that we really don't know what those aggregates are saying. We, like so many others--John Balles and Dave Eastburn as well as Steve Axilrod--have tried to see what we could do by adding back in the things that might have been reducing the aggregates. And some of the arguments that people have made don't seem to us to hold water. But I don't think we can rule out the possibility, indeed the probability, that there has been a downward shift in the demand for money. If so, that's an important reason for not doing anything at this particular time. The second point is that historically we often have had a burst in the aggregates in April because of faulty seasonal adjustments, and I don't think we can rule that out. We could also have a temporary spurt in economic activity. And finally, the improvement in the dollar in the foreign exchange markets has been so fragile that I think any reversal of policy now could certainly jeopardize that. That gets me to the point where we work on [the specifics of] policy, and I won't say anything about that until after the break", " MR. EASTBURN. Well, my view could be summarized by reporting on a meeting that we had last week with some business people and [other contacts]. The discussion around the table was very optimistic about current conditions, almost uniformly so, until I took a [poll] asking who thought there would be a recession this year. And about three-fourths of the hands went up. And that\u2019s where I come out. I agree very much with the analysis Chuck gave. I think the staff\u2019s projections are too optimistic. I\u2018m also skeptical about the Bluebook projection that the money supply will bounce back in the next month or so. I think that the slow growth of money is telling us something about the real economy and that that has implications for policy. I would dearly hope that we could hold the funds rate where it is in the next month but I would like to have policy tilted so that if the aggregates continue to be weak, we could edge that rate down", " MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I think we're facing an emerging conflict between the domestic and international requirements of monetary policy. quite clearly, we're moving into a period where they are going to be in conflict, because I think we're approaching a cyclical peak in the economy some time around midyear for the reasons cited by Chuck Partee. I would simply add one more point: In the month of January, when we had no increase in industrial production, we had a whopping increase in inventories, which suggests that final demand was extremely weak. Now, this picture of an approaching cyclical peak is not conclusive and, of course, it won't be conclusive until the peak is three or four months behind us. And that is why monetary policy has always lagged in the past. If we're waiting f o r  conclusive evidence, we'll inevitably lag again. But if we change policy now in the face of inconclusive evidence, it means that we have to be prepared to shift again if it appears that the economy is somehow getting a second wind, which I think is unlikely but possible. In my view, we don't know much about the demand for money; we used to think we did a few years back. But we do know something about the supply of money. And one thing we know is that we're not going to get much of a supply if bank reserves don't grow, and they haven't grown for the past six months. If it's our objective to avoid a recession, I think we have to move today; I don't think we can wait for another month. One thing I've found around this table is that one can always make an impressive case for waiting for another month. But the evidence suggests to me that the time to move is now. I think the issue is whether we seriously are concerned about avoiding a recession or not. Paul, I think, is resigned to a recession; I think the international constraint may be more of a factor in his thinking than he let on", " In the past year they've been nicely in harmony but, VICE C H A I W  VOLCKER. Inflation is a factor in my thinking", " MR. MORRIS. I think we ought to move at least to 9-1/2 percent and we ought to move now", " MR. WALLJCH. I think we\u2019re in imminent danger of building into the economy a higher rate of inflation and of putting ourselves into a position, with or without a subsequent recession, of having to work that off and starting from a higher level with less chance [of success] than we had the last time around. It\u2019s not true that we can\u2019t work off inflation; we did it after the experience of \u201974 and \u2019 1 5 ,  But we\u2019ve done very poorly of late and our surprises have always been that we\u2019ve found more boominess in the economy and more inflation than we expected up through the last forecast which shaded the 3 / 2 0 / 1 9  -23- boominess a little. So, I see our main risk on the side of inflation. And I fear that we\u2019re in some danger of validating the increase in the price of oil and accepting that as inevitable. I think we ought not to do that; I\u2019d accommodate this kind of outside shock only partly. It seems clear that the economy is much closer to capacity than we had thought. That is, I think, accountable for a good part of the pressures we\u2019re getting. Whether or not a recession is in the works is probably something that is beyond the power of monetary policy now to remedy. I think we have more chances of doing something about inflation than doing something about a recession. If there is a recession, it is likely to be a moderate and short one. I have that reaction because of the fact that it\u2019s so widely advertised and, in the face of that, business behavior has been to step up plant and equipment expenditures. It seems to me they\u2019re looking beyond the valley; they can\u2019t possibly be planning to put much [capacity] in place before some kind of a slowdown occurs. Meanwhile, the inflation pressure is threatening the President\u2019s wage and price program and if that collapses, we\u2018ve lost one further instrument. It threatens the dollar and if something happens to [weaken] the dollar, we will have more inflation. All this suggests to me that the dangers are more on the side of inflation than on the side of the real sector. I don\u2019t want to minimize those real sector risks; I think they are real. I might add that people who are concerned about excessive boominess and excessive inflation are not just a small minority. I\u2019m surprised how much support one sees around the country, even in the Congress and even among economists whom we have listened to and not usually found on the restrictive side--and even, if I may say so, amony some people in the Administration. So if we are talking about beds, there are some prospects for unusual bedfellows here. A s  for the aggregates, I have much sympathy for Steve\u2018s analysis. I think it is reasonably persuasive except perhaps the magnitude. something like a proxy for the aggregates, realizing that it\u2019s not a very good measure of total credit. S o  that brings me to what I should say about policy. I think if we fail to do something that recognizes the threat of greater inflation, we will really add to that inflation. A demonstration [of our anti-inflationary resolve] is needed. At a minimum, I would not relax the funds rate for that reason. I\u2019m very reluctant to push it up because I can see that six months from now we might regret having done that if the economy has weakened. I think some demonstration--an action on reserve requirements or the discount rate--might be more [appropriate], within a broader program than this Committee would ordinarily deal with. On the funds rate, I would like to hear the rest of the discussion", " [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN MILLER. Let me make a couple of observations. One is that in the course of these four years of business expansion, we\u2019ve had all the elements of a long expansion. And we\u2019ve had some new territory to explore since we\u2018ve had only one other period in our lifetimes when there has been high inflation during peacetime in the 3120179 -24- United States. We\u2018ve had it in the whole decade but it\u2019s higher than even the ridiculous rates of 6 percent we had in the \u2018 I 3  to \u201975 timeframe. We don\u2019t have much in our models to help us understand those periods. There were peculiarities in that period related first to the aftermath of mandatory controls and then the oil boycott, so we can\u2019t crank that into our model and assume that that was an experience or a base from which all future periods of like rates will track. In this particular cycle we\u2019ve had an usual experience where we have alarmed the public about inflation in order to get policy changes and they reacted by finding out that inflation is a danger, which makes our policy direction more difficult. Nonetheless, without alerting them, we couldn\u2019t get the policy changes. And one of the things that consumers did in the face of this was to engage in preferring goods to money and, therefore, there was anticipatory buying which worked against our efforts to cool the economy. And businesses, having been burned so badly in 1973-74, have behaved extremely cautiously during this period. Their investments in either capital or inventories have been cautious. On a net investment basis, after replacement, we are not back to where we were at the prior peak. [Business firms] are actually investing less today than they were at the peak of the last cycle on a net basis. So there has been nothing exuberant about business behavior. They\u2018ve been quite prudent, I think. We now have recently [unintelligible]. And the question before the house is: Does this mean that businesses also have begun to cave in to the inflation psychology and have begun to opt for goods over money. And will this create a speculative boom that [produces] another peak of sustained inflation, which then will result in a bigger bust. Well, the data appear to be confusing. To the extent that any business decisions currently represent capital commitments, I would say that we should have little concern. Number one, the actual expenditures will be spread over a time [period] that we all predict to be soft economically at any case. In terms of material actually bought and paid for and labor actually employed, it will come at a time when there\u2019s not excessive economic activity. To the extent that it works on the supply side and deals with increasing capacity and modernization and reduces unit costs and contributes to productivity, we should all be applauding and encouraging it. To the extent that it represents inventory accumulation, on the other hand, it could be dangerous because it could result in excess stocks, leading later to cutbacks in production, thereby exacerbating the slowdown and tipping the economy into unnecessary recession. So one has to analyze that. Now, to the degree that stocks are being replenished because of [final sales] in the fourth quarter being stronger than expected, that\u2018s part of the solution. To the extent that stocks are being accumulated because of the fear that there may be a trucker\u2019s strike or a rubber strike, one has to admit that that\u2019s not speculative behavior but a prudent hedge which has an impact on the economy later but does not represent a shift. To the extent that the accumulation represents a fear that the energy situation is a problem in terms of availability and cost--[if that fear] is rippling through the world again and feedstocks and petro-based products of all types and materials related to that are being bid up--if that is either hoarding or a hedge or a speculation, we have a problem. And to what degree that\u2019s all happening [I don\u2018t think] any of us can judge. 3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -25- In any case, what we do today is unlikely in my opinion to have much impact on the real behavior of the economy for the next two months. Therefore, what we should be doing today is thinking about what our policy direction should be as the year progresses, thereby being more consistent with our longer-tern view that the monetary aggregates affect the economy over time. We could send up red flags or white flags or yellow flags and people are probably going to behave pretty much based on these other factors. situation is probably more overwhelming right now than anything else. S o  with all that, I would ask you to turn first to page 7 of the Bluebook and thumb through to page 13. Look first at the staff\u2019s suggested alternatives for our directive for the period. Then look at page 13 where we can see [the projected outcomes relative to our long- run ranges1 if, for example, we took alternative B and were within the growth ranges contemplated for the aggregates for the next 2 months under alternative B. If we were pursuing M1 in the 4 to 9 percent range and we hit the top of it, we would get growth back up to just within our long-term range. We\u2019d still be below on M 2 ,  at the top of our range on M3, and we would be just touching the bottom of our [Ml] growth range; on bank credit we\u2019d be at the upper bracket. The Bluebook also continues to present to you the rates of growth for monetary aggregates that would be required to get back to the [upper limit], the midpoint, or the [lower limit] of our own target ranges over a period of time. Those I believe are shown on page 10. How they view the energy With all of that, my thought would be that the right posture now is one of seeking to [guide] the aggregates back toward our ranges, but not doing so with undue acceleration or signals of undue concern by moving too rapidly. I would be more patient for the reason that I think the economy is going to pursue its own course right now. Nor do I think we ought to start to send any particular signals of unusual tightening or monetary restraint because that wouldn\u2019t do much in the short term and in the long term it would work against our desire, if we believe in our own ranges and the objective of getting back inside the ranges. For that reason I would be inclined to take a moderate course of more or less even keeling where we are; I\u2018d [put] our objectives for M1 and M2 in the 4 to 8 or 4 to 9 percent area [unintelligible]. Those are just my personal observations. I would appreciate having inputs from each of you. I might say that on the thrust of policy the score card reads as follows: John Balles, slight tilt toward a lower funds rate; Bob Black, no action now; Phil Coldwell will tell us later; Bones Kimbrel, some firming; Bob Mayo, hold the current position, although I gather from what Bob said that a trifle more restraint would be acceptable; Chuck Partee, what he said was that it\u2018s time to do something and reading between the lines I think he\u2019d like to ease", " \"  MR. BLACK. That would be \"B.\" I'd buy those specifications", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Phil. Bones", " MR. WALLICH. Well, I question the meaning of the aggregates. I think we have to add something to them, both for ATS and for shift in the demand curve, so I believe they are much higher than they look on paper. I would, therefore, take the C alternative, 3-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent for M1 and 3 to I percent for M2. And somewhere in the directive I would make reference to the view that the aggregates are being interfered with by technological developments due to ATS and other factors, which I think should also be reflected in our one-year targets. There\u2018s no sense running after those if we have good reason to believe that something has happened to the demand for money that makes a given amount of money go further than we thought it would. On the funds rate, I would like to push it up just a little to 10-1/4 percent and go to a range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent. But I do think the inflationary environment calls for some other kind of action, so I would say that the Board should move on reserve requirements or the discount rate or some combination of these in a moderate way. AS far as the nature of the directive is concerned, I\u2019d like to have a money market directive with the range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent and, as I said, move to the midpoint of 10-1/4 percent with reasonable promptness", " MR. MORRIS. We might actually be in it, yes", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes. It looks to me as if we could cut this on a 4 to 8 percent on M1. I don't know quite what to make of M2, but 3-1/2 to 7-112 percent looks to be a mid-range [preference] And the compromise area might be 10 to 10-1/4 percent on fed funds", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. As I look at this, I'd say the consensus is to stay at about the prevailing rate, which is 10 percent plus. Five 3 / 2 0 / 7 9  -32- were for the prevailing rate. One--that was you--was for a lower rate. And Phil and Bones were for just a slight firming--I would say something a little over 10, maybe 10-1/8 percent. Some wanted higher", " MR. BALLES. Yes", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. It looks as if we\u2019re going to have a very close vote today because we have those who think this is too tight and those who think it\u2019s too loose. We have three who indicated they could accept it and five who indicated they couldn\u2019t. Of those, John, you would prefer it to be less restrictive", " MR. HOLMES. [Statement--see Appendix", " MR. HOLMES. Yes, I think the Germans would like it and the Treasury would not; so there's a bit of an impasse there", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. It cuts down our flexibility", " MR. COLDWELL. In view of the rising volume in the lending area it seems to me that we ought to be raising our interest rates on this, perhaps to a 2 to 10 percent range instead of the current range", " MR. STERNLIGHT. We are charging about double what they would have to pay elsewhere", " MR. PARTEE. About double", " Yes, I see your point MR. COLDWELL. But they do come and borrow. The question is the degree to which they push to try to cover [their shorts1 before they come to us", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. I just have to disagree because we have had to suspend these rules when we got into difficulty. Now you want to put them in so we can suspend them again if we get into difficulty. The only way we could operate on the day we did $1 billion dollars in one day was to have some authority to do so. So on that day we did suspend the rules. You're kidding yourself about your procedures because when we got into the real heat of battle you had to give us complete authority. Now you are saying while we don't have the heat of battle put the limit down tight; and when we have the hear of battle and the real danger comes and the authority could be abused, we'll take it off completely. That's poor procedure in my view", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Opposed"], "1979FOMC19790417meeting.txt": [" MR. PARTEE. Alan, had there not been all this intervention, do you believe that the dollar would have been substantially higher", " MR. PARTEE. So speculators against the dollar might have been squeezed in the absence of this intervention, I suppose", " MS. TEETERS. Where do you think the dollar is going now. Do you expect it to stabilize or do you expect the upward pressures to continue", " MR. STERNLIGHT. The greater part of it was for intervention, yes", " MR. KICHLINE. We did not treat it differently in terms of the price impact. On the real side, there are important differences. I believe I know what you are getting at. I think the question is what the percentage passthrough is and whether or not we are simply talking about shifting profits from refiners to crude oil producers, or how much do prices actually go up. And that\u2019s a major area of conflict. I might say we have treated it roughly the same; the Administration has treated it somewhat differently and assumed that only two-thirds of the costs get passed through", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. We show more inflation impact than the Administration does. M R .  KICHLINE. That\u2019s right", " MR. WINN. Jim, in the last three weeks we've been getting a little more evidence that disintermediation is starting to take place. We see it in terms of traffic in the Bank--direct purchases of [Treasury] securities--and we see it in looking at some of the institutional outflows. Parallel to that is the fact that long-term rates are starting to increase, particularly for the financing of office buildings and other such things. I get a reading that across the country for the first time [builders] are really starting to look very hard at costs and that a number of projects have suddenly been pulled back in April. Are we starting to see the bite of the policies that have been in train for some time. If that's true, then one gets a little different outlook than you projected for some of these things", " MR. AXILROD. There's a slight conflict, you're quite right. I said early on that the slower growth [in the monetary aggregates] we're now having is consistent with our staff projections of a slowing later on in economic activity. But then I went on to say that the slow [monetary] growth we're having was sufficient to finance this rapid expansion in nominal activity. And the rapid expansion in nominal activity mainly reflects, of course, the rate of inflation and only to a minor extent expansion in real output. Real output was low in the first quarter; it increased at only a 1-1/2 percent rate and the rate of inflation was up close to 10 percent", " MR. ROOS. Could I just ask one further question, Mr. Chairman. What factors mitigate, in your thinking, the view that there will be a rebound in the monetary aggregates in the period ahead. What evidence would there be to justify your point of view other than wishful thinking", " MR. BALLES. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. I always find it difficult to disagree with Steve, particularly after such a lucid exposition as the one he has just gone through. I do have to quarrel though, Steve, with the conclusion that Larry has already addressed. What is the evidence that money will rebound. Last month, you may remember, I called attention to the fact that for the five months running through February the Bluebook forecast has proven to be considerably over the mark month by month for both M1 and M2. To add a little interest to this debate--of course, it's always easier to be a Monday morning quarterback--1 gave my own forecast in qualitative terms. And my guess was that given this consistent pattern the March figures would probably come in significantly below what you were then forecasting. And with apologies for sounding like \"I told you so,\" your March forecast for MI was an increase of 5.7 percent and, as you know, it came in at .75 percent. I consider that significant. There was a better record on M2; the forecast then was 4.9 percent and its growth now is said to have been 3 . 6  percent in March. To try to get my arms around what seems to be the problem, I had my staff prepare a memorandum, which I have handed out here, and I would like to take just a minute, Mr. Chairman, to run through a few of the highlights. There has been this pattern now for six months in a row, October through March, of a significant overforecasting of money growth month by month. That is shown on table 1 by months for M2 and M1; those [variances] are in percentage points. The average overforecast for M1 for those six months was 5.1 percentage points and the average overforecast for M2 was 2 . 8  percentage points, as shown in table 1. Chart 1, which is on the next page, is rather revealing. These monthly errors are just bound to be big. If anybody asked me if I could do better than Steve, I'd say \"no I couldn't.'' This is a darn difficult job. Usually what happens, though, is that large errors in any given month will be offset by errors in the opposite direction in the next month. AS shown on Chart 1, about half of the time or in a good part of 1975 and 1976 that is what in fact happened. But when we got near a trough in interest rates in the latter part of 1976 and 4/17/79 -9- into 1977, the errors were all on one side. The staff was underforecasting money, as shown by the black areas below the zero line. We got into a period of rising interest rates in 1978 and the errors shown in the black shaded part were pretty much random. From late 1978 moving into 1979 the errors have again been systematic; they seem to occur at or near troughs or peaks in interest rates. Therefore, Steve, I must say to you again, as I did last month, that [I question1 the forecast in the April Bluebook, which shows M1 growth coming in at 6.75 percent-this is assuming alternative B and an unchanged funds rate--in May after 3.3 percent [in April], for an average of the two months of 5.5 percent. I suspect that's going to be several points too high when we get the actual numbers. I'd say ditto on M2, where the Bluebook shows M2 growth in April at an estimated 7.5 percent rate and in May at a projected 5.2 percent, for a two-month average of 6 . 3 5  percent. I think that's going to be several points too high. Now, if that's what the Committee wants to do, if that's the outcome we're looking for, fine. But we shouldn't walk into it accidentally. I'm beginning in my own mind to make some mental adjustments in deflating these current [Bluebook] figures until I see evidence that money is in fact rebounding at current interest rate levels. I'm afraid the evidence in the last six months gives me little comfort on that [score], Steve, and therefore I suspect that we may be unintentionally, as it were, leaning too hard and getting aggregate growth that in retrospect may prove to have been our undoing. My fear of this risk is compounded by the fact that, contrary to the Board's staff, we expect at least a mild recession beginning in the second half of this year. Without throwing in any detail, I expect it will probably be the classic inventory-type recession, hopefully short and mild", " MR. WALLICH. I wanted to ask Steve what his reasons were for placing much confidence on the existing relationship. there is at least a possibility that that relationship has changed. It has changed, I think, for two years running and has led us to an overprediction of $30 billion in that time, if I remember. People are now looking at what they consider to be inflation of 10 to 12 percent and that is a tremendous incentive to hold down not only Ml balances but also lower-yielding savings and time deposit balances. I really think that under these conditions we have to assume that there is a change in the relationship and, therefore, I don\u2019t see much basis for predicting a rebound. I think this shift can go on at a substantial rate f o r  a long time. If I were to look at any monetary aggregate now, it would be more nearly bank credit plus commercial paper plus finance company lending. In any event I am aware that the monetarists are divided now, with some taking the point of view that the aggregates are moving too slowly and others arguing that the relationship has changed. I\u2018m trying to ask Steve: What is the reason for thinking we\u2019ll get back on track with the relationship", " As Chuck said, 4/11/19 -1l- MR. AXILROD. Well, Governor Wallich, I really don't know and I don't think anyone knows when exactly we'll get back on the relationship. AS YOU said, in the early stages of this expansion beginning around the end of '74 it took us 2-1/2 years to so-called \"get back on the relationship.\" We have always assumed that this demand shift is not going to last as long because so much [of it] had occurred earlier and there is just that much less cash to use up. It was because of the uncertainty about the aggregates, as you point out, that I tried to stress as much as I did the kind of analysis one would go through in assessing the restrictiveness or non-restrictiveness of the present level of market rates. In that way I think one gets down to what is going to be a very judgmental factor, and that is assessing what really is the expected real return on capital. That is, if inflation expectations are accelerating, that could be offset by declining expectations in the real return of capital. One just expects to make less profit on any given investment. And that would tend, in so far as [assessing] restrictiveness, to offset the impact of accelerating inflation. S o  I really do believe under present circumstances that that kind of judgment is critical to policy, more so than a judgment--if I may put it this way without meaning it prejudicially--about a mechanical application of rules with regard to the aggregates. That's the more critical judgment now; it's essentially a judgment about the future economic outlook", " MR. WALLICH. I agree", " MR. BLACK. There has to be one in every group. I have more doubts than usual about the staff's forecast, which is really one of stagflation for eight or so quarters. I don't deny that there's a possibility that can happen, but to me the weight of past evidence suggests that we're more likely to get cumulative effects and slip into a recession [than to achieve] the kind of soft landing that the 4/17/79 -13- staff is projecting. My own feeling is that we\u2019re probably near the end of the current expansion and fairly close to a turning point. Inflation has [contributed to1 a pretty severe attrition, I think, of real incomes and wealth positions. We see some convincing signs of this in the behavior of consumer and residential outlays. Some people take comfort in the strength that appears to be developing in the investment sector of business, but that is a lagging indicator and I don\u2019t think we can take much comfort in that. I\u2019m more impressed with the scattered signs that are reported throughout the Redbook of lengthening delivery times, of some anticipatory inventory building, and a strong current preference of businesses for short-term versus long-term debt. When one talks to those in the business community there is an unusual unanimity in their views. They all seem to say that things are very good now, but they are scared as the devil about the future. I suppose that translates, Steve, into a belief that the real rate of return on capital is probably dropping. So, I think we\u2019ve arrived at the point in policy where we have to be seriously concerned about the steepness of the deceleration that is taking place in the rate of growth in the aggregates. Some slowing of the excessive growth that we experienced in 1976, 1977, and a good part of 1978 was clearly needed in an effort to have an effective anti-inflationary policy. I hoped we could bring the rate of expansion down, but at a more gradual rate of perhaps 1 to 1-1/2 percentage points a year. I thought it was the best way in which to wring inflation out of the economy and I still think so. But the deceleration that we\u2019ve experienced since September has not been gradual. Even after allowing for ATS, NOWs, and a likely downward shift in the demand for money, in my view this has been an overly steep decline. If this is allowed to continue, I think we risk aggravating any recession that may be impending. If my feeling that a recession is close at hand has any merit at all, then at this stage I think we have to face up to the question of whether we want to risk adding to its severity by reacting to the recent inflationary figures. I have doubts about [the wisdom of taking that risk] for two reasons. In the first place, I think we probably will see some abatement in inflation as a result of the past slowing in the aggregates. Secondly, I\u2019m not at all convinced that a severe recession would add significantly more to the reduction of inflation than a mild recession. And as a matter of political reality, if the recession is more serious than it otherwise might be, I think the political system is such that we\u2019re likely to have the kind of fiscal policy fallout that will aggravate inflation rather than help", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me make a couple of observations. I sit here listening to all this about the aggregates and it seems to me that the only reasonable conclusion is not to put much weight on the aggregates. We see relationships that go way out of the range of historical experience. We haven't any idea of the validity of the forecast [for the monetary aggregates], I'm afraid, and the combination of those two events does not make me want to linger over the aggregates. When I look at the outlook for real GNP, it does seem to me that the staff forecast of six quarters of approximately 1 percent growth in GNP per quarter is inherently improbable. I don't think that has ever happened", " Plus or minus 3 percent VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is precisely the difficulty. The reason they have come up with this forecast is that one doesn't know whether the 3 percent error will in fact be plus or minus. I must say in talking about projection errors that I am much more concerned about the persistent errors in the projections of the inflation rate than I am about the recent errors in the projections of the monetary aggregates. The inflation projections have been 4/17/79 -16- consistently on the low side. And I\u2018m not just talking about the staff\u2019s projections; I think that has been true of most forecasters. And [inflation] clearly remains our problem. In any longer-range or indeed shorter-range perspective, the inflationary momentum has been increasing. In terms of economic stability in the future that is what is likely to give us the most problems and create the biggest recession. And the difficulty in getting out of a recession, if we succeed, is that it conveys an impression that we are not dealing with inflation. I\u2019m afraid that is the impression that we are conveying. We talk about gradually decelerating the rate of inflation over a series of years. In fact, it has been accelerating over a series of years and hasn\u2018t yet shown any signs of reversing. I devoutly hope that it will in the second half of this year, but I think the staff is probably being too optimistic on what it will show in the normal course of events. I think the economy is essentially at full capacity and there is a real chance that the concern about a recession will be justified. But I also think there\u2018s some possibility we will have more of a boom for a longer period of time than we hope. I think it\u2018s clear that real interest rates are falling and the rate of inflation is up", " MR. WALLICH. I think we are in a very difficult situation. The real sector points down. Inflation points up. And the question is whether we can do anything about the downturn of the real sector without aggravating the inflation. I think the answer is no. It is very probable that a slowdown is ahead after four years of cyclical expansion. It would be really astonishing if we didn\u2018t get a cyclical peak after such a long expansion. The circumstances we observe are not those we\u2019ve seen at other peaks. Unemployment is still relatively high. Capacity utilization isn\u2018t all that high. But the economy has changed. Six percent [unemployment] is now what 4 or 4-1/2 percent used to be, and 84 or 85 percent capacity utilization is probably what 87 or 88 used to be after all the obsolescence in the capital stock that changing price relationships must have caused. S o  I think we have all the makings of a cyclical peak; we don\u2019t know whether we will descend into a recession or just a slowdown. I see no similarity, however, to 1974. There\u2019s no comparable buildup and there\u2019s no financial crunch. Meanwhile, inflation and inflation expectations are clearly mounting. I think something like 1/2 percent per month or every two months is being built into expectations. If I believe Art Okun, every 1 percentage point in the inflation rate costs $200 billion to remove by orthodox means, and I don\u2018t know of any other 4/17/79 -17- good means. I think that's greatly exaggerated, but I'd like to alert you to the very high cost, in terms of an inflation correction, we're incurring if all we're doing now is postponing that slightly. It is in any event probably inevitable. Actually, I think the choice we have is between a mild turndown now, in the second half of 1979, or a more severe one later after having suffered some more inflation. I don't think the choices are an obvious or foregone conclusion. As far as the aggregates are concerned, I don't need the aggregates at this time to tell me that the economy may be heading for a slowdown. I think the aggregates have become very weak because of what seems to be a shift in demand. I see that as plausible because the equations by which we're guided don't really encompass expectations of inflation of the kind that we now see, where expectations have moved from the 8 to 10 percent range to the 10 to 12 percent range. I think Paul is right that real interest rates have declined. In fact, they're probably no longer positive. And in a situation like the present, the only halfway plausible guide is to aim at positive real interest rates. I'm not even talking about after taxes because after tax real interest rates are very demonstrably negative except for nontaxable holders. So looking at this combination of a possibility of a downturn, or even of recession, and almost certainty continued inflation at an accelerating rate if we don't act, I come out for some tightening of monetary policy", " MR. MCINTOSH. Mr. Chairman, if one were to array the 8 or 10 most prominent forecasts, including the Greenbook forecast, clearly the Greenbook forecast with its rather heroic estimates of plus 1 percent real growth in six quarters would come up on the optimistic end of the array. Our own view is that we are heading toward a recession later this year, and that view is shared by most other forecasts. We don't see the case for tightening at this time, particularly since it doesn't buy us anything on the price front in 1979--and perhaps much of 1980--because of the lags. We think the choice is between easing or staying pat. Historically the Federal Reserve has had a tendency to overstay its policy at peaks and troughs, and itrs our fear that we're about to repeat that performance. Therefore, we would argue in favor of a modest move in the direction of ease at this time in the interest of moderating the impact of the recession that we're [expecting]", " John 4/11/19 -19- MR. BALLES. Just to add briefly, Mr. Chairman, to what I said before, we should not have a dilemma, especially for those of us who expect a downturn, hopefully mild, sometime this year and going into early 1980. Intuitively, one is tempted, of course, to tamp a bit harder on the credit brakes because of the recent news on inflation. Having taken a good hard look at what we might get out of that, I doubt if an increase in the funds rate would really give us any quick fix. Certainly it wouldn\u2019t do anything that I can see in the foreseeable future to affect the things that have been especially important in [causing] the recent increase in prices--namely what has been going on in food and in oil. And if we did increase the funds rate at the moment, given the lag that I think exists between such an action and [when] it flows through to the real world, it would be some time in 1980 before that would have much of an impact. Secondly, any move toward a further slowdown in money--looking at the other side now--I\u2018m afraid would simply exacerbate the recession that we probably are going to see in any event. The flattening out of retail sales for the past three months in my opinion suggests, as was said earlier around this table, that much of the growth in real GNP in the first quarter, modest as it was, was in the form of inventory accumulation. And while inventories don\u2019t appear to be out of line now, that picture, as I\u2018ve discovered to my sorrow many times before, can change very quickly if final sales remain weak. The recent slowdown in personal income growth and the heavy debt position of consumers suggest to me that we can\u2018t look to the consumer sector for any real strength over the balance of this year. The trend toward austerity-- if that\u2019s the right word for it--or less expansion in federal, state, and local government spending doesn\u2019t indicate that sector as a great source of strength in the year ahead. Although capital spending is now a source of strength, in my opinion it\u2019s simply too small and too volatile to support any broad-based increase in final sales. And I expect before this year is over [such capital spending will] be swamped by inventories going the other way. So given the outlook on the real side, to tighten monetary policy further now would, I fear, seriously risk the repetition of 1974. In my view the Fed held interest rates too high, too long, and certainly exacerbated that recession. Finally, I would add that the case for tightening to support the dollar is much weaker now than it was several months ago in view of what we heard earlier in the report from the Desk. There was good reason starting last November to adopt the [policy] that we did and I have no regrets about it. Now that the dollar is strong, I think there is more freedom to consider what we ought to be doing in view of the domestic outlook. So where I come out is strongly against any tightening and with some leaning toward a little easing. That\u2019s because of my personal view, as I said to Steve, that his estimates of monetary growth will be too high on both MI and M2 for the April-May period. That\u2018s too much restraint for me and I think it\u2019s going to make the recession somewhat worse", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, I\u2019m glad to get facts back into this [discussion1 ", " MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm at the end of the table and perhaps everything has been said. I look forward to these meetings. [I was pleased1 particularly this morning to learn that we have a new industry in Nebraska and they're apparently very persuasive if they can sell that shoe for $559 to Mark Willes. As for the Board staff's Greenbook forecast, we agree generally with it, with a bit of exception to a couple of areas. ~f you look carefully at it, they have a [rebound] in GNP in the second quarter which, as far as our staff can tell, does not have any basis other than a hope that GNP will increase to a more acceptable level in quarter two of 1979. Also, we'd suggest that housing starts and consumer spending may not be quite as strong as they're projecting. Thus, we would say that their forecast is a bit on the optimistic side, but [the difference] is narrow; we feel the economy might be just a bit weaker. Turning then to the aggregates, everything has been said about the aggregates. To be sure, all of them, including bank credit, have weakened measurably [even] with all the technical explanation that Steve has given. That, taken together with at least our outlook for the economy--and I think it would be true of the Board staff's outlook--the fact is that the restraint that has been put in place by monetary policy in the past is beginning to take effect. Looking forward to 1979, the risks certainly are on the down side. A recession--hopefully a moderate one--is quite likely sometime late in 1979 or early 1980. As for inflation, there's no question that it has been accelerating over the past months, but largely as a result of factors that we cannot control with monetary policy. That is, oil, food, and other such price increases will not be affected, at least in the short run, by anything we do here today. Thus, I would prefer that we stay where we are at the moment. I think a tightening would insure a recession. I don't think that's the way out. As a result, I'd stay where we are and be prepared to move to a bit easier stance if we find that, indeed, the economy in the second quarter is coming in somewhat weaker than the staff is forecasting and if the aggregates remain weak. I'd give greater emphasis to M2 than M1 because M1 does not seem to have much value at the moment. [Unintelligible] all of the measures are weak [andl so long as M1 remains weak with the rest, it seems to me we can throw it out and probably focus on M2 and bank credit a bit more. And I'd be prepared to move to a bit easier stance if the economy does indeed continue to be weak", " Phil MR. COLDWELL. MI. Chairman, the view of the world that you portrayed in your initial [comments] just doesn\u2018t happen to square with my view of what monetary policy can do nor with my belief in the desirability of public policy [moving] to restrain inflation. So I still would advocate that we put additional restraint in this package. I\u2019d prefer ranges of 2 to 7 percent for M1 and 3 to 8 percent for M2, and a federal funds intermeeting range of 10 to 10-1/2 percent", " MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, I would much prefer at this particular juncture to see [policy] cast in terms of a money market directive. I have trouble with these [Bluebook] ranges. I personally would not like to see them change, so I\u2019d like roughly 2 to 6 percent on M1 and 4 to 8 percent O h  M2. I would very much dislike having the fed funds rate drop below 10 percent during this intermeeting period. At the same time, I\u2018m not very anxious to see it move up very much-- maybe a shade to 10-1/8 percent with a range of perhaps 10 to 10-1/2. I\u2019m not a subscriber to such a narrow range, but in this environment it may flow reasonably well. So I\u2018d go with 10 to 10-l/2 percent with probably 10-1/8 at the moment", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. We have a range for the fed funds rate and now the question is, do we keep the present [rate] or move it up or down. You suggested we move down. Five other members of the Committee suggested the prevailing rate. And four others suggested going up, although Bones did not; he said 10-1/8 percent and that\u2019s where we are now, more or less", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, we need two 3 to 8 percent ranges--3 to 8 on M1 and on M2. That\u2019s the answer. Actually, we need 3 to 8-1/2 percent on M2. don\u2019t we. Or 4 to 8-1/2 percent. You all wouldn\u2019t stick with anything reasonable. You had to have all this individuality", " MR. PARTEE. An indication", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay. Bob Mayo, you had 3 to 7 and 4-1/2 to 8-1/2", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing, yes. Chuck, you had 4 to 8. You don\u2019t like 3 to 8. m. PARTEE. Well, I really do believe we ought to have something that brackets the path for getting back within the longer- run ranges", " The money market directive CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay. Bob", " MR. PARTEE. Yes. M S .  TEETERS. Yes", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. So it's four and five. What if we change it to an aggregates directive. Let's try again with an aggregates directive", " MR. BLACK. Yes", " MR. MAYO. Yes", " MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I\u2018m concerned about one bit of verbiage where reference is made to two possible policies. One says u.S. policy is aimed at countering short-run disorderly market conditions. Then there is explicit wording in the Morton-Truman memo which says that if U.S. policy is also designed to resist exchange market movements that carry the dollar\u2018s value beyond levels that are deemed to be reasonable in either direction, the United States might want to be prepared to accumulate substantial holdings. My question is this: In terms of the rules of the game that we are playing, are we contemplating going beyond just reacting to disorderly conditions and actually trying to peg [the value of the dollar]", " MR. PARTEE. Mr. Chairman, I have real concern about the Federal Reserve holding substantial foreign currency balances. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the appropriate thing for us to do. I\u2019ve never liked the idea of U.S. institutions in general holding large foreign balances. [It means they] aren\u2019t financing their primary activity of spending or investment or whatever it is. I think we have a swap system that is perfectly adequate; it was developed over time. I found the reasoning in both memos very strained as to what the advantages would be in terms of being able to operate without the blessing of the Bundesbank or whatever. That\u2019s because, in fact, when we spend marks--whether we borrow and spend them or we [hold them and] just spend them--the Germans are going to have the same liquidity problem. We\u2019re going to have the same tolerance of their sentiments as we would otherwise. Also, let me mention that we seem to get a good deal lower rate of return on these [balances], at least in the case of Germany and I guess Switzerland and [Japan]. I was interested to see that apparently my concern was shared by the framers of the Federal Reserve [Act] because both memos specify that the Federal 4 / 1 7 / 7 9  -38- Reserve Act says that it is against the law for the Federal Reserve to hold foreign currency securities", " MR. PARTEE. The one [reference] says government securities; the other doesn\u2019t. The other says foreign currency securities. Then [the memo1 goes on to say that we can get around the law. I don\u2019t think that\u2018s an appropriate thing for the Federal Reserve to do--to find a way to get around the law. If we have a need for relatively small working balances, that\u2018s one thing. But if we\u2018re going to develop [a program for1 large amounts of foreign currency holdings, that\u2019s another. I also noticed with interest that the memo from Messrs. Holmes and Pardee says on page 9 that a good cushion to begin with would be two or three days\u2018 worth of heavy intervention. That signals to me an intent here and a very possible threat of building up large balances. So I must say I oppose it", " MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, I don't resist the idea of building up a small kitty. I do have some resistance to the idea of an excessive amount in a single currency. So I think we ought to limit the amount in a single currency to a billion dollars, partly to limit potential exchange losses and partly to avoid pressures in terms of the currency status of some of these countries. Also, we ought to limit our holdings to major currencies. I'm certain that the Desk isn't going to play in or something like that, but I think we ought to have that well understood. I believe we need political and Treasury clearance and I assume that that will be done before we jump into any major stockpiling. We ought to have a slow rate of accumulation, assuming we don't have masses dumped on us, Alan. Then finally, I'm a little disturbed about what I hear in terms of intervention policy. [Under] the first of November ground rules, 4/11/79 -40- we're going to try to resist further downward movement [in the exchange rate of the dollar]. Well, now we have upward movement. Theoretically, I guess that first of November policy was established by somebody believing the dollar to be undervalued at that time. I don't know whether the dollar is valued correctly, overvalued, or undervalued now. But it seems to me that we ought to have some sort of policy that permits some rate increases along with increases in balances. We do not attempt to peg or limit changes in exchange rates. Those are my comments, Mr. Chairman", " And I think that reduces our ability to resist these other demands for the use of-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. I thought we were doing it so the crops would sell better abroad and maybe get more money on the farm. That\u2018s what I thought we were doing.

As you recall, prior to this surge in the aggregates, I spoke out at the last meeting for some ease because of my concern about the undershooting of the [MI] range. I do think that we should take it seriously, even though we don\u2019t know whether the present surge is temporary or not. There is some historical perspective. Last year at this time of the year the aggregates did surge upward and they then remained at a fairly level but higher [rate of growth] for a period of time, so I don\u2019t think we can ignore this. I would recommend that the Desk be authorized to use the full 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent range for the fed funds target and be prepared to permit the fed funds rate to move upward toward 10-1/2 percent in an orderly fashion. If this surge in the aggregates is temporary, then we can permit it once again to fall toward 10 [or even] 9.314 percent. So I think we ought to broaden the fed funds [movement] and use the full range and be flexible as we see how permanent the present surge turns out to be. CHARMAN MILLER.

KICHLINE. --on a real basis, which was about 10 months before the trough in economic activity. The peak in real terms [in the current cycle] would be December of 1978, so we've experienced four months of declining sales. But there are a number of major differences. One is the behavior of consumers. In that earlier period, the saving rate was considerably higher and consumers seemed much less willing to take on goods and spend as freely as they have this time around. So I'm a little disturbed about trying to make that comparison because of different consumer behavior. Secondly, though the energy situation was a bit similar as 1973 went on, that was a period when we had the storage situation by early 1974 combined with very rapid price increases. And it strikes us that at this point the situation is considerably different from what we experienced in 1973", " MR. BALLES. Jim, we've had this unexpected bad news for the first quarter in terms of real growth at about .4 percent. It's evident that real final demand actually declined and that what skimpy growth we had was in fact in inventories. In view of that and of the weak news we've gotten so far for the second quarter for those series for which we have data--1 don't think there's a single strong report out so far that I'm aware of--what is the case for a bounceback of real GNP in the second quarter. I must admit I'm getting pretty skeptical", " MR. KICHLINE. One major area to point to is business fixed investment. The first quarter was quite depressed in the construction area [but] the March numbers came roaring along with a bounceback. I would suspect that in the second quarter both shipments and, importantly, nonresidential construction activity will average substantially above the pace in the first quarter. That\u2019s one area. Housing may well turn out to be less of a negative in terms of expenditures in the second quarter compared to the first. It\u2018s not that I expect it to be rising and contributing to growth, but it may well be less of a drag on average for the quarter. Consumer spending, I think, is a very questionable area. We do anticipate a bounceback, but it is by no means a certainty. [If we don\u2019t begin to see that,] \u2019I would say that over time one would have to get concerned about that. State and local construction activity is also an area that was depressed in the first quarter due to weather effects. The evidence seemed to suggest a bit of an increase in March, but not a great deal. We are banking on the view that that sector will perform similarly to business fixed investment, particularly the construction part. The bounceback that we have forecast is nothing like that in the first quarter of 1978, when [GDP growth went from1 about zero to 9 percent. We\u2019re really talking about fairly small changes. Also, I think the infomation coming in has to be discounted to some extent. Industrial production is a clear case where we know the nature of some of the problems. But, as this [reported weakness] goes on, I\u2019d say one would have to be more concerned about the possibility of a weaker picture than a stronger one", " Frank MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say that I am pleased that Jim had such a good record last year because I have a very strong feeling that his record is not going to be as good in the next twelve months", " MR. MORRIS. It wasn't so good in the last twelve months. It seems to me that we have a classic cyclical decline; the [evidence] is almost overwhelming. And I think the latest piece of evidence that you cited--that there was a [big] decline in durable goods orders is the last straw. Now, the staff projection does assume--as it has all along--a 6 percent rate of growth in M1 adjusted for ATS, and we have not gotten that for seven months", " MR. KICHLINE. Sure. I'd make two comments. One is that in terms of a concern about the cyclical turn, I could perceive three possible scenarios right now. continued very strong growth that presses against resource availability and intensifies inflation. I would say that the information coming in tends to weaken that case, if not remove it. The second possibility is that we have a situation with serious distortions and one would anticipate either a deep or a prolonged One is that we will have a situation of I 5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -11- contraction in activity. I don't think we have those sorts of distortions. So what I am left with then is the middle course, which we believe is reasonable at this time; it involves small real growth. Now, whether or not that will turn out to be a technical recession in the sense of two consecutive negative quarters, where those negatives are very small, is not really a big issue as far as we're concerned. It's the general pattern of what happens that is important, and we think the economy is in for that kind of period of small real growth. But it may well slip into a mild contraction in the technical sense. With regard to the monetary aggregates, one of the things we have been getting that we did not anticipate is a further downward shift in the money demand function. So what we have in effect with the slower growth of the aggregates is interest rates that have been about on track with our forecast for some time. In addition, we've assumed that the rate of growth for M1 at 6 percent adjusted for ATS was over a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter period so that if there were shortfalls we would get back within the ranges and stay on track. Hence, to the extent there was a difficulty, we assumed it would be very short-lived and we'd have a resurgence of growth", " They have a heavier weight in the CPI and I think the difference in MR. WALLICH. It does make a difference whether the rate of inflation was 10 percent or 13 percent over the last three months, even if we give it the usual Federal Reserve discount", " Nancy MS. TEETERS. Have you evaluated the economic impact of sharply rising interest rates, Jim. Have you looked at what the Wall Street Journal or [people on] Wall Street have said. Suppose the prime rate went to 13 percent. What would be the effect of that on your forecast. M R .  KICHLINE. Well, if it went to 13 percent, one would have to ask why. If it went to 13 percent because all these numbers are wrong and we have a rip-roaring economy under way, that's a different situation than if it went to 13 percent as a result of policy actions. But I don't see a rip-roaring economy in the cards. Given available information, I'd presume we'd be talking about a substantial increase in the funds rate to get the prime to 13 percent. And I think we would be talking about a substantial downward push on real activity over the period ahead and some improvement in our inflation forecast-- but for the time period of a year and a half, relatively little on the inflation side", " MS. TEETERS. My other question is: Is there a reason for the peculiar pattern that you have on real disposable income. It seems to have a quarterly pattern that comes and goes", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Mark. John. M R .  BALLES. Well, when I asked the question of Jim Kichline about what the case is for a bounceback in the second quarter, I probably tipped my own hand as to my increasing skepticism. I'm afraid that what I see is pretty much what Bob Mayo sees in terms of a probable cyclical peak in this quarter. As a matter of fact, our forecast for some time has been showing a short, shallow recession beginning in the second half of this year and going into the first quarter of 1980. But that's obviously just as judgmental as yours, Jim, and I don't know that it's any better than yours. Nevertheless, it is different. The recent news that has come in for the second quarter when we were expecting what I mistakenly called a bounceback and was corrected by the Chairman--it's more of a little hop, if anything--gives me some real concern. This is the time in the business cycle when we could get some very unpleasant surprises. We certainly got one in the first quarter and I would be prepared to see one in the second quarter, I'm afraid. 5/22/79 -18- As for what to make of this troublesome development whereby bank credit has been growing more rapidly than the aggregates, our staff has recently updated their analysis in that area. I must say, after looking at it, that I don't really think the strong growth of bank credit proves very much. If we look back at earlier cycles, we find that bank credit tends to be more or less coincident with the cycle. That was certainly true in the '73-'74 recession where the deceleration of monetary growth preceded the peak in that business cycle and the formal recession by quite a few months. bank credit would accelerate at this time in the cycle. Corporate liquidity is down, as Steve has correctly pointed out, and corporations wish to avoid locking themselves into high long-term rates. Hence, they turn to their banks for credit accommodation and try to wait out the period of high rates and plan to do some funding when long-term interest rates are coming down. So on balance I'm really not impressed at all by the fact that bank credit has been growing faster than the monetary aggregates. It peaks very shortly before a downturn. There are all sorts of reasons why During April we fought the \"battle of the bulge,\" as I call it, on M1. It is said to have gone up at a 11 percent annual rate. [But] as the staff knows well, in view of the history of earlier Aprils, in our monetary theories it's tremendously difficult to compute seasonal factors for the month of April. I sympathize with the staff on this. But 17 percent could later turn out to be 8-1/2 percent or something like that. If we look at Aprils of preceding years, seasonal factor corrections have been made following the benchmark revisions and have involved some pretty [big] downward revisions. Whether that will occur for this April remains to be seen. But it's probably the most unreliable month in the year in terms of getting a good fix on what is really happening. Since the May figures as now projected by the staff--correct me if I'm wrong, Steve--show a 1 percent rate of growth for M1 and a 5.4 percent rate for M2. I wonder if it isn't time to unwind the snugging up of the funds rate that we did in April. We were leaning against what at that time appeared in the best judgment of the staff to be a bulge in the money supply. In view of the figures that we already have for April and those projected for May I wonder if we should inch the federal funds rate downward a bit. In short, based on my perceptions of spreading weaknesses in the economy and on the long cumulative impact of monetary growth well below the target range, even considering the April figures--and with May coming in on the weak side and the June projections weak--in my opinion this is no time to be snugging up any further. If anything, I would lean toward reversing the April action on the funds rate. That's all, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I, too, missed the turn in Steve's comments. I thought it was [going to be a recommendation] to lean more on the aggregates and he winded up [suggesting] a wider range on the aggregates", " MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to see the slowing in the economy. I've been hoping for it for a year. I think we're getting some reduction in the level of activity and I hope it continues for a while longer. I think we need to look at our basic objectives here because we have a problem of whether we are aiming to maintain a semblance of real growth or to contain inflation or a combination thereof. It seems to me that our current posture has some elements of restraint but those elements of restraint are coming in the housing field, largely in the usury ceilings and the thrift flows, which of course are the traditional ways. I think we run a risk on two sides. We run a risk of recession, of course, and we run a risk of some acceleration in inflation. The latter stems primarily from what I'd call an energy tax, because we are being hit with a very sizable tax thrown at us by energy costs. I suspect we can weather the food cost problem, especially to the extent that we can open up our borders to further imports, if there is anything to bring in. But I don't think the energy cost impact is going to go away and it is going to [spread] throughout our economy. You may recall the last time around that it took several months if not a year or more [for the energy shock] to [exert] its full impact. I suspect that the retail sales picture is giving us the signal that things are being slowed by energy costs and agricultural or food costs. Frankly, I welcome the slowdown. I'd prefer it hadn't come from further energy cost increases, but maybe over the long haul this will do us a favor and force us into some actions we should have taken six or seven years ago. A s  for our monetary policy posture, I still believe that inflation will be our principal problem in the coming months and years. Whether we can achieve a reduction in inflation by a nice slow 5/22/79 -21- pattern is something we have not yet proved. I suspect it's going to require more strenuous efforts than have been mounted so far", " MR. WALLICH. I share Phil Coldwell's feeling. I think we're in some danger of excessive preoccupation with the business cycle. rt matters much more whether we come down from I percent to .4 percent growth than whether we go from .4 to -1 or -2 percent. So in that sense an important move is already behind us. I think inflationary expectations have increased substantially in the last quarter. The leading models have raised their projections of inflation for the next two years by about 1 percentage point. And as we know, we've always been below on our projections. I think we're now building inflation into the economy to a degree that we've never had it; consumer behavior shows that. We also have evidence that inflation in the American economy is much less variable than it is in other countries and is, therefore, much harder to bring down. what we see in our own forecast is that at best we have to look forward to a period of a very slow deceleration of inflation. I think that will be regarded as unsatisfactory. And I expect that this situation is going to cause us to adopt wage and price controls sometime this year or next year. people are sufficiently excited about the inflation and sufficiently disenchanted with the actions in the fiscal and monetary fields. If we don't succeed in bringing inflation down, then the predictable pattern is that after a mild dip we'll go into a renewed expansion starting from an inflation base of 8 to 10 percent, whereas last time we started at 5 percent. And that will land us in an area where not even Italy is today. We are now the country with the most inflation among the major countries except Italy, I believe. As far as monetary policy is concerned, I think we still believe that somehow there's a free lunch--that we can accomplish our objective of reducing inflation at no cost--and I believe that's no longer true. We will have some costs, either in terms of much more inflation or in terms of reduced economic activity and a less than soft landing. I agree with Steve that real interest rates are falling; and that I think is the basic stance of monetary policy. We are [now] accommodating an external shock from food and oil. It's no longer the view of the economics profession that external shocks should always be accommodated, but our policy is doing that. It's not surprising, therefore, that in the ranking of inflation fighters we find ourselves near the bottom of the scale, as the Redbook among other things shows. As is obvious from my remarks, I would urge a tightening, even though it is late in the game. I think the impact on the real sector would be very slight. The real sector is going its own way with little benefit from monetary policy. [A tightening] will have some favorable effect on expectations. I think we have to look at interest rates at this time. The aggregates have become so unstable; for six months there has been no growth [in M11 and then we get 17 percent in one month. Why should we allow our funds rate decisions to be triggered by that kind of mechanism. So I would agree with Steve to have a wider range--1 think that is fine--and a money market target, with a rise immediately in the rate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " 5/22/79 -22- VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have heard a great deal of wisdom even without our getting around the rest of the table, Mr. Chairman. I\u2019m not sure it has yet resolved all of the uncertainties in my own mind. I do share a lot of the feeling that has just been expressed about inflation; I think we tend to duck that issue. Something was said earlier about there not being much precedent for bringing down the rate of inflation rapidly. I\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t much precedent for bringing it down slowly over a number of years either, which is a measure of the difficulty of our problem. I\u2019m impressed by the degree that inflation is now built into thinking in terms of the business outlook. I\u2019m also impressed--the supporting factor--by the degree with which capacity problems and backlogs exist. But certainly the outlook is uncertain. The recent news hasn\u2019t been very buoyant. So I would conclude that the time is not very propitious for much of a change in either direction. There\u2019s a fair amount of time before our next meeting", " MR. PARTEE. Well, I come to exactly the opposite conclusion that Steve did. I think we ought to pay careful attention to the aggregates and the growth in the aggregates in the period ahead. I\u2019d widen the range on the funds rate and guard to see that we don\u2019t have undue weakness in the aggregates. There\u2018s a good chance that the turn has already occurred in the economy, that March will have been the high in industrial production and that the second quarter--and we\u2019re two-thirds through the second quarter--will be the high in real terms. 5/22/79 -23- There is a very good chance that that's true. We've always, with no exception that I can recall, had great difficulty keeping the aggregates growing in the early stages of a recession. To go to an interest rate target now at this turning point in the economy would be exactly the wrong prescription for the Committee to follow. S o ,  I would say that we ought to have an aggregates target with modest growth. What we ought to do to fight inflation is to see that we have only modest growth in the aggregates over a sustained period of time, not crunch the economy into what--1 agree with Frank--could be a very serious recession. I think we could be in a much more serious recession this year than the one in '74-'75. So I would like to see quite modest growth in the aggregates over a sustained period, and I think that probably means that we ought to have a wider funds rate range. If I could echo what was said I guess by John Balles, it may be that a somewhat lower funds rate would be consistent with the discount rate", " MS. TEETERS. I find it interesting that everyone is saying that they agree with the staff projection but we're all, almost to a person, talking recession for the first time. I don't see the strength from the consumer side to keep [the economy] going at the rate that is being projected by the staff. These low levels of disposable personal income are such that they won't support an expansion in that range. In essence, I think we have accomplished much of what we started out to do last fall, which was to slow the growth in nominal GNP. Now, it came out of real growth and not inflation, but that shouldn't surprise any of us given the action by OPEC. I also think a move to tighten at this time is just out of the question as far as the domestic economy is concerned. And it would be the wrong prescription for the international situation; I think it would make things worse in trying to keep the [exchange] values of the yen, the mark, the Swiss franc, and the dollar all together. Evidence of further tightening here would just lead to a further appreciation of the dollar in the international market. However, I'm not quite ready to back down [completely]. little. And the only reason I think we should move [the funds rate] down a bit is that it's six weeks until the next [meeting]. I believe the rest of the information coming in over the quarter is going to be poor. But we do have our telephone network. Consequently, I would recommend staying where we are and, if anything, I would probably widen the fed funds range. And if I understand it, I can understand why [Steve was] calling for a widening of the ranges on the monetary aggregates", " MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, I sense a growing ugly mood in our society. I don't know whether the reaction is going to be in the political sector or in the economic sector or in the racial area, but I suspect it won't be a moderate reaction. So I think we are in for some rather volatile times ahead that could throw these estimates off, but I certainly don't want to predict them. My feeling would be that this is not the time to tighten. But in view of the uncertainties and the inflation problem and other problems, I would say that we would be well advised to stay where we are in terms of the current status of policy. I would favor a slight increase in the discount rate because of the position of the banks; the inviting differential there is hard for them to resist", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Henry. Ernie M R .  BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would prefer alternative B as specified in the Bluebook and with an aggregates directive", " MS. TEETERS. Do we have another month coming up like April, where we don't know what the seasonals are", " MR. BALLES. I've wrestled with Steve's compromise because I have great respect for his recommendations. When everything is said and done, I do like a couple of things he recommended. I like the money market directive and the widening of the ranges. But to be true to my own convictions with respect to M1, I really have to be in favor of a 1 to 5 percent range and on M2 5 to 10 percent. The lower number of 5 percent is with a view to not driving [M21 further below our long-range target. On the federal funds range, my preference would be 9-112 to 10-112 percent with an immediate move to 10", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. It's another one of those months. Looking at fed funds, six voting members have indicated a preference for leaving the fed funds rate at 10-114 percent. Of those, four want to have the range at 10 to 10-112. Two members want to move the rate immediately down to 10 percent and one wants to move it immediately up to 10-1/2 percent. Those who want to move down to 10 percent also want a range of 9-112 to 10-112 percent. And Governor Wallich wants to move the range up to 10-114 to 10-314 percent. As far as [preferences on] the ranges go, there's a mix. [For Ml] zero is the bottom on five of them. There are ones and minus ones. I don't know if we can synthesize this or not. It looks easier to do the fed funds range than the aggregates ranges", " MR. ALTMA\". President Balles. PRESIDENT BALLES. No", " MR. PARTEE. I can't support it", " MR. BLACK. I cannot [agree to it], Mr. Chairman, if I interpret it correctly that this would mean we would raise the federal funds rate if M1 started coming in at 3-112 percent. That would be a tightening. If we had a money market directive on the top and an aggregates directive on the bottom, I could live with it a lot better. I would not want to tighten", " Anyway, Bob, your sentiment would be-- MR. BLACK. I would vote against that, Mr. Chairman. As I interpret an aggregates directive, this is much tighter on the top side and it's easy on the down side. I'm more concerned about the weakness in the economy and I wouldn't want to tighten that soon", " MR. PARTEE. No, I don't. I'd rather cut the funds rate to 10 percent right now, so I feel unhappy if I'm not permitted to do that. I would rather [vote against] the directive if that is not called for", " MR. PARTEE. Especially with a I-week interval", " MR. WALLICH", " Now we have reinvestment facilities for-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. They can deny [us the use of] these investment facilities", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes, but that creates all kinds of [complications]. We\u2018ve already agreed not to [do] that, so it\u2019s more complicated. There is no problem on the 4.1 billion, which just brings the Treasury back to where it was on November 1. The policy memo presented sets forth the recommendation of our task group that we authorize the Federal Reserve System to hold up to $2 billion in foreign currencies concentrated in the principal currencies of DM, yen, and Swiss francs, with no more than $1 billion in any one currency and only relatively modest holdings of any other currencies that might be useful in transactions. Now, as for the Germans, as far as I know we have no understanding or commitment to accumulate balances at the moment for the Federal Reserve", " MS. GREENE. Yes, Henry, I'm afraid we do need that. We've come into a tremendous amount of paperwork problems, particularly when the proportions are so tight as 10 percent and 20 percent", " I didn\u2018t want to-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. Yes, Paul", " MR. COLDWELL. M r .  Chairman, I'm agreeable to the Committee approach [outlinedl in this memo. I would be much less happy with the Japanese approach because I'm not at all convinced that the Japanese yen is undervalued and I'm not at all sure I want to jump into a joint intervention for the purpose of improving the Japanese yen position", " That is, when a currency is declining as sharply as ours did last year, it ought to be up to the country involved-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. I'm laughing because all during the year up until November 1 we said it was up to the foreigners to straighten out the dollar", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. The maximum is $2 billion in any case, but the question is whether you want a maximum of $1 billion per currency or $500 million", " MR. BALLES. I share Chuck's view. I have real reservations about going up to $2 billion, based on a very skeptical attitude regarding decisions on what constitutes excessive movements one way or another vis-a-vis what the market is saying. I'd keep it where it is", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. May I come back with an argument", " MR. KIMBREL. Yes", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, I would like to give that authority but we [now] have the limit so small", " We are making an exception to the 5 / 2 2 / 7 9  -46- CHAIRMAN MILLER. This would be for yen [only]; and no yen would be held under the other policy", " MR. PARTEE. And a couple of hundred million for the Treasury, so it's about $1", " MR. PARTEE. Well, I know. On the other hand they've had quite a decline in their currency. So, yes", " MR. WALLICH. Yes"], "1979FOMC19790627confcall.txt": ["] MR. ZEISEL. We have a number of indications that the current quarter and the remainder of the year will be weaker than we had been anticipating. Consumer demand has been particularly hard-hit. Retail sales have been sluggish all year; in real terms, they were down more than 5 percent from December to May. Major factors have been the weaker growth in employment and income and the effects of inflation. More recently, gas shortages appear to have affected demand adversely, with widespread reports of reduced sales. We don\u2019t have retail sales figures for June as yet, but domestic auto sales in the first 20 days were at a 7-112 million annual rate, down from 8-1/4 million in May and 9.1 million in the first quarter. There are also signs that business fixed investment may be losing momentum. Shipments of capital goods in the past two months were below the Q1 average in real terms. Construction activity is generally less ebullient and truck sales have weakened substantially. Some of this may be strike- related, but the recent drops in capital goods orders and in commitments for commercial and industrial construction suggest something more fundamental. Housing activity continues sluggish. Starts rose somewhat in May--by a little more than 5 percent to 1.8 million--but the slight rebound was entirely in the erratic multifamily category. Single-family starts edged down further and housing activity remains well below the 2.1 million rate recorded in the fourth quarter. It appears that we may be getting some inventory backup as a result of weaker demand. Book value inventory figures were up sharply in April ($64.7b), particularly in manufacturing ($39b) and in autos and trade ($lob). Auto stocks rose sharply further in May--by about 6 percent. Again, some of this may have reflected strikes. The price picture remains bleak. Despite a more moderate food price rise, the CPI was up 1.1 percent in May, with very sharp increases for gasoline and fuel oil--up 5 percent--as well as for homeownership costs and new car prices. The price of gasoline in May was 20 percent--not an annual rate--above the December price. With larger energy price rises now in prospect and upward pressure on grain prices as a result of crop conditions 6/27/19 2 in the USSR, it appears that we can look for little easing of inflation late1 this year. On balance, a small negative GNP appears in the cards for the current quarter. With the deterioration of consumer attitudes, further price rises, and a likely weakening of business spending, somewhat larger declines in GNP over the new few quarters have also become increasingly likely. That concludes my remarks. [Secretary\u2019s note: The staff briefings ended with a report by Mr. Axilrod", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. So we will hear about that fairly soon. Now, let me give you a personal reason why I thought this consultation was particularly necessary and appropriate. We have the usual [policy] dilemma between international and domestic conditions. We have a situation where our dollar policy of maintaining a stable dollar and an orderly market is [being tested], and so far we have responded to that solely with intervention. Another way to respond to it would be by monetary action that would open up the interest rate dlfferentials in favor of the dollar. This could be done by a move to tighten by raising the federal funds rate and symbolically by an increase in the discount rate. On the other hand, we have a domestic economy where I think as a result of the energy situation--with the revolution in Iran and the interruption of oil supplies--it appears that a very significant increase in inflation [is in prospect] for 1979 and 1980. And a corresponding decrease in real economic activity in the United States, which we probably could not have predicted last fall or earlier this year, [seems likely]. With that weakness, and particularly the 6/21/19 3 inflationary aspects of [the current situation], the relation of money to nominal activity comes into question. So we have to consider what the appropriate course is for policy in order to [achieve] the economic [outcome] that we would like to see. Obviously, thoughts have been [expressed about] whether we should try to defend the dollar by taking monetary action and what the price and other consequences of that would be on domestic activity. That could send us into more serious difficulties. Let me just go around and ask each of you whether you have any suggestions or thoughts on this. Do you feel that we should stay on an even keel, [maintain] a daily and hourly watch, and keep in close touch or that we should be doing something now. I\u2019ll start down the list of members and then call on all the other participants. Paul Volcker, do you have any particular thoughts", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Roger. Frank Moms. M R .  MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I think we\u2019re agreeing for different reasons. The evidence suggests to me that the economy peaked in March and that we\u2019re now in the third month of a recession, the depth of which will be influenced by the energy problem. But I don\u2019t agree with Chuck Partee that it was caused by the energy problem. I think the seeds of the recession were sown before the energy issue reached its current prominence. But quite clearly the energy problem means that there is a potential for a more severe recession than anyone is currently forecasting. Therefore, I think the next move for monetary policy ought to be toward ease, but given the kind of growth rates we\u2019re seeing in the aggregates and the weakness of the dollar in the foreign exchange markets obviously now is not the time. But if my feeling about the economy turns out to be correct, the strength in the aggregates will likely be a short-term phenomenon. As a growing perception of weakness in the economy develops, the dollar will strengthen in the foreign exchange markets. And when these two things happen, then I think we should turn our attention to mitigating the seventy of the recession", " MR. AXILROD. Well, President Moms, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t be very enlightening. [The bulge] has been very widespread [across M1 components] in June and we don\u2019t have any particular special factor that would literally account for it in that particular month. U.S. government deposits have risen and have not declined [subsequently]. At least in April they declined a little but in June they\u2019re showing a rather substantial increase. So that factor, which you and I have disputed over the years as to whether it has any effect, if it had an effect it is in the wrong direction"], "1979FOMC19790711meeting.txt": [" CHAIRMAN MILLER. Before we start on the agenda, I have the sad duty of having to call to your attention what I consider to be a serious and recurring matter. And that is that somehow the tradition and what I consider commitment to keep the deliberations of the Federal Open Market Committee confidential is being breached each month. Yesterday, we had The Wall Street Journal saying that it was learned from sources that at our last meeting, in May, two members of the Committee called for tightening the credit spigot. The article mentions \"sources.\" And this is a different reporter [than last time]. And as I've said, my experience is that reporters don't cite sources unless they've talked to someone in the organization. This is to me a recurrence of what we talked about last time and it is very, very disturbing. It's spreading to [discussion of] the attitudes of international bankers. Henry, we've just had a report that \"sources\" tell us what the central bankers in the BIS [meetings] talk about and how they instruct the United States on monetary policy. I consider that inappropriate. I wonder if we should bring that to the attention of the Chairman [of the BISI", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, the quote in the newspapers is that sources from that meeting were telling us what our monetary policy should be and were telling what was discussed in the [BISI meeting", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. I think we ought to get the clippings and perhaps call it to the attention of Chairman Zjlstra and see if we can't tighten up those procedures. I just don't think it is appropriate to go to the BIS and discuss in confidence our policies and have people go outside and start saying confidentially off the record--but for publication, just not for [attribution]--this is what we discussed. This article says that sources noted what was talked about and the United States was urged to do a, b, and c. I just don't think that's proper. This is just one; there were other articles in other newspapers. 7/11/19 -2- I would again ask members of the FOMC to give their attention to this. What is wrong with our system. Why are we getting sources quoted in the newspaper. In this case, [the leak] could be from the people attending or it could be from people who have seen the directive or the draft of the minutes because this is actually an accurate statement. But it indicates that people who are reporting to [the press] have access to the FOMC meetings or its documents. So what do we do. Do we change the way we distribute the drafts [and] the directives. Do we have to go through some educational process. Do we have to restrict attendance. What do we have to do. I won\u2019t ask for your answer now, but I wish you would give this serious consideration. This seems to be a trend and if we continue to ignore it, I think it will be read in the System as a new policy where anybody can go out and give their personal appraisal [of policy deliberations and decisions]. A lot of egos will be appealed to by the press and we will have an endless problem. Well, to turn to the meeting itself, we need first to approve the minutes of the actions taken at the last meeting on May 22. I think those have been circulated. Are there any corrections or additions. If there are none, we will record them as approved and we will turn to Scott Pardee for a report on foreign currency operations since the meeting of May 22", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Larry", " MR. ROOS. Scott, you mentioned \"fundamentals\" at the end of your report. Isn't the recent expansion of the aggregates, and its portending a less than effective determination to deal with inflation, very fundamental regardless of energy and these other things. Doesn't that come into the minds of these traders", " MR. MAYO. Did you answer the question", " I don't think the MR. COLDWELL. Is this true of all the dealers", " MR. WALLICH. I wonder, Jim, whether your estimates of future inflation and wage increases couldn't be considerably low. This, of course, has been our experience all along. Here we have 13 percent CPI inflation and somehow we seem to assume that that has a minimal, maybe 1 percent, effect on compensation. That seems to me to imply a very strong effect on wages from rising unemployment and really a very tough government fiscal and monetary policy", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You haven't even got much of that. M R .  ZEISEL. True, we don't get much of that because of the inflation effect, but we get some--possibly an $8 billion swing in that direction in 1980. But, as I pointed out earlier, we perceive this--other than the OPEC effects--as being a rather sluggish slide into a softer economy without the kind of major distortions that were in place in 1973, preceding that [recession]. And it seems to us that under those circumstances, there is the potential for not only a moderate decline but the beginnings of recovery as well, in business fixed investment for example. We get some help also from the net export side, as Ted Truman mentioned earlier. I might point out, though, as you are no doubt aware, that the recovery we are talking about is about as sluggish as the recession we have predicted. We are talking about a fairly protracted period of very little growth; in a sense it's what we were projecting a couple of months ago overlaid by the effect of the OPEC price increases pushing consumption down and bringing the level down to below where we had it before", " MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I suppose 1'11 get the same answer to this question, but it seems to me that the interest rate pattern projected is not very believable in the sense that the staff is suggesting under alternative B that we could maintain a 6 percent rate of growth in M1 with only a very modest decline in the fed funds rate to 9-1/2 percent at the low point. If this were to occur, it would be the only recession that I can recall, large or small, in which we were able to maintain money growth during the recession with very little change in the fed funds rate. And I find that a little incredible", " MR. WILLES. Thank you, M r .  Chairman. Jim, implicit in your inflation forecast on the table in the last sheet of the handout and, in fact, explicitly in your responses to Larry and Chuck, is a belief that there is a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. Can you tell me what data there are in the last decade that make you think that such a tradeoff even exists. M R .  KICHLINE. There\u2019s very little. I know that most people like to believe the short-run Phillips curve is dead. The Board\u2018s model essentially has that construction and it\u2018s one of the few models that has worked very well on both prices and unemployment in the last year. If we as a staff had believed it, we would have been right on [the mark] in terms of the inflation forecast and also the strength of unemployment. It\u2019s a very difficult area. Frankly, I think one has to look at information from a variety of sources. I do, in fact, believe that there is a tradeoff. At the same time, I believe that expectations are very important. And what will happen in 1980 hinges very importantly, I think, on inflationary expectations, confidence, and market structure. It\u2019s difficult to model those sorts of things. So the tradeoff that I think is still there may be waning, frankly. But until there\u2019s very strong evidence to the contrary, I would still believe that one has to sacrifice some real performance to get much improvement in prices using aggregate demand management policy", " MR. KICHLINE. The monetary policy assumption that we have maintained in this forecast is the same as the one that has been running for the last several months. S o ,  with higher prices in effect and the same nominal rate of growth of M1, you are implicitly running a tighter policy and not permitting a complete validation of OPEC price increases. So it\u2019s a maintenance of the same policy despite an exogenous change in the price outlook", " MR. COLDWELL. Well, it\u2019s a bit difficult for me to accept that on face value, given the rate of change in M1 in the first quarter of the year versus the rate of change in M1 now and the changes in the OPEC and [other] price structures that have been developing over the first half of this year", " MR. MAYO. Jim, I have a little problem with your statement that one of the reasons the recession may be milder this time, or that we won\u2019t have a great problem this time, is that there might not be an identity this time of recession abroad and here. I would take some issue with the latter statement. Some of the tea leaves tell me--and it\u2018s more than tea leaves, I guess--that we may be forced into a situation again with an identity of recession throughout the free world, not just here. That would tend to make me a little more worried about the shallow saucer projections. Also, although this gets into the financial side, I would say that while we don\u2019t have REITS this time, there is much more concern about the volume of foreign bank loans by American banks at this point and whether we are getting too close to the saturation point on handling the recycling of the 80 percent increase in OPEC prices. This gives me an additional concern that hasn\u2019t been mentioned here yet", " MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, as I indicated earlier, I think we're facing a bigger recession than the staff has projected, primarily because of the consumer sector. When Jim talked about the other sectors that were not as vulnerable, he neglected to suggest that we have a major sector that is more vulnerable. And that is the consumer sector, where the debt burdens of the consumer are substantially higher than they were going into the '74 recession. The staff's projections show that the bulk of the consumer adjustment is already behind us in the second quarter and that hereafter the consumer is going to play a pretty much neutral role in the recession. That's where I would differ. I think we are going to see a rising saving rate. We are beginning to see it now; we've been very surprised to see in the last few weeks an upturn in ordinary savings accounts after a long period of steady decline. So I think the move toward a higher saving rate has already started. I believe we could see the unemployment rate go as high as 9 percent next year rather than the 8 percent the staff has projected. In my view that would be counterproductive to the long-run anti-inflation fight. If we have that big a recession, the hope of keeping some constraint on fiscal policy is going to be diminished, inevitably. postpone my comments on what we ought to do in the short term. As far as the long-term ranges are concerned, I would be happy with Steve's proposals", " I find Mark's assertion congenial and I-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. You're not going to prove it either", " MR. WILLES. We are prepared to prove it", " MR. MAYO. Yes, I think it can be proved, but I will make the same caveat that Mark did. Although the staff forecast is a reasonable one, I find myself a little more pessimistic. I am concerned about both the likelihood of less real growth and more 1/11/19 -21- inflation. I really feel at this point that if we can beat 12 percent this year we will be lucky on the inflation side. I think we will improve on that next year, but I don't hold much hope for getting materially under 12 percent for this year as a whole. Having said that, and having agreed with Mark's basic assertion, I find the 3 to 6 percent range for M1 this year a pretty good range. I wouldn't change that. For next year, if we have to do something--which we do-- intellectually I would say that we should widen the range and make it 2 to 7 percent. I would go the other direction from some of the others. But I don't think it is a practical approach", " MR. MAYO. I am talking about the second line in the material distributed--the \"M1 measure,\" as it is called here", " MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I think it's perhaps difficult to quarrel with the staff projection for the economy. But our independent look at the same figures they apparently are looking at--with some of the assumptions different, however--would suggest that we may have a bit less strength in the economy than in the staff projection, particularly starting in the 3rd quarter and running on into the 4th quarter. And just to throw another variable into it, there is a very good possibility that we will be facing an auto strike starting in September or sometime in early October, and that could further weaken retail sales and thus turn the economy down further than even we would project. Secondly, we would have some quarrel with what I believe to be the staff's assumption that there will be no substantial inventory reduction. We believe that there may be one--short-lived to be sure, but nonetheless rather sharp. With those very few exceptions to the staff's forecast, it seems to me as far as policy is concerned that monetary policy has to work against the inflationary aspects of our economy, much as Mark Willes has described essentially. On the other hand, in view of the weakness of the economy that I have just described, it doesn't seem to me that we should go overboard even through the remainder of 1979. I would also suggest that the chances are that we will not get the growth in the aggregates, particularly M1, at the midpoint [unintelligible]. Thus I have no reason to quarrel with Steve's suggestion for the ranges for 1979. And to agree with Bob Mayo, I don't understand the exercise for 1980. So what Steve has suggested is perfectly all right", " Well, I thought earlier that you-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. I thought I said it would put us back by adding to inflation; we start from a higher base. M R .  ROOS. Well, all right. Specifically, I believe that inflation is still our most serious problem. If we are able to signal to the world that we are determined to do something about inflation, I think that will have a very real and salutary effect on our dollar exchange problem. I think it will stimulate much needed capital investment in this country. So, I think our number one long-term objective must be to wind down inflation on a gradual basis. I find the alternative C scenarios preferable, both in terms of the policy for the remainder of this year and for 1980, assuming we can--and I believe we can if we want to--in a very real manner affect money growth. I don't think we [ought] merely to respond to how money grows due to something that people outside of this room do. If we hold money growth--and perhaps this involves a widening of the fed funds range, which I know is heresy--close to the midpoint of the alternative C ranges, I think we will have struck a real blow for freedom. I think we can do it and that would be my preference, sir", " MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, for some months we have felt that a turning point was near and I think we would buy what seems to be the consensus forecast, or the assessment that we have passed that point. So far as severity is concerned, I think the developments in the petroleum market do strongly enhance the possibility that this could be a worldwide downturn. And if this is true, I think our downturn may well be more severe than the staff is projecting. I would also add to that Frank Morris's fear that the consumer will be another source of weakness here. So, given our inflationary problem and the recent emergence of the downward pressure on the dollar, we of course have to be very careful in trying to cope with this downturn. In particular, we have to avoid any conclusion on the part of the markets here or abroad that we have thrown in the towel on inflation. I would be especially concerned if the downturn did turn out to be an international [one]. I'm remembering back to '15 and ' I 6  when the recovery began and Japan and Germany opted for a slower recovery than we did and we pumped in more money in late 'I1 and ' 7 8 ;  I think that has exacerbated the problem we have had with the dollar. In a similar situation I think we can count on the Germans, the Japanese--maybe with a change in government--the British, and the Canadians too, to exert more restraint in trying to come out of the recession. If that scenario should develop, and if we adopt overly 7/11/79 -25- vigorous anti-recession policies, we could have a very, very serious foreign exchange situation. So when we get to the long-run part of [our decision], I think what Steve has suggested is just about what we view as appropriate. We had slightly different figures in mind. We agree that we ought to adjust the old targets because of the revisions in the estimates on the ATS and NOW effect. Our original thought was that we would simply accept those specifications for 1979 outlined in alternative B. I say that but I also express the hope that we are not creating another form of base drift here. And if we do get enabling legislation, I hope that we will be just as quick in reducing those [adjustments] on the other side. The 1980 targets pose a particular problem because we don\u2018t know what the base is, but I think the main effect of those is really psychological at this point. So I think we ought to be very careful to point out as we explain the \u201879 objectives that they have been raised because of a mechanical problem and that we have not raised our targets at all. Similarly, I believe it\u2019s important that the \u201880 targets be somewhat lower than those we had for \u201979. So our feeling was that it would be best just to take 1/2 percentage point off the alternative B specifications for 1980. But, again, we could live with Steve\u2019s specifications quite well, though I might want to play around with that 6 percent top on the range he has on M1. People will look at that and not go beyond it to find the explanation of why it really represents a 5-1/2 percent midpoint excluding ATS transfers, as compared with a 6 percent midpoint in \u201879", " MR. PARTEE. Yes, but we are going to be talking publicly here about our projections for 1980 and I just think it would alarm the market. I would rather do it in January when, in fact, we could see how deep the recession is likely to be", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me be very quick on the business side. A lot of people have talked about the risks of a recession, and I think they are there. There are also some risks of financial disturbances arising perhaps out of some nonfinancial companies. I think there are risks in the balance of payments and on the dollar side. I just mention those to say that I recognize them. But I believe the overwhelming purpose we should have in mind now, which seems to me to be shared from the comments that I have heard around the table, is that [our policy] should in substance and appearance be steady. I might say in terms of the risk of a larger recession, if some policy initiative became necessarily desirable, I\u2019d rather see it myself on the fiscal side than on the monetary side-- specifically on the tax reduction side, not on the expenditure side. I think that could have some long-range benefits despite an adverse effect on the budget in the short run. But I do think in substance and appearance that we ought to be steady. What I\u2019m disturbed about is that while the tone of many people\u2019s comments seems to say that, their precise recommendations don\u2019t seem to convey it. I frankly think the numbers that have been put before us by Mr. Axilrod would be confusing to the market. market would only interpret this as an easing of policy. We\u2018re raising some numbers on the bottom side of our ranges and [growth is1 already running toward the bottom, so we must be saying that we want The 1/11/79 -28- to get easier. The M1 number is clearly higher on the surface than at present in any event. I think it would convey the wrong impression. What are we trying to do here. As I understand it, we are reviewing some projections we set forth early in the year. Has something happened to change our minds about what we thought about then. It seems to me that the answer we should be trying to give is \"no.\" We happen to be within the ranges. Why change them. And that is the message we want to give. And I would leave M1 unchanged, too", " 7/11/79 -31- MS. TEETERS. Aren\u2019t we just delaying the explanation. When we get to next January and we\u2019re 1-l/2 percent above where we said we were going to be, then we\u2019re going to have to give the same explanation. And in the meantime we\u2019re going to get all the adverse press on having been outside the long-term ranges", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. I don\u2018t think foreign exchange traders are analysts. I don\u2019t think they care about facts. They care if they can use the device to maneuver a market in order to make a profit. Ted, do you have any view on it", " MR. EASTBURN. I think these are very real concerns. The main concern on the other side, drawing from our experience with these targets in the past, is that once we get locked into a certain range it's very difficult to change. And the longer we go without changing, the more difficult it is to change. So if we go this way, I think we should do so with the understanding that if policy has to change, we will change the numbers. Let's not find ourselves locked into that same old situation as in the past. If we suspect at all that there's a danger of getting locked into that, there's some advantage in changing the numbers simply for technical reasons just to change the numbers", " I don't know what the staff was actually forecasting-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. It may be something else by the end of the year. That's one of the problems", " MR. COLDWELL. My point is that we end up leaving the figures the same, but with a parenthetical adjustment", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. I think what I'm saying is that that's true if we look at ATS only. But some members may want to adjust their policy thinking to other things that have happened. But on ATS only, I think you're probably right. We probably made a mistake. For internal purposes we probably should have put your estimate in for the effect of ATS every month. Pardon", " MR. BLACK. I would want that [1980 range] on the surface to appear to be somewhat lower; others wouldn\u2019t, but I would for psychological reasons. I think it could have a very therapeutic effect on the market", " MR. BALLES. I'm not quite sure, Mr. Chairman. If we try the tack you are suggesting to avoid specifying the numbers for '80, which I would approve, what I can't really make a guess on--maybe you can tell me--is whether the [Congressionall Committee will try to smoke it out of you. If they do, then you're going to have to face the problem of the explanation of why it's 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent now and 3 to 6 or 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent next year", " MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we refer to those old rates as pure rates in Richmond, before we fool around and adjust them", " MS. TEETERS. I think you ought to explain very carefully what we're doing because it could be very misleading. I think we've had a bad reputation for being misleading and not forthcoming in saying what we're doing. We should put all the cards on the table and tell the [Congressional] Committee exactly what's going on", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Sure. I have no disagreement with that. These ranges were set with the impact of ATS estimated at 3 percent. [The Congressional Committee] will have to take account of the fact that there may be a deviation from that particular estimate and that to the extent there is a deviation the ranges will be inappropriate. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, you should look at M2 as much better to track", " No, but you-- 7/11/79 -37 MR. WALLICH. I think we are getting ourselves here in the spirit of [believing that1 in a recession we've got to accelerate the aggregates. Now, that way, there will never be a reduction in inflation. In a recession interest rates should come down, but at constant rates of expansion of the aggregates: otherwise prices will go up indefinitely", " MR. COLDWELL. I don't believe the figures anyway. The figures are going to jump around and ATS account adjustments are going to jump around", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Steve, it seems to me that what we were planning--we haven't seen that chapter [of the report1 yet, but I think you and I talked about this--was to have a long-range chart on each aggregate to show what we have done to bring each one down as well as a shorter-term focus. We need to focus on the year because it gets lost. But in a long-term chart we are intending to show that we have been winding this [monetary growth] down as promised", " Well, at least back to the early ' 7 0 s  so it can be-- CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, yes. We want to go back so we catch the earlier cycle too and show how the money growth came up and then we have been bending it downward. And the ranges that we're suggesting, if we say we are going to continue the same ranges, allow us to continue that trend. I don't want to get locked into promising that. I think Chuck's right. I don't want to get locked into promising anything. I just want to say that all things equal, and with our ambition to fight inflation being what it is, we can live within those ranges to accomplish what's appropriate. What is your pleasure", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Do we need a vote on [the ranges for 19801. Perhaps yes", " MR. WALLICH. I'd like to stick with that because I disagreed on that one the last time", " MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, this Committee has traditionally overstayed policy both in the direction of ease and of restraint and I would like to see us violate this tradition once. It seems to me, with the economy clearly in a recession, that we ought to start moving to try to mitigate the amplitude of the recession--to try to take out some insurance that the recession will not be bigger than the staff has projected. So with that in mind, I would propose that the funds range ought to be 9-1/2 to 10-1/4 percent with instructions to the Manager to move to 10 percent immediately. I think history gives us assurance that the aggregates are not going to run away from us in a recession, even with an aggressive interest rate policy. Now. I recognize that this is going to be disturbing to the foreign exchange markets in the short run. But once the markets understand that our economy is turning down while the rest of the world is still moving up, I think it will turn out to be a short-run phenomenon. And we can use our open market operations in the foreign exchange area to mitigate the shock. But I believe we have a conflict between our domestic and our foreign objectives. I think we have to sacrifice one, and I would sacrifice the exchange market at the moment", " MS. TEETERS. iw. Chairman, if it were not for the international markets, I would be recommending alternative I. What I am worried about is that we are never going to get to a point that we start easing that the money markets are not going to get upset", " MR. PARTEE. Well, I agree with Nancy. But in deference to the international situarion, I would postpone the reduction in the funds rate until next week. [But] the fact of the matter is it\u2019s going to get worse and worse and worse", " VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that\u2018s really the explanation for the declining retail sales--and there must be something to it--I don\u2019t think the remedy is monetary policy but rather fiscal policy. My main concern here would be that we not move right away on the funds rate without some considerable provocation. I think we have to keep in mind the international situation but always against the perspective of accelerating inflation. It may yet require some action in raising the fed funds rate, but that leaves me happy with a 10 to 10-1/2 percent range--that will do--and I\u2019d do nothing at the moment. Probably I\u2018d have the money market directive. I am bothered by the ranges under alternative I1 simply because this month our own staff\u2019s projections for aggregate growth are much lower than the Board staff\u2019s. They are outside the ranges proposed here already on the low side, which will be contrary to the idea of not changing the fed funds rate if those [projections] came out to be right. I don\u2019t think one can put much weight on either of these projections; this just indicates that the money supply unfortunately is pretty much a random number for the month. So I would stick with the money market directive, and I would prefer a wider range on [the aggregates]. I would really prefer 0 to 6 or 6-1/2 percent or 1 / 2  to 6-1/2 or something like that [on M 1 1  and 5 to 9 percent on M2", " MR. BLACK. I tend to think we ought to have different ranges when we have a money market directive than when we have an aggregates one because the trigger points are different. Others apparently don\u2018t see that distinction, which I see", " MR. KIMBREL. I have a slight preference for a money [market directive]", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay, then that gives us everybody standing still here. There's an overwhelming preference for a money market directive. This gives us on M1 a preponderance of preference for the 2-1/2 to 6-l/2 percent range. On M2 there is a preponderance of 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent and on the range for fed funds a preponderance of-- it really looks like alternative I1 is it. Before we vote on that, I would like to take seriously John Balles' suggestion that in the directive we give more weight to M2. And I would like an expression of sentiment from the voting members on whether you would be so inclined or whether you would prefer to continue with the equal weight", " CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay, it looks as if the preference is to stay with equal weight. Now having done that, let us see what our vote would be on alternative I1 as is with the fed funds rate at 10-1/4 percent and a money market directive", " Governor Teeters Yes Governor Wallich MR. WALLICH. Are we going to stick by your suggestion, M r .  Chairman, that if the exchange markets destabilize, we will have a meeting", " MR. WALLICH. I have great doubts about it, Mr. Chairman, because it is a political move. If we do this, I fear we will find ourselves approached by the State Department and maybe the Treasury on behalf of other countries. That has already been the case at a very low level of planning. One person from the State Department has raised questions on whether some other countries could be included in the swap network", " 7/11/79 -52- MR. COLDWELL. Well, I have some of the reservations Henry does. I see it not costing us anything to add more onto their swap line. And if this were a crucial position of the State Department and foreign policy--that we add to the Mexican swap line--1 guess I'd swallow and do it just because it doesn't cost me anything at the moment. But I think there is a politicizing of this swap line arrangement that we have fought, especially with such countries as wanted a swap line because they wanted to be a part of the club. Mexico now wants to be a part of a bigger club. So I guess I'd have to say that if we are going to do this, we do it only as a political reason", " MR. WALLICH", " Technically, these things are limited to MR. COLDWELL.

Just another question quickly, Mr. Chairman, onthe fiscal policy matter. Jerry, earlier this year you may rememberwe called attention to some startling differences between yourprojections of the high employment surplus and those of the Council ofEconomic Advisers. They were much different magnitudes and evendifferent signs. Could you bring us up-to-date in a nutshell on wherethat stands today if you know", "MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, the situation as I view it has acouple of interesting quirks. As you recall, last fall we talkedabout the real economy expanding while the monetary economy heldquiet. We are now looking at a monetary expansion with a presumptionthat the real economy is flat. I didn't believe the one last fall,and I don't believe the one now. I think we have either a stockadjustment problem going on or a flow problem. At any rate, I thinkwe are caught in a vicious circle. We start with an inflation ratebase of whatever you want to call it--say, 7, 8, 9, or 10 percent.From that comes encouragement for higher oil prices and higher wages;we get lower productivity, we get higher costs, the dollardepreciates, and then we get higher inflation. We have got to breakout of this circle, and breaking out of it I think means we have torefuse to validate some of these higher costs and prices. It's goingto be an expensive process for us; it's going to be a traumaticprocess for some of our people. But I think the threat of anintensification of recession, while a cautionary flag, still is not-27-8/14/79balanced against the costs of inflation, which are now in the double-digit range and have been there for some time. The costs even if wejust take it against GNP are obviously over $200 billion a year.We've got to get out of this box. I don't think we are goingto break out of it today or tomorrow, but we are going to have tobreak out of it somehow or we will just continue to have a higher andhigher inflation and a constant recurrence of international crises.The downside risks are there, certainly. But there's a certainty tothe upside risks, too, in terms of inflation. I haven't had muchconfidence in these aggregates figures for almost 10 years now. Icertainly have not seen anything to improve my confidence in them.The impact on the dollar has come to be a new element in this packageand I think in the long run it means that we have to pay attention toour international position, perhaps a little more so than we have donein the past.All of this says to me that we still have a role to play.Monetary policy can't do it all but its role at the moment is to fightinflation. I would hope that the Committee would also look at thelong-range strategy of how we are going to get out of this box that Ihave tried to portray for you. We need to try to look at thepossibilities of getting more certain figures on our money supply,[perhaps by] getting greater reserve coverage throughout the wholerange of financial institutions and maybe even some nonfinancial onesalso. We must try to get ourselves equipped so we can know preciselywhat we are creating and be able to limit that creation of credit whenwe think it is necessary to dampen inflation", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman I agree on the nature of thebox we're in as you described it. It seems to me that we can work ourway out of the box if we gear our policy to the aggregates in the next6 or 8 months. I think we're in a situation very similar to thesecond quarter of '74 when we had declining final demand. The declinewas cushioned by a very large inventory accumulation, financed by asubstantial expansion in bank credit, and this in turn I think led toa sharp rise in the aggregates. It seems to me that the problem in'74 was not that we leaned so hard against the expansion in the firsthalf, pushing the funds rate to unprecedentedly high levels, but thatwe moved so sluggishly when the aggregates failed to grow in the lasthalf of the year. Our slow movement on the other side I think-29-8/14/79produced a much bigger recession than was necessary and probably morereaction on the fiscal front than was really productive. So I wouldagree with your judgment that we should take a symbolic action todaythat would not be terribly damaging to the future prospects for theeconomy but would have some symbolic significance to the markets.I would suggest moving to 11 percent on the funds rate,raising the discount rate to 10-1/2 percent, but giving the Manager amoney market directive and informing him that there should be no movebeyond 11 percent without further consultation with the Committee. Amove of that size is not going to have any major further weakeningimpact on the economy; it would be slight, but not significant. Ithink it would yield us some psychological benefits and would be aworthwhile move provided that we're willing to perform differently inthe last half of the year than we did in the last half of '74. [Weshould] really move against a situation in which the aggregates arenot growing, and I think that's likely to be the case in the fourthquarter when we get a big decline in inventory accumulation", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I listened with interest to yourcomments at the beginning of the discussion, and I appreciate a gooddeal what you had to say. I agree [with what you said on] economicpolicy, increasing prices, and credibility. I also agree that ifthere were some action or set of actions that we could prescribe thatwould strike a really significant blow against inflation, turn aroundpublic expectations of continued inflation, and restore the confidencethat you mentioned, that would be an imperative thing to do. However,I'm conscious of the need to balance the goal of moving againstinflation as well as doing what we can to minimize the impact ofrecession. Obviously the economy today is weakening; even yourecognized yourself, Mr. Chairman, that the recession may turn out tobe worse than the staff now projects. Clearly most of the economicindicators are weakening; very few show any strength at all. My ownfeeling is that the recession is likely to be deeper than we now arewilling to recognize. It may be true that increasing the money supplyright now would result in higher prices instead of stimulating realgrowth, as Mr. Willes pointed out. But it may also well be true thatany restrictive action that we're likely to take, given the causes ofthe current inflation, would be unlikely to have much effect exceptperhaps symbolically. I doubt myself if any action we take will haveany really significant effect in restraining the current inflation.So I would be most reluctant at this time to move in thedirection of further restriction. I can't help noting that money andcredit are already tight and interest rates are very close to theirhistoric highs at the present time. To move further in thatdirection, in the face of the obvious evidence of a weakening economy,seems to me to run the excessive risk of making the recession deeperthan it might otherwise be. I might be persuaded differently over thenext few days or weeks as additional data come in, but at the presenttime I would prefer to see us follow a steady course--that is, notmove in the direction of further restrictiveness. But also because upto the present time the unemployment figures have not risensignificantly, I would be opposed to taking any easing actions. Iwould therefore want to follow a policy of steady as we go. I'd staywith the policy that we had adopted previously. I think this wouldtranslate, so far as the monetary [aggregates] are concerned intoalternative B, keeping the ranges roughly where they were", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, like everybody elsearound the table who has [spoken] this morning, am mindful of thebalance needed between the [potential] depth of the recession and theneed to fight inflation. Over recent months, my attention has beenmore focused on trying to moderate the depth and the length of any-33-8/14/79recession that seemed to be clearly on its way or perhaps already inprogress. I guess that's a very comfortable position when theaggregates are indeed growing at a moderate rate or even at a very lowrate; we can [then] afford that luxury. But things have changed. Theprojections we're looking at now of as much as six months of very highrates of growth in the money supply ultimately will translate in myjudgment into a worsening of the inflationary outlook.I would come to the position then of suggesting that we haveto move against those growth rates in the money supply. The questionis how and by how much. I would note that this Committee has takeninterest rates, as measured by the federal funds for example, a fullhalf percentage point higher since the last meeting on July 11.That's not an insignificant move. The proposal around the table isthat we take another 1/2 point [increase] immediately; that's a fullpercentage point from one meeting to the next. There's been a changein the Chairman of this Committee; there have been changes in severalother aspects of the Committee itself. That [increase in rates] mayhave a public perception that would be acceptable in the short run.On the other hand, it seems to me that in view of the past movementwe've already had--and if there is indeed a lag in how interest ratesaffect the growth rate in money supply--then I would oppose going upat this time in any major step.I would like to propose that if the markets question where weare [on the funds rate]--whether it's 10-5/8 or 10-3/4 percent--weindeed validate a move to 10-3/4 percent. And I'd set the ranges insuch a way that they would be below either \"A\", \"B\", or \"C\" as theyappear in the Bluebook. I would have them be 1 percent off the \"B\"ranges of 4 to 8 and 7 to 11 percent, with a rather restrictivefederal funds range of 10-1/2 to 11 percent. And if indeed we get thegrowth projected by Steve and his staff for the latter part of Augustand into September--particularly those first 2 weeks in Septemberwhich apparently is a crucial period--we should be prepared to move to11 percent and let the Desk work within those ranges, but [I'd go] nofurther than 11 percent.You asked, Mr. Chairman, for some comments with regard to thediscount rate. If we were to move [the funds rate] to anything above10-3/4 percent--if that's the decision of this Committee--then itwould be my feeling that the discount rate probably should go up andby as much as 1/2 percentage point. I would prefer, on the otherhand, if we do stay fairly stable--that is, at the 10-1/2 percenttarget we have now--that the discount rate remain where it is. Onlyif we move to 11 percent should consideration be given to a discountrate move", " He participated at the very beginning and thiswon't be the very end, Fred, unless you're so dramatically persuasivethat we immediately--MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I want you to know that I shall protectmy position as the caboose with fervor. My feelings are pretty muchthe same as I expressed to you yesterday, Mr. Chairman. It seems tome that inflation and credit demands, the difficulty in projecting theaggregates, and the sensitivity of the dollar would argue very clearlyagainst any easing. On the other hand, in spite of the littlesnapback that we've had in July, the economy is certainly veryfragile. And in spite of the persuasive arguments in the FederalReserve Bank of New York [article] on demographics and credit cards, Icontinue to be worried about the level of consumer debt. I'm veryconcerned about consumer confidence, not just because of the Michiganand Conference Board surveys, but in light of the longer-term kinds ofstudies that are made about consumer confidence. I just don't knowhow low that can go and I don't know how serious the recession couldget. I think that is a clear and present danger, so I would argueagainst any very strong moves to tighten.That leaves me to suggest that we stay where we are ortighten moderately. It seems to me that at this point in time amessage is very important, so I'm persuaded that we should tightenmoderately. I am concerned that the messages we send be clear, whichunder ordinary circumstances might make me want to take a littlestronger move than I would support today. But in the presentcircumstances, with everything that has been said in the media andwith the changes in leadership, it seems to me that any move towardtightening is going to be a fairly clear message. I would hope thatsometime in the future we could narrow the aggregates ranges and letthe fed funds be perhaps more volatile. But I would be a littleconcerned about that right now, as perhaps muddying the waters alittle on the clarity of the message. I would also have a bit ofconcern right now about raising the discount rate because I would liketo save some powder if the message is not taken as we think it isgoing to be. So I would come down generally in favor of alternativeC; but the fed funds rate range I would prefer is Governor Partee's10-1/2 to 11-1/4 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you've got to give something tothe consumer, so it may be some combination of that sort with someemphasis on the investment side. Now, I've got a personal problem--other people do, too--with the payroll tax pure and simple because ofthe linkage between the payroll tax and the benefits. So, I don'tknow. But we're not going to resolve fiscal policy here this morning.I'm just not quite as pessimistic about it as some of your comments[implied].The other thing that occurred to me--I don't know whetheranybody mentioned this or not--is that any of these aggregates rangesshown for the short run in comparison with the short-run ranges wehave currently could be interpreted as an easing. I don't know howserious that is. It is true that they are substantially higher thanthe present ones we're working [toward].Well, let me try something here and just shoot at it. On theaggregates, I don't think I can't bracket everybody's implicit orexplicit comments, but there was a considerable amount of commentarythat we ought to go below any of these ranges [shown in the Bluebookalternatives]. The least we can go below them is 4 to 8 percent and 7to 11 percent. On the federal funds range--I'm speaking personallybut I think it may coincide with some other views--I tend to think ofit asymmetrically. It depends on whether we think of the rangeasymmetrically or put the asymmetry right into the specifications. Wehave another problem just in terms of the message issue. Right now,while the market is a bit confused about the federal funds rate[objective], there is a substantial body of opinion that thinks we'reat 10-3/4 percent, and at the least I think we have to confirm that.Frankly, I don't know quite where we are because when I listened topeople earlier I was changing my mind. Maybe I ought to change itagain. I was [thinking] in the fairly immediate situation--I'm nottalking necessarily tomorrow, but this week--of something like 10-7/8percent or maybe even with a little flexibility, say, around 10-7/8 upto 11 percent. That is consistent, I guess, with a range of 10-3/4 to11-1/4 percent. Obviously we can widen that out. Or I suppose thealternative is something like the 10-1/2 to 11-1/4 percent that somepeople mentioned, which also gives us a 10-7/8 midpoint if I did thearithmetic correctly", "MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, most of what you are suggesting asa possible position here I find--well, let me say acceptable. I'dlike to move a touch more promptly to 11 percent on the funds rate.There's one caution I'd like to draw, and maybe I'll be a voice in thewilderness this month as I was last month. We all agree that theaggregates are getting increasingly harder to understand. In my viewthat's much more true of M1 than M2. I made the suggestion last month--but got no support, I'll have to say--to put more weight on M2formally in the directive just for the reason that it is behaving lesserratically than M1. I hope before the next meeting of this Committeeto share with you an updated paper by my staff on what the recentbehavior and experience with M2 has been. It's really quiteencouraging in terms of the demand function being pretty stable andcoming back on track after departing in the first quarter, despite allthe vagaries of Regulation Q and what have you. The onlyspecification that I dwelled on, Mr. Chairman, was your very highrange for M2 at 7 to 11 percent. The projections of the staff for thegrowth of the aggregates in September are very high, bringing M2especially up near the top of this range. I think that's too high.And if we're going to pay any attention to coordinating our short-term2-month goals with our longer-term goals, I think we really need tobring the range for M2 down to a point where we won't continue todepart from the midpoint [of our long-run range]. It sounds awfullyradical but I'd like to suggest a range [with an upper limit] nohigher than 9 percent--perhaps 5 to 9 percent on M2--just so we don'tget increasingly off track from the midpoint, which is the provisionaltarget that I personally would like to shoot at.As far as the fed funds range is concerned, I could go withthe range you're talking about as long as we move pretty promptly to11 percent. If that is done, I think we should follow that up with anincrease in the discount rate of a full half point. And I'd feel morecomfortable with an aggregates directive to make sure we don't let theaggregates get too near their outer bounds without triggering someaction on the federal funds rate", "MR. WALLICH. I think we have a choice of either a narroweraggregates range that is likely to be triggered on the up side beforewe pull it down or being a little more generous on the funds rate. Icould go with 4 to 8 percent on M1 and 7 to 11 percent on M2 providedwe move to 11 percent on the funds rate and have a 10-1/2 to 11-1/2percent range, with the possibility of that being used if it istriggered by the aggregates under a regular aggregates directive sothat there's a gradual movement. If we don't want to do that, then Iwould say that we ought to pull down the upper end of the aggregates-40-8/14/79ranges and maybe the lower end also in order to have a narrower fundsrate but an earlier trigger. I would prefer the first version: 4 to8 percent, 7 to 11 percent, and [on the funds rate] 10-1/2 to 11-1/2percent and a move to 11 percent", "MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, there is the possibility that theCommittee could adopt a mixed directive--and the Committee once hadsuch a directive--that in effect was aggregates on the up side andmoney market on the low side. That is, you'd move the funds rate upif the aggregates were high in the range but you wouldn't [lower therate] until growth is below the bottom of the range. We had wordingat one point for such a directive", "MS. TEETERS. I'd be willing to support the 10-3/4 to 11-1/4with a funds rate of 11 percent and have your [proposed] ranges of 4to 8 and 7 to 11 percent. But I would be very much opposed to themixed directive. It seems to me that we're at a potential turning-41-8/14/79point of rather major proportions and if the money supply does come invery low, then [a standard type of directive] would operate to movethe rate automatically down", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will stipulate that a 1/4 or 1/8percentage point move on the federal funds rate isn't going to haveany pronounced effect on the growth rates in the next two months--ifthat's the only thing we're worried about. I'm not sure it's the only-42-8/14/79thing we're worried about. [Unless] somebody else wants to sayanything, all I can do is try again. I'm not sure, but I think thereis a little more sentiment for moving to 11 percent now than I hadjudged. I'm going to give you two more alternatives. We can stickwith the 4 to 8, 7 to 11, and 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent with themidpoint [on the funds range] at 11 percent and move there. Or we cango to, say, 3-1/2 to 7-1/2 and 6-1/2 to 10-1/2, which a number ofpeople suggested--and it [moves] some distance toward other[suggestions]--and we can shade the 11 percent a little on the lowside. I'd still like the flexibility to play in that area--perhaps goafter [something around] 10-7/8 to 11 percent [on the funds rate]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Following Phil, here, the money marketdirective at the moment. With that high a range, I'm a little worriedabout an aggregates directive. Again, there's just some uncertaintyabout what will happen in the very short run. I just looked overTom's shoulder and New York already has a lower estimate for theseaggregates; it might be triggered on the low side before we know it", "MR. ALTMANN. It's 4 to 8 percent, 7 to 11 percent, a fundsrate range of 10-3/4 to 11-1/4 percent with an 11 percent midpoint,and a money market directive.Chairman Volcker YesPresident Balles YesPresident Black No. I agree with half ofit, but I think the ranges are too high with a money market directive", "MR. COLDWELL. I'd like to charge because it's a substitutionfor direct borrowing", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If it will speed up things, I thought of agreat Solomonic approach on this of charging an eighth, which is lessthan we charge--SPEAKER(.). How about 3/16th"], "1979FOMC19790918meeting.txt": [" MR. ROOS. Scott, you alluded to the fact that as the energy induced segment of inflation improves--or recedes--it may bring some improvement into the picture. Don\u2018t most of the foreign exchange market partipants really look at the monetary induced part of the inflation picture, which of course reflects money growth. Don\u2019t they look at that. Don\u2019t they recognize that if total inflation were to be reduced from 10 to 8 percent, we\u2019d still have the basic underlying money induced part of the inflation. Won\u2018t that still be their primary concern in terms of the market", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, [you say] \"does need to be.\" I don't know what that implies", " MR. COLDWELL. Well, on the last point, I think it's ridiculous. Can't we at least get some action [by] the responsible part of Congress to quit this nonsense", " MR. WALLICH. I would remind you that this is an opportunity to talk about the budget deficit and, therefore, not to be completely despised even though it is rather illogical to first vote [in favor of1 the deficit and then refuse to allow it to be financed. But it gives the defeated party a chance to come back a second time and criticize", " But the electrical settlement really wasn't that-- CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think what you say has some validity looking backwards. I don't know where to put the automobile agreement; I have a little doubt about that. That's a question we have: Looking forward, will that rather favorable record, considering what has been happening in prices, be sustained. I think this is one of the major issues we have here", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might say in terms of these guidelines that I don't feel up-to-date on that and I don't know the details. I understand the argument has been whether to have a guideline at all, with the alternative being this tripartite labor/management/public commission to look at wage settlements and pricing behavior. It gets posed in those [unintelligible] terms because I take it that labor has said that they will not participate in a tripartite arrangement with any numerical guideline. The Administration likes the idea of the tripartite commission but has not been willing, so far anyway, to go along with the idea of giving [the commission] absolutely no guidance in terms of numerical guidelines. That's where the impasse is", " MR. MAYO. One of the main problems on the crop issue is the inability to move the crops. Rail capacity is very low. With the Rock Island strike and so forth, the Iowa farmers are really going to [unintelligible]; they just can't move anything. They still have a large share of last year's crop sitting there", "] CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me ask a couple of questions. You went over three reasons why the money supply increased more rapidly over the late spring and summer. It struck me last night that there may be an additional reason. I'll just comment on it. You do all these equations and everything else to get something called gross national product, which is the gross domestic product. And you have a price rise in there, whatever it is, of less than 10 percent or around 10 percent. In fact, we've had a big increase in the oil bill as well, which doesn't enter into the gross national product. It leads to a considerable discrepancy on other price indices from the gross national product deflator. [What] if we said in some sense that the additional money supply was financing the additional oil imports", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that helps explain it. Even so, [their growth] was fast in the first half of the year, too. But this column of figures seems a little inconsistent with what we talk about happening in the market in the short run. Is that because we got a drastic change in the fourth quarter or what", " But the third quarter will show a big increase in bank loans and-- MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, it's not all that unusual to have a burst in bank credit as the economy moves into recession", " MR. AXILROD. I\u2019ll be very elliptical, Mr. Chairman, in the interest of saving time. I was of course couching my own discussion in the terms in which the Committee has been framing its policies. If the Committee had been framing its policies in terms of the monetary base or reserves or something like that as an operating device, I would have couched the discussion in those terms. It\u2019s perfectly true that the monetary base or reserves have expanded much more rapidly in the past two or three months than they had in the previous two or three months. In part that\u2018s because of efforts to hold the funds rate down; in part it\u2019s because currency, which has a bigger weight in the base, has increased more rapidly. And in part it\u2019s because banks have begun adding to holdings of CDs and absorbing more reserves that way, whereas in the two or three previous months when M1 had been growing CDs had been dropping, releasing reserves available to support money. So reserve growth didn\u2019t have to be as rapid in order to support the same amount of money. I add those latter factors in order to indicate how complicated it is to have a relationship between reserves and money that is stable because the deposit mix and thus the need for reserves is constantly shifting, and preferences for currency versus deposits are constantly shifting. So it\u2019s very hard to come before the Committee and say: If you set the monetary base or reserves to grow this much, I can guarantee this much money. And it would be even more difficult to tell the Committee what federal funds rate or what interest rates are likely to emerge from that--questions the Committee obviously would want to and need to know. S o  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s impossible and I\u2018m not even really indicating my preferences in the matter. But it\u2019s not going to be any less difficult, in a practical way, to control money with reserves than it is to control it with the federal funds rate because it will always involve the Committee in two decisions. [First], what should be its fundamental target. Is the money target that it is setting right or wrong and should it [change] in light of changing circumstances. And [second], what is it going to do about interest rates. Does the Committee in fact want them to go up or down in the way that they would be going if we adhere fairly ridgidly to a preset reserve target. I hasten to add that I don\u2019t mean to say that I don\u2018t think it would be useful to have a reserve or a base target. Personally, I happen to think it would be useful. M R .  ROOS. Well, Paul, the reason I asked the question--and I ask it purely in a constructive way, not to just reopen the classical argument--is because of the problems that we\u2019ve had in controlling money growth. [Given] your statements, which I think are great, that we\u2019re never going to accomplish our ultimate goal until we achieve some discipline in terms of monetary growth, couldn\u2018t we discuss these issues again. Maybe I am out of order to raise this now, but couldn\u2019t there be a discussion again of whether or not our traditional policy 9/18/79 -14- of targeting on interest rates, in spite of the possible adverse consequences in terms of money growth, [is appropriate]. Shouldn\u2019t this be given another look in view of everything you\u2018ve said and in view of the less than happy experience that the FOMC has had over the past years in achieving its goals of stability in terms of the inflation problem. Shouldn\u2018t we take a look at this in some way", " MR. BALLES. I would, too", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm still confused somewhat by these figures when 1 look at the quarterly flow of funds. We have had higher interest rates recently, which are normally accompanied by an increase in individual purchases of credit market instruments, if I remember these flow-of-funds ambulations correctly, and a decline in deposits. Instead, we had an enormous increase in deposit holdings by individuals and a very big decline in the rate of growth of credit market instrument holdings during the third quarter when interest rates were rising. We'd normally expect the reverse to happen", " MR. BAUGHMAN. It was up 10 percent from a year ago in the four weeks ending September 8; and from the beginning of the year through those four weeks it's up 7 percent. So there was a definite step-up, compared to what had preceded that 4-week period, which occurred pretty generally across the metropolitan areas in the District. Those [whose sales] I had reported earlier as being very strong attributed it to an apparent increase in purchasing by people coming from Mexico. They continued strong but they did not show the surge that other centers did in that last 4-week period. That's just by way of suggesting that in our part of the country, at least, there seems to have been something happening to nonautomotive retail sales because these were department store sales. With respect to the financial sector, as I was listening to Steve's comments, they seemed almost exactly to replay some conversations we had in the District last Wednesday evening, at which Governor Teeters was present. [Those comments were] to the effect that in a prior period with 13 percent interest rates, bankers were working very hard to discourage borrowers. At the present time they are still out searching for loans. Apparently they find it profitable to add to loans now, whereas in the earlier period they did not. They say that they feel no credit restraint and they do not see a reluctance on the part of their customers to borrow. There was a comment, for example, that 13 plus 3 percent for real estate loans-- these were bankers talking so the loans were not primarily residential mortgage loans--just doesn't seem to deter people. They go ahead and sign up and don't even ask a question as to whether they couldn't do it for less. With respect to labor markets, the thrust of the conversation in our part of the world is tight labor, high turnover, and losses of efficiency as a result of high turnover. I don't know whether we have that sort of situation in labor markets elsewhere or not. But it seems to me--and I am inclined to disagree a little with the view Willis winn was expressing that we are lucky not to have more than an 11 percent annual rate of increase contracted for 3 years in the automobile industry--that building that sort of [wage increase] into the economy almost guarantees that we are not going to make any significant progress fighting inflation for 3 years. That's particularly so in an industry where the indications are that it's moving to supply a diminishing proportion of the domestic market. So we have a market structure that is permitting wages and prices to be pushed up in that industry. And we're really exporting jobs from the industry and importing increasing amounts of automobiles produced 9/18/79 -17- abroad. That Seems to me to be inconsistent with moving toward the objectives we presumably have in mind. I don't see any answer to this problem in our conventional use of monetary and fiscal tools except a very, very long, drawn out and very painful one. So it seems to me that we should be trying to encourage the government to think of ways to break into some of these wage and price processes in the interest of trying to move more rapidly to moderate inflation without going through the necessity of creating horrendous amounts of unemployment for a long period of time. That's all I have, M r .  Chairman", " MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, I have been listening here for some time, trying to cipher out what I think this economy is going to do. I think Steve's comment that it is uncertain is probably a good portrayal of my position. I have doubts that the staff's switch between the third and fourth quarter is going to come out as perfectly as they show it here. I doubt that they would defend the precision of the 0.7 [forecast] or anything like that anyway. It seems to me that we still have some strength left in this economy. And the portrayal of credit demands still reflects, I think, the basic attitude that inflation will continue. If there is anything certain in this world right now it seems to be that inflation will continue, whether at the current 10 percent rate in the fixed weighted index or at 9 percent plus. I am bothered about this forecast showing even through the end of 1980 more than 9 percent inflation in terms of the average from Q4 '79 to Q4 '80. The prospects we have had detailed for us by the staff have shown weakening, tied primarily as I understand it to an inventory position and personal income assumption. Housing is expected to decline, but barring a change in attitudes--unless the ceiling rates in state usury laws become more binding--it still appears to me a pretty speculative area of inflation. Oil [prices], of course, are something that seem to move ahead; and with a minimum of 10 percent inflation for this year, I suspect we are going to get another shock in oil prices next year, unless somebody can find some way to dampen the demand severely. S o ,  as I look over what is coming up, with high aggregates growth with which we are financing these [activities], with rates not dampening the strong credit demands--that is, the financial side of the economy still indicating strength--the recession seems uncertain and the inflation certain. I still think that the policy position of this Committee ought to be to do what it can to dampen inflationary expectations. That doesn't mean that we have to charge into major changes in either the federal funds rate or anything else. I suspect the answer I would come out with is that we have to get the money supply figures under better control, which means putting some rather severe limits on what we would accept as a peak rate of money supply growth over the coming 2-month period. And if we exceed that, then we take another tightening step and so be it. If the money supply growth does subside, as the staff seems to think it will eventually anyway, then we can afford to be a little more relaxed and perhaps even turn [rates around], following the market down. But for the coming period, Mr. Chairman, I would counsel the Committee to continue the path it has been on, slowly moving up its [funds rate] targets to force a curtailment in money supply growth", " MR. WALLICH. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that we face basically a question of timing. If the economy goes into recession, as it may already have done--interrupted temporarily maybe, but perhaps a more prolonged one than we originally thought--at some point we have to ease. But at the present time it seems to me the signs are still on the other side. The aggregates have been very strong; in a sense that\u2019s been an easing rather than a tightening even though interest rates have risen. Inflation shows itself to be more persistent than before and we have the old picture where we tend to underestimate inflation. That also means that real interest rates are less than one thinks, at least the upper end. We are now getting to the point where we are getting positive real interest rates. I guess Chase with its move [of the prime] to 13 percent made us honest. But that is only before taxes. And as we look down the road, it seems to make people increasingly accepting [continued] high inflation and thereby perceiving a lower long-term real interest rate. Now. the economy itself seems to me very spotty. What we have in good part is an automobile recession. This is reflected in the Redbook. Many parts of the country are still very strong and if we were to ease at this time those strong areas would of course bump against their ceilings increasingly and produce more demand pressure and inflation there. I would add that there are other things that might give us concern about high nominal interest rates. Most have not yet materialized. The suspicion that there might be some sort of crunch ahead seems not to be valid based on what we hear. There are no real supply constraints on credit. We think of how we\u2019ve shielded the housing sector through the money market certificate. That just means that we need more restraint across the board in all sectors-- that is, in lower aggregates or higher interest rates. I would remind you again that what\u2019s going on in the Euro-markets means that the relevant monetary aggregates that we ought to focus on, if we had the data, are growing faster than what we see. Finally, as to the immediate situation, it seems that the market interprets the behavior of the aggregates and of the economy as something that will cause us to tighten. So while we should not slavishly follow what the market seems to expect, nevertheless we have to recognize that we disappoint the market at a cost--at a cost in credibility--and I see no reason for that at this time. I would therefore argue in favor of a mild increase in the funds rate in order to slow the aggregates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " 9/18/79 -19- MR. EASTBURN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to take a little different position than has been taken up to this point. I believe one thing that is very good in the discussion that we have been having is that we are talking about longer-run strategy--a kind of cyclical strategy, I think. Everything that has been said up to now is in that vein, and that\u2019s good because I think one of the problems we have in these meetings is that we tend to operate month- to-month and get short-sighted. My strategy is somewhat different than Phil\u2019s or Henry\u2019s. I happen to think we are in a mild recession and that the recovery will be a protracted one. In that situation I also think that in our strategy we need to avoid mistakes that we have made in past cycles. One mistake that we have made is overstaying restraint and the other mistake is overstimulating when the economy weakens. I think Phil is entirely correct that we need to take an action that [makes] a dent on expectations; it\u2019s just that my course would differ somewhat from his because I feel we need to take increasing care to avoid precipitating a serious recession. That would have bad effects on expectations that would ultimately confirm inflationary expectations because it would precipitate action that would be designed to stimulate the economy and would in the longer run have negative effects on expectations. That means that in the current situation I would be willing-- not happy, but willing--to see somewhat higher growth rates in money for a time than I would ordinarily like to see. But that\u2018s in the expectation that we will be getting slower growth in the months ahead. I think it also means that we will have to exercise care against overstimulating as the economy proceeds to weaken, and that means resisting somewhat declines in interest rates that might otherwise occur and having somewhat slower money growth than we would have had in similar periods in the past. In other words, [I\u2019m suggesting] a strategy of kind of leveling off the peak and filling in the valley. There are risks in that, many risks. First of all is the assumption that the economy will behave the way I am assuming. Second is that the money supply in fact will start to slow down in coming months. But for the moment I would take that risk and stand pat; I\u2018d stay where we are and live with somewhat higher growth rates than I ordinarily would like to see. If that proves to be wrong and money growth continues exceptionally strong--that is, above the ranges--then I think we have to move the federal funds rate up. But [for now] I would stay essentially where we are", " MR. MAYO. So you think we can offset the availability through the rate", " On this issue, Paul, I hear more comment in the market about credit controls of various types as the way of doing it to avoid Reg-- CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My response would be a fortiori applied to credit controls. I don't know what we want to control at this particular point in the cycle, but--. Mr. Kimbrel", " MR. BLACK. M r .  Chairman, I don't have any serious quarrel with the staff's projections on the economy. But I think they are probably on the optimistic side, if they've missed, because it seems to me that this trouble we have is more in the nature of a worldwide problem with the petroleum shortage, inflation, and turmoil in the foreign exchange market. So I would not see nearly the improvement in the foreign trade sector that the staff has projected. I think all these problems are going to intensify the domestic problem. In dealing with the recession that we are in, I think we have a unique set of problems here that we really haven't [encountered] in the postwar period, as Dave Eastburn indicated. I don't think the past action in earlier recessions gives us much of a guide as to how we ought to proceed in this one. There was an excellent article by Paul McCracken in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that spelled out the sort of procedures I think we ought to follow. What I believe we have to do, since I think inflation is the main problem, is to address that problem almost entirely. More troubles are going to build up and we also are going have more serious problems on all fronts, including the unemployment front down the road. And to me dealing with inflation means getting a hand on the aggregates. As we set our targets today and as we approach the end of the year--when we are going to be judged as to whether we have hit our long-run targets or we haven't--we ought to bear in mind that there is a good deal of confusion among the public and probably on the part of some members of Congress. I find it confusing myself [as to] what our M1 targets really are for the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year. You will remember that in July we decided we would not change them; we left the M1 range at 1-1/2 to 4-1/2 percent but the consensus around the table as I read it was that for internal purposes we would think of that as being 3-1/2 to 6 percent since we revised downward our estimate of the ATS/New York NOW account effect from 3 to 1-l/2 percentage points. Now, this spurt in the aggregates that we had in August and September is going to make it very difficult for us to get a good fourth-quarter rate. And under all three alternatives in the staff's projections they are talking about a rate from the fourth quarter of last year to the fourth quarter of this year of 5.3 percent. If we add to that the 1-1/2 percent ATS/New York NOW account [effect], that comes out to 6 . 8  percent, which I find is sufficient evidence to indicate that we have been too easy. Although I sympathize with Bob Mayo's position--it's hard to judge these things sometimes--when I see bankers out fighting for loans as they are now and I see a lot them adding to their investments, I have to conclude that credit conditions may not be as tight as they appear [on the basis of] interest rates alone. Looking back in the history of economic thought, when we didn't have all the statistics we now have there was considerable feeling on the part of economists at the time that you could look at the behavior of the foreign exchange rate and the price of gold and that would tell you whether you had too much money or not. [Those indicators] clearly say to me that we are much too easy. But I view 9/18/79 -23- these long-run targets that we established in July as calling for a midpoint of 6 percent pre-ATS and 4-1/2 percent post-ATS, and I think we ought to endeavor to come as close as possible to these midpoints. I think this use of homeopathic doses of federal funds rate increases in the past has pretty well ruled out any hope we have of achieving this if indeed we can control the aggregates by manipulating the federal funds rate", " MS. TEETERS. I think you have overlooked that [Ml growth in] August came in at 6 . 8  percent. We haven't had a continuous 10 percent rate of growth; at the end of August the rate of growth of the money supply dropped. And if you look closely, it's in currency. The rate of increase in demand deposits has been coming down a l l  summer. Can someone explain to me why we have a sudden increase in demand for currency. I don't know the explanation for that. I would point out to you that we have raised interest rates 100 basis points [very recently]. That's a big increase in basis points. We have a prime rate of 13 percent, and nobody pays prime--it's prime plus. So we are talking about interest rates in the market that are 15 to 18 percent, and it's not just on consumer loans. We have really gone very far, very fast in the past 6 to 8 weeks. I think it's time that we slow down and see what we are doing because the major impact [of our 9/18/79 -24- tightening actions1 is going to be in the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of next year. I\u2019m a little puzzled about this availability argument. The lack of availability previously has always been in one [sector]; it has always been in the mortgage market. I suspect that in other areas of the market there was really enough money available, except maybe in the summer of \u201874. Now that we have said that we don\u2019t want to put all of the restraint on one industry, the word goes around that there is plenty of available money and nobody is being hurt by this. People have got to be squeezed out of the markets at this point. It may not be the big banks or big corporations, and it may mean [the restraint] is going to be focused again on certain areas of the country. The Sunbelt seems to be almost imune to any sort of restraint. And as we move [rates] around, it make it harder for New England and for the upper middle West, along with other areas of the country. I\u2019m extremely reluctant to raise either the discount rate or the federal funds rate at this point", " Well, it\u2018s very short-term money CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s all short term", " MR. MORRIS. I sort of lean [in the same direction as] Dave Eastburn and Nancy Teeters at this juncture. The evidence seems to me to indicate that recession momentum is gathering force very rapidly and that the recession is likely to be more severe than the staff forecasts. I had hoped, since it was the best forecast recession ever, that we would get some restraint on inventory accumulation. But the whopping increase in inventories in July plus the big demand for business loans at banks in the last 4 or 5 weeks suggest to me, even though oil inventories may be down some recently, that we\u2019re still 9/18/79 -25- getting very big inventory accumulation in August and early September. This, of course, suggests that when we start turning that corner, we\u2019re likely to have a pretty big inventory swing, probably bigger than is in the projection. I also agree with Nancy on the point that in the past [several] weeks we\u2018ve moved short-term rates almost 150 basis points; long-term rates in some cases [have risen] almost 50 basis points. I can\u2018t ever remember a month in which we\u2018ve moved rates more than that. We\u2019ve gotten a lot of bang for the buck in terms of the relationship of the relatively small move in the funds rate to the very big moves in the rest of the market. I think we have yet to see the effects on economic activity of the actions we have taken. So, I would come out the same place Dave did; I think we ought to behave a little differently going into a recession than we would behave in a continuing boom environment. All history teaches us that when the inventory accumulation starts to abate we will get a slackening in the aggregates. And I think the long-run track of the aggregates up to now has not been bad. Over the past 12 months [we\u2019ve had growth of] a little less than 5 percent on M1 and a little less than 8 percent on M2, and I think that\u2019s about what we would have wanted to come out with a year ago. So it seems to me that we ought to stand pat for the next month. As far as the discount rate is concerned, it seems to me that we ought to hold that in reserve in case we need to use it. In the event that we get a run on the dollar, it would be nice to have a symbolic gesture in the closet that would permit us to announce another 1 percentage point increase in the discount rate, which would attract a lot of attention in Europe and so on. So I would rather save that weapon for future use. As far as moral suasion is concerned, we might have had that as a part of the package last November 1, but I think it\u2019s much too late now. I think the recession will substitute for moral suasion", " MR. TIMLEN. Mr. Chairman, you expressed some interest in the discount rate actions at the Reserve Banks. Two weeks ago the directors of the [unintelligible] New York Bank voted a 114 percent increase in the discount rate. When the officers came in that morning, they were very troubled as to what our recommendation should be on the rate. There was some feeling to do nothing, some feeling to do a 114 point, and some feeling to do a 112 point. I think on balance the strongest sentiment was to take a small, but not insignificant step and therefore to recommend a 1/4 point. Well, later in the morning we heard that the projections on the monetary aggregates were reduced somewhat, so the officers decided on balance to propose that we wait a couple of weeks. Having made the recommendation to the directors that we do nothing [on the discount rate], the directors expressed some sentiment that it would be well to coordinate the action of the Bank with [developments] in the open market that were identified with the new Chairman, so that on their own initiative our directors moved and voted a 114 percentage point increase in the discount rate. [Our board] will be meeting on Thursday of this week and I would suspect with further market developments and administered rates, there might be some sentiment for something more than the action taken two weeks ago. As an aside, I might say that there\u2019s a good deal of talk in the markets in New York about the possibility of an impending credit crunch. As we look at 9/18/79 -26- the situation in the individual major banks, however, we can't find a commercial bank that may be faced with a credit crunch. In terms of the general situation, my views are very close to Governor Coldwell's. I don't think the situation is particularly dissimilar from the one we faced last month. Inflation is still for me a matter of major concern. The monetary aggregates still are on the high side, and the dollar--which I don't think Phil mentioned-- continues to be under recurring pressures in the foreign exchange markets. I must admit that we cannot overlook signs of weakness in the economy. Unemployment is edging up and there is the question of inventory accumulation. [It's unclear] whether there has been a correction in the automobile industry but that is a possibility. I think it's important that we not have the problem of a General Motors strike. We do have a problem that the settlement was expensive. I think it's important that the Federal Reserve not indicate that it is weakening in any respect in its resolve to fight inflation or restrain growth in the aggregates, so I would favor some further tightening at this time", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How much of that is the Susan B. dollar. There were $300 million of those going out beginning in July. M R .  BALLES. Well, in addition to the Sunbelt, the area west of the Rockies is not feeling very much if any recession yet. Aerospace, electronics, and agriculture in general are all quite strong. One indication is that the [volume of] help wanted ads in the Los Ancreles Times is almost unreal. The latest count that I heard from someone was 98 pages [of such ads1 in a recent Sunday edition. So a lot of jobs are going begging. We have had, of course, as is true around the nation, some decline in auto sales and in housing starts but considerably less percentage-wise than the country as a whole. AS far as the national outlook, we don\u2019t have any huge quarrel with the Board\u2018s staff view. We still expect the economy to bottom in the first half of 1980 and quite possibly in the first quarter. There\u2018s always the risk that things could get worse than our staff is now forecasting, but I\u2019m reserving judgment on that until we get some evidence that that\u2019s a likelihood. In addition to the input that we bring to these meetings and the usual sources of our own research staff and directors, last Friday when Vice Chairman Schultz visited us in San Francisco we called in a special small group of bankers, businessmen, and academicians for a very frank exchange of views. We sounded them out about their feelings on the economy and on Fed policy, and I must say, Fred, that I thought the reactions were quite candid and somewhat humiliating in a way. The bankers generally expressed the view that as yet there\u2019s very little evidence that the high level of interest rates is having any significant total effect on cutting off credit demand. Now, one has to add to that the expressions we got from them in our usual go- around with bankers and bank directors that these high rates are having a cutting effect on the so-called middle market for business borrowers--the smaller firms--and for mortgage loans and some small farmers. That\u2019s where the incidence of the high interest rate effect has been felt thus far in our part of the country. But as a general matter, even if the businessmen present were mostly from big concerns, they simply indicated that the higher rates per se are not having any effect at all on their capital projects. If a project is worthwhile, it\u2018s not going to get cut off by a one or two percentage point increase in the cost of funds. A minority expressed the view that this is leading to some greater caution on inventory policy, which is already being viewed as quite cautious. One major real estate developer present indicated that the higher rates are just built into their projects and aren\u2019t having any dampening effect at all. It was by the economists that we really got blasted. They came from Stanford, Berkeley, the University of California at Davis, and from a number of major banks in town. Quite frankly, they were highly critical of what they called pro-cyclical Fed policy and the extreme swings in the growth rates of money and credit that they\u2018ve witnessed over the past year--the very low rate from, say, October to 9/18/79 -28- March and the very high rate on balance from April to September. The clear majority view in that group--and the bank economists were quite similar to the academic economists--was that it's vital that we give more attention to that now than to what would be a more conventional counter-cyclical policy. My own view is that [we should make] an attempt at the gradualism that we announced several years ago. I remember your predecessor twice removed I guess, meaning Chairman Burns, [said] that the System's strategy would be to gradually lower the rate of monetary growth as a long-run strategy for getting inflation under control. What happened, I'm afraid, is that while the ranges have been brought down a little in the last several years, we've seen a great deal of evidence of the actual rates of monetary growth accelerating. I continue to feel, as I expressed last month, that we're going to get some automatic cushioning effect to this recession from fiscal policy, perhaps supplemented--there seems to be more and more talk about it [though I don't know] whether anything will happen or not--by discretionary tax cuts. So I lean toward the view that we may have to use monetary policy as the principal weapon to break inflationary expectations and to get some deceleration in the actual rate of inflation. Our directors clearly voted to increase the discount rate to reinforce what they thought should be a further snugging up in our efforts to get the rate of growth in the aggregates down somewhat. Almost fortuitously we've had a counter-cyclical policy since spring. If in fact the first quarter proves to have been the peak of the previous cycle, then in the second and third quarters we've had a counter-cyclical policy of considerable magnitude given the rate of monetary expansion that has taken place. And perhaps it's a bit too much to also get on top of the inflation problem. Bottom line I come out pretty much as Phil Coldwell, Henry Wallich, and Bob Black did. I think we should lean toward a little higher funds rate and a little better control in linking our short-term targets with our long-term targets if there's to be any success on the inflation front. I think it was last April, Steve--at just about the wrong time--that I raised with you in front of God and everybody here the fact that you had been overforecasting the rate of monetary growth. You sure got that fixed. Correct me if I'm wrong--1 don't have the exact figures with me--but I think month by month the Bluebook forecasts have in fact understated, and perhaps by a significant margin, the subsequent [monetary] growth we've experienced. I may again be raising that issue at the wrong time, but the recession will take care of that", " MR. BALLES. Until I see it, I guess I'm not going to believe it. I am concerned on balance that it may not have been bad that we had a real surge in monetary and credit expansion because of this recession. But I think we may have overdone that in view of the continued problem of getting inflation under control. So I would vote for a little snugging up", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey. M R .  GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to economic conditions in the Tenth District, we are enjoying--as others have said regarding the agricultural area--probably the finest crop in history. And it's a reality; most of it is already [harvested] or is ready to come into the bins. The problem has been more real in the sense that Bob Mayo mentioned; [producers] cannot move that crop, particularly to the port facilities for export, because of the shortage of rail cars as well as the Rock Island strike. It is putting some pressure upon the financial community to continue to finance inventories that had built up a year or two years before. But it also is fairly clear that some weakness is developing, particularly in retail sales--as affected by the auto situation--but also in residential sales. To my knowledge--and I have inquired around the region--1 can find no area within our District where any speculative houses are being built at the moment. Everything is being built on contract. If there is no contract, there is no building. Turning to my own view of the staff's expectations for the national economy, it seems to me that they are quite reasonable, though maybe a bit bullish. I would expect to have a bit deeper and more prolonged recession from the actions that have already been taken. Traditionally, when consumer expectations turn, they turn and don't come back very quickly. With regard to growth in the aggregates, as has been mentioned, to be sure over the year [Ell looks very reasonable at about 5.3 percent without ATS. I believe that is the figure. But equally important, it seems to me, both last month and again this month we've been looking at accelerating rates of growth in the aggregates. If you focus on M1, the staff projection is almost 10 percent for September. But I would like to point out that most of that has already occurred in the first two weeks of September. And two events have taken place, both the Social Security payment as well as the anticipation of the September 15 tax payment date. From here on out the staff projections are essentially flat. It would seem to me that if the seasonals play any part in the first two weeks of 9 / 1 8 / 7 9  -31- September--about which there seems to be some doubt--we may not be getting the aggregates growth now that we tried to react to in August. Lastly, I would join with others who have said that we have moved very rapidly. So it seems to me time to pause now to see [the effects of] what we've done. We talk about the 13 percent not cutting, but it hasn't been in place very long. People either had been committed before and haven't backed off or they haven't made judgments as to whether they're going to continue to borrow in the future. I would say that in the financial area of the Tenth District, the 13 percent rate has already taken a toll; several correspondent bankers have told me that at a 13+ percent rate they are withdrawing from requests to finance additional cattle operations simply because the economics don't pan out. As a result we could quite likely see in the future a withdrawal of the inventory levels of cattle that would have been coming on stream in the period ahead. In talking to staff and others and seeking advice, I would note that one person characterized the situation we're looking at right now as a situation akin to preparing a chicken for the table. That is, the chicken's activity increases substantially right after you cut off his head. If you react to that increased activity by striking with the ax again, that greatly increases the risk of damaging the meat. That may be exactly where we are now. So with that, I would propose that we stand pat at the moment with respect to the federal funds rate but use the discount rate for an announcement effect. As Willis pointed out, the discount rate has no real effect on market interest rate levels and the alignment issue is beginning to be a problem in our District. Thus, I would propose that the discount rate be raised at least 1/4 point, or perhaps 1/2 point", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. 9-1/2. All right, let me modify my suggestion for M2 to 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. Who wants to shoot", " MR. ROOS. I believe our range last month for M1 was 4 to 8 and you would adjust it to 3 to 8 percent. The 8 percent bothers me, Mr. Chairman, because that 8--when we add 1-1/2 for ATS--means we really would tolerate a 9-1/2 percent growth in M1 if we let M1 go to the top of these specifications. That's a heck of a growth rate if we're trying to correct the overshoot that we probably already have. That's my only reaction. I repeat that I really don't think [we should have] anything over 6-1/2 percent as the upper limit; the upper limit is much more important than the lower limit under the present circumstances", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we're not so far from that on the current projection. It's just a matter of judgment. At this particular phase in the business cycle, should we be moving more than that without at least having a telephone call. I don't think there is any question about that", " MR. COLDWELL. I have no objections to having a telephone call. I'm a little bothered about saying that [Ml growth] has to be at 8 percent [before we confer] because I think 8 is too high. If it means that we've got to go up to 11-3/4 percent, then I'd rather take the decision now that we're going to go to 11-3/4 percent if [Ml growth] is up in that area", " MR. BLACK. Phil, what would your preference be on ranges", " MR. COLDWELL. I wouldn't mind the 11-3/4 percent top on it, Tom. if we were going to use that top as [Ml growth] moved up toward the 8 percent. But I wouldn't require it to get to 8 percent before we use [the top of the funds range]", " MR. PARTEE. If I had my preference, I would put 9 percent as the top because I think we will have a large [number in] September. [Ml growth1 will be probably on the order of 10 percent; it could be 12 or it could be 8 or something like that. Why, when October [Ml growth] is moving down, would we raise the funds rate. There's an inconsistency about the whole thing. Also, I might point out that a 9 percent increase in money with the rate of inflation that we have and cannot stop--it will be there in fuel and in food prices over this period--is not a terribly high increase in the money supply", " MS. TEETERS. I would go with 3 percent [as the lower limit] and I would put 9 percent [as the top]. I think your proposal is being pretty [forceful] in putting it so low. I have noticed that the aggregates only work on the up side. During the long period of time the money supply was declining, we ignored the bottom level of [the M1 range] for six solid months--for [apparently] good reasons. I didn't think it was the right thing to do at that time. But we only seem to get excited when M1 growth goes over the top of its range rather than when it goes to the floor", " MR. BALLES. Well, I guess I could live with the ranges that you proposed, Mr. Chairman, if we had an aggregates directive. When I keep in mind that part of the proposal was a money market directive that does bother me. [I say that] simply in the sense that at some point if we have any intent at all of coming within even the upper end of the ranges we\u2019ve specified--and I think we\u2019ve got to do that if we\u2018re going to make any progress gradually on inflation--we\u2019re going to have to do something to keep from moving farther and farther away from both the midpoints and the upper end. So I\u2019d like to throw out the possibility, while we\u2018re still in the discussion phase here, of an aggregates directive to accompany these ranges that we\u2019ve talked about. On the federal funds rate specifically, I would join those who think we ought to set the range a little higher, at 11-1/4 to 12 percent", " 9/18/79 -40- MR. BLACK. I do too, Bob, but we have had year after year of excessive growth and at some point we have to act in the short run if the long run is going to come out right. And I don't think we have, though recently we've done pretty well", " MR. EASTBURN. I would support Alternative B, but I do think the arguments for a discount rate increase are good and I\u2019d be prepared to recommend that", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, there\u2018s no question that on the aggregates 3 to 8 percent is the [best compromise for M11. It hits both the majority and the midpoint of all the concerns; there are some higher and some lower, but there is a majority for that. It\u2019s the same for M2 at 6-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent. The difference of opinion lies more on where to put the upper point of the [funds range]. There was some dissent perhaps, but the great majority wanted to or are willing to go to 11-1/2 percent now. There is some difference of opinion on the upper point of the range; there is one who disagreed on the lower end of the range. I count 5 who would like to go higher on the upper end. And there is obviously a disagreement on the [selection of an] aggregates or money market directive. I would just make two comments, both of which have already been made. One is [that it\u2018s hard to] go much lower on the aggregates ranges if we\u2019ve got two high weeks in September already. Even if the rest of September comes out on the low side, it\u2019s got to get pretty damn low. And if we go down very far on that aggregate, we would be raising rates. There\u2019s quite clearly a possibility of raising rates in the midst of a pronounced decline in the growth of the aggregates from week to week. I question whether we want to do that. The other comment is on the aggregates against the money market directive. There may be a difference; I find it hard to see what the difference is on the up side. I see some difference on the down side. With an aggregates directive we might [move the funds 9/18/79 -42- rate] down more rapidly and sharply if the [aggregates] came in weak. But if we had 8 percent on the up side and we\u2019re at 7 percent to start with, then the difference [of opinion] may be, if it stays at I percent, [whether] we go up still further. I think that is the only substantive difference and it is a substantive difference. I guess I contemplated in my proposal that 11-1/2 percent is in fact above the midpoint, so we would already have gone above the midpoint and we would not move any further if the projection remained unchanged. It would take a further increase in the aggregates projection to raise the federal funds rate all other things equal, including the exchange market and everything else that might influence what we do. That\u2018s what the argument is about, as I see it, apart from the difference on the down side. Do you want to go above the 11-1/2 without the current aggregates projection for the two-month period changing. If it went up as much as a percentage point, we might go up under either formulation [of the directive]. If it stayed the same, on my original formulation we presumably wouldn\u2018t move. If the people who favor an aggregates directive mean that we should move under that circumstance, you ought to say so. I think that\u2019s what they would be voting for. I don\u2019t think this difference is enormous. M R .  STERNLIGHT. We\u2018d also appreciate some guidance as to the Committee\u2019s feeling if [the projection] went up something less than that full percentage point. I know these are fine lines to draw, but we have to make those decisions", " MR. COLDWELL. Even to 11-3/4 percent", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You don\u2019t like either one", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don\u2019t notice any upswelling of support", " MR. ALTMA\u201d.

COYNE. Peter, this is Joe Coyne. We Will be Saying \"absolutely ridiculous"], "1979FOMC19791006meeting.txt": [" MR. MORRIS. Well, I don't have a measure of credit crunch but I do have measures of the funds rate and the rate of growth in the money supply, and the behavior of those is quite similar. M R .  BAUGHMAN. My recollection is that we had a very different situation with respect to credit availability but I was told just recently that a bank from Chicago was working diligently in an eastern area to round up business loans. We wouldn't have had that, I think, in 1975", " MR. WALLICH. That is hardly speculative although it's a little speculative. In '74 it was virulent. M R .  COLDWELL. In '74 we had a constraint in terms of capacity that we haven't faced to a big degree. M R .  BALLES. To follow up on what Ernie said, I've had conversations in some depth with various directors over the last week and whether they're businessmen or bankers they report essentially the same story--that the present level of interest rates, in contrast to the situation generally in '74, is just not deterring borrowing in any way that they can see. country; small businesses and farmers are in a big cash flow bind. But medium- and larger-size companies, according to the companies themselves as well as their bankers, just don't blink at this level of interest rates. They just go ahead and borrow anyway. I don't think we're approaching the credit crunch type of situation that we had in '74. I think that's one of the big differences", " MR. PARTEE. I might make a general comment, Paul. I approach the situation a little differently than Phil does. And I don\u2018t pay as much attention to foreign and international aspects as 10/6/79 -13 you do. The thought I would like to emphasize or underline is uncertainty. I think the staff forecast--which I believe is not that much different from the forecast of the Council [of Economic Advisers] or from those one sees in standard private market services--is quite plausible. We certainly do have a lack of final demand right now. We certainly do have a decline in real income and we are going to continue to have a decline in real income. And today, at least in Washington, the winter heating season is beginning. The drain on purchasing power from that is going to be much greater on a seasonally unadjusted basis over the coming six months or so. There will be less money available for everything. So it's fairly reasonable to think that there is going to be a recession trend rather promptly, one that develops and continues over the winter and into the spring. If that's so, why of course we are going to want to try to keep the monetary aggregates growing. And we will have a sudden shift in our problem, which will be overly slow growth rather than overly rapid growth in the aggregates. That's one scenario. On the other hand, I was extremely bothered by the market developments of the last two weeks. I think the spreading of the gold [market psychology] into the more remote metals is very bothersome. Silver we understand and platinum we understand, but the spreading to copper, zinc, and lead is very bothersome. And not only grains but a number of other futures prices were moving [up], with no real justification for those moves. It leaves one with the thought that because of a run from currency--a desire to get into goods and out of money--we might have now a new development in our economic experience that would lead to a \"last gasp\" round of demand for goods, probably most intensively for inventory. That might last 2 or 3 months or it might last 4 or 5 months. It's very limited but it could last for a while. And then when the recession occurs, it will be much deeper because in addition to having to adjust to the lower level of final demand, people will have to liquidate inventory. They will move from inventory accumulation to decumulation and we will have a recession that is more like 1975 or perhaps worse than that. If that's the case, for the next few months or during the period in which there's this anxiety and concern about possibly moving from money into goods, it is very important to restrain the growth in the aggregates, and we could be talking about significantly higher interest rates. With that uncertainty, it seems to me that our traditional method, which is to estimate the short-term market rates that will adjust the demand functions for various kinds of money on a lag structure, has [inherent in] it the danger that we are going to miss. [Either] we will miss an intensification in the demand for money and be behind the gun, as we have tended to be here over the last six months, or we will miss a decline in the demand for money and overstay and be behind the gun, as we traditionally have done [going] into recessions. It's an extremely dangerous, risky proposition to change our operating mode. We have tried it a couple of times. We had RPDs back in the early '70s and we had that experiment a few years ago. For one reason or another--and we know the reasons--they didn't work. But even though it is extremely risky, I think it's the less risky course than to stay with our traditional system. So my emphasis is on uncertainty and the need to be aware of the fact that we no longer can specify interest rates given this uncertainty, rather than our need to tighten up or anything like that at this time", " MR. EASTBURN. I\u2018m thinking partly in terms of the public impact that this will have. If the impression is conveyed that this is something we are just trying, I really don\u2019t think it will have the impact on credibility that we need to have. CIiAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe we lose some, but in this particular situation I don\u2019t think we lose the whole [impact] or anywhere near that. We may lose 10 to 20 percent of it. Let me comment on a point that has come up a couple of times. I don\u2019t think we are talking about a program here just to support the dollar. I know [different] people place different emphases on that. The dollar is part of the total situation, but I think this is really all one ball of wax at this point. The psychology in the foreign markets is the same as the psychology at home; it is reflected in the metals markets. It is the inflationary psychology or whatever. So I don\u2019t think of this as a program specifically directed to the foreign side. If anything, it\u2019s specifically directed toward the domestic side, but it will have foreign repercussions. One oE the interesting questions--it\u2019s very hard to express and I don\u2019t know the answer--is whether the new approach will carry a message of its own even in the international markets. I would be a little more optimistic [on that score] than some of the comments I just heard. There has been a great deal of discussion about the money supply and the feeling that so much of this psychology is related to the fact that the money supply is out of control. That\u2019s the comment we hear all the time. The virtue of a new approach, if it has one, is that we are accepting--with all its risks and dangers--more of a focus on the money supply. I think that is understandable at that kind of gross level. I have a list here [of people who have indicated a desire to comment], so maybe I will [proceed] in an orderly way. John", " Roger Guffey MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe almost everybody who has spoken up until now has said that they would endorse the change in operating procedures. I'd just like to raise a voice, not necessarily in opposition to it but at least to question it. First of all, let me say that I agree that there's a need for something to be done today and that it has to be rather dramatic. Hopefully, it would include the Treasury, but if that's not in the works then we have to move ahead. But if I understand what is being proposed--the change in operating technique--it seems to me a very high risk venture, particularly in view of the fact that it has never been tried. To be sure, it has been studied to death. Moreover, I happen to be somewhat sympathetic to this kind of operating technique. But we are in a time of crisis. For us to move to a new technique that has never been tried will be viewed by the markets, it seems to me, as our grasping at the last straw, so to speak. And if indeed it doesn't work to get the aggregates in better position by the end of this year I think we would have shot our last round and missed. I think that's putting the Federal Reserve as a system in a very, very precarious position. Lastly, if I understand what is being proposed, I would say that the very same thing can be accomplished by using our present operating procedures simply by broadening the federal funds range and narrowing the aggregates ranges. We would have as much chance--or perhaps more chance because we have experience with it--of hitting the targets we're shooting at instead of starting to swim in new and untried waters. If we can get the public reaction that we're trying to get by operating with our present procedures, I would prefer to go that route rather than go into something that we know very little about. I happen to believe that we may be on the verge of moving into a recession but it isn't clear. And I think we do need some dramatic action. I would rather see a press announcement by you framed in the context of having a wider range for the federal funds rate, which certainly will be understood by the market though maybe not by the public. And it will probably be better understood by the market than our moving into a new operating procedure. That coupled together with a rather dramatic increase in the discount rate--and letting the fed funds rate move up to a fairly high level--would be a preferable action to me. However, I do recognize, as you mentioned earlier, that it's absolutely essential that we have a broad consensus [on whatever action we take today]. Accordingly, I will [not object1 if a consensus forms on the other side", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just make a couple of comments. I\u2018m not sure it\u2019s self-evident that in interest rate terms the new technique is stronger. It may or may not be, depending upon what happens to the money supply. I think that is inherent in the new techniqde. It also depends upon a judgment on how much traditional- type action we would take and I don\u2019t think at this stage of the discussion we know the answer to those [questions]. We\u2019ll never know the answer, no matter how long we talk, to what the money supply actually will do in coming months. And until we get further along in our conversation, we don\u2019t know how strong our traditional-type actions will be", " MR. BAUGHMAN. M r .  Chairman, i picked up on your earlier observation that we can get there either way--with some modification of our present technique or by shifting emphasis to reserves to a greater degree. I\u2019m somewhat inclined to think that if we do announce that we have made a rather basic change in our mode of operation--in our intermediate if not ultimate operational target--that unless it obviously is a disaster fairly soon, it is something we are stuck with for some period of time. I don\u2019t have any strong feeling as to which way we try to get where it seems we want to go at the moment. We can do it through the route of a monetary aggregates directive under our present format, with a broad range for the federal funds rate, lifted, and with a continued focus on targets set in terms of monetary aggregates. Or we can go the route that is suggested in the wire of 10/6/79 -21- putting greater emphasis essentially on intermediate targets or reserves. [Secretary's note: The memo entitled \"Proposal for Reserve Aggregates as Guide to Open Market Operations,\" dated October 4, 1979 was wired to Reserve Bank Presidents.] But it seems to me that there's a good possibility that if we adopt that [latter approach] we will be read as de-emphasizing rather than additionally emphasizing the monetary aggregates as targets or objectives of policy", " MR. WINN. Paul, during this past period, the rumors were everywhere. One of the ones that bothers me the worst is the feeling of an explosion on the wage front. For example, we see banks violating the guidelines pretty generally. knowledgeable friends seem to be predicting 20 percent increases next year and that really frightens me. They all had solutions with respect to what we ought to be doing. But they never have as a solution that we should do nothing. So I've tried to [assess] what the risks and implications are of doing nothing in this area and that was rather frightening. Being s-ympathetic to what you're proposing, I wonder if we really have tried to look at the risks inherent in this. We've talked about the price on the international side and so forth, but what are some of the risks here. While we say we don't emphasize interest rates, the implication of this [proposal] is considerably higher rates. And if we think about that, what does that mean at least in the short run in terms of money flows. What does that mean in terms of those with prime plus 3 percent embedded in their costs. What does it mean to those institutions with short-term funding. What does it mean in terms of the commitments and lines of bank credit that will be accelerated. In other words, what are the risks on this side that we have to grapple with as well as the risks that we've talked about on the other side", " Some of us are not professional economists and to sign off on specific numbers and specific details today - - CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will make two comments, Mr. Roos. I don\u2019t think it would be more productive because I hope the Committee as a whole, at this particular meeting at least, will not get into that detail. We will be in an absolute morass if we attempt to arrive at some judgment as to whether the staff has made all these translations correctly and on precisely how we should proceed. If we decide to go on this approach, I believe we are going to have to go on it with the Committee indicating only broad guidelines. There is enough judgment involved that we can get a good sense of how the Committee wants this process to operate in a very uncertain world. And even in a two-week perspective, I don\u2019t think we can attempt to have a technical resolution of all these detailed issues. There will be plenty of opportunity for that kind of [analysis] in the next few months and it would be relevant in terms of any further decision at the end of the year on whether or not to stay with this procedure. But inherent in the situation today, and I\u2018ll just put it very simply, the Committee has to have faith that it can give some general guidance and that we--basically the staff here at the Board under Mr. Axilrod\u2019s direction--will translate that as best they can, within these general parameters, into operational numbers. And then, it has to have faith that Mr. Sternlight will use his best judgment in taking the figures that are produced here [in Washington] and deciding on precisely which day he will provide how many reserves to the market", " MR. ROOS. Well, I thought we were going to get into the numbers. I was off base there", " MR. ROOS. Right, but not any more precise figures. What I'm worried about, for example--and I'm not trying to get specific--is the 8 percent monetary base figure referred to in this document. Our research staff said that if the people who watch this saw an 8 percent figure for monetary base growth, that would immediately destroy the credibility of the whole effort", " MR. COLDWELL. MI. Chairman, I wonder if we shouldn\u2019t at least make the initial decision if you are ready to go that far. Or if you want to discuss the specifications, which M r .  Axilrod can [expound on], we can go that route. ought to discuss specifications. But in my mind, at this point we\u2019ve made no decision to go in this direction. I think that\u2019s a decision we should make at the end oE the road, and citing some specifications may put some concreteness on this discussion in terms of whether we want to tolerate the risk. I just want to come back at the end to the question that M r .  Guffey put very well in stating the other case. There is a danger of a too high [funds] rate and there is a question of all this publicity and then falling short. There are these analytic difficulties: the instability in the demand function for money and the [multiplier] relationships that we work with. There is the problem that we may run into a situation where, in effect, our collective judgment tells us to do something different than what the aggregates are telling us to do. Do we want to get locked into a procedure that prejudices us so far toward worrying about the aggregates. Those are the questions that should be in our minds, questions we want to return to before making a final decision here. [We need to weigh that] against the knowledge that we can do something very comparable, to the best of our wisdom, by devising a package using the traditional technique--or the traditional technique as modified somewhat to accomplish the same immediate purpose. So that\u2019s the final question. But let\u2019s [proceed]", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if we adopt this approach, that is one of the issues I had in mind when I suggested that the Reserve Bank Presidents might want to meet for further discussion this afternoon. One of the problems with this approach, it seems to me, is that the administration of the discount window is very confused at the moment. Inherent in the way we have been operating--to put it bluntly--there is no legitimate reason to borrow. Banks borrow because of the rate spread, but that's not really a legitimate reason. Now, that ignores computer breakdowns and that kind of thing. Except for accidental circumstances or late on a Wednesday--and here I'm talking about the larger banks--under our present guidelines there really isn't a legitimate reason for banks to borrow from the discount window, as I understand it. I know I have had the experience in New York where the discount officer happily comes in to tell me that he called up bank x, which borrowed for the first time in six months, a few hundred million dollars. He asked them why they were borrowing. And the bank official cautiously says: \"What the hell, I hadn't borrowed in a while and your rate looked pretty low.\" And the discount officer replies: \"Well, you can't borrow for that reason.\" Now, if a Reserve Bank really enforces that kind of discipline, it doesn't get many borrowings. But it's obviously not enforced evenly. And I suspect there are no additional guidelines we can give the discount officers at the moment. We have to let events take their course. We have been doing it for years, and I suppose we can do it for a few more months. It will raise this question in the bankers' minds. I think we will have to develop a more coherent policy in a few months and it might be useful for the Presidents to think about these implications", " MR. EASTBURN. There is a question here of how the Reserve Banks should report all this to their boards of directors. I think some of the sharper directors will raise questions about what the role of the discount rate is and what their role is with respect to this new mechanism. We are going to need to consider this. My guess would be that we\u2019d view this as a special program for a special period and that we\u2019d probably want to handle it more through the administration of the window than to develop a whole new procedure to make the discount rate a flexible one", " MS. TEETERS. I think Phil\u2019s target [proposal] is too strict. In a sense, he\u2019s choking [the money supply]. And that seems to me ridiculous, given the underlying state of the economy as we see it. I think if we aimed to be within the upper part of the range [for the year]--aimed for 4.6 percent [for September to December]--we\u2019d tend to offset the dangers of putting this economy into an actual tailspin. It\u2019s all right to control the money supply, but we don\u2018t have to cut it off completely, Phil, which is what your proposal would do for the last two months of the year", " MR. PARTEE. I must say that I agree with Nancy. If this is the nature of the detail, then I can\u2018t agree to it", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We might affect deposits in that week. M R .  BLACK. And that\u2018s really what we are after, so I don\u2018t really think [money supply growth] is in the bag for October, Chuck. M R .  COLDWELL. I don\u2019t either", " MR. BLACK. I agree that this is not going to affect it a lot, but conceptually it isn\u2019t in the bag yet", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it\u2019s a matter of degree. We have two proposals: one for 3 percent M1 growth and one for 4.6 percent. M R .  MAYO. I would like to throw a third one on the table. I\u2019d make it 4 percent. I think we need to shade it, but I don\u2019t want to shade it as much as Phil suggested. M R .  BLACK. I\u2019m getting confused here", " 10/6/79 -41- CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me note that we have other instruments for biasing at the start, including the discount rate that the Board is going to have to decide upon here. If we raise the discount rate substantially, we are going to get an upward movement in the funds rate in the short run", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have to discuss that. Obviously, all these things have to be decided. But for myself, when I look at this potential package, I think there is enough risk of confusion in 10/6/79 -42- the announcement that an increase in the discount rate of 1 percentage point would be highly salutary in terms of our immediate objective. Intellectually, though, you can argue the other point. I just don't know whether we want to take the risk in the initial announcement of a possible interpretation that we don't really mean it. That's the problem that I see", "2 billion now CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's say $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. I would feel quite differently, frankly, about that borrowing level without a discount rate change. I think we would probably lose too much without the discount rate change. Without the discount rate change I'd put in a much bigger bias on the borrowing side initially, in effect, to force the discount rate change very quickly. But the more I think about it, the other way of doing it--announcing a discount rate change with the package--seems much safer. With that kind of initial discount rate change, I think we can be relatively moderate in biasing on the borrowing. It wouldn't immediately force another discount rate change. So, that's somewhat of a \"family\" [of potential actions]", " It matters to you, Henry, if it goes down MR. WALLICH. Yes", " MR. MORRIS. If we are in that situation, the Chairman can have a telephone conference and we can discuss whether we want to stay locked in or not. M R .  BALLES. The staff paper did recommend a range of 3 to 5 points didn\u2019t it, Steve", " MR. AXILROD. Yes. I don\u2019t know about Peter--he can speak for himself--but I feel very strongly that if we are in any way going to be held responsible for this operating technique working out, a very wide federal funds rate range is necessary", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have a real conflict here in terms of the way we want to place our risks. I must say that pretty consistently in my own thinking I come down on the side of not wanting to let this federal funds rate go out of sight by accident in the initial stages. Now, that\u2019s a matter of judgment. And the general tenor of the plan, of course, is to take whatever punishment--if that\u2019s what it is--quickly and get it over with so rates can come down and that\u2019s an offset. For once let\u2019s get ahead of the market expectation in a sense and get in a position to [move rates] down, which is the other side of the coin. But we are going into unknown territory and there is a limit as to where my own sangfroid gives out here", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. That's what would appear in the formal record, whether or not we consulted later. Then in starting off, I would suggest a mild further bias. I think the discount rate 10/6/79 -46- in a sense is a bias to start with, at least to get the federal funds rate up. And there\u2019s a bias in the sense that these projections, if they mean anything, are based upon a lower level of interest rates. So by getting the interest rate up we\u2019ve biased it some already. I would suggest a mild further bias--for about 2 weeks maybe--and I could express that in one of two ways. We just take the operating flexibility depending upon how things develop. as a slightly higher level of borrowings, as we discussed before. But even that I don\u2019t think is necessarily essential, if as things developed it appeared that the federal funds rate in fact was settling down around 13 percent plus or minus. In other words, I\u2019m saying let\u2019s bias it enough, if we have to, to get that kind of federal funds rate originally if it doesn\u2019t go up there by itself. Or, if it goes beyond that by itself, we probably don\u2019t need any bias in the borrowing component. Now, that\u2019s just going to be a matter of judgment in this early period. Peter is looking quizzical and wondering how he can make all these judgments every day. And he might miss. Inherent in this operating procedure is the possibility that the rate might be much higher or lower", " MR. AXILROD. Well, in a way I\u2019m a little puzzled because our knowledge of the relationships comes through a whole span of rates. As we get to very high rates, it may be that banks\u2018 willingness to borrow becomes stronger. If their willingness to borrow is about the way it has been, I would be thinking about $1.5 billion. But the banks may become more willing to borrow and we may have to think of a higher level of borrowing for the same federal funds rate", " MR. COLDWELL.

I do, too M R .  MAYO. Paul, one of the problems with the alternative is that we either adopt a wide range or start with a funds rate that's already above where it is now. In other words, if it's at a little less than 12 percent now, and we put our range at 12-1/2 to 14 percent or whatever you suggested, that raises another difficulty. Maybe it's mechanical. But from a realistic standpoint we almost have to widen the range on the alternative", " MR. PARTEE. Yes", " Except for the press conference MR. ROOS.

If the weight is 8 percent and you get a 40 percent [price] increase, that\u2019s more than 3 percent of GNP. Why doesn\u2019t it have a 3 percent impact on GNP", " MR. PARTEE. With respect to Governor Coldwell\u2018s question, in your additive process you haven\u2019t really included any dynamics in the business effects. That is, there must be a point at which another 3/4 percentage point decline in real consumption would have a material impact on inventories and capital spending that would run through the economy in an accelerated way", " MR. KICHLINE. That\u2019s right. The 3/4 point effect, for example, this year did not carry through fully to our price forecast. It\u2019s roughly 1/2 percent. So we have weaker activity as a result of higher world oil prices and in fact we assume that\u2018s going to have an impact in other areas in the domestic economy. M R .  WILLES. Now I\u2019m confused--not that I wasn\u2018t before. I thought that when you calculated the U.S. deflator the price of imported goods [always] came in with a negative sign", " MR. PARTEE. You mean rational expectations are an empty box", " MR. AXILROD. Yes", " MR. RICE. But that is the most likely rate of increase", " MR. PARTEE. How much correction does \"C\" make on that. What is the growth rate under \"C\" from December to January", " MR. AXILROD. In \"C,\" from December to January it's 4.4 percent. We assumed that the Committee would be restraining growth a bit below path in the first quarter, so we have it below and then coming back up. So in January M1 is a little below that 6 percent path. These are all things the Committee can adjust, but that's the assumption we made if you went to alternative C. M R .  PARTEE. So you'd have 4.4 percent for January. Then that means you would have something under 4-1/2 percent for the 4 months. And for the 3 months from October to January growth would be about 4-1/2 percent, I guess", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. By that time I presume we'll have complicated it all by having a new definition of the money supply", " MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, from my standpoint it seems probable that the economy is going to decline. To me the timing still is a bit [uncertain] as to whether that is going to occur in the fourth quarter or the first. quarter. But I think the chances are high that the fundamentals will bring the economy to a lower rate of growth and probably to negative gEowth. How much of a negative, I\u2018m not prepared to say at the moment. I think there is a good possibility that we might have a fairly sizable negative in the first and second quarters of next year. The place where I would quarrel a bit with the forecast is in the consumption area. I think there is still some resilience out there in terms of the rate of change in consumption expenditures, possibly even by making use of some [increase in] debt, although there it is difficult to see how that can stretch much further than it is stretched. An overriding problem that I see is that even in the staff forecast we are looking at a 10 percent rate of inflation for at least the next nine months and maybe further than that depending upon some ocher things, including the potential for a very nasty OPEC decision. In terms of the economy, I would mention one other thing. While we did get some curtailment in the rate of bank credit growth, the curtailment was from a 22 percent rate of increase to 18 percent or something like that. we\u2019ve missed our guess on that by a very [large] margin. I believe our forecast on bank credit growth was something like 7-1/2 to 10-1/2 percent or some range in that neighborhood, so [actual growth] is almost double that. I don\u2018t find, as I wander around, any real stringency yet. There\u2018s an awful lot of talk about the price [of credit] bringing things under control [both] in terms of mortgage rates and I think to some considerable extent a usury problem in certain states, but liquidity still seems reasonably adequate for other kinds o f  [expenditures]. S o  my preference would be to tilt [policyl a little on the tight side now, given the prospects for next year, trying to make sure that we don\u2019t have a further expansion [in the aggregates], which might bring us to even higher rates of inflation. I\u2019d like to keep the Committee\u2019s focus on the inflation side for the moment. I do think the chances of [recession] are high next year; and we will have to face the problem of to what extent we allow the rates to go down next year. But I don\u2019t like the possibility of those rates going down now, not only because of the potential [effects on the domestic side1 for this quarter but also because of the international side", " MR. WILLES. I have to admit that I don\u2019t know what\u2018s going to happen to the real economy. I\u2019m not sure I even know how to go 11/20/79 -20- about predicting that at the moment because it seems to me that it depends so much on what OPEC does and what the Congress does and lots of other things. I will go on to say, which will be no news to some of you, that in terms of policy it\u2019s not clear to me that it makes any difference what the real sector does over the next twelve months because I\u2019m not sure that we have any demonstrated ability to have an impact on that--in a predictable way anyway. Therefore, for slightly different reasons, I end up exactly where Phil did in terms of focusing on inflation as the primary objective. In terms of how we should do that, I have great concern about the process that we are using. It\u2019s not that I think we made a mistake in going to reserves. I think that\u2018s a tremendous step forward. But I\u2019m not sure we have done that in such a way that we are likely to have a reasonably good chance of being successful. One of the things that we know is that if we change substantially the way we conduct policy, that is going to change people\u2019s behavior. Therefore, all of the old statistical relationships that we have been able to look at in the past--relationships between interest rates and reserves and monetary aggregates and so on--might well be in the process of changing because we have changed our focus presumably from interest rates to reserves. So all of the discussion that we have about trying to pick a monetary aggregates target and then backing away from that step by step to figure out what the reserves ought to be and the associated interest rates and so on, just strikes me as being backwards. It seems to me that the only reasonable prospect we have of really making it work is to start at the other end and say, okay let\u2018s fix reserves and then let the system adjust to that. Clearly, we don\u2019t know exactly what impact that is going to have because we don\u2018t have any functions that are relevant in the new environment. But it doesn\u2019t seem to me that a lot of the things we have been talking about--unless we are lucky--are going to lead us to any kind of predictable result either in terms of the aggregates or in terms of interest rates. So I just feel very uncomfortable with the nature of the discussion that we are having in terms of how we hope to reach a policy decision. I can construct, given the kinds of conversations we have had so far, a relatively simple model that would say that what we would end up with are reserves that are totally demand determined. And it seems to me that we are trying to do just the opposite of that. We are trying to make reserves and, therefore, the aggregates supply determined. Yet the mechanisms we have set up would have just the opposite result. some things we have said this morning, I hope either today or in the near future we can discuss in detail the experiment that we are trying. I say that because it\u2018s not clear to me, regardless of what the ultimate objectives we set are, that we stand a very good chance of getting exactly where we want to go unless we just turn out to be lucky", " MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I think I can endorse a great deal of what has been said. I would like to make it very clear that I don't think we have any more control of the aggregates than when we were operating on an interest rate target. Yet the media and I think some of my colleagues here think that we have run out and put our hands directly on the aggregates; I don't think that's true. I agree with Mark that the fact that we've changed [our approach] is going to change the relationships. of difficulty and there is going to come a time when we are going to fail. We were lucky last month that it turned out the way it did. So, keep in mind as we are making policy that we aren't out there directly determining the Ms. And I'm a little concerned that when we begin to want to expand the money supply we will provide the reserves and there won't be any response in the money supply down the line. I believe we are going to have a great deal I am also very concerned about the consumer. There is no housing money; [financial intermediaries] are loaned up. I think our policy should basically be steady as you go at the present time. I would not want to force the banks to borrow any more than $1-1/2 billion under alternative B because I do think the economy is going to turn down. And when it does, I think it's going to drop very suddenly. When people get the first monthly bill for heating oil it is going to hit us. I think there is going to be a gasoline shortage again and I feel that people quite possibly are going to be very conservative at Christmas. I would come out in support of alternative B with $1-112 billion of borrowings and I would increase the federal funds rate. In other words, I favor a \"B-minus\" policy", " Question: You are associating $2 billion of borrowing with alternative C as-- MR. MORRIS. I said initially $1-1/2 billion", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There are different kinds o f  [auto] credit, [do you mean] consumer credit or dealer credit", " MR. WALLICH. I have no quarrel with the staff's forecast, though I think there is at least a possibility that the OPEC decision will be less adverse than they think. In Europe there seems to be a feeling that oil is reasonably plentiful and, therefore, that the ability to raise [its price] rather drastically is less", " MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think it's pretty obvious that the Iranian crisis has potentially great implications for the domestic outlook--[morel than the mere availability of petroleum supplies. But absent that problem, I would think the staff's forecast would be about right. If I had to guess which way the error might be, I would think the economy might be somewhat weaker than they are projecting. It's certainly true that the economy has shown amazing resilience up until now. I guess inventories are in better shape than they were this time in the 1973-74 downturn. But when I look at the weakness in housing and hear a talk like Frank Morris gave us on the resistance to rates and about the lack of availability of funds, I think housing is going to be quite weak. I think the consumer is pretty well over-extended. I gathered an interesting observation from the chief executive officer of He said that consumer loan demand had virtually dried up at is their consumer financing company, but was still present at the bank. I asked him if this related to the type of customer the two institutions have. He allowed as how he didn't know but said that might be part of it. And finally, I would think that if we made an error on the [forecast] of net exports, they would probably be weaker than we had guessed because of the increasing restrictiveness of monetary policy abroad and the generally unsettled international climate. Turning to the policy side, I think the most important task is for us to hit our long-run targets. I agree, as someone said earlier, that we can probably do that pretty well with any of these alternatives. Certainly we ought to hit the M1 and M3 targets with any of them and I believe we'd come pretty close on M2 with any of them. Bank credit I guess we are going to miss altogether. So I don't think that there's a lot to choose from in view of the short period left, as Emmett Rice mentioned. I have a marginal preference for \"B.\" My only concern with \"B\" is that the lower limit on the federal funds rate range might be a little high at 11-1/2 percent. Now, last time I argued that we ought not to put that below 11-1/2 percent because I thought we had a credibility problem. And I felt that if [the funds rate] came down before we demonstrated any control over the aggregates, we'd have a real problem. But I do think we have gained considerable credibility at this point and also the economy looks weaker. So against that background, although I'm somewhat 11/20/79 -32- concerned over what Henry and Scott said earlier about the foreign reaction, I think the reserve growth needed to achieve alternative B may well entail more federal funds rate movement on the down side than some might expect. I think the rate might have to go below current rates by a fairly significant level so I would want to lower that lower limit to 10-1/2 percent. I guess I\u2019d stay with 15-1/2 percent for the high end, but I surely wouldn\u2019t object to raising that. I might be wrong on this and I would suggest that maybe we ought to have a telephone conference if the funds rate approaches either of those limits", " MR. MAYO. I object", " MS. TEETERS. And I think the language to be released this week is 4-1/2 percent [but that] somewhat less than that [would be acceptable]", " MS. TEETERS. And for \"C", " MR. WALLICH. I think December would be much too early for a decline in interest rates in line with trying to say that this should 11/20/79 -39- go hand in hand with [what is happening with] the economy and with inflation", " MR. COLDWELL. Then we ought to stay at 4-l/2 and 7-1/2 percent instead of going to 5 and 8-1/2 percent", " MR. AXILROD", " MR. BLACK. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s responsive to John\u2019s question, really", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Then why is your projection higher than the track we estimated last time", " But their estimate may be no good, so-- MR. WALLICH. Well, I could take the second", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have alternatives 1, 2, and 3. The borrowing level is the same in all of these for simplicity. So all we're talking about is these other numbers. One is an arithmetic compromise between \"B\" and \"C, half way between \" B \"  and \"C\" straight out. The other is a more flexible interpretation between \"B\" and \"C\" and would depend in practice presumably on what happens in November, which we can't control any more. M R .  WALLICH. That would probably protect better against unexpected drops in the funds rate because we can go all the way to the \" C \"  specifications", " CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The next alternative is two. Four with myself. And the other one is the Axilrod version, which I guess is not [anyone's first choice.] Well, it looks like it's 8 to 4 [in favor of the first one]", " MR. WALLICH. I wanted two.

The meeting might be moved because of various developments of an unforeseen character but particularly it may be convenient in terms of the new money supply figures and all the rest. If nothing is happening that suggests that we need to review things with urgency and if the [new] money supply figures will be in better shape and clearer with two weeks more [of work on them]--and we will have the advantage of knowing the OPEC decision and we won't have that on December 18th--then I'd be inclined to change it.

It would just be easier in planning if we could fix on one or the other as the dominant one. I\u2019m happy to go to January.
