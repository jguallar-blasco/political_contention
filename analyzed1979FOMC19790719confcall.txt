FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEECONFERENCE CALLJuly 19, 1979PRESENT: Mr. Miller, ChairmanMr. Volcker, Vice ChairmanMr. BlackMr. ColdwellMr. RiceMs. TeetersMr. WallichMessrs.

Baughman, and Eastburn, Presidents of the Federal ReserveBanks of Dallas, and Philadelphia respectivelyMr. Altmann, SecretaryMr. Bernard, Assistant SecretaryMr. Petersen, General CounselMr. Mannion, Assistant General CounselMr. Axilrod, EconomistMessrs. Kichline, Scheld, and Truman, Associate EconomistsMs. Greene, Assistant Manager for Foreign Operations, System Open MarketAccountMessrs. Czerwinki, Forrestal, Gainor, and Williams, First Vice Presidents,Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City, Atlanta, Minneapolis, andSan Francisco respectivelyat, the upper end of the 9-3/4 to 10-1/2 percent funds rate range setby the Committee. Personally, Mr. Chairman, I would recommend to theCommittee a 10-1/2 percent rate at this point. The aggregates areright at the [tops] of the ranges--actually above in one case. Thefunds rate averaged 10.35 percent last week and I believe there wouldbe little to gain by an effort to fine-tune it somewhere between10-1/4 and 10-1/2 percent. That completes my report on the aggregatesand their relation to the directive, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a report on the aggregates and their relation to the directive.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 3.
MS. GREENE. Yes, I am. Can you hear me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that there is a conversation happening between a speaker (Ms. Greene) and someone else who is being addressed. The use of "Yes" in response to a question suggests agreement or confirmation in this context.

CHAIRMAN MILLER. We hear you fine here in San Francisco.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply relaying that the speaker can hear the person speaking in San Francisco.


Passage number 5.
MS. GREENE. If I may, I'd like to bring the members of theCommittee up-to-date on the events since we last talked on Tuesday. Ishould say that following the news of Tuesday afternoon the dollarcame under intense pressure once again, primarily in the Far East onTuesday night. The magnitude of our intervention operations in thatmarket Tuesday night and a quick follow-up by the Bundesbank inFrankfort the next morning impressed the market and helped to quellsome of the immediate pressure. Since that time the market hastechnically been in better balance, but the environment and sentimentcontinue to be extremely bearish for the dollar. Market participants,commercial [firms], and investors are reporting that they are making ahard reassessment of the dollar's prospects and the implication ofthose prospects for their own operations. Even the promise offered acouple of weeks ago that a recession might help us on the inflationfront and on our trade account is a promise that is quickly fadingaway. The one thing helping us in the past day or so has been theexpectation--[which] has been affirmed over the past hours--that theheavy intervention the market has detected will soon be followed bysome other kind of package. Parallels are being drawn between thisperiod and the period leading up to November 1 of last year.In terms of our operations, the Desk has sold $450 millionworth of marks since we last spoke on Tuesday. This brings ourintervention since Sunday night to almost $1.2 billion, which has beenequally shared between the System and the Treasury. Since mid-Junethe net intervention by the United States has been $3.6 billion. Thiscompares to the $4.1 billion from our 3 partners in the November 1package-- for Germany and for Switzerland.And we should not overlook, however, the contribution in terms ofofficial dollar purchases by the Bank of England ofduring that period. Of the $3.6 billion of intervention we have done,$1.5 billion has been on behalf of the System. That has been entirelyfinanced by swap drawings on the Bundesbank. The $2.1 billion donefor the Treasury has been financed largely out of balances theTreasury had warehoused at the System. This brings the Treasury'sbalance to more than a billion marks short of their liabilities underthe Carter bonds. That's all I have to report, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 6.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you very much, Gretchen. Well,ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me--since the growth of theaggregates now appears to be over our upper limits--that we have a7/19/79condition where, in the absence of overriding instructions, the Deskwould follow the directive and move the fed funds rate up. I wouldlike to outline some possibilities for consideration and then goaround and get your reactions. One possibility is to [issue] no newinstructions. The Desk would therefore interpret the directive, asSteve was suggesting, as meaning that the fed funds rate should bemoved up to 10-1/2 percent.Let me say it this way instead. The first alternative is togive overriding instructions to keep the fed funds rate where it is.The second alternative is to let it go up [in accordance] with thedirective. The third alternative would be to let the fed funds go upwith the directive to 10-1/2 percent and very quickly move thediscount rate to, say, 10 or 10-1/4 percent to close the widening gapbetween the discount rate and the fed funds rate. This would involvesome tightening and some signal, which would not be tremendouslydramatic. Another possibility is that we could believe that we notonly have aggregates problems but international or foreign exchangemarket problems and perhaps we ought to take a more forceful action--move both the fed funds rate and the discount rate up further.I am not at the moment sure what the [Committee's] sentimentis. My [inclination] is that the minimum we should do is to followthe directive under these conditions. And should we do that, it seemsthat a discount rate increase is likely because a 1 percent gap[between the two rates] is very large and undoubtedly will bemisinterpreted unless we do something to [reduce that] margin. Sowith those general comments, what I'd like to do is run through thelist and see how you all feel about it. I'll start down the list Ihave here; it may not be in accordance with roll call [order] but I'lldo my best. Paul Volcker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply outlining different possibilities and seeking reactions from others.


Passage number 7.
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I basically come out with yourintermediate position, Mr. Chairman, as a logical course. I couldrather easily be talked into your last position but I don't think weshould back down on the directive now. I don't think we should do adiscount rate change without a fed funds rate change. I would think,given the domestic and monetary and foreign exchange objectives, thatyour intermediate proposal might be a reasonable position. But Icould be persuaded to do more.I might add one other point. This question on the discountrate came up this afternoon, as it always does at our directors'meetings. There was some concern expressed, which I share, that forthis kind of action to be effective it shouldn't be a source ofcontroversy with the Administration; it should look like an integratedeconomic policy. Perhaps recent events have taken care of that. ButI just mention that [taking] some Federal Reserve action and thengetting a lot of controversy about it may not be helpful, unless [theaction] were bigger than what I'm talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for the chairman's intermediate position and stating that they could be persuaded to do more. They also mention the need for the action to be seen as integrated economic policy and express concern about potential controversy with the administration.


Passage number 8.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Paul, I think your comment is well taken.If we are going to take any monetary action, it might be [useful] totouch base with the Secretary of the Treasury and get it coordinated.Well, we will go back [to my list]. Bob Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is addressing Paul and expressing agreement with his comment about taking monetary action. They suggest consulting the Secretary of the Treasury and coordinating the action. The passage ends with the speaker stating they will go back to their list.


Passage number 9.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I lean toward the hawkish side onthis. I think we ought to put the fed funds rate up perhaps a half-2-7/19/79point and move the discount rate up a full percentage point. And I'draise the fed funds rate range to, say, 10 to 11 percent or somethingof that sort.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Black, is expressing his personal opinion and advocating for a specific course of action regarding the interest rates.


Passage number 10.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you. Phil Coldwell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 11.
MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, as far as the Open MarketCommittee's action, which is all I would like to comment on at themoment, I would prefer that we move [in conformance] with the currentdirective. I'd reaffirm that directive and then have the Board take alook at a discount action as [the requests] come in tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses a preference for moving in conformance with the current directive and reaffirming it, without any opposition or debate.


Passage number 12.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Phil, would you be seeking a discount rate[action by] the Board tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking Phil if he would be seeking a discount rate from the Board tomorrow.


Passage number 13.
MR. COLDWELL. Well, I think we really need [a discussionamong the] Board members of whether the Board itself wishes to approveany kind of discount rate action. If it does, then I'd try to seek abroader action rather than just [act on the pending request of] oneBank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the need for a discussion among board members about approving a discount rate action. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument.


Passage number 14.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you. Emmett Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It consists of a simple statement expressing gratitude, without any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 15.
MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I think we should stay with thedirective and that means to me that we should let the fed funds ratego up to 10-1/2 percent in accordance with the suggestions that wehave heard. I guess this is the middle range recommendation. At thistime, I would not like to see an increase in the discount rate. Idon't know if it's possible, in lieu of an increase in the discountrate, to suggest to the Federal Reserve Banks that they make access tothe discount window less automatic. I don't know how feasible thatis. I recognize that with the rise in the federal funds rate weincrease the spread between the discount rate and the funds rate andthereby provide an additional incentive to the commercial banks to usethe discount window. I think that should be discouraged if at allpossible. Nevertheless, I would not want to discourage it by raisingthe discount rate at this time. I would, however, like to see thefunds rate rise a quarter point. Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Rice is stating his opinion and preference regarding the directive and the various rates, but there is no mention of any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 16.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Emmett. Nancy Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you, Emmett" is a straightforward expression of gratitude and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 17.
MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to changing [thefunds rate]. It seems to me, given the state of the underlyingdomestic economy, that we are going to be raising the funds rate andit's just going to be a matter of days until we have to turn aroundand pull it back down again. I think we are better off riding out theinternational storm. Other things are in such a state of flux that itwould signal a supreme lack of confidence in what is going on here inthe city of Washington at the present time. I think we are better offjust staying still. That's all I have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Ms. Teeters argues against changing the funds rate, while others may have differing opinions on the matter.


Passage number 18.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Okay, Nancy. Henry Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a straightforward statement addressed to Nancy.


Passage number 19.
MR. WALLICH. I see the need to move the funds rate onaccount of the behavior of the aggregates. The exchange markets havenot done anything immediately and visibly that would call for actionbut I think there is accumulating malaise there and if we don't act,we will probably see a move [in the dollar] and will have to take7/19/79costly counteraction. Putting those two things together, I would say:Raise the funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, as per the directive;move the discount rate up 1/2 percentage point; and urge the Treasury--as a sort of blessing to the action--to increase its sales of gold tothe old level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 20.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Henry. Larry Roos.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple expression of gratitude, there is no contention or disagreement present.

MR. ROOS. I would recommend that we follow the directive--let the fed funds rate move to 10-1/2 percent--and that we raise thediscount rate 1/2 point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Roos, is giving a recommendation to follow a directive and raise the discount rate by 1/2 point.

CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Larry. Willis Winn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 23.
MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, I urge that we follow the directiveand permit the funds rate to rise to 10-1/2 percent. And then I wouldurge that we change the discount rate. In the announcement, however,I would focus on the behavior of the aggregates. That gives us theflexibility to back down in response, hopefully, to better behavior[of the aggregates] and the underlying economic situation. But Ithink we have to give some signals to the international markets if weare going to stem this dollar inflow. We certainly can't peg [thedollar]; we shouldn't peg it anyway. But we can't peg it, I think,just by direct intervention with no signal or we are going to findmore funds flowing in than we can possibly handle.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Winn expressing his opinion and urging a specific course of action. There are no conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments presented in the passage.


Passage number 24.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Willis. Ernie Baughman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a polite exchange of gratitude.


Passage number 25.
MR. BAUGHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I think the minimum in thecircumstance should be a quarter point move in the funds rate and ahalf point move in the discount rate. And I think Henry Wallich'ssuggestion of something from the Treasury with respect to gold saleswould also provide a significant indication of the Administration'ssupport and participation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention between individuals or groups. It is simply stating the opinion of Mr. Baughman and suggesting actions that could be taken.


Passage number 26.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Ernie. Dave Eastburn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Thank you, Ernie" is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 27.
MR. EASTBURN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage as it only provides a name "MR. EASTBURN" without any context or information to suggest a disagreement or contention.


Passage number 28.
 My preference among the choices--CHAIRMAN MILLER. Dave, we are not hearing you very well.Before you comment, I hope you will [discuss your own preferences] andnot feel bound by the choices I talked about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their preference but also encouraging Dave to share his own preferences, indicating a willingness for open discussion and not expecting everyone to agree with their choices.


Passage number 29.
MR. EASTBURN. Well, I was just about to do so. Can you hearme now. I was saying that my preference would be to do nothing at themoment and wait a little while. But if action is to be taken, I thinkthe appropriate move is to raise the discount rate. I say thatbecause I think that would be an effective signal internationally andwould follow the directive up. I would announce it on the basis ofthe dollar problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Eastburn is expressing his preference and opinion about what action should be taken, but there is no indication of a disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 30.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Dave. Frank Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply includes a statement expressing gratitude.


Passage number 31.
MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, the amazing strength in theaggregates has changed my position. I would be for an increase in thefunds rate to 10-1/2 or 10-5/8 percent and a move in the discount rateto 10 percent. I think Henry's idea of getting the Treasury toannounce simultaneously an increase in gold sales is a very good one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly describes a change in position and expresses agreement with a suggestion.


Passage number 32.
7/19/79CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Frank. I believe we have fromKansas City Henry Czerwinski. Henry, are you there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple exchange between two people.


Passage number 33.
MR. CZERWINSKI. Yes, Mr. Chairman. We would support anincrease in the federal funds rate to 10-1/2 percent. We also believethat there should be an adjustment upward in the discount rate by atleast 1/2 percentage point on [the basis of the widening gap] butthere are other good reasons to boost the discount rate as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker clearly states their support for an increase in both the federal funds rate and the discount rate. They also mention that there are additional valid reasons to boost the discount rate.


Passage number 34.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Henry. Bob Forrestall inAtlanta.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude from Henry to Bob Forrestall in Atlanta.


Passage number 35.
MR. FORRESTAL. Yes, Mr. Chairman. In view of thedifficulties in the foreign exchange markets, coupled with the rise inthe money supply figures that were published, I believe that a quarterpercentage point increase in the federal funds rate would beappropriate. We also would strongly support a discount rate increaseto 10 percent. The 10 percent rate can be justified on technicalgrounds if none other, but there are certainly compelling reasons togive a signal to the foreign exchange markets at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement made by Mr. Forrestal is expressing his belief that a quarter percentage point increase in the federal funds rate and a discount rate increase to 10 percent would be appropriate given the difficulties in foreign exchange markets and the rise in money supply figures. There is no indication of any opposing view or disagreement.


Passage number 36.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Thank you, Bob. Tom Gainor in Minneapolis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 37.
MR. GAINOR. Mr. Chairman, for the reasons already stated wewould favor a 10 percent discount rate and a 10-1/2 percent fed fundsrate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their preference for a 10 percent discount rate and a 10-1/2 percent fed funds rate.


Passage number 38.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. I thank you, Tom. John Williams here inSan Francisco.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude to Tom and mentioning John Williams in San Francisco. There is no indication of disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 39.
MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage because the information is presented as a statement without any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 40.
 WILLIAMS. Yes, I would agree with Tom Gainor that forall the reasons stated we should go to 10-1/2 percent on fed funds andmove the discount rate up to 10 or 10-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Williams, agrees with Tom Gainor about raising the interest rates, but it does not necessarily mean that there is no contention or disagreement in the overall conversation.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 41.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Unless I counted wrong, I believe I'vecovered all participants--Governors and either Presidents or FirstVice Presidents. Has anyone been omitted. My list seems to becomplete.SPEAKER(.). You didn't hear from Chicago, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker is questioning if anyone has been omitted from the list, suggesting that there may be disagreement or uncertainty about the completeness of the list.


Passage number 42.
MR. SCHELD. Well, Mr. Mayo and Mr. Doyle are away. This isKarl Scheld.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the absence of Mr. Mayo and Mr. Doyle.


Passage number 43.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Oh, fine. What would Chicago like to say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement expressing a mild annoyance or resignation.


Passage number 44.
MR. SCHIELD. The position hasn't changed here. We prefer tostay with the directive, moving to 10-1/2 percent on the fed fundsrate and moving up 1/2 point on the discount rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that their preferred position is to stay with the directive for the rates mentioned.


Passage number 45.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. All right, I think that does it. I'm sorryI missed Chicago. In going back and recapping, it seems to me thatfrom the FOMC point of view the reaction was overwhelmingly to followthe directive and go up to 10-1/2 percent on fed funds. The sentimentfor perhaps going a little [beyond that] didn't seem to be supportedthroughout the Committee. So, for FOMC purposes, assume that this isa consultation and in the absence of alternative instructions we will7/19/79follow the directive and go to 10-1/2 percent. Let's put it this way.Does anyone on the FOMC voting group dissent from that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing the reaction of the FOMC and stating that there doesn't seem to be support for going beyond the directive. They then propose following the directive and going to 10-1/2 percent. The question at the end is a request for confirmation or dissent from the FOMC voting group.


Passage number 46.
VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't dissent, Mr. Chairman, but itcould be interpreted, I suppose, consistent with the directive thatit's a rather firm 10-1/2 percent. In other words, 10-1/2 percent iskind of a floor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their understanding and interpretation of a directive without expressing any conflicting views.


Passage number 47.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. I think the directive carries it to 10-1/2percent, which is barely over what it is [now]. I don't think we'llkeep consulting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 48.
 I don't mean to hedge it but a weak 10-1/2 or astrong 10-1/2--VICE CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you are refining it anyway.I'm happy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different variations of a certain measurement and expressing happiness about refining it.


Passage number 49.
MR. MORRIS. We have had a very firm 10-1/4 percent, so itseems to me that a firm 10-1/2 percent would be appropriate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Morris suggests that a firm 10-1/2 percent would be appropriate, but there is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement mentioned.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 50.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. On the matter of the discount rate, ofcourse, it is the prerogative of the Board of Governors to act on therecommendation of one or more [Reserve Banks]. But I wanted to getthe sentiment of the FOMC because I think it bears on how we fall. Interms of the total System response on this telephone call, there seemsto be overwhelming support for moving to at least 10 percent on analignment basis or on the basis of [the monetary aggregates] or on thebasis of the international [situation] or for all three reasons.However, I am not sure that sentiment showed up among theGovernors [as a group]. Phil didn't express [his view] and Henry did.Nancy and Emmett said no change in the discount rate. I'm not surewhere the Governors are coming out. We have to leave that in theirlaps to decide in view of the discussions of the whole group and whatis going to [occur] once we have a 10-1/2 percent fed funds rate.They will decide what is then appropriate. If, however, the Governorsbegin to believe that an alignment is desirable, I think Phil's pointis well taken that we should try to make that a System-wide responseand give all the Banks as much chance as possible to be in on it.I don't know what is [the best way to proceed]. I'd merelysuggest that the Governors talk about this among themselves andperhaps I could call in the morning and see if there is anything thatI should be doing. I'll leave it to the Governors now, if they'd liketo give me any advice. Phil, do you have any suggestions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that there is overwhelming support for moving to at least 10 percent on the basis of various factors, but then expresses uncertainty about the stance of the Governors as a group. This indicates a disagreement or lack of unity among the Governors regarding the appropriate course of action.


Passage number 51.
MR. WALLICH. Bill, could I say that I think it's importantto get the two actions together, as far as the markets seeing them,because they don't understand the reasons and the mechanics by whichwe operate. Perhaps we'd be able tonight to get the Presidents readyto [catch] up with their boards of directors and have something readyearly tomorrow morning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the importance of getting two actions together in order for the markets to understand the reasons and mechanics of operation. They are suggesting a plan to inform the Presidents and get their boards of directors ready, which does not indicate disagreement.


Passage number 52.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Let's see. We have five Board members[available today]; I'm here and four of you are there. Chuck is notparticipating at the moment. I guess he was not available. Henry, Idon't disagree with you. I think it's going to be very strange if wehave a 1 percentage point spread between the discount rate and thefederal funds rate; it will be misinterpreted. Nonetheless, it7/19/79depends upon what the Governors as a body want to do. So, Phil, howdo you feel.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the availability of the board members and expressing agreement with Henry's viewpoint.


Passage number 53.
MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, may I suggest that after wefinish our FOMC discussion you call in and we could hold a brief Boardmeeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 


Passage number 54.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. I think that would be a very good idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement expresses a positive opinion without any opposing or contradictory viewpoints.


Passage number 55.
MR. COLDWELL. We could talk about it then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating that Mr. Coldwell would like to discuss a certain topic. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 56.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. I am trying to sense whether you'd ratherdo it now or in the morning, but I gather if the directors arewilling--. Why don't we all get off this call and why don't you callme back in San Francisco and we'll just pick up from here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a suggestion made by one party to continue the conversation at a later time.


Passage number 57.
MR. ALTMANN. Mr. Chairman, this is Murray Altmann. Whenthis is concluded if you hang up and we disconnect the telephonicsystem, I can get you back on just by calling the San Francisco line.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.

CHAIRMAN MILLER. If it becomes necessary for internationalpurposes, then I think we ought to poll the FOMC. It seems likesomewhat of a blank check to say "go over 10-1/2 percent" without anyfeeling based on the international situation. I'm not sure how theDesk could respond to that. And I'm not sure the Chairman should giveinstructions when he doesn't have the consensus of the Committee.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 99.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Mr. Chairman, Peter Sternlight. May I justinterject.

Unless it is withdrawn, itlooks as if there is a majority for it. I am not sure of anyprocedure other than to say, well, that's the will of the Committee.You have heard the comments. Phil, are you still satisfied that weshould set this range even though we are [unintelligible]. Have youhad a problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 101.
MR. COLDWELL. Well, my reason for this, Mr. Chairman,ultimately [relates to] what we do with the discount rate. If it werethe sentiment of the full Board to go more than one half percentage-9-7/19/79point on the discount rate, then we're stuck with a fed funds ratebelow or equal to it. I just was trying to give us a littleflexibility in the event the Board decided on a discount rate changeof larger than a half point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply explaining their reasoning for wanting flexibility in the event of a change in the discount rate.


Passage number 102.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, [if we were to] change the range, Idon't see that the Desk would do anything differently in the next 7days regardless of what happens to the discount rate. The aggregatesare barely above their upper limits and that doesn't call for greatermovement [in the funds rate], absent some other directive. So I'm alittle confused by this process. But it is a democratic process, sowe'll do what the majority thinks is right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage expresses confusion about a process but does not mention any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 103.
MR. COLDWELL. Well, I sponsored the motion, Mr. Chairman,and if there is a strong feeling of reservation on your part I'llwithdraw the motion. I just thought it gave us a bit more flexibilityrather than being at the ceiling [of the funds range] so early in theintermeeting period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Coldwell is offering to withdraw the motion if the chairman has reservations, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument between them.


Passage number 104.
CHAIRMAN MILLER. Well, let me say this, Phil. I appreciatethe reason and I appreciate the strong support here. But my tendencyis not to go off on these things without first having a quick phonecall so we can get everyone involved. I would hate to see us publishan interim action right now with dissenting votes. It seems to methat this is a time when we need to unify ourselves. For that reasonI am a little reluctant to see us take an action if we are not goingto use it, when we have two non-affirmative votes to be reported thenext time [the Policy Record is published]. It does not contribute toour overall course of action, so as long as there are dissenters whowon't withdraw [their dissents], I would ask that the supporterswithdraw at the moment. Let's just leave it that we will be in touchwith everybody if this action is necessary. And tomorrow we willstart again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing hesitation and a desire for unity, but there is no explicit disagreement or conflict among the parties involved.
