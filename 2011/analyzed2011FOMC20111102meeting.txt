Passage number 1.
 Hetzel, Senior Economist, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond   Transcript of the Federal Open Market Committee Meeting on November 1–2, 2011  November 1 Session  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  This is a joint FOMC–Board meeting.  I need a motion to close the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states the logistics of the meeting and calls for a motion to close the meeting.


Passage number 2.
 MS. YELLEN.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 3.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  We welcome you, Esther George, in your new capacity as President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.  Welcome again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is cordial and welcoming in nature.


Passage number 4.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 5.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Before launching into our official business, President Fisher needs to describe an intra–Reserve Bank transaction.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage is a statement of a fact or a requirement for President Fisher before starting the official business. There is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 6.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Unlike some operators on Wall Street, we at the Federal Open Market Committee do pay our debts in full.  [Laughter]  I have a debt that I need to pay back to the gentleman on my left.  [Laughter]  I am tempted to claw his eyes out and scratch his legs during the meeting, but instead, being honorable, this is the bet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The mention of paying debts and joking about a personal debt does not imply any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 7.
  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only includes laughter, which typically indicates agreement, amusement, or a light-hearted interaction. However, without further context, it is difficult to determine if there is any underlying disagreement or contention.


Passage number 8.
  Let the record show— MR. FISHER.  This is beer.  This is the elixir of working men and women, and I never resist giving some facts.  Beer is the third-most consumed liquid product in the world after water and beer.  It goes back to at least the Neolithic Period, 9,500 B.C.  There was a goddess of beer that the Sumerians have called Ninkasi.  And there is a famous prayer that is called “The Hymn to Ninkasi.”  I evoked it so many times during the sixth game, but I found out that Ninkasi, whoever she was, gave way to the god of Bud.  There it is, Shiner Bock, the best of Texas beers.  I would have brought you a Lone Star, but real men and women don’t drink light beer.  [Laughter] Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving us this opportunity.  I won’t tell you how I snuck it into this room.  I never want to go through that security procedure again.  [Laughter]  But you won, congratulations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is sharing information and making light-hearted jokes about beer, but there is no argument or disagreement between different parties.


Passage number 9.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, sir.  And a great World Series it was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges that the World Series was great.


Passage number 10.
 MR. FISHER.  It was a terrible World Series.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement made by Mr. Fisher simply expresses his opinion on the World Series. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 11.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  What were you going to pay up if he won.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no disagreement or contention in the passage. The use of laughter suggests a light-hearted or humorous tone, indicating that the statement is not controversial or confrontational.


Passage number 12.
 MR. BULLARD.  A six-pack of the local brew.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply stating that Mr. Bullard has a six-pack of the local brew.


Passage number 13.
 MR. WILCOX.  Bud Light.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states "MR. WILCOX. Bud Light" without providing any further information or expressing any conflicting ideas or opinions.


Passage number 14.
  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.  Bud Light, Busch.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply mentions the brands Bud Light and Busch, followed by a laugh.


Passage number 15.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Meeting is adjourned.  [Laughter] Let’s turn to item 1 on the agenda.  The retirement of Dave Stockton opens up a vacancy.  We propose to select David Wilcox as economist for the FOMC, and Larry Slifman as associate economist, effective until the organizational meeting in January 2012.  No objections.  [No response]  All right.  Thank you very much. Let’s turn now to item 2 on monetary policy frameworks.  Let me begin the discussion by turning to Michael Kiley, who will lead the staff presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 16.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  The floor is open for questions.  Let me start with a quick one.  In the nominal GDP targeting on exhibit 2 we show a gradual approach to the target.  How quickly do you assume that actual nominal GDP approaches the trend level, and how do you communicate that to the public.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 17.
 MR. KILEY.  In all of the cases, whether it is nominal GDP targeting or the inertial Taylor rule approach, policy is actually governed by a rule, not by a pure targeting approach.  So, there is no specific objective for how quickly nominal income approaches its target. We assumed that the policy strategy would be highly inertial so that policy adjustments would be very slow.  We did that because the policy literature suggests that in many models, highly inertial policies are a really good idea.  Those strategies imply that nominal income hits the target, depending on which model, late this decade or under some of the models even later.  In the FRB/US model, nominal income would hit the target around, say, 2018 and overshoot.  In the EDO model, it hits around the same time, and there is no nominal GDP overshooting.  It essentially hits that level.  In the small model we considered, because inflation is so inertial, it could take even longer, and nominal GDP wouldn’t hit the target over the next 5 to 10 years.  The answer to the question depends upon the model and the specific degree to which the nominal income targeting is inertial.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is providing information about different models and their projections for when nominal income will hit the target. They acknowledge that the timing depends on the specific model and the degree of inertia in the targeting approach.


Passage number 18.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  How do you communicate how aggressively you are going to respond to the gap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence is simply asking a question about how someone plans to communicate their level of response to a gap.


Passage number 19.
 MR. KILEY.  One way to communicate that would be by laying out a simple policy rule, and that obviously was what we did in all of the models and is one thing that is robust across models.  It doesn’t depend on when nominal income achieves target.  Showing how you would change policy in response to nominal income doesn’t depend on a specific model’s rate at which the nominal income gap closes, but, rather, depends on your model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is explaining that the communication of a policy rule does not depend on a specific model's rate of closing the nominal income gap.


Passage number 20.
  Then, one could explain that in terms of your baseline outlook for nominal income or—  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Thank you.  Other questions.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It consists of a statement and a response indicating that the speaker's response was satisfactory.


Passage number 21.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to ask about the optimal policy under discretion.  You say that you assume the Committee aims for a target of 2 percent.  I am wondering, does the policymaker choose what inflation rate we desire in the long run.  Or do you hold that constant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question for clarification.


Passage number 22.
 MR. KILEY.  It is a period-by-period choice for the policy rate, given a long-run objective.  The policymaker is trying to choose where inflation and unemployment will go on a period-by-period basis.  They don’t reconsider the 2 percent inflation objective.  That is hardwired into a policymaker’s DNA.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply explains the process of choosing the policy rate and mentions that the 2 percent inflation objective is not reconsidered.


Passage number 23.
 MR. LACKER.  In a sense, there is some commitment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that there is a commitment of some sort.


Passage number 24.
 MR. KILEY.  That is right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that Mr. Kiley agrees with something. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 25.
 MR. LACKER.  Thus the quotes around “discretion.”  So the Taylor rule is not time-consistent, and it describes what we do pretty well, right.  Is that true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a statement and asking for confirmation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 26.
 MR. KILEY.  Any simple instrument rule will not be the optimal discretionary policy.  There would be an incentive to deviate from it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The statement "Any simple instrument rule will not be the optimal discretionary policy" suggests disagreement or contention. It implies that simple instrument rules are not the best approach for discretionary policy, indicating a difference in opinion or viewpoint. Additionally, the statement "There would be an incentive to deviate from it" further supports the presence of contention or disagreement, as it implies that there are potential issues or drawbacks with using a simple instrument rule.


Passage number 27.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  The extent to which the Taylor rule captures how we behave now, is it your judgment that we behave with some greater level of commitment than is embodied in your optimal policy with discretion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear disagreement or contention in this passage. It is a statement followed by a question seeking clarification or agreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 28.
 MR. KILEY.  As I noted, we would view the historical approach of the Committee as one consistent with constrained discretion.  Clearly the Committee doesn’t adjust policy willy-nilly and doesn’t reconsider on a meeting-by-meeting basis every aspect of its strategy.  Definitely, there are commitments. Indeed, under the discretion case, as you noted, we take a number of commitments off the table and assume that, for example, an inflation objective of 2 percent is hardwired in the policymaker’s DNA.  In addition, policy communications have given guidance regarding the outlook for the federal funds rate, for example, and I am sure the Committee and the public view those as conditional commitments.  It would be false to suggest that the policy approach involves zero commitments.  The optimal discretionary case here involves a number of commitments as well, and the extent to which there could be gains from further commitment is consistent with the story that we have told in illustrating commitment versus discretion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that there are commitments in the policy approach, but also argues that there could be gains from further commitment. This implies a disagreement or difference of opinion on the extent to which commitments should be made.


Passage number 29.
 MR. LACKER.  I have one other question, Mr. Chairman, if I could.  You have an objective function that you carry across these scenarios and across models that has the policymaker minimizing this weighted sum.  On the unemployment side, it is the deviation of unemployment from a u* that is fixed, that is a constant.  Am I right about that, or is it the Tealbook’s NAIRU.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 30.
  MR. KILEY.  There are the modest movements in the Tealbook’s natural rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provided does not include any statements or opinions that would indicate contention or disagreement. It appears to be a neutral statement of information.


Passage number 31.
 MR. LACKER.  Is it the natural rate that is adjusted for the extended unemployment benefits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a question without any conflicting opinions.


Passage number 32.
 MR. KILEY.  It is.  That is not particularly important, because that is only an adjustment in the next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kiley simply states that the adjustment in the next year is not particularly important.


Passage number 33.
 MR. LACKER.  In the model EDO, you start from preferences, endowments, and technologies, and, principally, you could derive the right loss function, right.  And it wouldn’t have the same property that the u* is some fixed, smooth thing.  Am I right about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply seeking confirmation or clarification about the properties of the EDO model.


Passage number 34.
 MR. KILEY.  Yes, that’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kiley simply confirms the correctness of a statement without expressing any disagreement or opposition.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 35.
 MR. LACKER.  There is this dichotomy here, right.  The change in the unemployment insurance, the richness of those—it is a kind of a shock, right.  You guys take that on board for NAIRU, but you don’t take on board any of the other shocks that have hit the economy in the past few years.  Have you guys thought about that dichotomy, that contrast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The passage presents a disagreement between the speaker (Mr. Lacker) and the "you guys" he is referring to, possibly a different group or individual. Mr. Lacker suggests that there is a dichotomy or contrast in the way certain shocks, specifically the change in unemployment insurance, are considered in relation to the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment). He argues that while this shock is taken into account, other shocks that have impacted the economy in recent years are not. This indicates a disagreement or contention between Mr. Lacker and the group he is addressing.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 36.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Before this recession we thought the NAIRU was 4¾ percent.  Now we think, leaving aside the effects of extended unemployment benefits, things like that, it is 6 percent.  When you ratchet that up, that is a very persistent hit to labor market functioning, relative to what we thought. We have also gone back and taken a look at what it was prior to the recession.  I don’t think it was quite as low as 4¾ percent.  But we have assumed that—through very persistent reduced attachment to the labor force, through duration of employment, through long duration of employment hurting people’s skills, things like that—there are persistent fallout effects, supply-side effects.  As Mike said, those effects are taken into account in these analyses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that the NAIRU (Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment) was previously believed to be 4¾ percent, but now they think it is 6 percent. However, the speaker also mentions that they don't think it was quite as low as 4¾ percent before the recession. This suggests a difference in opinions or uncertainty about the exact pre-recession NAIRU.


Passage number 37.
 MR. LACKER.  That results in a figure that is really smooth, and the vision you’d get out of EDO is that every quarter’s TFP shock should affect the natural rate.  There is still a bit of a bucket of left-out shocks there.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement explaining a particular method and acknowledging a small amount of unaccounted shocks.


Passage number 38.
 MR. KILEY.  That is technically true.  In much of the literature actually incorporating unemployment in models like EDO—in practice, that is not the result that comes out.  The natural rate of unemployment is often very smooth.  In addition, it is important to be consistent across all the implications of a model if one wants to push the story that far.  For example, in EDO, given the definition of the natural rate of unemployment that you are suggesting, that would be higher.  It is also the case that there is a natural rate of interest that should be accounted for in a model like that, and that is actually much, much lower because of the effect on financial frictions estimated by that model.  If you take both of those factors into account, you would want policy to be even easier than in a model like FRB/US.  One shouldn’t cherry-pick a particular implication of a model.  One needs to walk through the analysis very consistently, and it is not always what one thinks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different factors and implications of incorporating unemployment in economic models.


Passage number 39.
 MR. LACKER.  Perfectly fair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  The statement "Perfectly fair" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It suggests agreement or support.


Passage number 40.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage only mentions the name "Governor Raskin" without providing any additional information or context. Without any further information, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement surrounding Governor Raskin.


Passage number 41.
 MS. RASKIN.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  One question, Michael, from an operational perspective on the nominal income targeting, and that has to do with whether the activity component of nominal income is known in a timely way and as a reliable data point sufficient to permit adjustment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about the operational perspective of nominal income targeting.


Passage number 42.
 MR. KILEY.  One could have different opinions on that.  At the current juncture, I think the answer is clearly yes, the data are timely enough.  Over the period that we are considering these strategies, nominal income would provide a reliable enough signal, because we are not talking about whether the federal funds rate should be up or down 25 basis points this quarter, and then adjusted next quarter.  We are looking at a situation in which, in our estimation, a plausible nominal income gap is about 7 percent.  The measurement error or the degree of revision in nominal income is just not that high, but there are revisions. It is certainly possible that when the economy is back closer to steady-state conditions that that type of a consideration would be important from meeting to meeting.  I think that’s something that one wants to consider when one is thinking about whether or not an intermediate target like nominal income is appropriate for the next 5 to 10 years or is appropriate forevermore. And the answer to that question is that it doesn’t have to be the same.  Right now we are in extraordinary times.  One of the problems with nominal income targeting—that we are not exactly sure about the level of nominal income this quarter—is actually not that important right now, even though 10 years from now I hope that that is a really important consideration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no explicit contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their own opinions and considerations regarding the use of nominal income as an intermediate target. They acknowledge that there may be different opinions on the matter and highlight that the measurement error or degree of revision in nominal income is not currently high enough to be a significant concern. Overall, the passage focuses on discussing and considering different perspectives rather than presenting conflicting arguments.


Passage number 43.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement mentioned in the given passage. The phrase "Vice Chairman" alone does not provide any information about disagreement or contention.


Passage number 44.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  I have a question.  It seems like the way you have presented it implies that the nominal GDP targeting implied a lower trigger or a lower threshold for exit.  Do you need the actual framework of nominal GDP targeting to generate these outcomes.  Or could you just actually have the lower trigger threshold.  And would that be sufficient.  I mean, how does the staff view the articulation of the framework vis-à-vis how that maps into the trigger.  I am not sure I am being clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is not presenting any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply seeking clarification and asking for the staff's perspective on the topic.


Passage number 45.
 MR. KILEY.  I am not sure that there is a uniform step.  The way that I would think about it is that certainly within a given model, or a given view of the world, specifying a trigger and an outlook for the funds rate is the same as saying that you want a target for nominal GDP.  But as I noted earlier when we were talking about the rate at which nominal GDP might approach its target, those implications are not robust necessarily across different views of the world; whereas reference to a set of goals—and those could be unemployment goals and inflation goals, those could be nominal income, those could be something else—may be more consistent across frameworks. The way that I would view it is that there is some distinction between simply saying the funds rate is going to be a certain value for the next X quarters and a framework, because the framework provides information to individuals who have a different view.  And over time they will learn whether their view is confirmed or disputed by the data and presumably update their expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing different ways of specifying a trigger or target for the funds rate and the implications of different views of the world. The speaker does not express disagreement or contention with anyone else's views or statements.


Passage number 46.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I am trying to get at a point—how much of the benefit do you get by having the trigger values out there versus the framework out there.  I am trying to understand how you parse those two things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing the speaker's attempt to understand the relationship between having trigger values and a framework.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 47.
 MR. KILEY.  Certainly, under the baseline outlook you get some of the benefit from the trigger and some of the benefit from the overall framework.  And then, in the shocks, when things turn out different than you expect, the triggers don’t necessarily tell you what is going to happen in all cases, because they may involve differences in policy in periods after the trigger has happened.  The framework provides some of the benefit.   In the simulations, or in the forward-guidance memo, triggers that signal additional policy accommodation are helpful at the current time, if one wants to improve outcomes for resource utilization.  But there appear to be some gains from moving beyond that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that while triggers can be beneficial, there are also potential gains from moving beyond them. This implies a differing opinion or potential disagreement about the effectiveness of triggers and the need for additional measures.


Passage number 48.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 49.
 MR. WILCOX.  It would be difficult to analyze that question, in principle, in your models, because the agents in your models understand exactly what the framework is.  I think what Michael is saying is that communication clarity is key to the difference between a trigger strategy and a nominal income-targeting strategy, and communication isn’t an issue that is salient in the model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Wilcox, is describing what Michael is saying and explaining why it would be difficult to analyze certain aspects in a model. There is no indication of disagreement or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 50.
 MR. KILEY.  Yes, that is the hard part.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement acknowledging the difficulty of a certain task.


Passage number 51.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On the other hand, nominal income targeting is only an approximation of the optimal path, so a lot depends on the quality of the approximation as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not expressing any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that nominal income targeting is an approximation and that its effectiveness depends on the quality of the approximation.


Passage number 52.
 MR. KILEY.  Right.  And certainly, across different models is a less-good approximation.  We had one example of nominal income targeting a specific rule, changing those parameters slightly.  It is not going to be quite as good an approximation of the optimal policy rule.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that using different models or changing parameters slightly may result in a less accurate approximation of the optimal policy rule. There is no mention of opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 53.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the position or title of "President Kocherlakota" without providing any information or context that suggests contention or disagreement.


Passage number 54.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Thanks for the great memo, and thanks for the great presentation, Michael.  I had two quick questions.  One is, in exhibit 3, when I look at PCE prices under nominal income targeting, the graph ends in 2018, and we are still above 3 percent.  How long do we stay above 2 percent in that simulation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a question asked by Mr. Kocherlakota regarding a graph in a presentation.


Passage number 55.
 MR. KILEY.  This is a huge shock, so the economy takes a long time to get back to steady state.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that the economy takes a long time to get back to steady state after a huge shock.


Passage number 56.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explicitly states that they agree with the statement mentioned.


Passage number 57.
 MR. KILEY.  It doesn’t actually take that long to get back to 2 percent.  This is sort of the peak, and it starts coming down and will be going back closely to 2 percent in the several years after that.  But the economy won’t settle down.  It will undershoot, and then it will come back up, because the economy under this particular policy strategy, which is just focusing on nominal income, will be oscillating in toward that steady state for a while under the FRB/US model.  That is not necessarily true in all the models.  But as I noted, part of the success of that strategy in this scenario is this willingness to have inflation go to 3 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is explaining a particular economic strategy and acknowledging that different models may yield different results.


Passage number 58.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I agree, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explicitly states agreement.


Passage number 59.
 MR. KILEY.  We certainly did simulations in which, when you see that, you just back off and want to give up on nominal income targeting.  That trims the gains and puts it closer to the Taylor-type strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is stating a statement made by Mr. Kiley about simulations. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 60.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  That was useful.  This is not my second question.  It is more of a follow-up.  I think that this gets back to something that President Lacker was asking about discretion.  One thing that might be interesting to know is the size of the losses that are being forgone by a discretionary FOMC as we go along these scenarios.  If you are in 2017, and the inflation rate is at 3 percent and unemployment is down under 4, what is that FOMC thinking about how much they are forgoing in terms of the losses.  I think that would help us understand how credible these kinds of plans are.  I don’t know if I was making sense or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and asking for more information to gain a better understanding.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 61.
 MR. KILEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The use of "Yes" in response to a statement indicates agreement or confirmation of the existence of contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 62.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  My second question is, what is the size of our shortfall, in terms of nominal GDP, right now.  The staff has an estimate of potential, and I think the shortfall right now is being calculated relative to that notion of potential GDP, and that comes to be about 7 percent in the current quarter relative to where we were starting in December ’07 or something like that, fourth quarter ’07.  Many outside observers would say that the gap is actually 4 percentage points bigger than that because they are using some kind of trend line from December ’07 to be their guidepost. The challenge right now is, how do we start to communicate about our nuanced measures of potential GDP to the public relative to just drawing the straight trend line, which I think is more what people are used to.  I will speak for myself.  When I try to communicate to the public about how deep this episode has been, I use the trend line.  For one thing, I think potential GDP is Class II FOMC information, so I am not able to talk about it.  [Laughter]  But more seriously, it is a challenge for us to say that we are going to do nominal income targeting, but, by the way, we don’t view ourselves as responsible for 4 percentage points of what you think of as a shortfall.  It is a communication issue that might be hard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different methods of calculating the shortfall in GDP and expressing the challenge of effectively communicating this information to the public.


Passage number 63.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions "President Bullard" without providing any information or context to suggest contention or disagreement. Without any further details, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 64.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  And thank you, Michael, for the presentation and the analysis.  I love this kind of stuff; I am a big fan. I have a couple of comments.  One is, when we talk about price-level targeting, I thought it got a little jumbled, because I guess you are talking about what I would call strict price-level targeting.  When I think back to the original Svensson paper on this, he took this objective that had the output gap and inflation in it, and he replaced inflation with price-level targeting.  The output gap was still there, so to me, when we went to the price-level-targeting argument, it was all there, and so there wasn’t anything that indicated that price-level targeting means that you are going to ignore the real side of the economy.  There wasn’t anything like that.  To have price-level targeting get a bad name from this memo, which is what is happening, I think is a little unfair to the approach.  The price level was supposed to substitute for the commitment that wasn’t there when you had the inflation rates there.  That was a pretty good insight and has been verified in subsequent models. You can go to nominal income targeting instead, but you could also go to flexible price-level targeting.  What is the difference between those two is really the question.  What is the difference between flexible price-level targeting, as I would see it originally envisioned by Svensson, and nominal income targeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of the speaker expressing their appreciation for a presentation and offering their own comments and interpretations.


Passage number 65.
 MR. KILEY.  Nominal income targeting is just one example of flexible price-level targeting.  Because there are an infinite number of examples of flexible price-level targeting, we picked the polar cases that are easy, round numbers; we picked 0 on the output gap, strict price-level targeting, and 1 on the output gap, nominal income targeting.  But you are absolutely right that flexible price-level targeting is the best thing to do in some models, and we just chose to focus on the one case.  People have some empirical papers that have considered flexible price-level targeting.  For example, the one by Gorodnichenko and Shapiro, let’s say they have a coefficient of 1 plus some inertia on the price level, and then an even bigger coefficient on the output gap than 1.  They would be even more aggressive than nominal income targeting.  So one, of course, could have a smaller coefficient on the output gap, and performance would be sensitive to those assumptions.  But one would move from “price-level targeting performed poorly” in a couple of the models we considered to “nominal income targeting performed reasonably well” in those models.  One would move in that direction as one became more flexible in price-level targeting and put some weight on the output gap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that there are different approaches to flexible price-level targeting and that different models may produce different results. They are not arguing against any particular perspective, but rather acknowledging the range of possibilities.


Passage number 66.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you.  One thing about this memo that I thought was not addressed—from the perspective of this Committee—is, what are we really worried about.  We are worried that you are playing with fire, and you might replay a really bad scenario in which inflation goes up a lot, and you really get into a lot of trouble. What would it take in this kind of framework to get into that kind of hot water.  The answer might be there is no scenario under which that can happen, but the ’70s did happen.  I think you have to have something in the model that goes too far and really generates a lot of problems.  Otherwise, the question would be, why don’t you just commit to zero rates out to 2030, if it is all beneficial.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 67.
 MR. KILEY.  I agree.  That is a really hard question, and certainly things can go wrong.  It is hard to know what those are.  I think if one committed to interest rates of some fixed path until 2030, things would be very likely to go wrong.  That is why we talk about strategies that would be conditional on economic outcomes. In terms of what could trigger a repeat of the 1970s, obviously, I don’t know.  It is notable that nominal income targeting was proposed in the late 1970s by people like Jim Tobin and James Meade, precisely because inflation was a problem.  Then, a subsequent analysis by people in the 1980s—Marty Feldstein, Greg Mankiw, many people—showed it is a good strategy in response to those kind of shocks.  The idea, actually, was to prevent that kind of outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 68.
 MR. BULLARD.  I just have one more comment, which President Lacker has already brought up, which is, how fair is it to characterize what the Committee does now as a discretionary policy.  In some sense, if you have a Taylor rule, maybe it is a simple Taylor rule, maybe it is not the optimal one, but you can pick the coefficients to be as good as they can be for that particular Taylor rule.  That will probably get you pretty close to the optimal outcome.  You are committing to the rule, you always behave like the rule, so in a sense there is a lot of commitment already there.  How much can you really improve on that, as opposed to the literature, which says that you are always choosing the discretionary solution at every point in time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 69.
 MR. KILEY.  There is one important aspect of commitment that isn’t captured by the Taylor rule.  In all of our baselines, the Committee is committed to following some reasonable strategy.  The baseline is always a simple rule—the outcome-based rule or something like that. The types of commitment strategies that Dave and Chris and I were talking about move beyond that simple rule, because they involve some commitment to undo undesirable movements in the price level.  So one is willing to have inflation run at 2½ percent for a while, for example, if unemployment is very high, to a degree that is greater than embedded in something like a Taylor rule.  That is an insight in the policy literature that can be a good idea, and that is behavior inconsistent with simple policy rules that involve inflation.  That price-level-type aspect of nominal income targeting or the optimal commitment strategy or price-level targeting does move beyond the types of commitments that the Committee has, for the most part, been willing to make in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: In the passage, Mr. Kiley suggests that there is an important aspect of commitment that is not captured by the Taylor rule. He introduces the concept of commitment strategies that go beyond simple rules and involve undoing undesirable movements in the price level. This idea is presented as behavior inconsistent with the simple policy rules that the Committee has typically followed in the past. Therefore, there is disagreement or contention between Mr. Kiley's suggestion and the Committee's previous approach to commitment strategies.


Passage number 70.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply a polite expression of gratitude towards President Plosser.


Passage number 71.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two less deep, more mundane questions about the charts that I’d like to see if I understand.  Under nominal GDP targeting, nominal GDP is the sum of real GDP plus the GDP deflator, and yet you’re talking about what’s going on with the PCE price index.  If you’re really targeting nominal GDP, you’re targeting the GDP deflator implicitly, right.  How in your calculation do you make that translation, and how do you think about that, again, as another communication device about what we’re doing.  That’s the first question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for clarification and understanding on how nominal GDP targeting works.


Passage number 72.
 MR. KILEY.  First, I’ll give you technically what we did.  This is a question very similar to the question Governor Raskin asked in terms of its implications at the current juncture.  What we did mechanically is not be particularly concerned about any trend differences in GDP prices and core PCE prices, and we set the target for 2 percent for GDP prices, and that’s slightly different than a target for 2 percent for core PCE prices or for overall PCE prices. During normal times—when we are there, 5 to 10 years from now—that would be really important if one’s very concerned about 2 versus 2.2 percent.  If the gap in nominal income is 7 percent, 2 or 2.2 percent just doesn’t matter.  It’s not important for the types of simulations we’re doing right now, but it is important for behavior potentially at other times.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply explains the technical details of setting a target for GDP prices and core PCE prices.


Passage number 73.
 MR. PLOSSER.  The second question is sort of related to this.  A lot of the level targeting, whether it be price-level targeting or nominal GDP–level targeting, can be quite sensitive to where the path begins, whether you start at December ’07 or whether you start at December 2000 or 2003 or what have you.  When we think about targeting the level for anything, the sensitivity perhaps to that initial condition, how do we think about choosing what the right initial condition was.  Certainly, December 2007 was the peak of the housing bubble and perhaps some other things that you might want to think about.  And yet if you go back earlier, as President Lacker has talked about, the inflation rates of 2005 and 2006 were high.  I’m thinking about the sensitivity and how we would think about implementing a policy and choosing the right initial condition to measure what you think, in fact, the gap is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It raises questions and considerations about choosing the right initial condition for implementing a policy, but it does not present conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 74.
 MR. KILEY.  It’s a hard question.  The approach we took was simply: I’m on the staff with the Board, and I think our estimate of the output gap is pretty reasonable.  [Laughter]  Taking a view in which it happened to be the case that the output gap was pretty close to zero before the recession started in our estimation now, and we said, let’s take that as the initial condition because it might be something that one would want to communicate—that we’ve seen a bad few years and want to make up for those bad few years—and we came up with a reasonable number. Other people would go back to that same date and just write through a trend line, and they would have an even bigger gap—not the 7 percent we had, but a 10 or 11 percent gap—because they wouldn’t be accounting for the unfortunate decline in potential that we’ve seen in that period.  Or you could start from today and say, “the gap is zero, but we’re going to follow this strategy in the future,” and that would have very different implications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining different approaches to estimating the output gap, but there is no clear contention or disagreement present. The speaker is simply describing different perspectives and methods that can be used to estimate the output gap.


Passage number 75.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions.  [No response]  Well, we’re about ready for a go-round and discussion.  I’d like to make a couple of framing comments. First of all, let me thank the staff, for I think we can all agree that their work has been extraordinarily helpful, really first rate, and it helped me think about this quite a bit.  Thanks very much for that work done under pressure of time. One might think that a discussion of policy frameworks is a little bit arcane, academic, and off point, but actually, it’s right at the center of what we’re doing now.  We’re in a situation where the effects of our policy depend at least as much on what people think we’re going to do in the future as they do on what we do today, and consequently, the framework that we are using and that we communicate—and the communication is incredibly important—has very real effects on the efficacy of our policy.  This is very much part of the contingency planning effort that I promised a couple of meetings ago both in the sense of trying to think about our current framework and thinking about where we might go if things turn much to the worse. There’s probably a narrow way and a broad way to think about this discussion.  The narrow way is to note that I think it’s not too controversial to describe our behavior as conforming to a version of flexible inflation targeting, which attempts to achieve a broad definition of price stability over the forecast horizon, but in the short term allows some flexibility for stabilization of the real economy. Where we deviate to some extent from international practice on inflation targeting is that we haven’t done everything that some central banks have done in terms of communication, including specifying a numerical objective, providing a comprehensive, collective forecast, providing guidance or even forecasts of future rates, et cetera.  One way to think about this discussion is, what additional steps do we want to take, if any, recognizing that we do have a rather different institutional situation here than in many other countries—a large Committee, a dual mandate, et cetera.  But another way of thinking about this discussion is an issue that we’ve talked about many times before, that we want to take further steps to solidify and clarify our flexible inflation-targeting approach, and if so, how could we communicate that. It’s useful—and one of the things I thought that the memo did very well—to show us that there really is a broader issue here, which roughly speaking is the difference between discretionary and commitment-based policy, particularly in a situation where we’re at the zero bound and conventional signaling by moving interest rates is not available.  To the extent that we can show a committed policy—that we can clarify our future policies will correspond to the optimal path under commitment, similar and analogous to the path that is presented every meeting in the Tealbook—the better results we’ll get. In some sense the broader question is not just about flexible inflation targeting.  The broader question is, can we provide a communications framework that will allow us both to convey and to commit to a policy path that will deliver potentially better outcomes on both inflation and growth than the policy framework we have now.  I think that’s an open question.  There are a lot of practical issues that come into play, a lot of special issues related to what model you believe in, and so on, but I would urge us all to think about this in that context, and as much as possible, to divorce it from the current conjuncture and ask the question that if we’re going to adopt some changes in communication, what would serve this Committee well for a period of time. Before opening the floor, let me restate the questions that were circulated so they’ll be in everybody’s mind.  Narrowly, to the extent that we’re looking at a flexible inflation targeting framework, would it make sense to adopt a numerical objective.  That would be one way to clarify our goals.  In doing so, of course, we would have to make very clear how that relates to our dual mandate and why it’s consistent with our dual mandate.  The counter argument is that doing that convincingly is a communications challenge in itself, and that’s one issue to address. More broadly, again, beyond the flexible inflation-targeting framework is the question of how we can make better, clearer commitments to future policy, and a number of different approaches have been suggested.  We talked at the last meeting about conditional commitments, and we showed a few possible examples in the alternative A1 in the statements.  Would it be helpful to specify some conditions under which we change policy, specifying those well in advance.  That is one way to try to approximate an optimal policy in terms of commitment. An alternative way, as the discussion just illustrated, is by specifying intermediate targets.  Intermediate targets are an old concept in monetary policy.  It’s been always used in the sense of a guidepost or a second pillar, a way of providing additional information about policy.  But in the current context, as the memo shows, it could be that pursuing a particular intermediate target might be a reasonable approximation to the first-best policy under commitment, and that’s an empirical question, in part. I’m sure many of you have seen some of the commentary on, for example, nominal GDP targets.  Christina Romer made the point over the weekend that one potential advantage of something like a nominal GDP target is that it could be viewed as a regime change, and to the extent that it reflects a real change in how the Fed is doing business, it might have a more dramatic effect on expectations than something more incremental.  That being said, of course, big changes are also dangerous, and that’s something we need to keep in mind. Now, a fourth question.  So—first, inflation targeting; second, conditional commitment; third, intermediate targets.  A fourth question—there was a lot of discussion last time about the economic projections; can we use those better.  I think we’ve made a lot of progress on that front.  In particular, we have a proposal to look at projections of our policy rate.  In what way could that be complementary to an improved communication strategy. Finally, let’s not forget, it’s important as we talk about these things to keep in mind process.  Is there a way that we can put this all together in a way that will satisfy the appropriate consultation and discussion within the Committee but also allow us to bring this to the public in a way that will be better understood and better accepted.  In particular, a specific suggestion that’s been made is that we use the approach we did with our principles of exit strategy, which we published in June in the minutes.  Would it be possible, if we do adopt some changes in our communication strategy, to agree on a set of principles that would be sufficiently broad to encompass Committee support, that we could then put out through the minutes or some other mechanism.  I think there’s a whole bunch of interesting questions here, and this is very central to our current policy decisions.  We don’t have to resolve all of these questions today, but I do think that this is a valuable investment in time, and I look forward to your comments. Beginning the go-round, I see President Evans is first on the list.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by one person discussing various topics for consideration.


Passage number 76.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude towards President Evans.


Passage number 77.
  Since you took my name in vain, I do feel constrained to mention— MR. EVANS.  No, I thought it was good.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply mentions that they thought something was good in response to someone taking their name in vain.


Passage number 78.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But I do think I need to clarify that those comments were directed at the country that actually was suffering significant deflation, and so it was failing on both the price stability and the economic growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a clarification statement.


Passage number 79.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes, I think you’re right.  I understand that, and in fact, I spent a little more time reading Friedman and Schwartz and The Great Contraction, and at the end of that lovely chapter, they had this section on why monetary policy was so inept.  And I remember back to the lovely Milton Friedman celebration of his 90th birthday party where you gave a speech where—with Milton Friedman in the front row, attentive as always after a very long night before and that morning and afternoon—you assured him that the Federal Reserve had, indeed, caused mischief in the ’30s, and that we wouldn’t do it again. I looked at that chapter, and I totally agree with you that you have been faithful to that.  During the contraction, there were policies that should have been taken that were not, that could have prevented deflation and the Depression.  I agree with that.  I think we could do more, though.  That’s all I’m saying.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the person they are addressing and expresses their agreement with the points made.


Passage number 80.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  A two-handed intervention, President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions President Kocherlakota's two-handed intervention without offering any conflicting information or opinions.


Passage number 81.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The dialogue that you and President Evans just had is relevant when we think about the Eggertson and Woodford model and the Werning model.  I have to admit I understand the Werning model a little better, but in those models, basically, price-level targeting works extremely well, except for the presence of the zero lower bound.  It means in some settings that you’re not able to keep prices growing at 2 percent or constant.  If you’re ever in a situation where you’re meeting your price-stability mandate in the Werning model, if you’re doing well on that and hitting 2 percent, 2 percent, 2 percent, you do not have a problem in that model.  That’s also true in Eggertson and Woodford. I think it’s important to make this distinction that you just made between that and Japan and the U.S. in the ’30s, that those were situations where you could easily point to problems on the price-stability mandate and see that the central bank is not behaving optimally.  I think it’s more challenging in our current environment where, as you expect in Minneapolis, we’ve done extremely well on our price-stability mandate—over the past four or  five years, we’ve done very well on it.  There are some differences of opinion about how well we’re going to be doing going forward, but even there the differences of opinion are relatively minor compared to what we saw in Japan. I think when we look at these New Keynesian models—they’re very hard to bring support for the kind of commitment policies that President Evans has in mind because we’re just not that far away from our price-stability mandate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 82.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, obviously this will be taken up in some length.  [Laughter]  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The mention of laughter also suggests a light-hearted or humorous atmosphere, further indicating absence of disagreement.


Passage number 83.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  President Evans was quite eloquent and expansive.  [Laughter]  I have a great deal of sympathy with his views.  I’ll take a different strategy and use a little more brevity in my remarks. In terms of question 1, flexible inflation targeting can be consistent with the dual mandate, but being clear about exactly what is meant is critical.  Some use the term to place a heavy weight on inflation and a small but nonzero weight on employment.  Others use it to imply a lexicographic preference between inflation and unemployment, that is, as long as we are below the inflation target, we have the flexibility to address large output gaps.  I would be opposed to either of these interpretations of flexible inflation targeting.  What I would support is a quadratic loss function with roughly equal weights on inflation and unemployment as in the optimal policy simulations in the Tealbook, Book B.  Were we close to the inflation target but far from our estimate of full employment, we would be accommodative to reduce the quadratic loss function.  Were we close to full employment but well above our inflation target, we would have more restrictive policy to return to our inflation target and reduce our loss function. In terms of question 2, our current approach of using calendar dates to signal the first increase in the funds rate is potentially problematic if we are not willing to adjust it to changing circumstances.  For example, significantly greater downside risks or worse-than-expected economic outcomes after the date is set, so that economic conditions are no longer consistent with the original calendar date.  I would prefer to announce our intent to remain at the zero bound until we hit specific economic triggers, such as an unemployment rate at or below 7 percent and an inflation rate of 3 percent or higher.  Of course, we would not view such triggers as absolute and independent of all other economic conditions.  For example, a forecast of exceptionally strong or weak growth as we approached a trigger might force us to take action earlier or later.  I would strongly support moving to conditional commitments, such as the example in option A.   In terms of question 3, I would support considering moving to nominal GDP targeting if it is necessary to forcefully convey a change in regime.  It would be most appropriate if we want to signal a regime change that requires more aggressive policies moving forward.  I view nominal GDP targeting as preferable to price-level targeting because it is easier to communicate, performs better in simulations, and does not emphasize just one element of the dual mandate.An announcement that nominal GDP targeting was necessary to get much stronger growth in output is understandable to the public and could be effective if it was conveyed in conjunction with more aggressive actions. In terms of question 4, we need to be clear what we’re trying to communicate.  If we’re trying to communicate why we were taking policy actions, then enforcing a common interest rate path across all participants, such as an assumption of no change in interest rates or the interest rate path embedded in the futures market, may be appropriate.  If our policy differs from the assumptions, we would show that our forecast with those assumptions is not consistent with our goals and use that communication to justify a different policy than what was used in the forecast.  A potential problem is that it may be difficult to make clear at times why our forecast deviates substantially from what we expect.  A second potential problem is that an interest rate path alone may not be sufficient for describing policy over the next several years, given the prominence that balance sheet policies have played.  If instead we are trying to communicate our best forecast for important economic variables, I would prefer to use optimal policy as we do now, even though we might disagree on how we get there.  Of the two, my guess is the general public is primarily interested in our best forecast.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing his own views and preferences on different topics, but there is no conflict with anyone else in the passage.


Passage number 84.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple expression of gratitude from President Plosser.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given passage does not contain any apparent contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude from President Lacker.


Passage number 86.
  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  How smart is your brother-in-law.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a humorous statement followed by a question about someone's intelligence.


Passage number 87.
 MR. LACKER.  He’s a doctor.  I won’t say anything more.  [Laughter] Price path targeting does a bit better, except for the times when the price level is well below the target path, and then you’d have to do logarithms.  Again, he would call me.  [Laughter]  I think it would be really hard for him to figure out what number to put in that software, and that is a test for simplicity and clarity that I am attracted to. The fourth question:  What should we do.  I found the document we drafted earlier this year compelling.  It explains the relationship between unemployment and inflation—as best we can forge a consensus on it within this group—and does a very good job of embodying that consensus about the relationship.  Recasting that document as an explanation of the Federal Reserve’s flexible inflation-targeting framework seems like an ideal approach.  Using that as a vehicle for slipping into the public domain our commitment to a numerical inflation objective seems to me like the best approach going forward.  Let me leave it at that.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement and support for a particular approach, without any contradictory or conflicting views being presented.


Passage number 88.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You could tell your brother-in-law what his revenue is going to be in his practice under nominal GDP targeting.  [Laughter] There actually was a good complementarity between your remarks and President Evans’s, and you talked about the uncertainty of the NAIRU over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The mention of laughter suggests a lighthearted and agreeable atmosphere. Additionally, the reference to complementarity indicates that the remarks made by the speaker and President Evans align with each other.

Passage number 93.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, would like to compliment the staff on the fine work they did in advance of the meeting.  I see this discussion of alternative frameworks—and I hope I am not getting ahead of the discussion—as boiling down to two questions.  The first is:  Should the Committee shore up its existing framework to be more effective.  To that, I would answer yes.  The second question is:  In light of the extraordinary circumstances of the economy, should the Committee shake things up, go beyond the existing framework, and go in another direction.  To that question, at the moment at least, I would answer no.  I don’t think the cost-benefit or the risk-reward tradeoffs justify such a move.  I do see that clarification and reaffirmation of the Committee’s basic framework and strategy, and an explicit inflation target, could serve to make the existing and future policy elements more effective.  It will serve to reassure the public that there is coherence to the Committee’s approach and remove some uncertainty at a time when uncertainty is a major negative factor weighing on the economy. Now let me turn to the questions posed by the staff, and I will paraphrase these questions.  Is a flexible inflation-targeting framework consistent with the dual mandate.  Yes, I think flexible inflation targeting, with flexibility around the price-stability mandate, allows for balancing the two objectives in the short term when required while still encompassing the belief that the two mandates are complementary over the longer term. Should we enunciate it as our working framework, perhaps in a way similar to the exit strategy statement.  I think it would be constructive to clarify our working framework in a general sense, and the method used in communication of the exit strategy seems like a reasonable approach.  Also, the consensus-building process that preceded the addendum to the minutes I thought was quite effective.  I also think it would be useful to provide more specifics about certain operational definitions relating to an inflation objective.  We might put more definition around what is meant by short term, medium term, and long term.  For example, we might state that over a long-term horizon of five years or longer, the Committee believes an average year-over-year growth rate of 2 percent, as measured by the overall PCE index, is consistent with the price-stability mandate. We might then state that over a medium-term horizon of three to five years, the Committee seeks to maintain an average year-over-year growth and overall inflation in a range —and this is for example only—of 1 to 3 percent.  This range reflects the intent to keep overall inflation reasonably close to the long-term target while maintaining the flexibility to respond to economic conditions and shocks as required by the other half of the dual mandate.  In the short run—a period of up to three years, and a horizon captured by the Committee’s SEP—the Committee, we might say, aims to closely monitor underlying inflation trends and inflation expectations.  In such a scheme, there is a cascading from explicit long-term objective to performance within a range in the medium term to monitoring underlying inflation expectations in the short term. Should the Committee announce conditional commitments.  If so, how to communicate them.  It is difficult to argue against the principle of credible commitment to an optimal policy path.  That said, I view an explicit threshold for the unemployment rate as potentially problematic.  Our understanding of participation trends, the equilibrium rate of unemployment, the lag in unemployment relative to GDP growth, and any number of other recent labor market developments suggest to me that an explicit threshold for unemployment is risky.  I am also concerned about combining a real-time threshold for unemployment with an inflation threshold based on forecast, because the realization of an unemployment rate result is immediately verifiable, while an inflation forecast is inherently speculative.  I am concerned that the public would interpret such conditionality as a de facto subordination of the inflation objective to an unemployment threshold.  I am more comfortable with the communication method used in paragraph 4′ in this meeting’s proposals, which treats the interest rate, inflation, and unemployment rate conditionality symmetrically—an approach indicating the Committee’s expectations of conditions that will prevail prior to commencing exit.  If the Committee decides to be more activist, I think we need a nominal anchor to reassure the public that we have not lost sight of, and are not jettisoning, the inflation or price-stability objective.  The public wants to know how much tolerance we will admit around the 2 percent inflation objective. What about price-level targeting or nominal income targeting.  Although both of these options have merit, both entail serious communications challenges, as the staff memos have pointed out.  My concern is that a shift to either option, but particularly nominal income targeting, would be viewed as a significant change of the Committee’s approach.  This might introduce more uncertainty about monetary policy and its intent at a time when we should be trying to reduce uncertainty. Finally, a more general question:  What steps should the Committee take to provide more information to the public about the expected course of policy.  I continue to favor inclusion of implied policy paths in the quarterly SEPs.  If the Committee decides to move in the direction of explicit employment and inflation thresholds in the statement, then a more complete rethinking of the SEPs seems necessary.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 98.
 MR. EVANS.  President Bullard, you often had mentioned the Benhabib–Schmitt-Grohé paper—and I have to admit that the half-life of my understanding of those analyses is usually less than a full meeting length when I ask my staff about that—but I thought that that relied on a Taylor-rule monetary policy, doesn’t it .
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Evans is expressing his lack of understanding and questioning President Bullard's assertion about the Benhabib-Schmitt-Grohé paper relying on a Taylor-rule monetary policy.


Passage number 99.
  MR. BULLARD.  The problem in the model is that you’re fully committed to the Taylor-type policy rules.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a problem with a model, but there is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 100.
 MR. EVANS.  But we’ve been running balance sheet policies and we’re also at the zero lower bound, so obviously we’re still running that type of policy.  Isn’t that the kind of thing that would tend to break that equilibrium.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker only offers a statement about the existence of something in memos without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 103.
 MR. BULLARD.  —certain type of policy rule.  If that policy rule is going to tell you that you’ll never move off zero until certain conditions are met, then the public starts to think, okay, you’re never going to meet those conditions, so you’re going to stay at zero.  One of the conditions is that inflation is near target, but because of the Fisher relation, inflation expectations are low, and so you’re just permanently below the target.  That’s what happened in Japan, where they’ve had mild deflation for 15 years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, is simply explaining a certain type of policy rule and giving an example of how it played out in Japan.

Passage number 106.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think, President Bullard, that some of us are confused about the dynamics and the inflation-expectation formation process that supports that equilibrium.  In other words, it’s obviously an equilibrium, but is it one that would naturally occur.  Rather than ask you to answer that here, maybe you could help us with some comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing confusion and seeks clarification on the dynamics of an equilibrium and the inflation-expectation formation process. They are not presenting any opposing views or challenging President Bullard's statement.


Passage number 107.

Passage number 109.
 MR. BULLARD.  It’s fair to say—I wrote it down in my model—that the one equilibrium is the one that’s the natural one to focus on, but you’ve got a country that’s stuck at the other equilibrium.  Your theory has to tell you why you’re going to be at one equilibrium versus the other.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement that highlights the need for a theory to explain why a country is stuck at one equilibrium rather than another.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 116.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate the Board staff’s analysis of these alternative policy frameworks, as others have noted.  Looking at ways to strengthen our framework and strategies for the longer term certainly is worthwhile, given the importance of our credibility to effective monetary policy. I do support efforts that strive to make monetary policy transparent, credible, and clearly communicated.  But in reading the alternatives and how they are interpreted in the Tealbook, transparency appears to be equated to additional stimulus when, in fact, the two strike me as separate concepts.  In my view, adopting new strategies to achieve additional stimulus in the near term is unlikely to accelerate the broad and necessary process of deleveraging and rebalancing now under way in the economy without risking the low and stable inflation we have worked to achieve, sometimes at great cost, over the past 30 years. Looking ahead to the long-term application of these alternative frameworks, I also see potential practical problems with their implementation, even though they appear to work well in simulations.  In particular, the communication challenges associated with changing our policy framework now would be tremendous, raising the possibility of increasing rather than decreasing uncertainty in what are already uncertain times. Let me turn briefly to my comments on the specific questions raised.  While the general concept of flexible inflation targeting seems innocuous, there are a number of definitional issues I find that are unresolved.  How would the explicit inflation objective be defined.  What inflation rate, what horizon, what numerical value.  And specifying an inflation target also raises the question of how the Committee would define “maximum employment”—the other component of the dual mandate. Second, the concept of optimal policy under commitment depends on a model, which immediately leads to questions about how different models reflect reality, and thus, produce different optimal policies.  Some have noted how different preferences can contribute as well. For instance, I differ from the authors and would argue that inflation of 2½ percent over several years is more costly than inflation of 1½ percent, because of the risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unhinged.  Commitment is elusive, because we cannot bind ourselves, or our successors, to carry through on any forward guidance we provide today.  As economic circumstances change, the temptation to deviate in the future from today’s promises will be significant. Regarding strategies for price-level or nominal income targeting, I am concerned with basing policy decisions on only one or two variables.  The financial crisis reminded us that policy decisions should be based on a range of data that can inform us about the state of the economy and the outlook.  While our primary objectives are inflation and employment, financial stability is both important and consistent with our long-run mandate.  A narrower focus on inflation and employment in the medium term could lead to a costly miss of our financial stability objective in the longer term. Finally, I would be interested in exploring the idea of augmenting the SEP to include more information about our expected policy paths.  Adding such information to the SEP has the potential to enhance transparency and provide more flexibility, in my view, than incorporating specific funds rate projections associated with unemployment and inflation triggers.  Since the public is beginning to be more familiar with the SEP, the communications challenges may be easier to overcome.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: The passage shows disagreement on several points. Ms. George disagrees with the interpretation of transparency as equating to additional stimulus. She also expresses concerns about the potential risks and practical challenges associated with adopting new strategies. She questions the definitional issues and unanswered questions related to flexible inflation targeting. She also expresses disagreement with the concept of optimal policy under commitment and the focus on price-level or nominal income targeting. Lastly, she suggests exploring the idea of augmenting the SEP to provide more information about expected policy paths, which differs from incorporating specific funds rate projections.


Passage number 117.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply conveys gratitude towards President Pianalto.


Passage number 118.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also want to thank the staff for the excellent work they did on this important issue.  I am going to focus my comments on the questions. My answer to all parts of the first question is yes.  I view flexible inflation targeting as consistent with our dual mandate, and I think that we should enunciate this framework.  As I have indicated in past meetings, I think that adopting an explicit numerical objective for inflation would enhance our accountability, our transparency, and our communications.  We can and should go farther than simply saying the Committee seeks price stability, and we should define numerically what price stability means. I would also be comfortable with indicating that the Committee estimates an unemployment rate of, say, around 6 percent to be consistent with maximum employment, as long as we make it clear that monetary policy does not determine what rate of unemployment is consistent with full employment.  It would be helpful to try to formulate a consensus statement on the Committee’s monetary policy framework as we did with our exit strategy. Moving to the second set of questions, broadly, I see some form of conditional commitment as having value for improving our communications by providing more information on the policy reaction function.  In principle, I think we could help the public to better understand how the Committee is likely to respond by using the SEP to provide the economic conditions underlying our forward guidance. Paragraph 4′ in policy alternative A1 strikes me as presenting an approach that could be helpful.  I think it would be more difficult to go further, as paragraph 4″ does, to set policy thresholds, because simple thresholds cannot capture the range of factors we will want to consider in determining the future course of policy. Moving to question 3, of the options considered, I agree with the Board staff assessment that targeting the level of nominal income appears to work well in some challenging scenarios.  But I would reserve a change in our operating procedure for an extreme event, such as a significant risk of deflation or another recession.  Should we face such prospects, I think that nominal income targeting would be our best option for providing significantly more policy accommodation while making clear our commitment to both components of our dual mandate. Finally, in response to question 4, as I have already suggested with my responses to the other questions, to improve our communication and effectiveness of policy, I would favor enunciating our flexible inflation-targeting framework and adopting an explicit numerical objective for inflation.  I would also favor providing forward guidance more clearly linked to our SEP.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 120.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 121.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Successful communication of our policy framework is especially important as we navigate uncharted waters of unconventional policies.  A critical goal of our communication, to me, is to maintain well-anchored inflation expectations.  During the past few years, the anchoring of inflation expectations has paid huge dividends.  It stemmed what could have turned into a sustained deflationary dynamic, and it also provided monetary policy with greater maneuvering room for extraordinary accommodation with less danger of high inflation.  To further reinforce the anchoring of inflation expectations, I strongly favor publicly stating an explicit inflation objective in the context of our dual mandate.  I should say that I am one of the latter participants to go in this round, so many of my further comments are going to echo comments of other participants.  In particular, I noticed that some of my comments are very closely aligned with President Rosengren, and some of my other comments are very closely aligned with President Plosser.  I am not sure how often that sentence is uttered.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing the author's views and acknowledging that some of their comments align with the views of other participants. There is no contention or disagreement present.

  [Laughter] MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 124.
 WILLIAMS.  I, too, think it would be useful to make a general statement of the Committee’s policy framework that we all agree on, and to publish that in the minutes, as was done with the exit strategy.  I actually think flexible inflation targeting is a good framework for thinking about that.  It is a big tent, as many people have already mentioned, but with this group you may need to have a big tent like that, and so that is a good approach.  As President Plosser earlier said, the work that was done by the ad hoc group on putting together a one-pager about the framework around a numerical inflation objective is a good place to start on that.  I will add that inflation targeting has proven to be a very highly successful strategy that has been used in many countries. I do think we have to be careful in how we publicly describe our current policy framework if we were to describe it as flexible inflation targeting.  The problem, which has already been mentioned by a number of people—and this is where President Rosengren’s comments and mine overlap—is that flexible inflation targeting is a very elastic term.  It means different things to different people.  For example, some inflation-targeting central banks have a hierarchical mandate in which price stability is the prime goal.  That is not how I interpret our dual mandate or our framework.  Explicitly identifying ourselves as an inflexible inflation targeter could be misperceived as tipping the balance of our dual mandate strongly toward price stability.  This could complicate already daunting communications challenges, and it could be seen as inconsistent with the mandate given to us by Congress.  If we were to publicly describe our framework as flexible inflation targeting, which I do support in principle, it is important that we do so along the lines that Lars Svensson has done, and that is as a balanced approach, with a significant weight on both parts of the dual mandate. With regard to communicating the optimal policy under commitment, such an approach is attractive for the reasons that were laid out in the staff memos.  Unfortunately, for similar reasons that President Bullard mentioned, I think it is an unrealistic benchmark.  In the jargon of academics, our commitment technology is very limited.  It is simply impossible for us to set a predetermined course of policy that will bind future Committees.  Another comment I will make on the staff presentations, which were really helpful, is that the differences in the outcomes under the different policies that they look at—nominal income targeting or inertial Taylor rule or optimal policy—depend critically on the expectations of events that are many years in the future, another point that President Bullard and others have made.  For example, if you look at exhibit 2 from Mike Kiley’s presentation, it is striking that the inertial Taylor rule and the nominal income-targeting rules actually yield essentially the same unemployment paths, as I see it, up until 2017, yet the inflation rates starting from 2012 are very different.  I have dabbled in the dark arts of large-scale macro models, so I have some understanding of how these models work.  Events way out in the future can really feed back into the present in a very strong way, and there is a lot of uncertainty about how strong the feedback effects are of events five, six, seven years in the future on the actual inflation and unemployment rates today.  I am not sure if, in reality, the simulations may exaggerate the benefits of differences in policy regimes.  As President Bullard said, these simulations assume rational expectations, and that everybody instantly knows the change in the policy regime.  In practice, I think there would be some learning and adjustment that would again reduce the differences in the policy alternatives. Instead of thinking of optimal control as being the approach that we should be concentrating on, we should aim to communicate as clearly as possible our current reaction function.  Policy thresholds could help in this communication.  Alternatively, as Governor Tarullo and I argued last time, and a number of participants have already mentioned, we could include our individual projections about the appropriate path of monetary policy in the published SEP.  Then, as our forecasts for economic activity, inflation, and the funds rate evolve, the public would get a clear picture of the state-contingent nature of our policy reaction function.  Although I have not yet studied the results that we were sent this weekend from the trial run of the SEP, my reading of the SEP answers is that these are consistent with what I think of as a pretty clear view of where policy is expected to evolve, with a liftoff apparently in early 2014 or so, with a range of views on that.  That range of views in the SEP about when liftoff is and what the policy will look like going forward is consistent with the range of views on inflation and economic activity.  That would benefit transparency, and it would be consistent with our policy framework and communication. Finally, I don’t believe this is now the time to switch to a price-level or nominal income target.  In theory, these approaches can work very well.  President Lacker, and I think President Kocherlakota, brought up the issue that you should be really evaluating policy frameworks in an unconditional stance, thinking about how they perform on average.  I and many other people have actually looked at that issue in different models and under different assumptions.  The way I would summarize is that a very good monetary policy rule—a well-calibrated Taylor rule, or an optimal control policy, or a nominal income-targeting policy, or a flexible price-level targeting policy—all of these do really well if they are well designed.  They do roughly equivalently well in normal conditions.  Looking at that question doesn’t give you an answer about which framework you want.  You really do have to think about the communications issues and also the unusual circumstances that we are in today.  At this time, switching horses in the middle of the stream could confuse more than clarify, and ultimately could backfire.  In particular, nominal income targeting seems to muddy the waters.  Investors care separately about prices and about quantities.  And, importantly, we care separately about prices and about quantities.  Looking at only nominal income, which mashes together prices and quantities, seems to me at this time to be counterproductive and could undermine the anchoring of inflation expectations.  Thanks.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 126.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to start and conclude where President Williams concluded.  That is, I don’t think now is the time, but I do think it is a subject we are studying. First, I want to thank the staff for their good work.  I also want to thank them for their honesty.  I thought section 4 about the risks of our models at least, and the faulty potential of our models, was frank and honest.  I do want to have submitted for the record a particularly pungent sentence, which says, “Given that the strategies we consider lack historical precedent, and even the tools used to implement the strategies are relatively unconventional, there is considerable risk that our model results may prove faulty in some respect.”  Indeed, any policy outside the range of historical experience, ranging from the strategies considered here to balance sheet adjustments and macroprudential regulation, could have unintended consequences for economic welfare, for better or for worse.  Your section 4 expands upon that somewhat.  I thank you for the good work that you have put together. I am in favor of at least more discipline, if not a rule.  I think we have been a little bit spastic in the way we have developed policy, a little bit reactionary, and we have sent signals to the marketplace, which then seem to be built into expectations.  I would like to see a little bit more discipline as we go through time. I am in favor of the exercise.  I boil it down to two simple principles:  We have to be realistic, and we have to be credible.  What I mean by realistic is that we know that we have more influence on inflation as a monetary phenomenon than we do on employment.  What I mean by credible is that shifting horses, whether we do it midstream or whenever we do it, cannot be viewed as a weakening of our commitment to price stability, and cannot be viewed as, in particular, a weakening of our commitment to long-term price stability. I thought President George’s comments were interesting.  To me, the key variable is to identify a longer-term inflation target.  I am in favor of doing that.  President George pointed out some issues around that—which target do we pick, under what conditions, and so on—but talking about having one is a worthwhile exercise. Then, I would want to understand better within this Committee what the bands of tolerance are around that target if we are going to talk about flexible inflation targeting.  Once we have achieved that understanding, then I think we need to explain to the public that as long as we have a dual mandate we have to deal with both inflation and unemployment variables.  And as long as we have that mandate, then it may be desirable, if we decide that is the case at this table—once we have agreed on a long-term inflation target, and our tolerance bands around it—that we may have to deviate occasionally from our target on maybe the high or the low side in order to deal with our employment mandate. This is something that we should take some time to consider.  I started this meeting by giving President Bullard a six-pack of Shiner Bock beer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses a desire for more discipline in policy development and a preference for a longer-term inflation target, while also acknowledging potential risks and unintended consequences. However, there is no direct contention between different parties or individuals in the passage.


Passage number 127.
 MR. BULLARD.  Three left.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are three items remaining or left.


Passage number 128.
 MR. FISHER.  There are only two left, actually.  [Laughter]  Shiner Bock beer, by the way, Mr. Chairman, was picked because the Shiner brewery was founded in 1913, fitting for the Federal Reserve.  But if you look at the way beer is made, out of hops and grains, the standard formula has been in place since the year 1541 under a ruler of Bavaria named Henry IV.  Now, there have been improvements made to beer, but I think it is something that you would have to proceed with extremely slowly. I am not suggesting we take another 500-and-some-odd years to change our rule or our discipline, but I do think that we need to vet the thoughts that have been circling around this table.  Reference has been made to Ms. Romer.  I thought that was an interesting article.  However, I must tell you that all I got out of it was, “Be bold.”  That was what her message was.  I wasn’t convinced by her argumentation.  I have listened very carefully to Ken Rogoff, who is on our advisory committee at the Dallas Fed and our Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.  I respect him enormously.  And then, I observed the pushback that came from another person I respect enormously named Paul Volcker.  I understand that Tobin made the arguments in the 1970s, but I also understand that no other central bank has attempted what we are talking about.  You had a slight variation of price-level targeting in 1930 by the Swedes.  We love to evoke the Scandinavians at this table.  But it was not held for very long, and it was a variation of price-level targeting.  To my knowledge, no central bank has adopted nominal income targeting.  It is true that Tobin made the argument in 1970.  It is true that Martin Feldstein agreed with it. I did have Professor Feldstein down the other day to the Dallas Fed.  He is completely against it presently.  Why.  Because he doesn’t think we are quite credible yet in having anchored—and this is his own personal view—our commitment to long-term price stability.  I come back to long-term price stability.  To me, that is the key variable.  The flexibility around it is something that we need to define, and then we need to socialize it.  Despite the interest that has been shown by Goldman Sachs and Christy Romer and others, I think we need to socialize it further.  I would say at a minimum I would take the theoretical work that has been done, and some of the studies that we are doing, and at least get these out into academia and into a more serious discussion, so that we can evaluate these alternative policy rules and see what kind of criticisms come forward. Mr. Chairman, in short, I am in favor of trying to achieve greater discipline.  I would like to come up with a rule that is more modernized.  I am willing to change the formula to the beer that we brew, but we should take our time.  I would like to suggest that we look at a time horizon that doesn’t have to be infinite.  I would be against changing this horse in midstream now, as President Williams mentioned.  But I would at least like to have these questions discussed and vetted and thought through—including the risks that I mentioned at the very beginning—over the course of the next several months, if not half a year.  I think it is a worthwhile exercise.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought the staff work was excellent and thank them for all their efforts. I am not convinced our current framework is obviously inferior to some of the alternative frameworks that have been proposed.  I think market participants do know what our long-term inflation objectives are.  If you look at the SEP’s long-term inflation, it is in a very narrow range.  I think market participants have a pretty good understanding that we have something close to a quadratic loss function.  All you have to do is compare and contrast how we have reacted to the inflation and unemployment news in the U.S. compared to Europe, and you see quite a bit different path. What we should be focusing on is not so much frameworks but providing more insight to the public about what our reaction function is.  My emphasis would be on reducing the uncertainty about how we would likely react under a wide range of circumstances.  By doing that, we can accomplish two things.  One, we can reduce uncertainty about how monetary policy is likely to evolve, which should have favorable implications for risk premiums, therefore, making financial conditions more accommodative.  And, two, it would help markets to think along better with us, so it may enable market participants to better anticipate our future actions.  That means prices could adjust more rapidly to the receipt of new information on the economy or political developments that might affect the outlook. Now, having said that, I want to provide more information about our reaction function.  I don’t think that is a very simple task.  Not only are there 17 different reaction functions around the table, but it is also difficult to reduce those reaction functions into a simple two- or three-parameter mapping.  For example, specifying what the unemployment rate and the inflation rate forecast is likely to be as a precondition for exit, is probably too simplistic for most of us; other parameters might also be important, for instance, speed limits—how fast the unemployment rate is falling or inflation is rising—or the risk around the central forecast—if there is a very big skew in the outlook. Despite this, I think we can do more to overcome some of these problems.  First, we can provide greater detail about our individual forecasts, and we could aggregate this detail into consistent central tendency projections with respect to the inflation rate, unemployment rate, and the path of the federal funds rate. Second, we can explore in greater detail the degree of agreement within the Committee about what parameter values would be important in their view in influencing when exit might be likely.  If the dispersion turns out to be relatively narrow, then we could actually move down this path, hopefully over the next couple of meetings.  In this respect, in terms of the trigger values, I would much prefer escape clauses rather than triggers, because it gives us a little bit more flexibility.  It allows a little bit more nuance.  The fact that you only have two parameters with escape clauses is implicitly saying that those aren’t the only things that are important to you.  In my mind, expressing parameters with respect to inflation and unemployment is quite a bit superior to a date.  For one thing, we are probably going to move the parameters around a lot less frequently than we want to move around a date.  I have a lot less uncertainty about what my parameter values on unemployment and inflation are likely to be than I do about the date.  I have no idea when we are actually going to exit.  I have a point forecast, but there is a wide range around that.  Conversely, I have a relatively narrow range around the parameter values of unemployment and inflation that might trigger an exit. In terms of the types of foreign commitments discussed in the staff memo, I am skeptical that there are significant benefits, because I don’t know how we can tie our hands credibly—a point that many others have made—and I don’t think the model assumptions about how market participants form their expectations is necessarily correct, coming to the point about your brother-in-law. Finally, I worry that making binding commitments might be viewed as potentially reckless in a world where the outlook is highly uncertain.  If people thought we were making binding commitments and then we got a very bad draw relative to our modal forecast, we would then be committed to generating something that could be potentially a very unpleasant outcome.  Market participants would price that in immediately as a potential risk. In terms of the alternative frameworks, I have some skepticism about a nominal GDP targeting regime.  It is very difficult to explain, and it seems to bless outcomes in terms of growth and inflation combinations that we might not be happy with.  It seems to suggest that 5 percent real GDP growth and 0 percent inflation is equivalent to 0 percent real GDP growth and 5 percent inflation.  The former would be terrific, and the latter would be pretty horrible.  Explaining that in the context of nominal GDP target would be very difficult. In terms of price-level targeting, I see some value in environments in which deflation expectations are a problem.  The PLT could be helpful in those particular circumstances in anchoring inflation expectations.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 132.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 133.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to thank the staff for the quality of thought and work that went into the memos and for the time they spent with me answering my questions.  I also want to apologize to that same staff because my comments are going to take the intellectual level of this discussion down a number of notches, but I’ll remind you that the intended audience for any communication that we might make includes a lot more people like me than it does people like you.  [Laughter] I am in no position to question the theory, the assumptions, the thought, the quantitative analysis, the simulations, or the academic literature that underpin the framework memos.  As I thought about these over the weekend, I was reminded of a story that I first heard when I was in college, and maybe some of you heard it as well.  It’s the story of the physicist and the economist who were stranded at sea with nothing but a single can of beans to eat, and the physicist took the can of beans and applied precisely the right amount of force at exactly the right location and still couldn’t open the can of beans, despite having used the heat of the sun and the coldness of the water to soften up the metal.  So he asked the economist if he thought he could open the can of beans, and the economist looked at it and said thoughtfully, “Assume we had a can opener.”  So I focused on two aspects of execution, credibility and clarity, because all of the expected results depend critically on the assumption of a can opener—that is, absolute credibility and clarity. The Federal Reserve already enjoys a high degree of credibility stemming from its demonstrated commitment to containing inflation.  This credibility comes not so much from what we say, but from what we have done for many years, and the public has learned our ways.  For the most part, the public still trusts us to control inflation, and those who pay the most attention to what we say have come to understand that we will control it at a level of 2 percent or a bit less.  If we’re going to convince the public that we’re going to act differently in the future, especially far into the future, we will first need unanimous or near unanimous agreement and steadfast conviction that it’s the right course for us to follow, and we would need to speak with one voice to communicate clearly how we were changing and why.  Without near unanimity and one voice, the public could focus on the potential for the rotation of voters to change the path or the potential for the two open seats and the upcoming term endings on the Board to bring about a philosophical change or, in the worst case for credibility, the political debate could become fixated on effecting such a change through legislation or personnel changes. Finally, in order to protect the hard-won credibility that we already have, we must be absolutely clear about our intentions and our reasoning, and one carefully worded and unanimously supported statement is a start, but it has to be reinforced through repetition and explanation.  As an example, there’s already much confusion in the public about the difference between guarding against deflation and inflating our way to growth.  To return to the questions we were asked to address, I’m supportive of an effort to create a document that addresses our framework as long as it addresses both parts of our dual mandate.  I’m not opposed to making a clear statement about our objectives or even an explicit inflation target as long as we also articulate the way that the employment level influences our decisions.  It would be helpful if we could also articulate the way that asset purchases fit into our strategy and how the size of our balance sheet interacts with the federal funds rate and our policy objectives. Moving on to the question about using policy thresholds to explain our strategy, I used the fed funds rate in the alternative simulations to help me with my fed funds projections in this round, my understanding being that these are fed funds rates that most closely correspond with the historical behavior of the Committee if each of these scenarios were to unfold.  But when I tried to find the common thresholds in those simulations, I couldn’t do it, which underlined, for me at least, the need to think carefully about how we express ourselves.  In August we started down the path of using a date for forward guidance.  Then in September, with no one especially pleased with the idea of using a date, we discussed several alternative ways of providing guidance.  Before we change this again, I hope we’ll work very hard to forge agreement on the language, such as date, time, or threshold; the vehicle, such as statement, SEP, or separate document; the frequency with which we plan to adjust it; and whether we do it as a commitment or a forecast. As to changing frameworks altogether, such as a move to targeting nominal income or a price level, I found the discussion of risk in the memo quite persuasive and would hope that we could keep these weapons in reserve unless we see a recession scenario in which a dramatic change might better justify the risks.  In the meantime, it could help with clarity if we could work to educate the public about why we might make this choice. Here’s what I would most like to see us do:  Rather than each trying to convince the others that his or her approach is the best, maybe we could think about what it is that we all do agree on.  If President Williams agreed with both President Plosser and President Rosengren, that proves that this is possible, [laughter] and then we could work to explain that to the world. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 134.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much. Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude towards Governor Tarullo.


Passage number 135.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll begin where Esther began, with the observation that people’s preferences with respect to things we call framework or quasi-constitutional changes are almost always connected to substantive policy preferences.  I very much think that’s the case here, and so in part that leads me to want to bypass a lot of this discussion in order to focus on the question of what should we be doing given the fact that we have somewhat differing analyses of where the economy is.  I think that leads to more need for communication, but it pushes me away from a preference for structural or quasi-constitutional changes because of my observation that writing constitutions or frameworks tends to become more complicated precisely because there’s a different set of debates going on underneath, which are substantive policy debates.  And, while I wouldn’t foreclose any of that, having listened to most of the conversation already today, it doesn’t strike me that there’s been an enormous amount of convergence thus far around any new framework. The second introductory observation I’d make is that the more I’ve read in the intermeeting period about the way other central banks do everything, do inflation targeting and economic projections and the monetary policymaking in general, the more I have been impressed with the—how shall I put this neutrally.—peculiarity of the Federal Reserve System.  Thus the tentative conclusion that much of what may work in other countries, in other monetary policy committees in other systems, may not work particularly well precisely because of the different institutional characteristics that the Federal Reserve System has. Turning to the questions that the staff put in front of us, I’m going to change the order somewhat and start with the framework question.  To Richard, I would say that the possibility of unanticipated negative consequences is a sobering one to be sure, but one always has to balance that with what the costs of the status quo are, and that’s where we get to substantive issues again.  My own view, which won’t come as a surprise to anyone, is I am deeply distressed with the status quo.  I fear, as an increasing number of people do, that we are sliding into a period of stagnation, which will become ever more difficult to extract ourselves from.  As an ex ante matter, I wouldn’t dismiss something just because there probably will be negative unanticipated consequences.  However, I think Janet and a number of others have pointed to anticipated negative consequences, which could be associated with some of the framework changes, and add to that the communications difficulties that a number of you have pointed out, and it seems to me—again, like many, though not everybody here—that these things are worthy of continual consideration in the event that the economy deteriorates further or, regrettably more likely perhaps today than a few days ago, we get a major external shock sometime in the not-too-distant future. I’m going to pair the threshold proposal with the SEP because I think they are both about communications.  As everybody knows from the last meeting, John and I were trying to push forward onto the table the use of the modified SEP as a surrogate for the use of the thresholds, and I continue to think that bears consideration, but I’m going to place two qualifications on my own predisposition. First, I read the results of our initial foray here as posing more of a communication problem than I had anticipated, and I am of the provisional conclusion that aggregating the 17 individual results is not going to do the trick.  We may want to think about some alternatives, again, taking into account the peculiar institutional characteristics of the Fed for this purpose, the fact that we are a very large group compared with other central banks that have this kind of exercise.  The academics with whom I’ve spoken about these sorts of exercises all point to the value of the discussion whereby the monetary policy committee critiques, and comes eventually to some consensus, on the projected path of interest rates.  I have a vivid imagination, but I have had difficulty conjuring up the scenario in which the 17 people around this table come to a consensus view on a projected path of interest rates.  But it seems at least plausible that if staff could construct three scenarios—one, relatively higher inflation; two, their baseline scenario; three, relatively lower inflation—we might have the opportunity to get most members of the Committee signing onto the proposition that if this, in fact, is the way that the economy evolves over the next eight quarters or whatever the projection period would be, then the anticipated federal funds rate path associated with that movement in the economy would be appropriate.  I don’t know if that’s possible either, but it seems to me worth thinking about. The second problem, which somebody alluded to earlier, and I did note this in my memo last time, is that at present we’ve got the big balance sheet in addition to the zero interest rates.  As many of us have said many times, beginning to draw down the balance sheet would be the equivalent of a tightening move and thus would be relevant to market actors and somehow that would be need to be factored in. Moving now to the flexible inflation approach, Jeff is absolutely right.  You state the proposition broadly enough, everybody can agree with it, and that allows everybody to tweak the particular clauses or phrases in the formulation in order to make it fit their policy predisposition.  As I’ve said before on this Committee, I was substantially more open-minded on stating an explicit inflation target when I walked in here two years and nine months ago than I am now, and the reason for that gets back to Esther’s observation.  I think to a considerable extent, it reflects, and would be perceived publicly as reflecting, a fairly strong, substantive preference for an inflation target over the other side of the dual mandate. I have listened to some of us around the table who basically say that if you do price stability well, you will promote maximum employment, which to me is very close to reading half the dual mandate out of the statute.  It is a coherent view of the world, but it’s not either what the statute says or my view of the world, and thus I have some substantial resistance to it.  There are some environments in which the establishment of an explicit inflation target, along with the kind of explanations of unemployment or maximum employment or output gaps that people have mentioned, could be perceived as a balanced embodiment of the dual mandate.  I don’t think that this is one of them.  Although I’m not closed-minded on the proposition, I have to say that there’s a substantial hurdle that I feel has to be overcome before I would be comfortable with it. My last comment would be that one way to potentially make me comfortable with an inflation target—contrary to what Esther said, as opposed to agreeing with her—is if it were put in place as part of an exercise that was actually accommodative.  That is, if the inflation target were put in place and the rest of the explanation of the dual mandate made an effort to communicate as clearly and credibly as we could a medium-term inflation target, while at the same time taking the kind of substantive policy accommodation steps which I think are needed, then it would be a different story.  But as Esther’s comment reflects and as I’ve heard others speak, it seems to me that a lot of people want actually to pull those apart because, quite legitimately, they have a substantive policy preference for not taking further accommodative action and, thus, don’t want to tie those two things together.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is sharing their own observations and preferences but does not engage in any debate or argument with others.


Passage number 136.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.  I’m sorry.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply includes expressions of gratitude towards Governor Raskin and President Kocherlakota.


Passage number 137.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Just a quick gloss on what Governor Tarullo said about the SEP paths of the target funds rates.  There was a lot of heterogeneity.  I was struck by that. I will say for myself, the question was about what I viewed as the optimal path of the fed funds rate.  The question was not about asking me to forecast what the fed funds rate was going to be—what the likely outcomes of these Committee deliberations would be.  My guess is that President Evans and I might come much closer on that calculation than we would if we were asked to be in charge of setting the fed funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply reflecting on their own views and clarifying the question that was asked.


Passage number 138.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 139.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I think flexible inflation targeting can be consistent with the dual mandate.  Unlike the Committee’s current approach of constrained discretion, flexible inflation targeting is more optimal if it involves conditional commitments referencing both parts of the dual mandate and indicating how policy rates will be adjusted going forward.  Constrained discretion, on the other hand, means that the Committee proceeds on a meeting-to-meeting basis and remains unwilling to promise future accommodation via communication.  With this current approach, the Federal Reserve will not meet its employment goal for a long time and may be at risk of undershooting its inflation goal as well.  Moreover, the continued use of constrained discretion means that the funds rate begins to increase in 2014 even though unemployment is well above the natural rate and inflation is below 2 percent.  I respond to question 1 by believing a framework of flexible inflation targeting can be structured to be better aligned with the dual mandate and more likely to lead to optimal results that are better achieved with commitment strategies that reference both employment and inflation.  In terms of articulating a framework, I see no downside and can imagine developing a statement on the policy framework similar to that used for the exit strategy statement. The staff memo on alternative frameworks describes the superiority of commitment strategies.  The memo makes clear that there are risks in such strategies, most notably risks related to the possibility that the commitment strategies would perform less well if their credibility were significantly questioned, and that there are challenges in the use of such strategies, most notably the challenge of communication.  Even the most stimulative policies considered do not imply significant overshooting of inflation above a possible long-run goal of 2 percent.  I believe that the commitment strategies are superior, but only with a strong caveat.  That caveat is the imperative of a well-developed and well-tested and multifaceted communication strategy.  Unfortunately, to date we have not put enough effort into framing such a communication strategy, and the results have been negative and troubling to this institution and to the Committee.  The launch of the second LSAP, for example, was met with a barrage of mostly uninformed negativity, which may have undermined its effectiveness. Paragraph 4 in alternative A1 presents three strategies with increasing commitment and accommodative value.  The first option is the least transparent, contains the lowest commitment, and accordingly, would provide the least accommodation.  The third option is the most transparent, contains the greatest commitment, and accordingly, I would expect it to provide the most accommodation.  The latter two options could bring about a noticeably faster fall in unemployment than under the baseline outlook while keeping inflation in the neighborhood of 2 percent.  Whichever of these options is chosen, there should be a corresponding communication program set forth for the Committee to discuss and debate.  In addition to this enhanced forward guidance, which looks more like the third option for paragraph 4 in alternative A1 and less like the first option for paragraph 4 in alternative A1, the staff memo describes two other commitment strategies:  price-level targeting and nominal income targeting.  Both of these strategies are shown by staff to be more optimal under various models, including FRB/US, than the Committee’s existing strategy.  I appreciate how critical credibility is to the execution and success of these commitment strategies and appreciate the scale and creativity that would be involved in the crafting of a comprehensive communication strategy. Again, I don’t view the communication challenge as insurmountable.  Rather, I would venture to say that communication thought of as a strategy is a challenge that needs more serious debate and piloting.  From this perspective, I believe the communication challenge to be just as intense for our current framework and choice of policy actions.  There’s continued risk to the credibility of the Federal Reserve in a decision to continue to engage in constrained discretion because we have not described to the public why we are choosing to engage in what we have decided is a suboptimal strategy. Model simulations suggest that nominal income targeting could provide considerable stimulus under the modal outlook and would perform well in a severe downturn or in response to an unexpected sustained rise in inflationary pressures.  Accordingly, if the credibility challenges could be overcome with a meaningfully robust and comprehensive communication program, I would view us as remiss in meeting the dual mandate if we were not to consider it. Finally, I should attempt to be concrete about what I think a communication plan includes.  At the very least, we need to be able to explain the expected transmission of the action.  I was stunned when talking to a group of bankers after one of them said to me, “Please stop.  Just stop.  What can we do to get you all to just cease.”  This kind of question makes it obvious that our actions are not completely understood and suggests that we focus resources on a communication plan both through the SEP and through a coordinated strategy that can explain how our policy actions are expected to work and how they may fall short.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a series of statements and opinions from Ms. Raskin regarding flexible inflation targeting and the need for a comprehensive communication strategy.


Passage number 140.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Questions.  I’m sorry.  President Lacker, do you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It consists of polite expressions, a thank you, and a simple request for a question.


Passage number 141.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  I have two questions.  Brian, as this chart shows, we’ve been buying a lot more nominals than TIPS, and under the same theory that lengthening our maturity of our portfolio twists the curve, that would also affect the breakeven spreads.  Do you think that’s happening.  And do you have a quantitative estimate of how much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by Mr. Lacker to Brian, seeking his opinion and a quantitative estimate.


Passage number 142.
 MR. SACK.  It could be happening.  We don’t have a good quantitative estimate.  The reason we include TIPS is we don’t want to distort the decomposition of nominal rates into their breakeven and real components.  We want to have some presence in that market, and, of course, when we calibrate the pace of purchases or the allocation of our purchases, we look at a variety of measures to try to judge how much we could buy without causing market strains. Here I’m showing gross public issuance.  When you compare it to gross issuance, it looks quite small, but I think we did have some concerns that going too fast could disrupt the markets, since this is a less liquid market anyway and there are a lot of buy-and-hold investors.  Having said all that, it’s possible we undershot, and indeed there were some commentaries by market participants, such as Barclay’s, talking about our programs actually putting downward pressure on breakeven inflation rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 143.
 MR. LACKER.  You gave us an estimate of the effect on the 10-year yield, but it would be nice to have an estimate of this as well. The second question is about Treasury debt issuance plans.  Is there anything you can tell us about what you know about their plans for next year and the extent to which they may be contemplating or may have embarked on a path that would to some extent offset what we’ve done.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for additional information and clarification.


Passage number 144.
 MR. SACK.  I believe they have not made debt management decisions in response to the effects of our program that would undo our program.  They are certainly not looking at rates and opportunistically saying, “Given what the Fed has done to the yield curve, we want to move further out in our issuance.”  Having said that, they were already on a course that was lengthening the average duration of their issuance, and I think that lengthening will continue over the near term.  At one of the recent meetings, we talked about Treasury expecting to be on a path toward a weighted-average maturity of about 70 months, the market having anticipated that, and I think the discussion at Treasury essentially is not whether to go beyond 70, but whether to stop at 70 or stop somewhat below that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 145.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It’s fair to say that we don’t think Treasury has adjusted their behavior in response to our behavior.  It sounds like that’s the key point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states their opinion that the Treasury has not adjusted their behavior in response to their behavior, without any contradicting perspectives or conflicting opinions being presented.


Passage number 146.
 MR. SACK.  They’re also considering a debt management innovation that would probably reduce the amount of duration that they issue.  They’ve asked the TBAC to consider the appeal of floating-rate securities, which of course would allow the Treasury to reduce rollover risk while not introducing duration into the market.  If that were a product that they brought on line and used in any size, that would actually help in terms of keeping duration out of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement about the Treasury potentially considering a debt management innovation to reduce duration and rollover risk.


Passage number 147.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 148.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only states the title or position of President Kocherlakota and does not provide any information or description that could suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 149.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a quick question, Brian.  In terms of table 18, what would Goldman Sachs look like if we looked at their liability structure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question by Mr. Kocherlakota asking for clarification from Brian on a specific topic.


Passage number 150.
 MR. SACK.  I initially had Goldman Sachs on the table.  I am contemplating whether to dig through my notes.  It looks a lot like Morgan Stanley.  I can send you the details.  The point is, both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs look different from institutions with larger banking operations in the sense that they both have some retail deposits but much less in the banking operation, and hence they rely more intensively on repo financing.  The point of this table is to say that was true for MF Global as well, but of course to a much more extreme degree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply discussing potential options and providing information about Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.


Passage number 151.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So, long-term unsecured debt would look roughly the same, you think, for Goldman Sachs in terms of percentage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple question asking for confirmation or agreement.


Passage number 152.
 MR. SACK.  I think it would be in the same ballpark now that the figures show.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their opinion without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 153.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude, indicating a positive sentiment.


Passage number 154.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Deposits would probably be a little less.  Their bank is probably a little smaller.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is solely expressing a probable decrease in deposits and the smaller size of the bank. There is no conflicting viewpoint or opposition presented.


Passage number 155.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 156.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 157.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’m sorry.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply consists of an apology and the mention of President Plosser.


Passage number 158.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I want to follow up with a question that Brian may not be able to answer, but I’m just curious.  If I looked at JPMorgan three years ago, before the crisis, roughly what percentage would they have had in repo and trading liabilities—just ballpark.  Twice this or 50 percent more or about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is simply asking a question and expressing curiosity about the percentage of repo and trading liabilities JPMorgan had three years ago before the crisis.


Passage number 159.
 MR. SACK.  I will have to check on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Sack simply states that he needs to check on something, without expressing any opposing view or conflicting position.


Passage number 160.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would guess more, because remember, they bought Washington Mutual, which had a lot of core deposits.  The repo books have generally come down over the past couple of years.  I would guess more, but I don’t think it’s so significant that you’d think they were in a very different position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing their own estimation and opinion based on their understanding of the situation. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 161.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  That’s kind of where I was.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not include any explicit contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser's statement is presented without any contradictory or opposing information.


Passage number 162.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Let me go to President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individual simply acknowledges the request to move on to President Fisher.


Passage number 163.
 MR. FISHER.  First, I want to congratulate you on handling MF Global the way you handled it.  I have a question about that, and I have two other questions.  But on this front, any other trip bars that might ensue from MF’s failure that you’re monitoring in terms of its impact on the system—not the Federal Reserve System, but on the fixed-income markets and on financial stability.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is congratulating the person on how they handled MF Global and then proceeds to ask a question about the potential impact of MF's failure on the fixed-income markets and financial stability.


Passage number 164.
 MR. SACK.  Yes, there are several areas we’re monitoring.  MF Global, of course, had essentially a large brokerage unit into futures markets.  One area we’re watching is whether their customers will experience any period of disruption and confusion about their ability to change positions.  There could potentially be odd short-term dynamics for futures markets. The second area is questions about whether the customers’ assets are truly fully there at the institution, and if there were problems in that regard, you could see a loss in confidence in other types of custodial arrangements or intermediaries. And the third area is whether there would be any consequences for repo financing, not necessarily direct consequences associated with the unwinding of MF Global’s positions, but broader concerns about whether repo funding for less liquid assets is as stable as the market had assumed. I’m sure there are others, but those are three areas that we’re watching.  Not having the benefit of seeing markets today, but through yesterday, it looked like the markets were not overly concerned with any of those systemic consequences, but that’s what we’ll continue to monitor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 165.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman, you wanted to add to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The Vice Chairman is being given an opportunity to contribute or provide additional information.


Passage number 166.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, just a few things.  This is the first significantly sized FCM, futures commission merchant, that’s failed in a way that they didn’t actually port the customer accounts off smoothly to some other entity.  There’s a little bit more uncertainty here because it has never happened like this before.  In the past, there has always been a smooth transfer of accounts. The second thing I would say is that it underscores how fast liquidity can dry up for a firm.  This is another firm that, while I wouldn’t say they were fine a week ago, they didn’t look like they were headed to collapse, and a week later they’re dead.  That is going to reinforce people’s anxiety about firms that are wholesale funded without any obvious lender-of-last-resort support from the central bank.  I think as long as other firms stay out of trouble, it’s not an issue, but if they get into trouble, people may actually pull back faster as a consequence. And the third thing, of course, is that this was triggered in part by, as Brian mentioned, European sovereign debt exposure.  To the extent that things in Europe deteriorate, other firms are viewed as having exposure to Europe, and that’s another aspect of this.  But so far we would say, and I think Brian and I would both agree, that the selloff in the market today really has very little to do with MF Global.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different aspects of the situation regarding MF Global.


Passage number 167.
 MR. FISHER.  I would add a fourth factor, which is humility versus arrogance and balanced risk.  The principals involved here were extremely arrogant, taking the positions that they had, and were imbalanced in terms of their judiciousness of risks, and I think the markets are well aware of that. The second area of inquiry I have, Brian, if you look at your chart 1 and chart 8, is with regard to the way Treasuries have moved and the initial way that corporate bond spreads moved—remember those spreads are relative to an increase in the yields as shown in chart 1.  Can you separate out for me the Operation Twist impact versus the impact of Europe in terms of influencing the way yields have moved.  The question really deals with the efficacy of Operation Twist—and mind you, we’re just starting this process—and trying to separate out the seesaw effect and the whipsaw effect of what’s happening in Europe.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and additional information.


Passage number 168.
 MR. SACK.  Are you specifically raising the question of whether Operation Twist passed through to the private borrowing rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for clarification on a specific topic.


Passage number 169.
  Or do you— MR. FISHER.  What I care about is whether it passed through to private borrowing rates.  That’s my priority—how it impacts the market for private debt.  Because chart 1 doesn’t indicate what one might have expected, but I care more about what happens in terms of private debt.  That should be our objective—affecting the real economy.  I am curious as to your judgment at this stage, and mind you, it is initial.  And then, how are you able to separate out the seesaw effect we have gotten from the standpoint of enthusiasm over Europe and then sudden disappointment on the details.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own priorities and what they care about, as well as their curiosity about the judgment and how to separate out certain effects.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 170.
 MR. SACK.  My assessment would be that Operation Twist put downward pressure on Treasury yields, as I said in the briefing.  All else being equal, the majority of that would have passed through to private borrowing rates—maybe not the entirety of it, but the large majority of it. What actually happened on the FOMC announcement was that private borrowing rates did not go down for lower-quality issuers, that spreads widened immediately.  But I would interpret that spread widening as more of a reaction to the concerns about the economy and the pessimism that was in the FOMC statement that apparently surprised market participants, rather than a lack of pass-through from the Twist action itself.   It wasn’t that Twist only affects Treasuries and nothing else.  We do think that arbitrage, all else being equal, would have pulled down the private borrowing rates.  You see that in the reaction of the 30-year swap rate.  The 30-year swap rate, in terms of credit risk, is somewhat complicated.  It does have a credit risk premium in it related to the LIBOR that it is referenced to.  It is not the credit risk of lending to a firm for 30 years, but it is essentially the credit risk of promising to lend to a bank that will be in the LIBOR panel for those 30 years.  That means it has a much smaller credit risk component than corporate yields.  You can look at this and basically, from the relative movement of swaps and Treasuries, assess whether Treasury yield movements pass through to private rates, all else being equal, and then add on top of that the effects on credit quality. In terms of assessed credit quality, for sure it has been a seesaw.  The market repriced to much wider credit spreads through early October associated with pessimism about the economy and concerns about risks emanating from Europe.  It is the same pattern we saw with the financials and their CDS spreads, and so on.  Then, as sentiment improved—which was the old theme of the briefing, as Europe seemed a little better and the data came in—that is really what led to a substantial narrowing of the corporate bond spreads.  But my guess is, as we seesaw here, if this pessimism we have seen in the past two days persists, we will again start to see some upward pressure on corporate yield spreads.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sack is suggesting that the widening of corporate bond spreads was more due to concerns about the economy and market participants' reaction to the FOMC statement, rather than a lack of pass-through from the Operation Twist action. This contradicts the idea that the spread widening was directly caused by the Twist.


Passage number 171.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  And then, one last quick question.  Do we know why the Norwegians liquidated their MBS portfolio entirely on Friday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for information.


Passage number 172.
 MR. SACK.  No, I don’t.  We didn’t run down that story.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Sack simply states that he does not have information about the story they didn't run down.


Passage number 173.
 MR. FISHER.  It might be interesting to get as much as we can.  They are running a $500 billion plus sovereign fund.  They do interact with the central bank.  I haven’t seen an explanation yet as to why they would liquidate their entire MBS portfolio.  If you can just follow up, I would be very grateful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing curiosity and requesting further information or explanation.


Passage number 174.
 MR. SACK.  Yes, that would be very easy for us to ask about.  We just haven’t done it yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states that asking about something would be easy, but it hasn't been done yet.


Passage number 175.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The statement "Thank you" by Mr. Fisher does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a polite response expressing gratitude.


Passage number 176.
 MR. EVANS.  I thought you spoke Norwegian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MR. EVANS simply expresses a thought or realization, without any opposing or conflicting views present in the statement.


Passage number 177.
   MR. FISHER.  They didn’t explain it in Norwegian or English.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply stating a fact about how something was not explained in a particular language.


Passage number 178.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that Governor Duke laughed.


Passage number 179.
 MS. DUKE.  My question goes back to the impact on customers of MF Global, and this question may not make sense because I wasn’t sure I understood the article I read just before I came in here.  But it was something about either clearinghouses or exchanges freezing customer transactions, customers of MF.  And then, I was remembering how some of the people who came through here were really unhappy in the Lehman bankruptcy about their collateral getting tied up in pieces.  Is there anything in moving derivatives to central counterparties that we should be aware of in connection with this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question posed by MS. DUKE seeking clarification on the impact of moving derivatives to central counterparties.


Passage number 180.
 MR. SACK.  That is related to one of the three broad concerns I talked about:  Would there be uncertainty about the client’s ability to change positions.  Would there be confusion about what the status of their assets was or not.  And as Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned, without the quick transfer of the client accounts, it leaves this uncertainty.  I don’t know enough about the legal arrangements to answer the questions you raise.  But how long that will take and how transparent it will be in terms of when the customers will be able to reaccess their positions is one of the big areas of uncertainty here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 181.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  SIPC is on the case now as a trustee, so they are trying to manage these accounts.  But I think there is definitely some freezing of assets and people not being able to execute this stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is disagreement or contention regarding the management of accounts and the ability to execute transactions due to freezing of assets.


Passage number 182.
 MR. TARULLO.  It’s CFTC rules, though, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Tarullo.


Passage number 183.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  FTC rules on it for the FCM.  And they were not a big firm, about $40 billion or $45 billion in assets, but they were very big in the commodities space.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It merely provides information about the FTC rules and the size of the firm in the commodities space.


Passage number 184.
 MS. DUKE.  Is there anything in that that would cause potential customers of, say, Morgan Stanley not to want to be customers of Morgan Stanley for just that reason.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any form of contention or disagreement. Two entities, MS. DUKE and Morgan Stanley, are being discussed, but there is no conflict or opposition expressed.


Passage number 185.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think this is probably viewed as a pretty idiosyncratic case.  But, like I said before—wholesale funding model, dependence on repo, exposure to Europe—our base case is that the contagion channel should be small, but there is some risk.  Brian, would you agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply presents their view and asks Brian for his agreement without showing disagreement with any opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 186.
 MR. SACK.  Right, exactly.  You have these relationships not only at FCMs but also through prime brokers, and so on.  When we saw some of the pressure on the financials, such as Morgan Stanley, through early October, there was a lot of focus on the prime-brokerage relationships.  We talked to some hedge funds who were actually trying to figure out how to hedge those exposures, so generally, that is a piece of the story about stress at any institution.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that there were concerns and discussions about the prime-brokerage relationships and how some hedge funds were trying to hedge their exposures during a period of financial pressure on institutions like Morgan Stanley.


Passage number 187.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If you feel we are going in the right direction rather than seeming to go in the wrong direction in terms of market sentiment, you would probably be less nervous about this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is expressing a hypothetical scenario and does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 188.
 MR. TARULLO.  But, Bill, when you said it was idiosyncratic, did you mean idiosyncratic to the underlying problems at MF Global.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a clarification question asked by Mr. Tarullo to Bill.


Passage number 189.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Without the actual passage, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. In order to answer this question, the passage needs to be provided.


Passage number 190.
  MR. TARULLO.  But in answer to Betsy’s question, were another firm that was a commodities merchant to get in trouble, there is no reason to expect that the exchange treatment of collateral would be different for them than it was in this case, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 191.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  What was unusual in this case was the fact that in the segregation of the customer accounts there was a shortfall, and that is gumming up the works, in a different way than you would expect in a normal case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 192.
 MR. TARULLO.  Are those the same accounts, or was the action on the Chicago Mercantile independent of the private customers’ accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question seeking clarification.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 193.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don’t know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 194.
 I think there was a press report about the CME saying that they were aware of problems with the customer— MR. TARULLO.  So maybe it is related.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents information about a press report mentioning the CME acknowledging problems with a particular customer, Mr. Tarullo. The statement "So maybe it is related" only suggests a potential connection, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 195.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  —segregated assets, but I don’t have any details on that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply stating that they do not have any details on segregated assets. There is no disagreement or contention expressed in this statement.


Passage number 196.
 MR. TARULLO.  If it is related, then it is purely idiosyncratic.  If it’s not related, then it gets to the way they conduct themselves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states two conditions - relatedness and conduct - without any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 197.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions President Lockhart without providing any specific information or context about him. Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement presented in the passage itself.


Passage number 198.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just to continue on the question of MF Global, a couple of weeks ago, as you see on chart 12, there was—and I hesitate to call it a “run” —but certainly a lot of pressure on Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which has eased.  Then, we get the first casualty with MF Global.  My broad question, Brian, is:  Are you more or less concerned about financial instability now than two weeks ago.  How is that trending.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question and a statement about the MF Global incident and its impact on financial stability.


Passage number 199.
 MR. SACK.  At best slightly more comfortable, but actually probably about the same.  As I noted, what happened a few weeks ago with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs was the same dynamic.  Taking Morgan Stanley as an example, based on their discussions about the firm’s exposures, I think market participants weren’t convinced that the firm actually had problematic exposures, but what they were convinced about was the fact that if the market got too concerned, they could put Morgan Stanley out of business because of their reliance on short-term funding markets.  I think that contributed a lot to the jitters that emerged in early October, and it is the same dynamic that ultimately brought down MF Global.  But I do want to emphasize that MF Global is a very different case than a Morgan Stanley, in terms of the aggressiveness—relative to its size—of how MF Global was positioned.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement that explains the similarities between the situations of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, and MF Global, highlighting the different levels of aggressiveness in their positions.


Passage number 200.
 MR. LOCKHART.  But their reliance on short-term funding is a lot different, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This statement does not express any disagreement or contention. It presents information about a difference in the reliance on short-term funding without expressing any opposing views.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 201.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  Morgan Stanley, we believe, has a very large liquidity cushion.  The MF Global experience showed you that whatever liquidity cushion you have can run off a lot faster than you expect.  Morgan Stanley is starting with a much better balance sheet than MF Global was, and they have been actually earning money.  One of the precipitating events for MF Global was that they took a very large loss in the most recent quarter.  That was really what started this thing spinning last Tuesday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents both sides of the argument regarding the liquidity cushion and balance sheet of Morgan Stanley compared to that of MF Global. It mentions that Morgan Stanley has a large liquidity cushion and a better balance sheet, but also acknowledges the possibility of a rapid loss of liquidity as shown by the MF Global experience.


Passage number 202.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Do you see any dynamic of predatory market players essentially gaining any victory with this one and moving on to the next most vulnerable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question being asked.


Passage number 203.
   MR. SACK.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states "No" without any opposition or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 204.
 MR. LOCKHART.  No, we don’t see anything like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident from the statement made by Mr. Lockhart, who clearly states that they do not see anything like what is being discussed.


Passage number 205.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don’t think this was about people shorting the CDS and driving down the stock price.  This is all about the fundamentals of the company; that would be my opinion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states a personal opinion about the reason behind a certain event in the financial market. There is no indication of disagreement or contention with another person or perspective.


Passage number 206.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I’ve got President Bullard and President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage without further context.


Passage number 207.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On MF Global—it became a primary dealer this year, is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward question asking for confirmation of a fact.


Passage number 208.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states "Mr. Sack. Right." without any opposing views or conflicting statements.


Passage number 209.
 MR. BULLARD.  Are we happy with our expanded criteria for primary dealers.  And does this give you any pause about that new, more expansive definition.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in the passage. It seems to be a straightforward question about the speaker's opinion on the expanded criteria for primary dealers. There is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 210.
 MR. SACK.  The new primary dealer policy just increases the transparency about the requirements.  There was no reduction in the requirements to be a primary dealer.  When we look at the primary dealers as candidates, there is an extensive review.  It covers quality of management, the quality of their systems, their financial health, and so on.  But we are at a disadvantage.  We are not a supervisor of this firm.  There is a credit review.  They passed the credit review.  But that doesn’t guarantee that they can’t go downhill.  As we see in the market price and everything, they went downhill very quickly and very unexpectedly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply explains the primary dealer policy and acknowledges the potential limitations of the credit review process.


Passage number 211.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Impossible to determine without any context or specific information about President Lacker's statements or actions.


Passage number 212.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, a question about MF Global, and then I want to follow up on a question from President Fisher.  MF Global is insolvent, I take it.  Is that our best information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply asks a question about the status of MF Global.


Passage number 213.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don’t think we know whether they are insolvent or not.  We know they can’t meet their obligations, but that doesn’t mean when they are all liquidated that the value of the assets couldn’t be a lot greater than the value of the liabilities.  We don’t know that.  The fact is that their long-term debt, which they have a small piece of, is trading at about, last time I saw, in the 35 to 45 percent per dollar range, which suggests that the market thinks that they are most likely to be insolvent.  But we are not going to know for a while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage presents different opinions and information about the financial state of a company, but there is no clear contention or disagreement between parties. The speaker acknowledges the possibility of the company's assets exceeding its liabilities when liquidated, but also presents information about the market's perception of insolvency. Overall, there is no direct disagreement or conflicting views present.


Passage number 214.
 MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Do you view how it has played out as inefficient ex post.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement by Mr. Lacker, seeking the other person's view on a situation.


Passage number 215.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It was inefficient in the sense that there was not an orderly bankruptcy process.  It would be much better if there had been a way to move the customer accounts to new firms, so that they didn’t get trapped.  It was messier than optimal.  Is it systemic or not.  Fingers crossed, we hope not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no evident contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is focused on describing a situation and suggesting a possible improvement without presenting contrasting viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 216.
 MR. LACKER.  About Richard Fisher’s question about corporate debt spreads—this actually came up at the last meeting.  We are operating under this habitat theory, and there is this question:  Is 10-year corporate debt in the same habitat as 10-year Treasuries.  Or is it in a separate habitat, and its yield doesn’t move.  And the data look like it is in a separate habitat, but you are saying that there was some offsetting move and some expectation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing a question and presenting different viewpoints without indicating any disagreement.


Passage number 217.
 MR. SACK.  Right, that’s what I’m saying.  Equity prices went down sharply on the FOMC announcement.  If the story were just a preferred habitat, so that Operation Twist only affected Treasuries and didn’t affect corporates and that explained the widening of spreads, that alone wouldn’t cause a big decline in equity prices.  Clearly the market read the FOMC statement as more pessimistic than expected and repriced equities and corporate bonds accordingly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the market's reaction to the FOMC announcement.


Passage number 218.
 MR. LACKER.  The question I want to ask is about 2-year versus 10-year corporates.  Do you view the impediments between those two markets as similar to the impediments between 2-year Treasuries and 10-year Treasuries.  Or are they in the same habitat.  And, in particular, does the fact that a corporation can operate in its own debt make it different from Treasuries.  And would that short-circuit the effect you want to have on the shape of the yield curve in the Treasury market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is asking a question and seeking clarification on the differences between 2-year and 10-year corporates and whether they have similar impediments as 2-year and 10-year Treasuries. There is no clear contention or disagreement present in this passage; it is simply seeking information and insights.


Passage number 219.
 MR. SACK.  I would argue that what we have seen from the experiences with the Federal Reserve policies is that there clearly is preferred habitat across the Treasury curve, across maturities.  I would imagine that, to a large degree, you would see some of that preferred habitat pass through on the corporate side as well.  I wouldn’t view corporates as a single asset class where duration doesn’t matter.  Are you asking if the degree of market segmentation is greater in Treasuries than in corporates across maturities.  That is a bit harder.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The speaker is expressing an opinion and discussing the possibility of market segmentation in both Treasury and corporate bonds. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 220.
 MR. LACKER.  The intuition in habitat theory is the costliness or riskiness of arbitrage.  A corporation can scoop up its own debt pretty easily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is providing information and not presenting any conflicting or opposing views. It discusses the concept of "habitat theory" and how a corporation can easily buy back its own debt. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 221.
 MR. SACK.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage, as the speaker simply states "right" in response to something that was previously said or discussed.


Passage number 222.
  Maybe I’m missing the connection there, but— MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Another way of saying it is in the Treasury market we expected there to be a twisting of the yield curve; we weren’t particularly surprised that the two-year yields went up a little bit and then the longer-term yields came down.  Ceteris paribus, we would have expected to see a similar effect in the corporate bond market for the same reasons.  I don’t know if they did, but if two-year corporates did go up, that wouldn’t be at odds with what we expected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their expectations and acknowledging that they are unsure if those expectations were met.


Passage number 223.
  Whereas, we would have expected 10-year corporates that have— MR. SACK.  I’m not sure what the corporate arbitrage is here.  I don’t think there is an incentive for them to equalize their corporate yields across the yield curve or something, if that’s what you mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty and seeking clarification about the topic being discussed.


Passage number 224.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I wonder if there is a constituency for taking a vote on domestic open market operations.  [Laughter]  Without objection.  It is 3:15.  Let’s take 20 minutes for coffee.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a brief exchange where someone wonders about the possibility of having a constituency for taking a vote on domestic open market operations, followed by laughter. Then, without any objection, it is suggested to take a 20-minute break for coffee. Finally, a simple "thank you" is mentioned. The passage is straightforward and cordial.


Passage number 225.
   [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Why don’t we recommence.  The next item on the agenda is the economic situation, and I will call on David Wilcox.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the agenda will move forward to discuss the economic situation and the speaker will call on David Wilcox.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 226.
 MS. MESTER.5  I will be referring to the exhibits in “Material for Briefing on Trial-Run Policy Projections.”  As part of its exploration into various approaches for enhancing the Committee’s communications, the subcommittee on communications asked FOMC participants to provide information on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.  More specifically, participants were asked to provide projections for the average level of the federal funds rate target in the fourth quarter of each calendar year through the forecast horizon of 2014 and over the longer run.  These projections correspond to the appropriate policy that participants incorporated into their November SEP submissions.  Participants who see the first policy firming occurring after 2014 were asked to provide their assessments of the likely year of liftoff, as well as their economic projections for that year. I have divided the handout’s exhibits into those similar to the ones seen in the standard SEP release (these are exhibits 1 and 2) and those that might be useful for internal discussions (these are exhibits 3 and 4). As shown in exhibit 1, participants’ funds rate projections have a central tendency of 13 to 67 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Beyond 2012, differences in views about the timing and pace of tightening can be seen in the widening of both the central tendency and the range of projections.  By the end of 2014, the central tendency for the funds rate is 13 to 250 basis points.  Thus, participants agree that by the end of the forecast period, the policy rate will remain considerably below its projected longer-run value, whose central tendency is 400 to 450 basis points. The longer-run projections represent the value of the funds rate to which the economy will converge over time in the absence of further shocks.  This longer-run value depends on both the longer-run inflation rate, which the central bank can determine, and the equilibrium real interest rate, which it cannot.  5 The materials used by Ms. Mester are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). Exhibit 2 provides histograms of the trial-run responses.  As shown, there is somewhat less disagreement about the appropriate path of policy—at least over the next couple of years—than the central tendencies and ranges might suggest.  A large majority of participants—11 of 17—see the funds rate remaining at current levels through 2013, consistent with the Committee’s current forward guidance that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.  In contrast, by 2014, only 5 participants see the funds rate still at current levels, and the range of projected values is quite wide.  This result suggests that, while participants are in fairly close agreement about their long-run objectives, they differ more significantly in their assessments of the economy and about how monetary policy can influence economic outcomes. As shown in exhibit 3, there is considerable disparity in views about when appropriate policy would require the funds rate to move off the zero bound.  The modal year is 2014, but three participants project no change until 2015 and one projects no change until 2016.  In contrast, one participant judges that the appropriate year of policy liftoff is this year, and three others, in 2012. Participants cited several factors that informed their policy judgments.  Those favoring liftoff in 2014 or later cited slow growth and high unemployment coupled with moderate inflation, high and persistent resource slack, and the effects of the zero lower bound in limiting monetary policy accommodation.  Those favoring an earlier liftoff cited the need to forestall inflation pressures and financial and structural imbalances, and the need to keep inflation expectations anchored.  More generally, some participants indicated that their views of appropriate policy included further clarification of the Committee’s forward guidance, and some noted a relationship between the Fed’s balance sheet and their funds rate paths. The trial run provided information on economic projections beyond the standard forecast horizon for those participants anticipating that the first funds rate increase would occur after 2014.  This allows us to look at participants’ projections of economic activity aligned on the year of the first increase rather than on a calendar year.  This is a step toward gaining a better understanding of participants’ views of the economic conditions that underlie their assumed policy paths.  Participants could find such information useful in their internal discussions of policymaking and communications issues, such as clarifying the conditionality of the Committee’s forward guidance. It is important to remember that we do not know the exact timing of a participant’s first rate increase—the collected information reveals only the level of the funds rate in the fourth quarter of each year, and a participant could be anticipating the first change in the funds rate early in that year or late in the year.  So, to get a sense of expected economic conditions and the expected change in economic conditions at the time of the first projected rate increase, the top panel of exhibit 4 shows the central tendency and range of projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and PCE inflation for the current year (2011), for the year prior to liftoff, and for the year of liftoff. As indicated, in the year prior to their first rate increase (the middle bar in each forecast panel), the central tendency of participants’ projections is for economic growth to pick up from the current level of around 1¾ percent to between 2½ and 3¾ percent; for the unemployment rate to decline from around 9 percent this year to between 7¾ and 9 percent; and for total PCE inflation to decline from around 2¾ percent this year to a range of 1½ to 2¾ percent. Then in the year of liftoff (the third bar in each forecast panel), participants generally anticipate a slight acceleration in GDP and that the unemployment rate will continue to move down—but the central tendency is fairly wide at 6½ to 8 percent.  The central tendency of the inflation projection in the year of liftoff is about 1½ to 2¼ percent. Of course, while the central tendencies and ranges give summary information, they don’t reveal the connections between an individual participant’s policy assessment and his or her economic projections.  The bottom panel of exhibit 4 displays some of that information in a set of scatter plots of pairs of variables from each individual forecaster in his or her year of liftoff.  It is important to note that forecasters can have similar views of the economic conditions needed to spur liftoff, but their views on the timing of when those conditions will be reached can differ substantially.  I’ve highlighted two points in the first scatter plot as an example.  Each of these two forecasters sees growth around 3 percent and the unemployment rate around 8 percent when the fed funds rate moves away from the zero bound, but one thinks this will happen in 2012 and the other thinks it won’t occur until 2014.   As seen in the first plot, several participants are projecting that the first rise in the funds rate will need to occur before the unemployment rate falls to 7½ percent and with growth at 3½ percent or less.  As shown in the bottom-right plot, all participants anticipate that liftoff will need to occur even though inflation is under 3 percent and the unemployment rate is at or above 6½ percent. These exhibits and those distributed on Monday are meant to illustrate how information about participants’ policy expectations might facilitate the Committee’s internal deliberations.  If it would be helpful, the staff could collect and present this information on an ongoing basis and assist in exploring approaches for disseminating such information to the public through the SEP.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions differences in views and disagreements among FOMC participants regarding projections of the federal funds rate and appropriate monetary policy. It states that there is somewhat less disagreement about the path of policy in the next couple of years, but differences emerge by 2014. Participants have different views on when the appropriate policy would require the funds rate to move off the zero bound and have cited various factors to support their judgments. This indicates contention and disagreement among the participants.


Passage number 227.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  These are some interesting ideas on how to present the information on projections. It’s been our practice four times a year to have a briefing on financial stability.  Given that we had a videoconference a couple of weeks ago and given how full the agenda is, we’ve decided not to have that briefing.  But Nellie Liang is here and Pat Parkinson is here, and if anyone has any further questions relating to financial stability or wants to make any comments or raise any issues, I hope you will feel free to do that.  We’re ready for questions for the staff.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and providing information about a decision made regarding a briefing. They also encourage the audience to ask questions or make comments.


Passage number 228.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a brief question related to our discussion of nominal income targeting.  Looking not just at the change in real GDP in the year of liftoff—it might be interesting to look at the cumulative output gap of real GDP or nominal GDP at the time of liftoff.  So maybe we’re at minus 7 percent now—just thinking about putting in the Tealbook estimates of potential GDP and then thinking about how the forecasts of real GDP have evolved relative to that.  I don’t know if I’m making sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is simply asking a question and seeking clarification on a topic related to nominal income targeting.


Passage number 229.
 MS. MESTER.  Yes, you are.  One thing is in the handout that we distributed on Monday—we did deviations from the long run—an individual’s forecast of long run.  You can at least see how far away they are from where they think the long-run gap is.  But I would direct you to look at those, and maybe that’ll give you some insight. The other thing we thought about doing is amending the one chart that is basically “Year of Liftoff” in levels.  You could imagine doing changes and then doing a central tendency and the range of that.  But derivatives of derivatives of derivatives get to me, although I read your memo, and you have a third derivative in your loss function.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 230.
  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  A lot of functions have a third derivative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that many functions have a third derivative.


Passage number 231.
  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage. The presence of laughter indicates a light and positive atmosphere, suggesting agreement or enjoyment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 232.
 MR. FISHER.  Just a point for David and the international side—to tie them together.  In talking to the oil companies—which include Exxon; it has pretty good information—what they note is that gasoline–diesel demand is off 2 percent year to date.  But what has occurred is that with the slowdown in European growth, there is less refinery output, meaning less exports to the East Coast of the United States.  As a result, they haven’t seen the decrease in motor gas prices that they had expected.  So there is this odd phenomenon.  It is an international market.  It’s marked off of Brent, by the way, not off of WTI.  But it’s a refinery concept.  The slowdown in Europe is actually affecting supply in the United States, even though demand has come up somewhat.  The same is true for av gas—that, in the parlance of business, the crack spread has just not narrowed.  The question is, when will it happen.  But the pressures are moving in that direction from a demand standpoint.  I wanted to make that point. On food prices, the entire structure seems to be supported by Chinese demand.  Soybean oil, for example, which is the most important—10 years ago, they imported 5 million tons; this year, they’ll import 60 million tons.  I mention that because, if you look at the headline PCE number, Mr. Chairman, of that 2 percent, 1.7 percent was either gasoline or food—1.4 was gas and 0.3 was food—and the rest, the core, of course, was flat, in keeping with what the trimmed mean was forecasting, as I’ve said, at a six-month run rate. For what it’s worth, I think you need to take note of that phenomenon.  The international side is definitely impacting, in both gas and food, what is happening here in the United States.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a contention or disagreement between the expected decrease in motor gas prices due to decreased refinery output and the actual unchanged gas prices due to the impact of European growth on supply in the United States.


Passage number 233.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 234.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a question for Steve.  I want to clarify something you said.  When you were talking about the bank capital issue in Europe, you said “asked to raise.”  I’m not sure I would characterize it quite that way—in the sense that it’s a shortfall based on a 9 percent capital ratio, but they’re not really forced to raise it; they’re just supposed to get to a 9 percent capital ratio.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply a request for clarification and a statement of a different perspective.


Passage number 235.
 MR. KAMIN.  Oh, right.  What I thought I said—but I might have erred in my reading—was that they are required to raise it one way or another.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Kamin is simply acknowledging that he might have made a mistake in his previous statement.


Passage number 236.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 237.
 MR. KAMIN.  Their first option will be to go to the private markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the first option that "they" have, without any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 238.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  They’re not really raising.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact.


Passage number 239.
 MR. TARULLO.They can cut assets, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting statements.


Passage number 240.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  All they have to do is get to the right ratio at the end of the day.  They could shrink to get to that ratio; they can change the risk-weighted assets.  I just wanted to clarify that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining different options or strategies to achieve a certain ratio. There is no disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 241.
 MR. KAMIN.  Thank you—that’s correct.  In their statements and in their discussion, they are very eager that that target not be achieved through deleveraging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not express any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that the individuals mentioned are eager for a target to not be achieved through deleveraging.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 242.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But that’s a loose EBA instruction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

The passage is discussing a loose EBA instruction, which suggests that there might be some disagreement or contention about the specific wording or interpretation of the instruction.


Passage number 243.
 MR. KAMIN.  Exactly.  That is, indeed, a loose instruction.  And so they’re trying not to have that be the case.  They have talked about restricting dividends and things like that in order to achieve that, but thank you for that clarification.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the previous statement and thanking the other person for providing clarification.


Passage number 244.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any mention of disagreement or contention. It only mentions President Rosengren without any additional information.


Passage number 245.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  My question is for Steve, but it’s a financial stability question, which is: You highlighted the 50 percent voluntary write-down, and the CDSs presumably are not going to be triggered; I wonder if you have any views on what that means for the CDS market going forward.  If you thought you were being hedged against sovereign debt default, then not only for Greece but also for all your sovereign debt, all of a sudden it looks as though that hedge isn’t a very good hedge.  And if you think that sovereigns could play that game not only for sovereigns but also possibly for bank debt if the bank was large relative to the size of the country, you start wondering whether that contract any longer has viability.  But all of a sudden then, do you want to hold sovereign debt if you can’t hedge it.  So it starts having implications for the yields going forward.  So I was wondering if you have views on that.  Then I think this is really a question for another time, maybe, that the financial stability people could pick up on.  But given how often the CDSs are cited, I wonder if you have any views on that—or Nellie or anybody else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is asking for the speaker's views on the implications of a 50 percent voluntary write-down on the CDS market. There is no disagreement or contention presented in the passage.


Passage number 246.
 MR. KAMIN.  I’ll just start by saying that’s an excellent point, and it’s something that people have raised as an issue.  It is interesting that those same concerns came up after the July agreement by Europeans to impose a haircut of only 20 percent on private creditors.  And in the event, that concern seems to have been shrugged off, but it’s come up again with this much larger haircut.  One could imagine a situation after this, especially if it goes through, where indeed the role of CDSs could diminish.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It is simply acknowledging that concerns have been raised in the past, but their impact has been shrugged off.


Passage number 247.
 MR. SACK.  My sense is that it’s not being shrugged off as easily this time.  There is a lot of discussion about this, and it’s a serious potential problem.  You see it in the prices.  The CDS spreads have come in much more or have come in even in cases where the cash spreads have not, so I think you’re already starting to see some slippage in the prices.  And if they are no longer effective as a hedging instrument, it would have the implications that you raised.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their perspective on a potential problem and discussing the implications of it.


Passage number 248.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Are there any other staff who want to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply asks if there are any other staff members who would like to comment. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 249.
 MS. LIANG.  I don’t think I’m going to add too much to that.  That is an issue that was raised very quickly, and so that is something we’re reviewing to see if there’s any measurable effect on the cash spreads and the CDS.  But as Steve pointed out, in July and last year, when they talked about extending maturities, it appeared to get shrugged off, though the effects on CDS values were a big concern at the time.  This time we’re starting to see a little bit of an effect, but it’s a hard question to answer.  We’ll try to come back with something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing a topic and reviewing the effects of certain actions, but there is no expressed contention or disagreement.


Passage number 250.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without additional context. The provided passage contains incomplete information with only a mention of "Other questions" and "President Plosser." Without further details, it is not possible to ascertain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 251.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I want to turn to the trial run.  I want to make a comment and maybe even ask a question here.  One of the things I find interesting about this is the difference in part between exhibit 1 and exhibit 2.  As Loretta pointed out, if you look at exhibit 1, it looks as though there are huge spreads about what people expect. I think it’s important we remember two things about that.  One is that this is appropriate policy and not a forecast.  I think that’s important to understand what we’re doing.  But also, as she pointed out in exhibit 2, the modal forecasts here reveal a somewhat different story than you’d get by just looking at the first chart.  And the modal forecasts are much closer to what the Committee has been signaling through its forms of forward guidance. I think the other thing that’s important to remember about this is that the value of this, as I see it, is not just as a snapshot in time, but it’s also to watch how this exercise would evolve every quarter as the economy evolved, and therefore how this shape would evolve.  And that’s part of the information, rather than a point in time.  It’s the evolution of that that would be very revealing, I think, over time.  So from my perspective, this could be a very valuable exercise for the Committee to undertake.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is offering his perspective on the importance and value of the trial run and how it can provide valuable information for the Committee over time.


Passage number 252.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  First time anybody ever estimated a Taylor rule on panel data.  [Laughter]  Any other questions.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward statement followed by laughter and a request for other questions.


Passage number 253.
 MR. TARULLO.  I think I drew a somewhat different inference than Charlie did, because I found myself focused on panel B in exhibit 4, which had quite a bit of variance.  If at some level the most relevant piece of information for markets is when the Fed will begin to exit—if I looked at that, I’m not sure I would be too confident in drawing any conclusions.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they drew a different inference than Charlie and explaining their reasoning by referring to exhibit 4.


Passage number 254.
 MR. PLOSSER.  I think the question might then be to look at that in the same sort of bar chart—in other words, looking at the modal numbers on that chart rather than just the spread and central tendency.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage mentions a possible alternative way of analyzing data, but there is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 255.
 MR. LACKER.  Which chart are you talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions the speaker asking about a specific chart, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 256.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’m talking about the lower right-hand column of panel B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply referring to a specific section, the lower right-hand column of panel B.


Passage number 257.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Oh, I’m sorry.  I misunderstood.  I thought you were looking at panel A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 258.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Exhibit 4.B—PCE inflation versus unemployment rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 259.
 MR. TARULLO.  Very last page, very last panel, very last graph.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple statement of position.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 260.
 MR. LACKER.  It would be hard to pick a consensus trigger out of that or a threshold.  Is that what you take from this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker states that it would be difficult to identify a consensus trigger or threshold, suggesting a lack of agreement or consensus on the topic being discussed.


Passage number 261.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  That returns me to the question I had earlier, which was whether, if there were three kinds of scenarios, there would be more convergence.  And this graph at least suggests that there might not be a whole lot more convergence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing a question and suggesting that there might not be much convergence based on the information provided by a graph.


Passage number 262.
 MR. LACKER.  You can make them into three clumps.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Mr. Lacker is a simple suggestion or instruction.


Passage number 263.
 MR. TARULLO.  Maybe that’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. Mr. Tarullo's statement appears to be open-ended and does not indicate any disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 264.
 MR. LACKER.  Maybe not.  I don’t know.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 265.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply mentions the title and name of President Kocherlakota without providing any evidence of conflict or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 266.
   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yes, I wanted to build on something I had said earlier after Governor Tarullo’s earlier remarks.  Frankly, when I speak about the economy, I’m not sure people are all that interested in what I would do with the fed funds rate if I were in charge—they want to know what I expect this Committee to do.  And when we use the SEP, I’m not sure we want to be thinking about it as conveying the full richness of all of our views about the economy, as opposed to trying to use it to convey what we think is going to be happening to policy tools. I think it’s right to condition our long-run forecasts on optimal monetary policy.  That gives the people the right idea of what the long-run target is.  Conditioning our forecast for the fed funds rate and for inflation and unemployment on that—I don’t think that’s going to convey the right kind of information to markets.  Markets want to know where we think those variables are going to go and how we think policy is going to respond to that and what we think policy will be, as opposed to under what we think optimal policy should be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, expresses disagreement with the use of the SEP (Summary of Economic Projections) as a way to convey the full range of views about the economy. He argues that it should be used to convey policy tools and the Committee's expectations for policy. He also disagrees with conditioning forecasts for the fed funds rate and inflation/unemployment on optimal monetary policy, suggesting that it may not convey the right information to markets.


Passage number 267.
 MR. TARULLO.  Narayana, there’s insight in that observation.  How, in practical terms, then, do you think one gets from the manifestation of everybody’s individual inclinations, which this graph shows, on the one hand, to something resembling more of a consensus, which, I read into your remarks, you would expect to actually be way less divergent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with Narayana's observation and seeking further understanding or clarification on how to move from individual inclinations to a consensus.


Passage number 268.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I would be interested to see a different trial run where we make a forecast predicated on what we think the Committee will do, what the evolution of inflation, unemployment, and real GDP will be, on the one hand, and what the evolution of the fed funds rate will be, on the other hand.  And we’ll see—maybe I’m wrong.  Maybe there won’t be more convergence on that, but my suspicion is that there would be a lot more convergence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing curiosity and stating their suspicion that there would be more convergence in a different trial run.


Passage number 269.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This is important information, though—what people’s preferences are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 


Passage number 270.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes, I was going to ask you about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker initiates a question to inquire about a certain topic.


Passage number 271.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It’s very reasonable for us internally to have that information.  I will say for myself, I don’t think it’s as important for the public.  I’m all in favor of transparency, but I have many vehicles to inform the public of my personal preferences over these variables.  I’m not sure that seeing them in this bar chart form is all that valuable.  It’s valuable for us to know—panel 4.B is really useful for us to know in our own internal dialogue.  But it doesn’t necessarily mean that’s going to be what we should share with the public.

Passage number 278.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to follow up on that.  There is literature that looks at the forecasts by the group here.  They treat them as unconditional forecasts, and they look at whether it’s accurate or not.  They forget all about the “appropriate policy” assumption, and so I think there are a lot of subtle issues here.  If you think the Committee is off on the wrong path, you might forecast that inflation is going to go way down or way up—way far away from target, for instance.  And do you want that.   Other central banks have wrestled with this.  They’ve done the projection based on the market expectation, which is a reasonable compromise.  Or they’ve allowed the staff forecast to go out and have let the principals just comment on the staff forecast.  So I’m not sure—this is a difficult issue, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily discussing the different approaches that central banks take in regards to forecasting and policy assumptions.


Passage number 279.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Anyone else.  [No response]  Okay.  We’re ready for our go-round, and let’s start with President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement indicating that there is no response and then transitioning to the next topic.


Passage number 280.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll do my best to ensure that we complete this meeting by nine o’clock tonight.  [Laughter] In our recent round of board meetings and contacts, the majority of directors and business contacts in the Sixth District described activity as expanding at a slow pace.  While most reports were a bit more upbeat than before the last FOMC, a plurality of directors and their contacts stated that they had revised down expectations for their firms’ performance.  Two directors representing the country’s second-largest retailer and largest airline expressed pessimism about the business outlook, citing continuing uncertainty and weak confidence emanating particularly from the political process.  Overall, I would characterize what we heard over the past two weeks as falling in a range from “still somewhat pessimistic” to “very cautiously optimistic.”  In our questioning of directors and other contacts, we asked about intentions to hire or reduce staffing in the coming months.  Although we heard some rumblings about reducing employment, the modal response was no near-term intention either to hire beyond replacement requirements or seasonal needs or to downsize staffing.  Most firms seem to be holding steady as regards staffing. In our formal survey of business inflation sentiment—this time, it involved 164 respondents—we detected less pressure on input costs than earlier in the year.  Also, no significant wage pressures were noted.  However, the vast majority of respondents noted that they intended to pass on at least some of any cost increase to their customers.  Businesses in the transportation sector noted that they have faced little resistance to surcharges to cover fuel cost increases. Turning to my sense of the outlook, Atlanta’s forecast is very similar to the Tealbook’s through 2013.  In the last year of the forecast horizon—2014—we depart from the Tealbook’s trajectory and project flatter growth, reflecting the weight of fiscal drag, continued deleveraging, and restrained consumer confidence.  Our forecast has unemployment above the Tealbook’s 2014 projection and above the 6½ to 7 percent projections suggested in version A1 of the Tealbook draft statements.  At the same time, our inflation forecast stays in the neighborhood of 2 percent over the forecast horizon, while the Tealbook numbers stay south of 2 percent.  Therefore, we have assumed less slack in the economy than the Board staff. To be more specific, I have a strong sense that the labor market involves much more in the way of inchoate rigidities, inefficiencies, and behavioral impediments than fully appreciated.  Now, admittedly, I am basing this sense on a lot of anecdotal input, but here is some of what we’re picking up.  With respect to the relatively slow pace at which reported job openings are being filled, we are in fact told that some vacancies are so-called purple squirrel openings:  If a purple squirrel shows up, the company will hire; otherwise, the company waits.  [Laughter]  My sense is that this employer attitude will change if confidence increases and demand picks up.  But we are also consistently told of many skills mismatches.  These mismatches are related to hard skills in specific industries and job types, but we hear much more broadly of issues related to soft skills, such as basic work habits, attitudes, and expectations.  I frequently hear of jobs going unfilled because a large number of applicants have difficulty passing basic requirements like drug tests or simply demonstrating the requisite work ethic.  As an example, one contact in the staffing industry told us that during their pretesting process, a majority—actually, 60 percent of applicants—failed to answer “0” to the question of how many days a week it’s acceptable to miss work.  [Laughter]  Now, I am not suggesting that these are necessarily new phenomena.  But for a variety of reasons, employers seem to be paying much more attention to the quality of prospective hires than pre-recession.  We also hear that job requirements have been updated to combine a wider spectrum of performance competencies, such as those that are required for receipt of the ACT’s National Career Readiness Certificate. There is anecdotal evidence of structural shifts.  Companies of various sizes in various industries report moving to increase their permanent part-time workforce, typically as a way to manage uncertainties about health-care expenses and requirements.  Now, I stress that these are anecdotal accounts, and the effects are difficult to quantify.  But combining these and other inputs with the somewhat confusing participation data suggests to me that a great deal is going on in labor markets that we don’t fully grasp.  And I am not quite ready to argue that all this means the structural rate of unemployment is permanently higher, but I am inclined to think that clear progress in the labor market will lag economic growth more than usual.  Further, I am somewhat skeptical of the capacity of monetary policy measures to speed up the process. Let me conclude with comments on the balance of risks.  I see risks to growth to the downside.  Financial market volatility, slow jobs growth, and weak confidence make the economy vulnerable to any number of adverse shocks.  Regarding inflation, I judge the risks to be broadly balanced, reflecting some ambivalence on the question of the amount of slack in the economy.  It is possible that the high unemployment rate reflects more slack than I have assumed in my inflation outlook.  But as my earlier recitation of anecdotal input suggests, the labor market could be struggling under the weight of forces that have raised the natural rate of unemployment for at least some time.  I also think there is a chance that the influence of commodity prices and other pressures on core inflation numbers could play out over a longer period than I have assumed, and inflationary sentiment could be adversely affected as a result.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and analysis based on their observations and anecdotes.


Passage number 281.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a simple expression of gratitude from President Rosengren. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 282.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The markets seem to have initially taken some solace in the Europeans having an outline of actions with no details and in U.S. economic data consistent with growth that does not improve the employment situation.  That such diminished expectations can generate a market rally is hardly encouraging.  As Brian highlighted, it is even less encouraging that a referendum in a small country can offset much of those gains.  This highlights the fragile financial condition as we try to make our own forecast. My forecast, like that in the Tealbook, provides little to celebrate—positive but weak growth given the sizable output gap, positive but weak employment growth that leaves us far from full employment, and inflation that remains below 2 percent.  By mid-2013, I expect we will still have an unemployment rate above 8 percent and an inflation rate well below 2 percent.  The Tealbook has a similar forecast.  If these forecasts are right, we will be missing on both elements of the mandate two years from now. Financial market participants remain concerned.  Liquidity in many markets is sporadic at best.  Financial institutions, worried about their own liquidity risk, are not supporting markets to the same degree, making financial market participants less willing to take positions that may be difficult to exit.  My own interpretation is that in many markets, European and American institutions that have been dependent on wholesale financing are pulling back from activities, resulting in marketmakers less willing to make markets.  While there has been some increased refinancing activity, and the newly announced HARP changes are positive, both the movement in mortgage rates and the fiscal willingness to encourage refinancing remain too timid to have much macroeconomic effect.  Our econometric equations imply that we are well below the level of construction implied by fundamentals at this time.  And buyer concern about future prices and the tightness of credit conditions make a very gradual return to normal in housing the most likely outcome. My business contacts indicate widespread caution.  Given the possibility that deficit discussions remain dysfunctional and European brinkmanship remains the negotiating tool of choice, businesses would prefer to defer hiring and investment decisions until there is more clarity in the outlook. Given the weak performance we have experienced and the weakness in our forecast, our incremental policy is not the best approach.  Critics of Japanese policymakers focus on a slow, deliberate approach that led to very suboptimal outcomes, with 20 years of slow growth and inflation below targets.  If we do not start seeing more-robust improvement, then the likely fiscal austerity and continued downside risk from Europe put such improvement at significant risk.  We will need to decide whether incremental policies are likely to return us to either element of our mandate in the medium term.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Rosengren, is critical of the market rally and the impact of a small country's referendum on it. He also highlights the fragile financial condition and expresses concern about unemployment, inflation, liquidity in markets, and the slow return to normal in the housing market. He suggests that the current incremental policy approach may not be effective and references the suboptimal outcomes in Japan as a cautionary example. This indicates a disagreement with the current policies and their potential to achieve the desired outcomes.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 287.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My assessment of the economic outlook has not changed meaningfully over the past few meetings.  I do not see any evidence that the U.S. economy is poised to achieve escape velocity anytime soon.  We’ve experienced periods when the balance of the incoming data had been negative.  More recently, the news has been somewhat better.  I made it a point not to overreact to the weaker monthly data we saw this summer, and so I’m not overreacting to the more positive numbers we’ve seen of late.  The best-case outlook seems to be simply muddling along.  The recent, more positive data are still only indicative of an economy that’s just treading water.  The 2½ percent growth rates we’re looking at over the near term are just not enough to make meaningful headway into the substantial resource gaps we see in the economy today. Commentary from my business contacts continues to support this assessment.  Indeed, there really wasn’t that much new in their reports this round.  Overall, most say things are moving sideways at this time.  They just don’t see the demand in place to justify expanding workforces or capacity.  Many of my contacts said they were demanding contingency plans from their staffs to slash expenditures 5 to 30 percent if needed, and I continue to hear many say they are making plans to promptly cut spending at the first sign of a downturn in demand.  These are hardly the plans of business leaders who are contemplating an acceleration in their activities.  I expect more of the same.  The ups and downs in the national data did show through in our contacts’ commentaries about the automotive industry.  The OEMs and their suppliers are expecting continuing modest improvement in auto sales and production, but they don’t see things taking off, either. Everyone continues to be concerned about Europe.  This report seems stale.  The reports from my staff, who talk to people in the Chicago markets—the report seemed stale on Friday, but it seems a little fresh today.  Prior to last week’s announcement, the financial-sector contacts said that uncertainty and caution were freezing up some markets.  That said, there was little evidence of panic.  Our contacts also said that they would view any European debt package with some skepticism.  They seem to be on target with that one.  They question the Europeans’ ability to execute whatever immediate plans they come up with, as well as the prospects for a longer-term resolution given the impediments to growth in the region. Turning to the macro outlook for the U.S., our growth forecast is similar to the Tealbook’s.  We also think that the reductions the Board staff has made to potential output are plausible, and these reductions are not small.  They cut nearly 3 percent from the level you would get by simply extrapolating forward a modest 2½ percent growth trend from the beginning of the recession—not as much as the 5½ percent growth that President Williams was talking about.  But even with this substantial reduction in potential, we’re still looking at large output gaps and growth forecasts that leave resource utilization at very low levels throughout the projection period.  To sum up, all of the incoming data and anecdotal reports point to an economy that’s just sputtering along.  We’re generating growth, but it falls far short of the pace we need given the size of the resource gaps that must be closed.  With regard to the two scenarios I discussed this morning, in my opinion, the U.S. economy is entangled in a liquidity trap with amplification from a large Reinhart–Rogoff financial crisis.  We could be staring at a lost decade, the way President Williams was suggesting from his comments on Japan.  Even if this is only an exaggerated risk—I don’t think it is—if we fail to take further actions, owing to credibility risks, we end up with about as much credibility as the Bank of Japan has, I worry.  Like President Rosengren, I worry about too slow, incremental policies.  I think we need to continue to add more accommodation.  There are alternatives in the Tealbook, A1 and A2, and I’m uncomfortable with stasis.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Evans, disagrees with the idea that the U.S. economy is poised to achieve "escape velocity" and believes that the best-case outlook is for the economy to "muddle along." He also argues that further actions need to be taken to add more accommodation to the economy, while expressing concern about "too slow, incremental policies."


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 288.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me ask you, President Evans and President Williams—I’m a little confused:  If potential output is 5 percent lower, how can the output gap still be comparably large.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests confusion and a potential disagreement regarding the concept of the output gap and its relation to potential output.


Passage number 289.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. Without any additional context, it is not possible to determine if there is any contention or disagreement between the parties involved.


Passage number 290.
 WILLIAMS.  This was a comparison—I should have spelled this out a little more carefully—of what our forecast or view of potential output was in 2007, before the recession.  Basically, it was that trend line and seeing how much the decline in the level of potential output in the end of 2004 is relative to that in 2007.  It’s not just in the past six weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining a comparison and discussing potential output before and after the recession.


Passage number 291.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So what is your potential output relative to the Tealbook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is asking for information or an opinion, it does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 292.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 293.
 WILLIAMS.  It’s 1 percent because our output gap is 5 percent.  The Tealbook, I think, is 6 percent in Q3.  So it’s just a 1 percentage point difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a difference in numbers or percentages without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 294.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply showing gratitude to President Fisher.


Passage number 295.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a simple exchange where the speaker expresses gratitude to President Pianalto. There is no indication of any disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 296.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  For the first time since last March, I’ve been encouraged by some of the economic news that we got during the intermeeting period.  That news has lessened the odds of another recession, but with so many indicators still weak, the bit of good news we received hasn’t been sufficient to change my baseline outlook beyond this year, and I’ll explain the basis of this assessment. Like the Tealbook, since our last meeting I have edged up my forecast for GDP growth in 2011 but otherwise left my growth forecast essentially unchanged.  From the fourth quarter of this year onward, I expect GDP to grow at a moderate rate of about 2½ percent through the end of next year and about 2¾ percent in 2013 and 2014.  With this growth profile, unemployment will decline slowly by roughly ½ percentage point per year, leaving it at 7½ percent at the end of 2014. In my judgment, there was enough strength in the third-quarter figures to make the risk of recession lower than I feared at the time of our last meeting.  I have also been somewhat encouraged by reports from my business contacts that bankers have become more optimistic and are a little more willing to lend.  As one example, a builder of commercial properties reported that he is now starting to see a renewed willingness on the part of bankers to extend loans for the value of a project rather than the cost, allowing the borrower to take away cash, which then can be invested in other projects. Despite this good news, a range of concerns lead me to believe that the pace of recovery is likely to remain slow over the next few years, with risks to my outlook that are still higher than historical norms.  Some of those concerns include, first, that the economy continues to see considerable headwinds, including the ongoing woes of the housing sector, consumer deleveraging, and cutbacks in state and local government spending.  A second concern is that, based on the most recent purchasing managers survey, Europe now seems likely to be headed for recession.  And third, the overall stress in financial markets seems likely to remain elevated until the European situation is fully resolved.  This stress is going to continue to impair credit market functioning and hold back growth.  I am also concerned that the continued high level of uncertainty, which others have mentioned, is holding back the pace of recovery by restraining business spending.  Virtually every CEO I talk with has said that uncertainty is preventing some projects from going forward.  Among the uncertainties they mention are weak sales outlooks, the direction of health-care requirements, the broader regulatory environment, and future tax rates.  That said, even though uncertainty is limiting the expansion of capacity, it doesn’t seem to be detracting from earnings and profits.  Many companies in my District are reporting record earnings and profits, apparently because they have figured out how to manage their business to stay profitable in this environment. Turning to the inflation outlook, I have made little change to my forecast of inflation.  I continue to expect core inflation of about 2 percent from 2011 through 2014.  As pressures from energy prices continue to dissipate, the rate of headline inflation should slow to the core rate by the end of next year.  As others have mentioned, I saw some good news in the September CPI and PCE releases.  The headline rate of inflation continued to drift downward.  Surprisingly, the core CPI inflation rate dipped below 1 percent on an annualized basis, but the decline in core CPI inflation is probably overstating the slowing of the underlying trend.  The core CPI was pulled down by significant reversals of apparel and auto prices, which finally dipped in September after rising unusually sharply for much of the year, and these were likely relative price movements that don’t tell us much about the underlying inflation rate.  Consistent with this reasoning, the Cleveland Fed’s median trimmed-mean and sticky price measures of underlying price trends didn’t slow nearly as sharply as the core CPI did. Still, I think the most likely outcome is for a gradual decline in inflation to about 2 percent, reflecting several forces.  Critically, inflation expectations remain low and stable.  The inflation expectations model that we maintain at the Cleveland Fed shows that inflation expectations over the next few years are still below 2 percent.  The other important forces giving me some confidence in my inflation forecast are for continued slow growth of labor costs and reduced pressures from commodity prices. Putting all of this together, while there was important good news in the economic information received since the last meeting, the news hasn’t been sufficient to materially change my outlook for the economy.  I continue to think that the most likely outcome is for slow growth and inflation stable at about 2 percent.  While the risks to the economy now seem somewhat lower than they did a meeting ago, they remain considerable, particularly with respect to the European crisis.  So I still see that the risks to growth are primarily to the downside, while the risks to unemployment are primarily to the upside, and the risks to inflation still seem balanced to me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their own assessment of the economic outlook based on their interpretation of the data and their own concerns. They mention some positive news but also express concerns about various factors that could impact the economy.


Passage number 297.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage "Thank you. President George." It is a simple expression of gratitude towards President George.


Passage number 298.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Economic activity in the Tenth District has continued to expand moderately, and contacts generally expect similar or perhaps slightly faster growth ahead.  Manufacturing activity picked up in September and October.  Inflationary pressures have eased a bit and are expected to be moderate in coming months as the effects of higher commodity prices recede. Recent job growth in the District as a whole has been similar to that in the nation, but the rate of growth continues to vary widely across District states.  Energy and agriculture states have expanded rapidly, while other District states have shown little growth, if any.  Many contacts express difficulties finding skilled workers, but wage pressures remain muted. Energy drilling continues to boost economic activity in many areas of the District.  Oil production remains highly profitable, and natural gas firms continue to have easy access to cheap capital.  Continued rapid expansion of oil production in the central United States has put more pressure on pipelines and maintained the sizable spread between U.S. and world oil prices.  This has caused some firms to ship oil by rail or even truck to coastal refineries rather than through pipelines to the hub in Cushing, Oklahoma. Land values in the District continue to grow rapidly, particularly in northern parts of the region.  Non-irrigated farmland values in the third quarter were up nearly 40 percent from a year ago in Nebraska, about 20 percent in Kansas, and over 10 percent in the rest of the District.  Over the past five years, land values have increased over 100 percent in Nebraska and almost 80 percent in the District as a whole.  Moreover, institutional investors are showing increasing interest in making these land purchases. With respect to the national economy, recent data suggest that the near-term outlook has improved and the risk of the U.S. economy tipping back into recession has receded.  Third-quarter real GDP growth came in stronger than I expected in September, as the temporary factors weighing on growth dissipated. Over the medium term, my views are largely unchanged from September.  I expect that the economy will maintain the momentum evident in the third quarter and will gradually move to a growth rate that will lead to modest reductions in the unemployment rate.  Factors supporting growth include pent-up consumer and business demand, exports, and monetary policy that is highly accommodative.  Nevertheless, several factors will weigh on growth over the next few years, including uncertainty, ongoing deleveraging, an anemic housing market, and an increasing drag from fiscal policy.  In addition, the extended period of highly accommodative monetary policy could lead to a buildup of financial imbalances that could threaten the longer-run stability of the economy. On a more positive note, the near-term outlook for inflation has improved.  Inflation is likely to recede over the next several quarters to 2 percent or less.  With a gradually rebounding economy, a depreciating dollar, and inflation expectations that appear to be well anchored, there is little risk that inflation will fall much below 2 percent over the medium term.  In fact, the extended period of highly accommodative monetary policy, combined with our long-term fiscal imbalance and the possibility of a rebound in commodity prices, poses significant upside risk to inflation.   In summary, I expect that the recovery will continue at a moderate pace, with inflation remaining near 2 percent.  While the risks to output growth have become somewhat more balanced, the risks to inflation remain to the upside.  Thank you.

Passage number 300.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Eighth District economy continues to expand at a modest pace.  The Eighth District unemployment rate based on 16 metropolitan statistical areas is somewhat lower than the national rate, at 8.7 percent.  Payroll employment in the District was approximately flat during the most recent reporting period. Large firms in the District remain optimistic and plan to expand in some cases.  Profitability remains strong.  Cash holdings are high.  Many large firms have a strong presence in Asia, and in almost every case, the growth strategy is based on Asian demand.  In this sense, the European sovereign debt crisis is not upsetting business planning or entering corporate thinking as anything more than a general risk factor, and Asian growth is still considered mostly unassailable at this juncture. District agriculture continues to do well.  Relatively high prices, even with higher input prices, mean farm income will likely remain strong this year.  As an indicator, some farm equipment dealers are reportedly sold out through the spring of 2012. Commercial real estate conditions are variable across the District.  Residential real estate continues to be lackluster in many areas.  Banks continue to report very weak loan demand. The national economy now appears to have avoided the recession scare that gripped financial markets during the August time frame, even though the level of global financial stress remains high.  If a recession was developing during the September–October time frame, the hard data would have been considerably worse than they were.  My sense is that market expectations outran actual economic developments.  As it stands, I expect moderate growth during the remainder of 2011, with reasonably good prospects for improved growth during 2012, provided that significant financial stress can be mitigated. The types of risk events that occurred during the past several months have apparently not been of a variety that might cause households and businesses to pull back spending sharply and set off a recessionary event.  For households, the European sovereign debt crisis is worrying but too distant to cause immediate changes in spending patterns.  For large businesses, the EU crisis is, again, very worrying, but much of their growth strategy is in Asia so that both growth and profitability remain on track for them.  For both businesses and households, the debt ceiling debate only confirmed the political realities in the U.S. concerning the difficulty of dealing with medium- and longer-term fiscal issues.  Despite the contentiousness of the debate, there was no real news about the U.S. fiscal situation. The July 29 revisions to GDP, as we have noted here on several occasions, were indeed significant and did lead to legitimate worry of a further slowdown or outright recession.  But the Q3 hard data did not confirm this view, so now I think we’re in a position to expect reasonable but not stellar growth going forward. In the meantime, headline and core inflation have not subsided to the extent that one might have predicted based on the estimated size of the output gap.  One reasonable interpretation is that the output gap is not nearly as large as suggested by conventional analysis.  Reverse engineering the output gap using the method of Laubach and Williams—our colleague just to my left here—for instance, suggests that movements in core inflation are indicating a gap of about 2 to 3 percent, much smaller than suggested by other metrics.  This makes a lot of sense if one is willing to attribute some of the growth in the past decade not to fundamental factors but to an unsustainable bubble in housing and real estate more generally.  Indeed, this fits with our rhetoric about the past decade very well.  I think this hypothesis bears careful watching during the coming quarters and years.  Thank you.

Passage number 308.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  The way I would characterize the outlook is, we got a little bounce that we were hoping for.  The positive of that is that the sharp drop we saw in household and business confidence does not seem to have led to a pullback in hiring or spending, but I think we shouldn’t get overimpressed by 2½ percent growth in the third quarter.  Some of the bounce was due to temporary factors such as autos, and the increase in consumption was accompanied by a pretty big drop in the household saving rate, which may indicate that there is actually some stress on household balance sheets.  And finally, some significant obstacles to growth remain.   In my mind, there are three key determinants of the outlook over the next few quarters.  The first one is Europe, and we saw earlier how powerful the contagion was back to the U.S., especially in terms of those financial intermediaries, like Morgan Stanley, that have very limited access to the Fed’s lender-of-last resort function.  If Europe goes badly, then there is a real risk to the U.S. financial system; and then, by extension, to financial conditions; and then to the real economy.  So although the bilateral exposures don’t look so great, the actual consequence would be quite severe.  On Europe, I agree with Steve’s characterization that there is lots of assembly required, probably a few missing parts, and no real assurance that it’s going to work in practice. A couple of things I would note.  The first thing about the Greek restructuring that’s really quite interesting is that even with a 50 percent haircut, full participation of all of the private-sector participants, optimistic assumptions on growth, and the fiscal austerity package being implemented, they still end up with a debt-to-GDP ratio of 120 percent in 2020.  Now, the reason why this is happening is that as more and more Greek debt gets socialized into official hands like the ECB and the IMF, the haircuts to the private sector have very diminished consequences to the total Greek debt burden.  So I think that really raises a question:  Is 50 percent restructuring enough, or is this the first in a series of Greek restructurings.  Or is Greece ultimately going to default. The second issue associated with the Greek restructuring that’s noteworthy is, it’s not clear that this is being done in a way that actually makes other sovereign debt look more attractive.  You could argue that it makes it look less attractive because, one, you now have the precedent of restructuring in place, and, two, as we discussed earlier, if the CDS are not triggered, then you no longer have a way of hedging your sovereign debt.  So I think in some ways, this actually makes the rest of the European debt look a little bit less attractive.  If you can subordinate the Greek debt holders, the more that the ECB buys of Irish, Portuguese, Spanish, and Italian debt, you’re essentially de facto subordinating those holders as well.  And I think at some point, they’re going to catch on to that. The second thing I would say about Greece—we talked about this before:  the bank recapitalization.  They have a €106 billion shortfall.  But press reports indicate that very little of this is expected to be met by new investor equity.  In fact, most of it’s going to be done by retained earnings, changing business model, and deleveraging.  I think one of the real key questions is, how does that deleveraging hurt economic growth—and then does that feedback make it more difficult to make progress in terms of fiscal consolidation. Lastly, there are two more issues with Europe—the next one is, does the EFSF actually have enough capacity to do all the things that they need to do.  The reason we have this 20 percent first-loss piece is that the EFSF has only €440 billion of capacity, and a lot of that capacity is already spoken for in terms of Greece, Ireland, and Portugal.  So you have a pretty Rube Goldberg type of machine, and nobody really knows if investors are actually going to have much appetite for this debt that has a 20 percent first-loss piece.  And then the final thing, the thing I think was probably the most disappointing regarding the European announcement—there’s really no vision yet at all about where Europe is headed over the medium to longer run.  What’s the exit strategy of all of these programs.  How are they going to enforce conditionality in terms of fiscal consolidation on an ongoing basis.  How do these countries reenter the market and actually issue debt to private investors two, three, four years down the road.  I’m pretty pessimistic about what’s actually going to transpire in Europe.  So that’s issue number one. Issue number two is housing, and I think there are a lot of problems there.  Obviously, the first problem is the high loan to value.  Mortgage holders are locked into high-coupon mortgages, and that’s basically impeding the power of monetary policy to actually support the housing sector and household consumer spending.  The second problem is the slow pace of foreclosures that you highlighted, which is bad in itself, but it also creates a greater incentive to default because if you already know it’s—what was it, 397 days until the foreclosure actually is ended.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 309.
  MR. PLOSSER.  In New Jersey, it was 900 days.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement expressed in this passage. It simply mentions a fact about the number of days in New Jersey.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 310.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Sorry—900 days.  You can live in the house for a long time rent free before they actually catch up with you.  Also, you have the problem of getting the Real Estate Owned once it’s foreclosed back into the market.  We have a very peculiar situation right now where rents are rising despite the fact that we have a glut of unsold homes.  And that’s a really peculiar situation.  Now, the good news, of course, is that the Administration is taking another stab at helping high-loan-to-value households refinance.  But as I read it, the program seems pretty limited in scope, and the terms are not as generous as they could be.  Also, the Administration program is focused just on that one aspect of housing. I view housing as really essential because if you stabilized housing and housing prices did stop falling, not only would that be good for the housing sector itself in terms of provoking more demand for housing, but I think it would also be very important for household wealth and household confidence.  So it could actually have pretty significant effects for consumer spending.  But I don’t think we’re there yet. The last issue is fiscal policy.  There are two real issues here.  First, fiscal policy, in the absence of policy action, is going to be turned sharply restrictive at the start of 2012.  I think we’re understating the potential significance of that.  Second, we have policy dysfunction in Washington, and that’s also important because it has an independent effect on household and business confidence.  In this respect, the outcome of the supercommittee deliberations is important, not just for what they do or don’t do in terms of long-term fiscal consolidation—but also, if they do something tangible, it will actually be good for household and business confidence, and if they don’t, it won’t, because then we’ll just be on hold through the next election. My view is that we’re going to see moderate growth over the near term.  But until these three issues—Europe, housing, and fiscal—are addressed in a way that takes them off the table, I view the risk as very much tilted to the downside.  Now, if all of them were addressed positively, I could actually see the economy surprising on the upside.  And the reason for that is, a lot of people are on the sidelines, holding back, because they’re uncertain about the outlook.  When I talk to businesses, especially small businesses, I actually hear a lot of people say, “I’m okay, but I’m not doing anything right now.”  So if we could just take care of these three problems, we could actually have a pretty good outlook.  But unfortunately, there’s not a lot of power in this room to do much about it.  My own view is, we should be highlighting these three issues, and, especially on housing and fiscal, we should be pressing the Washington policymakers, both publicly and privately, to do something about these things.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement and contention in this passage. The speaker expresses their own view that the Administration program for high-loan-to-value households is limited and not generous enough, while also stating that stabilizing housing prices would have positive effects on the housing sector and consumer spending. The speaker also expresses concern about fiscal policy and policy dysfunction in Washington, stating that without action, fiscal policy will become restrictive and that policy dysfunction has a negative effect on household and business confidence. The speaker concludes by stating that these issues need to be addressed and that policymakers should be pressed to take action.

Passage number 314.
 MR. TARULLO:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m going to jettison most of the notes that I had prepared because someone has said most of these things—though not with the literary allusions that were included in my notes—and I want to address instead labor market issues. I think it’s worthwhile looking at the data rather than just relying on anecdotes, and as we think about what’s happened in the labor market over the past few years, it’s important to draw a distinction between what has happened in the past few years, presumably as a result of the recession and its aftermath, on the one hand, and the very real long-term problems that we’ve got in the labor market in this country, on the other hand.  Basically, we’ve got to look at the delta, and I think once we try to look at the delta rather than to absolute numbers or anecdotes that can be drawn from one source or another, the picture becomes rather more clear. There are a variety of hypotheses about why structural problems may be greater and greater as the result of the recession.  One that has been alluded to today is, we had a bunch of bubble sectors where there was a lot of lost employment, and so one would expect that people in those sectors would have difficulty becoming reemployed.  In the mid-’70s, we had a very serious recession with a lot of lost employment in the Midwest in manufacturing.  There were concerns then about whether there was going to be increased structural unemployment, but a retrospective look suggests that that was not the case.  There are always some sectors in a serious recession that suffer significantly, and at least to date in the experience since World War II, we haven’t seen a particular impact on long-term structural unemployment increases.  Something may be different this time, but we’ve got to point to whatever it is that’s different this time than in the mid-’70s or early ’80s. Second, we have the concern that because there’s been long-term unemployment of an unusual and, indeed, unprecedented—since the data series was developed—nature, it seems logical to infer that there’s going to be more structural unemployment there, that people are going to have more trouble getting back to work.  I think at some point, that is going to become a phenomenon, but again, the data to date suggest or allow us to conclude, perhaps a tad counterintuitively, that the probability of reemployment declined in about the same amounts for the short-term unemployed and the long-term unemployed and has since risen in about the same amounts for the short-term unemployed and the long-term unemployed.  So, to date at least, this hasn’t happened. Third, we’ve got a Beveridge curve phenomenon, which I refer to as shorthand for a lot of the points about vacancies and mismatch and the like.  Economists at the Federal Reserve Banks of Cleveland and San Francisco have done a very nice job of going back pre–data series, pre–JOLTS series to try to construct from other data approximate Beveridge curves that, again, cover the two serious post–World War II recessions.  And just as we saw this time, the Beveridge curves get pushed out, and each time, the Beveridge curve comes back.  There’s still debate apparently among the labor economists, including the very good labor economists at the Cleveland and San Francisco Feds, as to exactly why that was, but it does seem as though, when you have an awful lot of unemployment growing pretty quickly, there’s a generalized disruption in labor markets, which makes employers more likely to wait longer to fill vacancies, in particular.  It may turn out, Dennis, that the purple squirrel phenomenon is more widespread than people think, because there does seem to be some sense that standards for hiring go up during periods of high unemployment since employers are saying, “Gee, there must be somebody good out there somewhere.” Finally, to the phenomena of a lack of literacy and of drug use, these are not new phenomena.  These are not deltas from the recession.  We had these problems 25 years ago when I was working on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.  I spent time in the city of Philadelphia with a school-to-work program, in which the greatest problem identified was the failure of individuals to understand they had to show up to work every day.  We had that problem 25 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago; we have it today; and we’re going to have it 5 years from now.  It is a real problem for the productive potential of the country.  It is not an argument for the proposition that structural unemployment has increased during and as a result of the recession.  I do believe that structural unemployment has increased some, and I was actually a bit surprised when we went through all the data, that the data don’t suggest it has increased even more so far. The last point I would make, which I think is very important and gets to what John was referring to earlier, is that at some point, all of this becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy.  If there is no aggregate demand, if there isn’t increased employment, if the productive facilities in both the manufacturing and service sectors that are lying fallow now do not get back into use, the productive capacity of the country and structural unemployment will go in the wrong direction.  We are fortunate in that it doesn’t seem as though we are there yet, but it also strikes me that the tipping point may not be that far away.  And I think we can’t continue to come here as we have for the past two years, straining to see green shoots coming out of the ground—saying, “Oh, the signs of spring are now here”—and therefore to say we need not take any more action, only to see another snowfall the next month.  I hope Betsy is right.  I hope that the underlying structural conditions are getting closer to the point where there’s more self-sustaining momentum in the economy, but even if there is some of that, it’s not going to move us very far or very fast in the face of an awful lot of cyclical unemployment. What we should do about it—I guess I’m supposed to save that for tomorrow, so I will.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply expresses thanks to Governor Raskin.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 316.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy remains mired in the worst slump since that of the 1930s.  While recent readings on retail sales, capital goods orders and shipments, and nonresidential construction have turned up, important indicators of near-term economic activity remain downbeat.  Business surveys point to continued caution, conditions in the labor market have not brightened, and gains in industrial production, excluding the motor vehicle supply chain, remain sluggish.  These disappointing indicators likely reflect the fact that the factors that have been restraining the pace of the recovery are still in place.  The large overhang of vacant housing units remains, credit availability remains impaired, and risk premiums remain elevated.  In the interest of time, I won’t comment on the European situation or the housing situation or the fiscal situation.  I also won’t comment on drug use among non–purple squirrels.  Instead, I just want to talk for a minute about consumer sentiment, which is another factor likely continuing to hold back the recovery. Confidence measures are at historic lows, and recent measures of confidence remain exceedingly low, probably due to households’ concerns about low future income and wealth, which tend to depress consumption.  Despite last week’s report showing a 0.5 percent increase in real consumer spending in September, a welcome surprise for sure, I’m not optimistic that households are ready to be an engine of growth for this economy.  For one thing, the September increase was not accompanied by rising incomes.  Rather, real disposable income edged down in September and has increased only very modestly over the past 12 months.  The resulting downdrift in the saving rate to around 4 percent in the third quarter might be interpreted as a sign that households are feeling optimistic again, but the lousy consumer sentiment numbers and the lack of any improvement in home equity values suggest that this is very unlikely to be the case and that consumer spending will be subdued going forward. The lack of any meaningful increase in real incomes for the vast majority of households suggests that many are feeling pretty strapped, even those who have jobs and are not under water.  This is evident in the spreading discourse about income inequality in the country, which the Chairman has been asked about.  Many of us are receiving personally addressed letters to our homes from protesters, and I have the one that I received just yesterday.  Page 1 reads, “End the Fed.”  This is typical because I do get one a day, and this is Occupy Muskegon.  Many of the Reserve Bank presidents, too, I know, are dealing with Occupy Wall Street protesters in their cities and at their Banks.  Regardless of how any of us feel about the merits of the 99–1 critique, we have to acknowledge that this is not only a cost of a lack of aggregate demand, a cost of long-term unemployment, but also an additional factor that is affecting social cohesion, dignity, and American optimism. In sum, the pace of consumer spending is up, but the low level of sentiment, volatility in the stock market, and tepid gains in employment and income projected for the coming years continue to weigh on consumer spending and thus on overall economic activity.  It’s hard to see what string of events will eventually break this cycle, and as a consequence, I continue to expect the pace of the recovery to be subpar.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that consumer spending is up, but argues that low consumer sentiment, volatility in the stock market, and weak employment and income gains will continue to hold back the economy. The speaker also mentions receiving letters from Occupy protesters, suggesting disagreement or opposition to the Federal Reserve.

Passage number 318.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Bill.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply includes statements and requests for someone named Bill. There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage.


Passage number 319.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, can I ask Brian a question.  Yesterday in his presentation, he said that it was our description of the economy that you felt was a little harsher than markets expected.  I’m interpolating your words.  The operative word here is “significant.”  Is that what you were referring to in terms of statement B as it’s drafted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question asked by Mr. Fisher to clarify a statement made by Brian in his presentation.


Passage number 320.
 MR. SACK.  I think that’s what received a lot of attention in markets.  Just to be clear, I had thought the first two paragraphs of that statement were essentially marking to market in a way that was pretty obvious.  But market participants actually took a more negative signal from it than I had anticipated.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that market participants reacted more negatively than he had expected, without expressing any disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 321.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, have they digested that word “significant” by now in your opinion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking for an opinion or assessment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 322.
 MR. SACK.  Yes, I would imagine their expectation is that that clause would be repeated.  We didn’t ask that explicitly, but certainly given the volatility in markets and the uncertainties that they see, I think they wouldn’t be surprised to have that sentence repeated with the word “significant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a disagreement in the passage. Mr. Sack acknowledges that he imagines the expectation of the clause being repeated, while also mentioning that they did not explicitly ask for it. This implies a difference in understanding or perspective between Mr. Sack and the individuals being referred to.


Passage number 323.
” MR. FISHER.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement is a polite expression of gratitude, indicating agreement and harmony rather than any disagreement.


Passage number 324.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Any other questions for Bill.  [No response]  All right.  Let’s begin our go-round with President Williams.

Passage number 325.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The given text, "MR," does not provide any information or context to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 326.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I also favor maintaining the “at least through mid-2013” forward guidance and including the word “significant” in describing the downside risks.  I think that’s accurate.  In my view, appropriate policy entails liftoff of the funds rate from its current level around mid-2014.  This is similar to the median of market participants’ expectations, so I don’t see a compelling need at this time to try to move market expectations by changing our policy guidance. In thinking about the appropriate stance of monetary policy, I find it useful to consider a variety of simple estimated and calibrated monetary policy rules.  I’m less swayed by the optimal control simulations, which are highly sensitive to the model and underlying forecasts, and I don’t think they’re as reliable a guide for policy.  But currently, with considerable slack, slow growth, and fairly low inflation, the central tendency of these policy rules is completely consistent with the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Furthermore, the central tendency of these policy rules doesn’t predict lifting off from the zero lower bound until around mid-2014. Of course, simple rules are only partial guides to our policy decisions, and there are three key reasons why we may want to adjust the prescriptions from these rules.  First, because of the zero lower bound, we haven’t been able to follow the prescriptions of the policy rules into negative territory.  So there’s no reason to think that we should follow them regarding the policy liftoff.  Indeed, much research, including work I’ve done with Dave Reifschneider, suggests that policy should stay at zero longer than standard policy rules would suggest following an episode at the zero bound.  A policy rule based on our analysis suggests liftoff in early 2015.  Furthermore, the normal channels of monetary transmission remain unusually clogged.  Many businesses and households are unable to take on new debt or want to shed existing debt, muting the effects of monetary policy stimulus.  If this reduced effectiveness persists, additional policy accommodation is needed, and liftoff should be delayed relative to the simple rules’ prescription.  However, working in the opposite direction, the simple rules ignore the sizable additional accommodation from our unconventional monetary policies.  The additional stimulus from lower term premiums and longer-term yields suggests that our short-term policy could lift off somewhat earlier than the simple rules suggest. I view these and other arguments that deviate from the policy rules as roughly canceling out.  So I remain fairly comfortable with the rules-based prescription of a mid-2014 liftoff as a modal forecast.  Importantly, I foresee a relatively modest pace of increases after liftoff, with the funds rate ending 2014 at only 75 basis points. Finally, there are significant downside risks to the outlook for the economy, as we discussed yesterday, and I therefore recognize that the date of liftoff could be significantly later than mid-2014.  And obviously, depending on the actual evolution of the forecast for economic activity and inflation, we may need to change our policy guidance and use further large-scale asset purchases or lower the reserve rates as needed, but right now I see alternative B as appropriate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 329.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yesterday I discussed the Boston forecast and talked about inflation being at 1½ percent, roughly where the Tealbook was, by mid-2013.  Both the Boston forecast and the Board forecast come from a particular econometric tradition, so I thought it was noteworthy to at least look at the memos on DSGE models.  And interestingly, from all four of those banks, they came up with roughly the same estimate that both the Tealbook and the Boston Fed forecast, which was roughly 1½ percent.  In fact, I think 1½ is a high rather than a low for both those four banks and those coming from a different econometric tradition. What that would seem to say is that there is some flexibility, if we are going to have an inflation rate below 2 percent two to three years out, to do more accommodation in order to get a better result on the unemployment rate.  The reason you wouldn’t do that is, one, you might think that we couldn’t affect the interest rate, or, two, if we did affect interest rates, it would have no impact.  Brian yesterday showed the percent of Treasuries that we’re buying, and showed that in a number of issues, we’re buying a very significant amount.  I have no doubt that if we’re willing to buy a very significant amount, we have the ability to move down both Treasury rates and mortgage-backed securities rates.  It’s a question of will, not whether we can do it or not.  It isn’t a question of whether we can move those interest rates. So then the question is, if we can move those interest rates, what is the likelihood it would have any impact.  Some analysts have argued that pushing long rates down through quantitative easing would have no effect.  No effect is a very restrictive assumption, but it has been cited by a wide number of analysts.  That assumption means that housing is unresponsive to lower rates; that consumption, including autos and durables, is unresponsive to interest rates; that exchange rates in the foreign sector are unresponsive despite the complaints by many of our foreign trading partners about the quantitative easing; and that investment is unresponsive to lower rates. I asked the people who do our model to test the assumption of whether the interest responsiveness of each of these components is really zero.  Not surprisingly, my prior was that they wouldn’t find that zero was the right answer.  And when they did that, they did find that in housing, the coefficient was much lower, but they didn’t find that the coefficient was 0—which is, housing is responsive; it’s not as responsive as it would be without all of the various headwinds.  But in those other sectors, they couldn’t reject the assumption that in the past several years, interest rates have affected those sectors in the same way that they did prior to the past several years.  So it is interesting that it does seem, from at least the econometric analysis done at the Boston Fed, that in using the model that we use for the forecast, we actually do find that if we chose to push interest rates lower, it would have an impact on the economy, contrary to what at least some analysts have argued. When I look at alternative B, which maintains the exceptionally low rates “at least through mid-2013,” our forecast implies that the language in alternative A would actually be more appropriate.  Should we leave policy unchanged when both elements of the mandate are missed in the medium term.  We’re not at full employment, and we’re lower than 2 percent for the inflation rate.  My preference would be to use this meeting to clearly communicate that rates will remain exceptionally low until unemployment is 7 percent or the inflation rate exceeds 2½ percent in the medium term.  At our next meeting, if the outlook once again envisions unacceptable progress toward our primary goals, we need to consider taking more forceful action. Were we to have a shock from a large bank failure here or abroad, a European crisis, or the inability to reach agreement on our debt problems, aggressive monetary actions, perhaps coupled with a move to nominal GDP targeting to signal a regime change, would clearly be appropriate.  But even our baseline forecast implies a lost decade for many people in the workforce.  We should consider soon whether more vigorous policies are necessary.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in this passage. The author argues that pushing interest rates lower would have an impact on the economy, contrary to what some analysts have argued. They also suggest that more vigorous policies may be necessary to address the current economic situation.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 331.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today I support further actions by the Committee to provide additional significant monetary accommodation.  I am not arguing that economic conditions have deteriorated further and thus require this additional action.  I am arguing that the progression of adding stimulus needs to continue.  In my assessment, there are significant benefits to credibly solidifying expectations that policy will continue to be extraordinarily accommodative as long as conditions warrant.  I spoke about the risk-management benefits at length yesterday, and I hope that the record properly reflects those comments here as well in the interest of time. As I’ve stated here and in public, I interpret our dual-mandate responsibilities to be closely associated with minimizing a quadratic policy loss function, which puts equal weights on price stability and maximum employment as captured by unemployment deviations from a pretty conservative and time-varying natural rate.  Given such a loss function, the staff analysis shows clear value in strengthening our forward guidance.  I agree with President Rosengren very much. There are also considerations not captured by the staff analysis that I think add to the case for further accommodation.  Some of this came up yesterday.  The longer we go with very high unemployment and output far below its potential, the more we risk actually eroding that potential.  President Williams mentioned the supply effects the Japanese perceive.  Some of the reductions that we have already made to our estimates of potential are due to decreased capital deepening that is actually a fallout of weak demand suppressing capital investment. Mr. Chairman, your speeches have highlighted the corrosive effects of long-term unemployment, and Governor Tarullo did a great job of explaining how we may be on the cusp of finally significantly raising the natural rate of unemployment.  I think those considerations add some urgency to this situation. In favoring more policy accommodation in the form of certain variations of alternative A, I expect that I will be outside the consensus policy decision today.  Since July 2010, I’ve advocated aggressive forms of additional policy accommodation.  I argued for state-contingent price-level targeting in the fall of 2010.  I was pleased to support QE2 as a further substantial step along the way, and I hoped that that would be enough.  In August of this year, I argued for a version of the trigger threshold strategy similar to the language in alt A1, paragraph 4″.  Yesterday’s discussion clearly indicates that, at least for now, I’m outside of the Committee’s consensus regarding such policy clarifications of our “mid-2013” forward guidance—that is, if in fact there is a consensus regarding interpreting and clarifying “mid-2013.”  We’re going to have to deal with that soon.  It’s not really optional. In any event, it’s my judgment that we need another substantial step toward additional accommodation in order to solidify expectations.  Accordingly, I favor alternative A1, with a variation of paragraph 4″ included.  I think that our exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate, at least as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent or unless medium-term PCE inflation exceeds 3 percent and longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored.  Just to be clear, my preferred strategy for delivering additional accommodation in the most credible fashion would be to pursue additional asset purchases regularly at subsequent meetings until the outlook for hitting either of these thresholds increased commensurately with these additional actions. As I said, Mr. Chairman, on the basis of yesterday’s commentaries, I expect that my policy position is simply too far outside the consensus, and I cannot support alternative B today.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Evans, states that he supports further actions by the Committee to provide additional monetary accommodation, but acknowledges that his position is outside of the consensus. He argues for more policy accommodation in the form of alternative A1, while stating that he cannot support alternative B. This indicates a difference of opinion or disagreement within the Committee regarding the best course of action.


Passage number 332.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I ask a clarifying question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking if they can ask a clarifying question.


Passage number 333.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "Vice Chairman" simply states a position or title and does not inherently indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 334.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  President Evans, in buying more assets, do you have a preference in terms of what you would buy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The question is simply asking President Evans if he has a preference in terms of what assets he would buy.


Passage number 335.
  MR. EVANS.  I would clearly support MBS.  I think that that would be very helpful for the housing market.  And I also would say that if a consensus was to emerge—which I am not anticipating—that some sort of asset purchasing today could be adopted, then I could be prepared to support that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their support for MBS (mortgage-backed securities) and also mentioning that they could potentially support asset purchasing if a consensus emerged. However, the speaker clarifies that they are not anticipating such a consensus.


Passage number 336.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not provide any information that indicates contention or disagreement. It only mentions President Lockhart without any context or details.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 337.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m going to support alternative B.  I do not support alternative A2 because I don’t favor additional asset purchases at this time.  But I do have to express some sympathy for alternative A1, with its policy thrust of pushing the funds rate guidance further out to 2014. My own forecast projects a funds rate near zero at least through mid-2014.  Considering the language options for paragraph 4 of alternative A1, I am sympathetic to the first option because, as I said, it reflects my forecast.  I’m also sympathetic to the second option for paragraph 4 because, in my view, it makes sense to move in the direction of policy conditionality in terms of projected economic outcomes, versus guidance based only on a calendar date.  I am less sympathetic to the third option in paragraph 4 because I think its introduction of an explicit unemployment threshold could prove to be a step too far.  For reasons that I expressed yesterday, I am concerned that the unemployment problem is multifaceted, not well understood, and quite possibly not as responsive as we might hope to a sustained accommodative monetary policy stance.  I am reluctant to connect the path of policy so concretely to what might show itself as time passes to be a problematic number that is taken as a trigger.  Despite my sympathy for alternative A1, paragraphs 4 and 4′, I lean to alternative B at this meeting.  I would prefer a “stay the course” approach for the time being.  The economy is improving, and I think we would be prudent to take a breather and see how the European and congressional fiscal stories play out and the economy evolves.   I think it would be best to avoid the impression of a policy change, and the easiest way to do that is to stick with our previous language.  I say this because I do not really think the presumption of a very low funds rate through mid-2014 is a change from the consensus view that has prevailed since August.  Because alternative A1, with the first paragraph 4 option, does reflect this reality, I do not strongly object to it in substance but advise against it at this meeting as a matter of tactics.  If the Committee goes in that direction, I would hope we might convey that pushing the horizon of the current funds rate policy to mid-2014 is more an extension and continuation of the August policy decision than a change in the implied degree of stimulus relative to September.  This could perhaps be done through the Chairman’s comments on the SEP. As regards the language of alternative B, I prefer no change at this meeting.  As I already implied, I do not object strenuously to the change that comes off a date and allows a rolling approach.  It does suggest an extension, as I said, which is consistent with my forecast, but that may be too narrow a point.  It’s early enough, it seems to me, to treat this tactically at this meeting.  So all things considered, I prefer the existing “mid-2013” language.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lockhart expresses sympathy for alternative A1 but ultimately leans towards supporting alternative B. He expresses concerns about the introduction of an explicit unemployment threshold in alternative A1 and believes it would be best to stick with the existing language of alternative B.


Passage number 338.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Did you want to say anything about “significant”.  Were your comments meant to encompass that or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification or expansion on the topic of "significant" without expressing any opposing view or disagreement.


Passage number 339.
 MR. LOCKHART.  The dropping of “significant” is okay with me, I think, at this time because of the slight improvement in the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lockhart, expresses agreement with the dropping of the word "significant" in relation to the improvement in the economy.


Passage number 340.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage only states the name "President Pianalto" without providing any information or context that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 341.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B today.  Since our last meeting, we received some good news on the economy that signals a reduced chance of recession.  But as I said yesterday, the news hasn’t been sufficient to change my view of the most likely path of the economy, which is for slow growth in the 2½ to 2¾ percent range through 2014.  We also had a bit of good news on inflation, although not enough to be certain that we are seeing a reduction in the underlying trend of prices.  Nonetheless, I continue, as I said yesterday, to expect inflation of about 2 percent for the next few years.  With my outlook little changed since we eased policy at our last meeting, it makes sense to me to keep policy unchanged at this meeting. As we move forward, I think the course of policy is going to be highly dependent on how the considerable risks to the outlook play out.  While the risks don’t look as dire today as they did at our last meeting, they may yet pose some challenges for policy.  For example, we could easily face circumstances in which risks to price stability prevent us from easing in response to a faltering recovery or circumstances in which rising inflation prevents us from maintaining the current degree of policy accommodation in response to a still-weak recovery. In terms of the language, I wouldn’t change the “mid-2013” date at this meeting.  In paragraphs 1 and 2 of alternative B, we are making comments that show somewhat improved economic conditions, and we didn’t really change our economic outlook very much since our last meeting.  Drawing on yesterday’s discussion of policy frameworks, though, I would prefer to use the SEP to clarify the forward guidance in alternative B by referring to our forecast for unemployment and inflation in mid-2013.  Adding some form of the language in the last sentence in paragraph 4′ in alternative A1, I think, could help the public better understand our reaction function. Mr. Chairman, because you’re going to have a press conference after this meeting, I would encourage you to use that opportunity to draw the public’s attention to what we expect economic conditions are going to be in 2013, if we don’t use that language in our statement today.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's support for alternative B and her views on the economy and policy.


Passage number 342.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude towards President Fisher.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 343.
 MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I support alternative B, with maintaining the language “through mid-2013.”  Mr. Evans may be surprised that I agree with him completely—that the longer we go with high unemployment, the more we undermine potential.  I just don’t believe that our monetary accommodation has been all that useful in assisting the reduction of joblessness, given the uncertainty that is posed by the fiscal and regulatory morass that we see on Capitol Hill.  And I believe we’re pushing on a string on that front. I have been outspoken on this publicly and within this room.  I did not support the extension to mid-2013.  I voted against it.  I still—despite, I think, Brian’s very good briefings—view Operation Twist as incomplete.  I suspect it was good for the rich.  As a former trader, having learned very well to operate on “buying on the rumor and selling on the news,” I think we did end up enriching certain swift and capable money operators.  It’s not clear to me that in the end it will benefit the cost of business borrowing.  I do believe very firmly that we have significant liquidity in the economy. I found all the interventions yesterday to be quite brilliant, but I was particularly struck by Governor Duke’s, in terms of some of the improvements that have been made regarding balance sheets and the potential that exists out there.  I wouldn’t say that I want to completely embrace the “Tigger” scenario, nor am I willing to embrace the “Eeyore” scenario, but I found that to be a sobering assessment in contrast to what everybody else was talking about at the table, and it’s something we should bear in mind. I continue to believe that we should harbor our ammunition.  We have few bullets left.  I referred to them in the last meeting—in reference to your initials, Mr. Chairman—as BBs.  But whatever we have left we need to use under dire circumstances.  I am still of the belief that we could see an S&P 500 trading at 600 under very easy circumstances if we have the horrific scenario that some fear obtained in Europe and just because of the nature of the skittishness of markets. I continue to worry about the impact of what we have wrought on those who played by the rules, saved their money, and are being hurt by low interest rates.  I do believe this is not constructive from the standpoint of the 6,000-plus community banks we have in this country in terms of squeezing their profitability. I do believe that this has a negative impact related to the resetting of pension fund liabilities, which takes away from investment that might otherwise go into job-creating capital, and I worry about the consequence of our low-interest-rate policy.  These are costs that are involved.  There are certainly benefits that accrue.  But I don’t think one of the benefits is that we impact the too-high unemployment levels in this country if we just act as a substitute for fiscal policy.   We’ll have more information by December in terms of knowing what the supercommittee is likely to do, and in my book, as long as we provide accommodative monetary policy, we give them an excuse not to act.  It is time for them to act, and I would urge you, in your press briefing, to underscore what you have said publicly—and Mr. Dudley, the Vice Chairman of this Committee, mentioned yesterday—that we should stress regarding the need for fiscal policy to get its act together.  Mr. Chairman, I would support statement B.  With regard to the word “significant,” I am somewhat indifferent.  I would prefer not to use it, but if the Desk tells us that it’s been digested by the market, then I could swallow it.  I didn’t think it was in blue, by the way—I thought it was in purple, Mr. Lockhart, just to satisfy you.  And I would suggest that those who are seeing purple squirrels may be taking the drugs that Mr. Lockhart and Mr. Lacker have been talking about.  [Laughter]  So that’s it, Mr. Chairman.  I support statement B as drafted, with “through mid-2013.”  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

There is disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher disagrees with the extension of monetary accommodation and believes it has not been effective in reducing unemployment. He also expresses concern about the negative impact of low interest rates on community banks and pension fund liabilities. He urges the need for fiscal policy to take action.


Passage number 344.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is a short and polite expression of gratitude.


Passage number 345.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My preference is to take no further action at this meeting.  Since September, the moderate recovery has continued, and although far from robust, GDP growth has been resilient, and the third-quarter reading came in slightly better than I had previously expected, thanks to strong business investment. While I understand the desire to do something to address high unemployment, I don’t think our current problems can fundamentally be solved with monetary policy alone.  Deleveraging and rebalancing take time to achieve, and monetary policy has only a limited ability to speed these processes without risking low and stable inflation, which we have worked hard to achieve.  Moreover, we normally believe it takes some time for monetary policy decisions to affect economic activity.  The Committee has taken action at each of the past two meetings, partly in response to a deteriorating outlook and downside risk, but conditions have not worsened, and in fact have improved a bit, since then. So I favor no further action.  I would like to leave the language unchanged and to eliminate the word “significant” from “downside.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. George, is expressing her preference for no further action at the meeting and providing her reasoning for it. She acknowledges the desire to address high unemployment but believes that monetary policy alone cannot solve the current problems. She also points out that conditions have actually improved since the previous meetings.


Passage number 346.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 347.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’ll be brief.  I support alternative B.  The data have been somewhat stronger than expected.  The recession scare that was around during the August time frame has been mitigated, at least for now. It’s true that sentiment is down at both the household level and the firm level.  I consider this a headline phenomenon for right now.  There is very real risk to the U.S. from Europe, but it’s only a risk at this point, and it’s not enough to change household behavior or business behavior for a couple of reasons.  The households, I think, see themselves as too far removed from Europe to actually change behavior, despite the fact that they’re reporting bad feelings.  For the large businesses, they’re also worried about developments in Europe, but they are also profitable and cash rich.  Their business growth strategies are not centered in Europe but in Asia, and Asian growth is projected to continue unabated.  These are two good reasons to think that the sentiment numbers are not affecting actual household and business behavior in the U.S. at this point, and so I think that that helps explain why we’re not getting significant downturn based on sentiment alone. The Committee has taken easing actions at the August and September meetings, strengthening the commitment to maintain the policy rate near zero and undertaking Operation Twist.  Both of these are operating today.  Given the improved hard data on the economy, I counsel patience at this point. I also counsel against the use of the word “significant” in paragraph 2 of alternative B.  The tradition of central bankers is to be appropriately fair but understated to avoid frightening the financial markets.  It’s a serious problem.  They think that we know something that they don’t know, and we have to be very careful about sending any signals of that nature.  I think it’s fine as originally written:  “Moreover, there are downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.”  Certainly there are.  Everyone knows what we’re talking about.  Putting “significant” in there may otherwise create more problems than it solves.  So I would use the original wording in paragraph 2. If the Committee wishes to ease aggressively at future meetings, I suggest that asset purchases are the most potent tool available to the Committee.  Partly based on the discussion yesterday, I would recommend the incremental balance sheet policies, such as those described in the excellent memo of October 24 by Dave Reifschneider, John Roberts, and Jae Sim.  We haven’t discussed that memo very much at this meeting, but I thought it was very good, and I recommend that we take a look at it.  I’ve also described my own views on this issue in previous discussions with the Committee.  An incremental approach would have a great advantage of allowing the Committee to make decisions in a manner analogous to interest rate decisions in ordinary times.  Also, the open-ended nature of this approach potentially promises substantial additional easing while still giving the Committee the ability to pause or reverse the policy as the macroeconomic situation changes.  I counsel purchasing Treasuries versus MBS. Other methods of easing did not strike me as being nearly as effective as they are sometimes portrayed, partly for the reasons I outlined yesterday.  The trigger strategy approach seems questionable to me.  I do not see why this is a good way to commit to longer periods of zero rates relative to other methods of committing to longer periods of zero rates.  I do not think much would happen initially if we took this approach, and it might complicate our strategies down the line if either or both of the thresholds were violated.  Furthermore, trying to tie monetary policy directly to unemployment strikes me as very questionable given the state of knowledge of hysteresis in unemployment as experienced in Europe in recent decades.  It’s not that we shouldn’t think about unemployment—we should think about unemployment.  The question is, should you tie the policy lever directly to a number that we probably don’t understand as well as we would like to understand.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Passage number 360.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I’m willing to support following through on our maturity extension program, which I opposed at the last meeting, but I’m willing to support that. As I said in the economic go-round, I think the forecast for inflation—people’s around this table and my own—is good, one that I’m very pleased with.  The risks around inflation are heightened.  If you look at a picture of inflation over the past several years, you’ll notice the significant increase in volatility this past decade over the decade before, and I think that volatility is likely to be with us for some time.  It is possible that the broader inflation trend could moderate a bit, as in the Tealbook and many of your forecasts, but I worry that a forecast of moderating inflation relies overly much on the effect of slack, whose downward effect on inflation has disappointed us several times in the recent past.  I think inflation could accelerate, and it could do so rapidly.  I don’t see that on the horizon right away, but it’s well within the realm of possibility.  I’d note the continuing buildup of bank balances and the huge amount of reserves, and I’d question whether two-year Treasuries are any less effective as inflationary tinder than bank balances.  So it’s conceivable that with the spark of a commodity price increase or an oil price increase of a substantial magnitude, we could get a broader acceleration of inflation. Growth is certainly extremely disappointing, but as I’ve said and many others have said around here, it’s a fairly nonmonetary phenomenon.  I think the natural rate, thinking in those terms, is fairly high and fairly close to the unemployment rate we have.  Further stimulus on our part could well affect growth, but I can’t see it affecting growth without also pushing inflation up.  It’s one thing, when inflation is running below where we’d like it to average, to be willing to run that risk for the sake of stimulating employment, but it’s entirely different when inflation is where we want it.  And it’s one thing to tolerate shocks that temporarily push headline inflation well above where we’d like it, in a situation where we have good reason to believe that that effect will reverse shortly and we’ll get back down to where we want it; it’s quite another thing to attempt to deliberately engineer an increase in inflation trends.  I just don’t think that our ability to manage the movement upward in inflation and a controlled movement downward warrants as much confidence as I’d require to get over the hump to support that.  It would be a terribly risky maneuver to attempt. Looking forward, I think the more stimulus we provide, the quicker we’re going to have to be ready to take it out.  The deeper we get into this, the quicker we’re going to have to move to take it out.  So I worry that we’ll face a situation with rising inflation and terribly disappointing growth still, or growth picking up but still disappointing on the labor market side—a dilemma that will be tough for this Committee to grapple with, that will really expose a lot of differences of opinion in this Committee. On the statements, I think “significant downside risks” was a mistake, in hindsight.  I believe that markets already thought there were significant downside risks, they read our statement as gloomier than they already were, and they read it as gloomier than we really were.  So I’d favor dropping the word “significant.”  I realize that the past few days’ events in Europe may make that a discordant, dissonant move; therefore, I could support leaving it in as well.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses his support for following through on the maturity extension program and shares his views on inflation and growth. He also discusses his concerns about the risks of inflation and the potential challenges the committee may face. While he expresses some hesitations and uncertainties, there is no direct disagreement with any other viewpoints or individuals in the passage.


Passage number 361.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, President Lacker.  Governor Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude towards President Lacker and Governor Yellen.


Passage number 362.
 MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We’ve taken a number of important steps to ease monetary policy in recent meetings.  Even so, absent further accommodation, the outlook is unacceptably weak.  Under current policy settings, the Tealbook forecast and the Committee’s central tendency projections show unemployment remaining exceptionally high for years to come and inflation running below the 2 percent level that most Committee members consider consistent with our dual mandate.  A central bank that practices flexible inflation targeting would be looking for ways to provide further accommodation. In my view, it would be feasible to foster a more satisfactory recovery, without pushing inflation above 2½ percent, by using communication strategies like those illustrated in alternative A1—namely, strategies that would convey the Committee’s intention to exit from the zero lower bound at a somewhat later date, and to firm policy at a somewhat more gradual pace, than financial markets currently anticipate.  Such a strategy is embedded in the projection that I submitted for this meeting, and hence my forecasts for both of the dual objectives are more appealing than in the extended Tealbook baseline.  In particular, my preferred policy path is associated with a faster pace of economic growth over the next few years, a significantly lower rate of unemployment by late 2014, and a trajectory for inflation that stays very close to its mandate-consistent rate.  Among the specific variants of paragraph 4 in alternative A1, the thresholds in version 4″ are very appealing to me as a way of conveying quantitative information about the conditionality of forward guidance, and I agree with the comments and discussion that President Evans has given of why this is a good approach.  The formulation in version 4′ based on projections, however, could also be workable. Nonetheless, as we have discussed, it makes eminent sense to make adjustments to our forward guidance in the context of a clear expression of our overarching goals and strategy.  I’m hopeful that we can reach a broad consensus on a statement of principles over the next couple of months.  I look forward to working with the subcommittee on communications to find a formulation that fully respects our dual mandate.  I also hope we’ll be able to move forward with incorporating policy projections into the SEP.  As a matter of fact, I became even more persuaded of the merits of publishing our funds rate projections as I filled out my survey for this round and discovered that my rosy economic forecasts could easily be misinterpreted in the absence of information on my judgment about appropriate policy. Regarding alternative A2, I’m also open to additional LSAPs, especially as a complement to providing additional accommodation through our forward guidance.  I would be particularly supportive of MBS purchases to help foster recovery in the housing sector, especially since dysfunction in mortgage markets is attenuating the effectiveness of monetary policy accommodation.  A pickup in the housing sector could make a substantial contribution to the recovery if starts were to rebound toward more normal levels.  Moreover, house prices have significant effects on spending via wealth, cash flow, and collateral effects, and a stronger housing market would also improve the health of the banking system.  So initiatives along these lines certainly deserve further consideration. In summary, rather than changing our forward guidance or engaging in further LSAPs at the current meeting, I’m supportive of adopting alternative B today.  With respect to the specific language, I strongly prefer to stick with the current wording of “at least through mid-2013” rather than substituting the phrase “for the next six to seven quarters.”  The phrase “at least” conveys that policy firming might not commence until significantly later than mid-2013, and this phrasing has already been helpful in guiding financial markets, as Brian noted in his briefing yesterday.  The Desk survey suggests that investors now see liftoff as most likely in early 2014.  Moreover, from the standpoint of effective communications, I consider it preferable to formulate our forward guidance in terms that can be reiterated at each meeting as long as there isn’t any substantial change in the economic outlook.  In effect, we should lay out the anticipated path of policy as clearly as possible based on our economic forecast, and we should follow that path unless there’s a good reason to change it.  Finally, on the language concerning “significant,” I could, frankly, go either way on this.  The current language, the language that was incorporated initially in B, seemed acceptable to me based on the data suggesting less risk of inflation and the fact that there has been some progress on Europe, but I could certainly live also with including “significant,” especially if, as Brian says, it’s been digested by markets at this point.

Passage number 363.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "Thank you, Governor Duke" does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 364.
 MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B with the language “at least through mid-2013,” not because I think that’s optimal, but because, as I said yesterday, if we made a change to it this time, it might be considered, given all the discussion about communication in the intermeeting period, our final choice, and I don’t think we’ve made a final choice.  In making a final choice, I could support one that referenced time, such as the six to seven quarters.  I could support one that was formulated as a prime or a double prime as long as we all agreed that that’s how we were going to do it going forward.  I do have some preference for referring it to the projections, the SEP, in some way and tying it to those. With regard to the word “significant,” I think the risks are significant, and taking that word out, it seems to me, would be a standing down from that position.  So I would prefer to leave it in. As to additional asset purchases, and specifically MBS, I would very much be in favor of weighting any purchases we were going to do toward MBS, but that goes only part of the way.  That affects the spread between Treasuries and the MBS securities.  It’s not as effective at this point in affecting the spread between Treasuries and the rates that are actually offered to homeowners, and paying more attention to that piece also makes sense.  We have within this System probably the largest collection—certainly of economic research resources that are available to the government, and I think making our assets available as technical assistance to parts of the government that can actually make changes that will improve the housing market and the ability of borrowers to access the low rates that we’re working on is something that we can do.  And certainly, anywhere that our regulatory supervisory policies can be supportive, that’s an important thing to do as well.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing her personal preferences and opinions, but there is no direct contention or disagreement with anyone else in the passage.


Passage number 365.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is a polite expression of gratitude directed towards Governor Tarullo.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 366.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A week and a half ago, I gave a speech in which I suggested that additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities should be put back on the top of our agenda.  I carefully phrased that speech and that particular suggestion so as to say that if things did not improve over the next couple of months, I thought we should consider it.  I qualified the formulation, really out of respect for the decisionmaking process of the Committee.  In fact, I think that there is a good case to be made right now for additional MBS purchases. Before I get to that reasoning, though, I wanted to say a couple of things about the general environment in which we’re making this decision today.  First, we’re not just talking about unemployment here.  Had it been a circumstance in which the economy was growing 3½ percent a year but unemployment was remaining stubbornly high, it would have been one thing.  But that is not the circumstance that we confront.  We have now had a several-year pattern of growth that has little spurts and then reverts back to a very tepid pace.  So the failure to create more jobs seems quite logically tied to the performance of the economy as a whole.  Of course, there are some uncertainties about exactly how some sectors of the labor market would or would not react to improved growth.  But if one looks at the data, the importance of aggregate demand and of cyclical unemployment as explanatory variables is as strong as virtually anything that we look at in this Committee.  So I do think it’s a red herring to talk about structural unemployment or drug problems or something of the sort when we’re talking about what impact may be had by further monetary stimulus.  I appreciate Jeff’s formulation, which was basically saying, “Yes, of course there’s room for more stimulus.”  But Jeff assesses the risks of inflation versus the stimulus, and I think that’s a legitimate conversation.  I would come out on the other side, but it does seem to me that’s the conversation we should be having. I think the case is actually quite strong, and it’s quite strong right now.  Why MBS.  Well, people have already mentioned several of the reasons.  The spreads are obviously one of those reasons and the fact that we’re getting to the point where there may be some impact on market functioning of further Treasury purchases.  But I would also point to something that has been reflected in a number of your comments over the past couple of days—that the suboptimal, subexpected performance of the economy over the past few years, with the very disappointing trajectory of the recovery, seems in retrospect pretty obviously tied to debt overhang, the Reinhart–Rogoff kinds of factors that people have been citing for a while now.  And the housing sector is clearly at the center of all of that.  As Betsy was indicating, in other areas there’s been a good bit of working down of debt.  Housing is what has continued to be dysfunctional.  That’s where the debt is; that’s where the failure of markets to clear is.  Again, as Betsy was just mentioning, that’s where prices and quantities don’t quite seem to be in the kind of equilibrium that we would expect.  So I think action we would take in the housing area with MBS purchases would not only be efficacious in the way that all large-scale, long-term asset purchases would be, but could also have a particular impact on the major impediment to the kind of recovery that would more resemble past recoveries out of recessions. I know that a lot of people, myself included, are frustrated with the failure of the political branches of government to take appropriate action to provide more clarity and stimulus for the economy.  But this is an instance in which there could be some synergy.  Some modest steps have already been taken to make refinancing more readily available.  If we were to act by announcing a large-scale asset purchase, I think both the public sector and the banks themselves would see more opportunities again to leverage what we were doing to have a greater economic impact. So the case is actually quite strong, and thus I’m very much tempted to join President Evans in dissenting from alternative B, because I think alternative B does not accurately reflect the state of the economy.  Having said that, I believe there are a couple of reasons not to move right now.  One is the point that Narayana and John made earlier, and which Bill Dudley has made, I think, on a number of occasions in the past several meetings—that we do need to get the communications and the framework and the sense that we think in terms of multiple meetings (and not just one meeting) more clear than we have.  And there are some reasonable grounds for arguing that an action by us today, whether it was A1 or A2, would once again be difficult for markets and other observers fully to comprehend.  They wouldn’t quite know how it was that we were making decisions and why. Second, and someone alluded to this earlier also, I do think that the risks of a significant adverse event in Europe are as high as they have been since May 2010.  The risks are not just significant—whatever the adjective above “significant” is, that’s the one we should have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, is expressing his disagreement with the decision to not prioritize additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities. He believes there is a strong case for these purchases and disagrees with the reasoning behind the decision. He also expresses frustration with the political branches of government for not taking appropriate action to stimulate the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 367.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  “Very significant.” PARTICIPANT.  “Humongous.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The participant's statement of "humongous" indicates a differing opinion or perspective from Mr. Kocherlakota's statement of "very significant."


Passage number 368.
”  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  “Humongous”—that’s the one that belongs in the statement as an actual reflection of reality.  Because of the increased possibility of something seriously adverse happening, it might be prudent to withhold for now a significant additional policy initiative, which is what I might otherwise favor, and then to assess the state of our communications, the state of the economy, and the state of Europe over the next couple of meetings. So with considerable reluctance, I can support alternative B today.  Mr. Chairman, one probably shouldn’t make one’s support or nonsupport based on any single word, except maybe the insertion or omission of “not” in certain places.  [Laughter]  But I do think that omitting “significant,” given that it’s in the statement now and given what I regard as the increase in financial risk since the last meeting, would be a mistake.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the statement that "humongous" belongs in the statement, and they express their support for alternative B despite their reluctance. They also make a lighthearted comment about the potential impact of a single word, but it is not a point of disagreement.


Passage number 369.
CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not include any statements or claims that can be argued or disagreed upon. It is a polite expression of gratitude towards Governor Raskin.


Passage number 370.
 MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some of the incoming data indicate that the downside risks have receded somewhat.  But unemployment is still projected to decline only gradually, and inflation is still projected to settle at or below mandate-consistent levels.  The economy is still in dire straits, with sentiment highly pessimistic.  Again, I am not optimistic that households, many of which have lower levels of disposable income, are yet ready to be an engine of growth for this economy.  We have not fallen off the cliff, but the margin of safety is not wide.  Downside risk is significant. First, I think that early cessation of the maturity extension program, as suggested in alternative C, would be premature.  It also would challenge the credibility of the Committee to reverse a decision so quickly when economic indicators have not materially changed.  In my view, early cessation of the maturity extension program requires more-definitive data confirming that the recovery has strengthened and that unemployment has begun to decline. I’m instinctively drawn to alternative A1 because, with the federal funds rate constrained by the zero lower bound and with elevated downside risks to output, stronger forward guidance seems prudent.  But stronger forward guidance of any type requires a communication strategy in order to be effective.  In order to maximize the benefits of accommodation promised by such stronger forward guidance, I’d like to understand what communication efforts would accompany such an action.  Once these communication plans are developed and considered, the option in alternative A1 will be more credible to the public.  Until then, staying the course, as in alternative B, seems appropriate.  But I am drawn to the need to update our reaction function in paragraph 4 by reflecting the “six to seven quarters” language, which I think is more commensurate with at least my economic outlook.  I’m sensitive to President Kocherlakota’s argument that keeping the “through mid-2013” language reduces the level of accommodation.  So I look forward to the work of the subcommittee on communications to create for the full Committee’s consideration a framework for enhanced forward guidance. Thank you.

 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a simple expression of gratitude and the title or position of the individual signing off. There is no contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 372.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  First, I want to talk a little bit about the “significant” point.  I feel really strongly that it has to stay in, because if you take it out, you’re basically saying that you now think the downside risks are insignificant.  Does anyone around the room think that the downside risks are now insignificant.  I agree that we were surprised by the reaction of the markets last time to putting “significant” in.  But it’s very different keeping it in as opposed to taking it out.  If you’re taking it out, you’re trying to make a statement that you think the risks have really declined significantly.   I just don’t see any evidence that the downside risks have declined significantly—in fact, at all.  The European situation is probably at the worst place that it’s been.  It’s also completely inconsistent with what we’re saying in the SEPs.  If you look at the SEP results, uncertainty about GDP growth went up compared with June; downside risks to GDP growth are the same as June—11 versus 6.  If you look at the risks to unemployment, they have gone up since June.  So how do you reconcile taking “significant” out here, and then you have all of this uncertainty that you’re going to discuss in the SEP results.  I just don’t see the benefit.  I think it could be really embarrassing for the Committee if you take it out, Europe falls apart, and people go back and say, “Well, what were you thinking.  Didn’t you see what was going on in Europe as you were going into the meeting.” Now, in terms of other things, obviously I’m going to support alternative B.  I prefer to stick with the date rather than move to the quarters.  I understand the argument for the quarters, but we’re on a trajectory here where we’re hoping—at least some of us around the table are hoping—that by January we can arrive at a framework where we actually specify triggers or thresholds.  And in that case, the thresholds will be the key thing, and then the date will follow from that.  I don’t think it really makes sense to go to quarters and then go to this new thing—you’re going in a zigzag pattern.  So I don’t really oppose the idea of the quarters conceptually, but I don’t think it really fits in, in terms of the trajectory of how we might like to move through the meetings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage regarding whether to keep the word "significant" in the statement. One person strongly feels that it should stay in, while another person argues that taking it out suggests that downside risks have significantly declined, which they disagree with.


Passage number 373.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Could I just say one thing to that, Bill.  For this meeting, I understand the arguments for staying the same as we were, and I appreciate that.  But even if you’re thinking about alternative A1 down the road, in December or January, we will have to communicate information about timing in some way.  And I think saying something about the duration, as opposed to a date, would be a better way, even in that context.  So I don’t think of them as being inconsistent.  That’s all I would say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is expressing agreement with his colleagues and suggesting a different approach for communicating information about timing.


Passage number 374.
  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.  Well, let me continue.  The other thing I want to talk about is, we need to really think clearly through what our escalation options are in the near term, because there are significant downside risks.  So I think we could actually not have the luxury of getting all the way to January to pursue the thresholds approach.  Regarding the near-term escalation option, there are really two things that I would favor if we had to go down this path.  One is that I much prefer MBS over Treasuries at this point, subject to the capacity constraints in terms of how much we can do without disrupting market function.  And the reason why I favor MBS over Treasuries is, it’s easier to make the case that this is more directly tied to one of the key issues that we’re facing, which is housing.  It’s easier to tie it more directly to private-sector financial market conditions, and it also would have less political noise associated with it.  I don’t think that we should pay that much attention to the political noise per se, but the political noise can make policies less effective.  So to the extent that there’s less political noise of doing MBS versus Treasuries, I think it is significant in terms of the efficacy of the policy choice. Regarding where we’re heading over the next couple of meetings, I very much hope that we can get to the point where we can actually turn the date into thresholds, with the date actually following from the thresholds rather than just standing out there in space.  As I said yesterday, I’m very uncertain about what the date is.  I’m considerably less uncertain about the thresholds, so I think the thresholds are, in some way, a better metric to give the markets.  The second thing with thresholds is that they give the market the ability to update its view of how long policy is going to stay accommodative dynamically as it gets new information and the outlook changes.  So that’s something that I’m hoping we can work toward.  Obviously, I think it’s going to be difficult. The second thing I think we need to think about—and this is something that we talked about; we got a briefing from the staff at the videoconference—was that we may need to think about bringing back a better liquidity backstop for our financial system if Europe really gets into great difficulty.  The very rapid failure of MF Global underscores the fact that the broker–dealers in the United States do not have a credible lender-of-last-resort backstop.  And so it’s very possible that we may have to do something very quickly on the liquidity front to backstop the financial system.  One thing I think that it’s very important for us to stress in our public remarks is that despite the Dodd–Frank Act, we still have both the ability and the will to perform our lender-of-last-resort function, because I think there’s a little bit of confusion in the market about whether we would actually be willing to act.  Obviously, we didn’t have a discussion at that videoconference, but my reading of the body language is that there’s quite a bit of support on the Committee that lender of last resort is a legitimate central banking function.  I think we should make it clear to people where the Committee stands on that in our public commentary.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply discussing various topics and expressing their thoughts and opinions on those topics.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 375.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, all, for your comments.  We are still at a difficult juncture.  There is certainly a case, I think, for further action.  The best way to say it is that our medium-term forecasts have inflation below target or at target and unemployment well above what most people consider to be the long-run equilibrium level.  And I think it’s pretty straightforward to show that that can’t be a feature of optimal policy.  That said—well, there are responses to that, of course.  One can argue that the actions that we could take at this stage are ineffective or have unintended side effects.  So it’s a complex debate and one that’s been going on in this room for some time. For this meeting, I would propose that we not take new action, and that’s based more on trying to get our framework clarified than on a clear decision on the need for or efficacy of further action.  We took important actions at each of the past two meetings.  Both of these, I think, were well grounded in theory.  But President Kocherlakota and others have a point that there was some ad hoc feel to those actions, and probably their impact is somewhat less than it could have been if they had been better cast in the context of a framework and better prepared for the markets. For those who are advocating more expansionary policy, I would just point out that our toolkit is not infinite, that our capacity is not infinite, and that we’ll be more effective if we can use the ammunition we have left in the most focused way.  And the best way to do that is to have a strong communication program that will help people understand what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, and help guide expectations in both the markets and the public. So I would propose not to take new action today.  I leave aside the question of whether new action is justified.  I see a case for new action.  But whatever we choose to do, it’ll be more effective if we are able to provide a more coherent framework for communication.  Again, I think that we should not introduce yet additional policy actions today.  We have several things already in play.  Therefore, I do support alternative B, which most people around the table were comfortable with.  I think the majority of people in that statement were in favor of retaining the “through mid-2013” language.  Whatever the merits may be of the alternative, there’s a case for waiting until we get to a new communication strategy before making changes, and then we can consider how to incorporate different considerations into that.  So I propose that.  “Significant” is—I got a very divided response on that.  Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 
There is contention and disagreement in the passage. Different opinions and arguments are presented regarding the need for further action, the effectiveness of previous actions, and the communication strategy.


Passage number 376.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I’m sorry, but I wanted to suggest one possibility because the response was so divided, which was to use exactly the words from last time rather than changing the structure of the sentence.  It might be that the market would be less likely to notice and think about the word “significant” if it’s in the context of exactly the same words as used before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show contention or disagreement. Mr. English is simply making a suggestion to use the same words as before in order to minimize the likelihood of the market noticing and thinking about the word "significant."


Passage number 377.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think that’s right.  I would say the two options are, in alternative B, either striking the bracketed word “significant” and leaving the sentence as it is:  “Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook remain, including strains in global financial markets”—I think the case for doing that is, first, there’s this mysterious overinterpretation of the word in the markets, and we’re not quite sure what all that means.  But more substantively, even though Europe remains very troubled, there has been at least a little reduction in downside risk in the near-term U.S. economic data.  The case on the other side is that we have already used this language.  And as the Vice Chairman and Governor Tarullo and others point out, we are facing downside risks that could be significant or worse from European developments.  Frankly, I’m willing to go either way.  I think if we do retain “significant,” we ought to go back just to the language of September, so there’s no need to change. PARTICIPANT.  I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing two different options and states that they are willing to go either way. The subsequent participant agrees with the speaker's statement.


Passage number 378.
   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage itself does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. It only mentions President Lacker without giving any specific context or information about his actions or opinions.


Passage number 379.
  MR. LACKER.  I found Vice Chairman Dudley compelling, so I agree we should leave it in.  Going back to the old language makes sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker in the passage agrees with Vice Chairman Dudley and believes it is a logical choice to return to the previous language. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 380.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions the position or title of President Bullard, but it does not provide any information or context that suggests contention or disagreement.


Passage number 381.
 MR. BULLARD.  Yes, I agree—we could just keep it the way it was.  Let me just say, though, that as a matter of style, you always want to be understated as a central bank.  People are imputing that we have some really detailed knowledge about what’s going to happen or that we have a special crystal ball, and they’re imputing the probability of disaster to be higher than it otherwise is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, expresses agreement with keeping things the way they were and offers a suggestion regarding the style of communication used by the central bank. There is no opposition or disagreement presented in the passage.


Passage number 382.
   MR. LACKER.  You could say “somewhat significant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing a description or qualifier ("somewhat significant") to the matter being discussed.


Passage number 383.
”  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.  I’m happy to leave the sentence the way it is, but let me just say, the Wall Street Journal is a master of understatement.  They have the small headlines.  It says, “Nixon Resigns; Ford Takes the Oath of Office.”  They don’t blare it at you the way the other newspapers do.  I think that’s the style that we should have in describing the situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a comment about the writing style of the Wall Street Journal and the preference for understatement in describing a situation.


Passage number 384.
 MR. FISHER.  So you would caution against “humongous”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Fisher expressing caution against something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 385.
 MR. BULLARD.  I would caution against “humongous.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. 
This can be seen in the use of the word "caution" by Mr. Bullard. By cautioning against the use of the word "humongous", he is indicating that he disagrees with or opposes its usage.


Passage number 386.
” CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Now, on the other side of that, “significant” is not exactly a word that would blow most people away.  [Laughter]  It is significant, certainly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents a point of view and includes laughter, suggesting a light-hearted tone.


Passage number 387.
 MR. LACKER.  “Notable”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The word "notable" does not indicate contention or disagreement. It simply implies that something is worth noticing or remarkable.


Passage number 388.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  “Significant.”  [Laughter]  I’m not suggesting any change.  All right.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of "laughter" suggests a light-hearted or amusing tone, and the phrase "I'm not suggesting any change" indicates agreement or lack of disagreement.


Passage number 389.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Just a comment.  It’s fine to leave as in the original sentence.  However, in listening to what people said about “significant,” in some sense, the significant risk domestically, as you point out, has actually mitigated somewhat.  What is really true about the risk is what’s going to happen in Europe.  Being more specific—that is the source of the significant risk, rather than being something else—would be clearer in some way about what we’re saying.  So that’s just a thought, maybe, for the future.  Or maybe instead of saying “including global financial,” we could say “particularly from global financial markets.”  But I don’t want to gum up the works.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser is offering a comment and suggestions for improvement in the language being used, rather than disagreeing with any specific point made by someone else.


Passage number 390.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think this is a really great question.  You really don’t want to point fingers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement or approval of the question and emphasizing the importance of not blaming or accusing others.


Passage number 391.
 MR. FISHER.  It’s implicit in what we’re saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating that something is implicit in what they are saying, indicating agreement or a shared understanding.


Passage number 392.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right, I guess.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "Right, I guess" is not expressing disagreement; it is simply an affirmation or acknowledgement of a previous statement. The mention of "President Pianalto" does not indicate any contradiction or disagreement either.


Passage number 393.
 MS. PIANALTO.  Just a question, though.  When you say we’re going to keep it the same as the last meeting, does that mean the word “remain” comes out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MS. PIANALTO is asking for clarification on what "remain" means in this context.


Passage number 394.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no passage provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 395.
  Replace the sentence that currently has the word “significant” in it with— MS. PIANALTO.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any sentence or statement that includes the word "significant." Therefore, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage to identify.


Passage number 396.
  The exact same statement from last— CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Exact same:  “Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a statement without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 397.
” MS. PIANALTO.  So “remain” comes out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Pianalto is simply clarifying the meaning of the word "remain."


Passage number 398.
 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, it’s exactly identical to the last—in September.  All right.  I think I’m getting agreement.  President Lockhart agrees.  Okay, good.  So we’re ready to take a vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing that there is agreement from multiple parties, including the President.


Passage number 399.
  MS. DANKER.  Okay.  This vote covers alternative B as in the handout, with the substitution of the “Moreover” sentence from the September statement:  “Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.”  And in paragraph 4, it retains “through mid-2013.”  It encompasses the associated directive as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating the proposal made by Ms. Danker without any indication of disagreement or contention.
