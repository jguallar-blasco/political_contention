{"2012FOMC20120125meeting.txt": [" MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think each of these presentations was really very interesting and timely, and there\u2019s a lot to think about here, particularly in the fact that they\u2019re not all consistent with each other.  Interestingly enough, in John\u2019s presentation, he points us to the possibility that tax, financial, and regulatory changes would be affecting the sensitivity of consumption to household wealth, and we see something that looks significant in that story in exhibit 7 of his presentation.  I have to say that as I looked at this, it sounded rather plausible, in fact, because we are having some difficulties explaining consumption growth recently when some of the underlying fundamentals like household wealth and real disposable income aren\u2019t supporting what we see.  The notion that there are these underlying regulatory issues going on sounded as if it was on the right path, and I was even tempted to add that there could be something else going on having to do with the general convenience factor in terms of  refinancing. It was the case that in the upturn, it was very easy to do a refi.  You could meet your mortgage broker on a Saturday in a parking lot and get it done within hours, and now there seem to be these inordinate obstacles. While John\u2019s story sounded quite plausible, we then get to the Boston presentation where we\u2019re told that the data showed that the standard relationship linking consumption to income and net worth stays as it has stayed historically, and that we\u2019re not seeing real statistically significant differences between owners and renters or between levered and nonlevered households.  Is there a way to reconcile these stories", " MR. ROSENGREN.  I want to follow up on Governor Raskin\u2019s question.  First, Dan used a definition of deleveraging.  I\u2019m just curious whether the definition that he used would be one that you would use, because the term is used differently in the literature.  I think, actually, in this case it does matter because some people use deleveraging to mean that it is policy-invariant\u2014that is, that we just have to wait for the passage of time for people to pay down the debt.  Using that definition, Dan draws the policy implication that it\u2019s not just a case of waiting for time to go on, but actually there may be things that policy could do to affect some of thefundamentals.  Second, he drew a little bit more of a policy context than the other presentations.  Would you agree that if a lot of it is explained by some of the fundamentals\u2014either disaggregated or not disaggregated\u2014that is something policy can do something about, or would you be more comfortable thinking of it as policy-invariant", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I would like to ask a couple of definitional questions that I am sure the economists around the table know but I don\u2019t.  The first question relates to the broader concept of saving and whether pensions are factored into the saving rate for society\u2014not the personal saving rate but the broader saving rate.  Then, how does  the anticipation of pension income or recent fears about Social Security being there or not being there factor into a consumer\u2019s thought process about wealth and net worth.  Any answer", " MR. BULLARD. That is changing the calculus to some degree", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would like to ask a quick methodological question, probably more to Dave and David.  The way that Mr. Cooper approached the question was to say, \u201cWe have a null hypothesis, which is the standard model, and we are going to test whether these bells and whistles are statistically significant in a classical hypothesis testing sense.\u201d Obviously, that is the way we usually do inference.  But suppose your objective is to minimize the mean squared error of your forecast, which is a little bit different.  Wouldn\u2019t the right approach be\u2014and I am asking this in terms of how you think about this\u2014to look at, on the one hand, the improvement in the in-sample forecast brought about by a more complex model penalized by the number of extra parameters and some information criteria.  And isn\u2019t that the way you should think about it.  Or do you instead use some kind of Occam\u2019s razor and stick with the smallest statistically valid model", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I respectfully would like to oppose the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive.  This is the position I and my immediate predecessor have taken every three years since 1997. These are the foundations for foreign exchange operations.  Foreign exchange operations\u2014interventions by central banks\u2014have become exceedingly rare in recent years, and for good reason, largely reflecting a sense of futility. If these operations are sterilized but not followed by supporting policy actions, then they are likely to fail to the detriment of the credibility of the central bank. If they are sterilized but followed by supporting operations, they are essentially compromising the independence of the central bank that has had to cooperate with the Treasury and its lead in these operations.  If they are not sterilized, we obviously could have bought U.S. Treasury securities instead, the difference being we are taking on foreign exchange risk to the detriment of the U.S. taxpayer. I believe that, given the history of the past decade or two with foreign exchange operations, we should consider approaching the Administration and seeking to take steps to wind down and dismantle this infrastructure and back away from this central banking practice.  In the meantime, I would like very respectfully use this triennial opportunity to register my hope for better policy by voting against the Foreign Exchange Authorization and Foreign Currency Directive", " MR. LACKER.  Yes", " MR. TARULLO.  I\u2019m having difficulty putting together your characterization of the statement, Mr. Chairman, with Governor Yellen\u2019s characterization of the statement.  You seem to indicate that it was basically setting down as best we could what we think we currently do within this Committee. I think Governor Yellen used the term \u201cmomentous\u201d and indicated a broad agenda that would follow from this statement, and I\u2019m wondering if you could comment in a little more detail on how you see the significance of this statement", " MR. TARULLO.  I should state for the record why I can\u2019t support the document, and because it comes down to the same thing I\u2019ve said before, I won\u2019t say it at great length. I think the document has made vagueness a virtue to an excessive degree, and there\u2019s a nontrivial risk that what comes out of this will actually be more of a cacophony than a clarification. I hope that doesn\u2019t happen, and it may not happen, but when I compare it with what I think the benefits of the statement will be, I don\u2019t think that a case has been made", " MR. SACK. We do think that the improvement at the short end of the sovereign debt markets has been largely attributable to the LTRO, and that it hasn\u2019t backstopped the entire yield curve as effectively.  You can actually raise questions about whether it will continue to backstop the short end of the curve as effectively as it has so far, given the reasons I cited in the briefing", " MR. REEVE. It\u2019s very indirect on what the banks then did with those funds.  We, in fact, do not really have any information on whether or not specific banks have increased their purchases, either of their own country\u2019s sovereign bonds or other euro-area bonds", " MR. REEVE.  If I could just add on to that, President Lockhart.  There is a very near-term risk that Greece could default as soon as March, if this deal doesn\u2019t go through and does not get near-universal participation on the part of the private creditors, which seems a rather high hurdle to achieve.  But even if that PSI deal does go through, the prospects for Greece still are full of tremendous risk over the next couple of years because they require another very substantial financing package from the European Union and presumably the IMF as well.  And yesterday the EU finance ministers said that they have no intention of increasing the size of that package that they had agreed on in October.  By our reckoning, Greece just doesn\u2019t quite get there with that amount of funds.  They are going to need more.  It has got to come from somewhere. So we have both very acute near-term stresses related to the Greek deal, but also some longer-term ones.  As a final point, there have been two exceptions to this improvement in market sentiment in Europe since December.  One is Greece, of course, and the other is Portugal.  And we have started to see some contagion from what is happening with the Greece PSI deal now starting to rattle investors who are holding Portuguese debt", "VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I agree with Brian.  This has been a positive development.  There are two negatives to note.  One, more and more of the borrowing of these banks is being done on a collateralized basis rather than uncollateralized basis. There is a question of all of the collateral being encumbered.  And, two, the banks are not dealing with one another; they are using the ECB as the intermediary.  So the private-market functioning is definitely not working", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tealbook\u2019s forecasts in general seem to be on the weak side relative both to the SEP projections as well as some private forecasters.  One aspect of the difference that struck me was business fixed investment, and I would like to get some clarification on it.  In our business outlook survey, the diffusion index for prospective capital expenditures actually doubled from 10 to 20 in January.  I would also note that in the SPF\u2014the Survey of Professional Forecasters\u2014the projections for business fixed investment in 2012 are in the neighborhood of 5.8 or 6 percent, while the staff\u2019s forecast is just barely over 2 percent.  And, indeed, the slowdown in business investment from 2011 to 2012 is actually knocking something like \u00bd percentage point off your forecasted GDP growth.  What I would like is some insight as to what is knocking you down from 7\u00bd percent, or whatever it is this year, to 2 percent in 2011. Is it add factors. Is it uncertainty.  What\u2019s feeding through in your projections for business fixed investment.  That seems to be a very important part of the forecast, so I would like some elaboration on it", " MR. FISHER.  I wanted to talk about Europe for just a second because in your presentation we talked about spreads, particularly on Spain and Italy, and we talked about the French banks.  For reasons that may be peculiar to me, I continue to worry about the French primary fiscal deficit and developments that might occur during the course of an election year.  Do we have concerns about France, or am I alone at this table", " MR. FISHER.  On the domestic side of the presentation, we referred to a faster snapback scenario.  On the European and the foreign side, the only alternative scenario is basically severe stress or it could be worse than we think.  There is that asymmetry.  Although I would like to hear of happier scenarios, my concern is that the big issue that could drop could be France, and I would urge us to continue to be mindful of the risk that that presents, particularly given what is happening politically in France", " MR. ENGEN.  Yes.  There is, as I noted, some supply-side damage involved in this scenario in terms of lower participation rates, a higher NAIRU, and lower potential, but not enough to get the kind of result that you were mentioning.  A Tealbook alternative that I didn\u2019t highlight here that may have had a little more of what you are talking about was the \u201cGreater Supply-Side Damage.\u201d It continued with the weak economy, but with greater supply-side damage that policymakers are slow to recognize.  In that different scenario, you then can get a boost in inflation", " MR. EVANS.  Yes", " MS. DUKE.  Mine is just a question.  The Tealbook forecast seems to be way outside of what the central tendency and even in a couple of cases the range, which seems unusual to me. Is this unusual, happening from time to time", " MR. PLOSSER. I have a two-hander because I want to follow up on the question I asked when we started this off. I wanted to come back to investment because I think investment plays an important role in this somewhat weaker forecast.  I didn\u2019t quite get an answer to the question.  Given where the private sector is on the forecast for business fixed investment, I\u2019m trying to figure out how much of your lower forecast is add factors or judgment calls relative to your investment equations.  Can you give me some sense about how those two things affect your forecast", " MR. ENGEN. Certainly there is some judgment in it in the following sense.  When we think about how much we\u2019ve marked down the forecast relative to last June, some of that is direct. As Trevor showed, there is the effect of the exchange value of the dollar on exports.  Some of that is indirect in the sense that we saw that measures of sentiment both for businesses and households went down.  They\u2019ve recovered some, but they\u2019re still pretty subdued.  Risk premiums have risen, and how much to attribute that to more transitory factors and how much is going to weigh on the forecast for a while is always a judgment.  How much of that was directly  related to Europe and how much was other factors as well as how much has weighed specifically on the investment is hard to parse exactly.  But even though businesses in the past couple of years have invested at a fast rate in order to build back up their capital stock to a certain degree, it is the case that we think some of this uncertainty and subdued sentiment going forward will weigh on it.  Some other surveys on capital expenditures that we have looked at, for example those that ask firms what their thinking is on this, indicate that uncertainty and the difficulty in planning long-term projects is part of it, but I can\u2019t give you an exact amount from our forecast", " MS. RASKIN.  To follow up on that, I wonder whether the other potential difference could arise from the idea that when we do projections, we\u2019re doing them under what we view to be appropriate monetary policy prescriptions.  There is the real possibility that what you guys are doing is making assumptions\u2014and in this case you put those assumptions in footnote 1\u2014but what the Committee is doing is, in essence, putting together projections and then saying to   ourselves, \u201cWell, what do we think appropriate monetary policy would be.\u201d  Some people then may have different views as to what appropriate monetary policy is, and that appropriate monetary policy is going to affect what your numbers look like.  To some extent, the projections that we are doing are projections that aren\u2019t necessarily ones that we think are going to occur, but ones that we think would occur under appropriate monetary policy", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would just raise a question about whether the \u201cfairly high bar\u201d is really quite the right characterization", " MR. LOCKHART.  Yes, I\u2019m maybe on the other side of the sentence from Vice Chairman Dudley in being slightly concerned about characterizing the majority being \u201cprepared.\u201d  Could we not say \u201cwould consider\u201d or something that signals that there would be deliberations around this in the future, and that minds are not closed, but not go so far as to say \u201cprepared", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the financial stability report was very good this time, not in terms of the outcomes and the concerns but in terms of the thoroughness and directness at which you address some of the issues.  That\u2019s really beginning to gel, and I really appreciate the effort in making that work. I liked the structure that you had in the very beginning, which began with a LISCC portfolio and then went to the broker\u2013dealers. What struck me as interesting is the LISCC organizations that you focused on all had large broker\u2013dealers.  As I looked at exhibit 11 that we were shown today in the briefing, it was   interesting to note that the market equity ratios of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were quite low, but in the previous CCAR exercise Goldman Sachs was viewed as relatively well capitalized, whereas Morgan Stanley was viewed as poorly capitalized.  Then I noted the observation that you made that hard-to-value assets are continuing to be financed by broker\u2013 dealers with short-term financing.  And the observation that Vice Chairman Dudley made that during a crisis, like what\u2019s happening in Europe, central banks tend to be the counterparty to a lot of organizations\u2014that they choose not to transact with each other, they tend to transact with the central banks.  As I put all of these strands together, along with what you put together for the broker\u2013dealers, the question that I came up with is:  Is the broker\u2013dealer model sustainable if we have a European crisis. I\u2019d start with asking whether you share my concern about the broker\u2013 dealer model being sustainable in a crisis.  What was not in the report was how we could mitigate those concerns. Noting the disparity in capital between Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, if your concern is that organizations aren\u2019t going to want to transact with them and they\u2019re highly dependent on overnight financing, then it would be something like altering the repo market, altering what kinds of investments they could make, altering their liability structure. If you could give me more of a sense of what you think would be right and what more we could do, because it is troubling to have such important organizations having credit default swaps as high as they are", " MR. LACKER.  Just a comment about Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s comments about the broker\u2013dealers. I appreciate the threat they pose and the extent to which they still rely on pretty short-term funding and are vulnerable to runs.  It strikes me that they have it within their capability to make themselves invulnerable to runs.  We may not have the actual legal capability, except by clearing a very high bar for 13(3) programs, to come to the rescue of their creditors. But I would question whether that is fully appreciated by their creditors, and I would question whether general market supposition is that our lawyers would find a creative way\u2014would they,   Scott.  I question whether market participants don\u2019t believe that we would find a way to provide support", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My forecast for GDP growth over the next two years has been essentially unchanged for the past several meetings, while the Tealbook\u2019s has come down.  So for the first time in quite a while, my forecast for GDP is modestly above the Tealbook\u2019s.  I am expecting GDP growth of about 2\u00bd percent this year and 3 percent in 2013.  In light of the December employment report, I did revise down the starting point for my unemployment rate projection, but I continue to expect the trajectory from that starting point to be one of only gradual decline.  At the end of 2014, I expect the unemployment rate to fall to 7\u00bc percent, still some distance from my estimate of the full employment rate, which I have at 6 percent. I continue to project an inflation rate that dips below 2 percent this year before gradually rising to 2 percent by the end of 2014.  With that overview, I will focus on some of the key issues underlying my outlook. All of the headwinds that many of us have noted for some time\u2014sluggish income growth, household deleveraging, the depressed housing market, financial strains in Europe\u2014 remain present to varying degrees. I still expect the economy to expand at a moderate pace despite these obstacles, but I find it hard to anticipate more than gradual progress.  Growth at this moderate pace will only slowly chip away at the unemployment rate. The back-to-back surprises in the unemployment rate in both November and December convinced me to take some of the decline on board in my projection, but I expect only slow progress going forward.  Before the recession, there were fewer than two job seekers for every open job.  Today, there are about four job seekers for every job opening.  I realize that the fundamental solution to the unemployment problem is to increase the number of job openings through more growth in the economy.  Nonetheless, the labor market appears to be adjusting more slowly than it did in the 1980s, which was the last time we had such a high unemployment rate.  In the 1980s, there was more churning in labor markets\u2014that is, more people were losing their jobs each month, but more people were also being hired each month.  While we don\u2019t necessarily want more layoffs, a more dynamic labor market in this sense produces more-rapid declines in unemployment, and our labor market has become less dynamic.  There are many factors that could be slowing the adjustment, but one that resonates with my business contacts is a slower matching of workers to available jobs, which is due to greater specialization needed in today\u2019s workplace.  Looking forward, most of my business contacts are expecting only a moderate number of new openings this year at a rate similar to last year.  Their expectations are consistent with my forecast for only a small decline in the unemployment rate. Today\u2019s unemployment rate also reflects an unusually stagnant labor force participation rate. While there are several potential explanations for today\u2019s low participation rate, I suspect that the participation rate will rise somewhat when labor demand picks up.  If so, the unemployment rate won\u2019t decline as quickly as the employment gains I expect to see would normally produce.  Under these circumstances, I think it will pay us to be cautious about projections of the unemployment rate several years out. Finally, my outlook for inflation has a decline in the near-term inflation rates, like the Tealbook, which reflects diminished commodity price pressures and continued subdued unit labor costs.  What makes my projection different from the Tealbook is that, in my forecast,inflation returns to 2 percent in 2014.  Compared with the Tealbook, my forecast for inflation puts somewhat less weight on unemployment and more weight on the gravitational pull of the longer-run trend rate of inflation of 2 percent.  To respond to President Fisher\u2019s inquiry about the median and trimmed mean CPI, on the near-term momentum in inflation, the Cleveland Fed median and trimmed mean CPI measures are still running near 2 percent over the past year, but they are showing mixed signals on underlying price trends in the past few months.  Looking at the details of the components, while there are some factors pulling core measures of inflation down, inflation in owners\u2019 equivalent rent, or OER, has steadily picked up.  Looking ahead, my staff is concerned that relative price shifts in housing could well put notable upward pressure on both the CPI and PCE this year and next.  OER, which is the largest component in the consumer\u2019s market basket, is being boosted by rising house rents even while home-purchase prices are actually still experiencing declines.  My staff estimates that this development could add about \u00bd percentage point to core CPI inflation.  This is not necessarily an increase in the true cost of housing or even overall inflation, but at a minimum, it could pose a communications challenge if measured inflation turns out to be obviously larger than what we are expecting. In assessing the risks to my outlook, although my business contacts were generally more positive on their outlooks than they were last month, I still see a predominance of risk factors for growth to the downside.  Similarly, without more underlying momentum in the labor market, the risks to unemployment seem to remain primarily to the upside.  I continue to see the risks to my inflation outlook as broadly balanced.  On the one hand, labor costs could come in weaker than I anticipate. On the other hand, a range of factors could prevent inflation from slowing as much as I anticipate.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  Several people raised concerns about the uncertainties in forecasting\u2014the RMSEs, root mean squared errors, associated with macroeconomic forecasts more than a few quarters out.  Another point made was a concern that, in the possible case of a self-fulfilling deflation, excessive use of policy would leave the central bank defenseless. On the other hand, one person pointed out that the economy is still in such a deep hole, with 6 million jobs less than the total number before the recession, that precise forecasts several years out are probably not necessary in order to see that additional support might be needed. Those are some observations from the go-round.  I\u2019d be happy to take any comments.  President Lacker", " MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Great.  Maybe sometime we could get that updated.  The big question has to do with \u201ccurrently anticipated.\u201d Paragraph B(3) has the condition that \u201cthis exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate\u201d as long as three conditions are met, and the sentence says that the Committee \u201ccurrently anticipates.\u201d So the word \u201ccurrently\u201d there suggests that at some future time, given future data, it could be the case that we no longer anticipate that interest rates will be exceptionally low under those three conditions.  And yet this forward guidance language is widely interpreted as a commitment by the Committee.  Today\u2019s Wall Street Journal said the Fed is committed to keeping interest rates low until at least mid-2013, and the same sort of \u201canticipates\u201d language is used with regard to the year\u2014\u201cCommittee expects\u201d\u2014right.  So I\u2019m just wondering.  You helped draft this language.  Do you view this as a commitment\u2014that we\u2019re saying that we\u2019re going to behave in a way that in some circumstances would be other than what we\u2019d want to do then, or is this merely a forecast of our future behavior", " MR. BULLARD.  Just on that point, I think there is an alternative interpretation of what happened in August, which is that there was tremendous market turmoil at that time.  There was the July 29 GDP report, which marked down the path of GDP through the recession.  A simple interpretation is that that\u2019s what pushed out market expectations of our time of tightening, and it didn\u2019t have much to do with whether we put \u201c2013\u201d in the language or not", " MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up on that.  This other hypothesis about August is that it conveyed our sense of future economic data as much as it conveyed information about our reaction function, and the same thing plagued interpreting March 2009, right. We don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re taking a signal from our read about the economy\u2014gloomier than they thought we\u2019d read the economy\u2014or it\u2019s the reaction function.  Do you have a way of teasing that out", "   MR. FISHER.  I think we have to be very careful about what we ascribe any market movement to; markets don\u2019t work that way.  I did read Bill\u2019s paper pretty carefully, and by the way, it\u2019s a thoughtful presentation. I really appreciate it.  You talk about the number of basis points.  Again, we\u2019re talking about one-hundredths of 1 percent.  Now, the shorter you are on the yield curve, one can assume that you wouldn\u2019t have a market impact.  I think President Bullard\u2019s point is very good, and President Lacker raised a very good point.  It\u2019s not clear what you can ascribe things to.  The question is the effect over the longer term.  I do believe we have suppressed the yield curve.  I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve done it alone.  It\u2019s happened in circumstances relative to what\u2019s happened elsewhere.  We\u2019ve seen additional oomph come from what\u2019s happened in Europe and our relative performance. But I think we have to be extremely careful. We might observe an event occurring, but ascribing it to what is said at this table, particularly with immediacy, may be reading too much into the data.  The data are helpful, but at least for what it\u2019s worth, again, as a former market operator, you never know what moves the market, and I think we take too much credit for immediate reaction. It\u2019s what we do on a sustained basis over time that is impactful, and I do believe we send signals to the market, clearly, that we expect to repress any tightening of policy for a substantial period.  That takes time to factor into the market.  The explanation as to why we do it is, as pointed out earlier, also very critical.  But I would urge the Committee, again, from one person\u2019s perspective, not to read too much into any immediate market reaction because on any one minute, any one second, any one day, the market reacts to a multiplicity of factors that none of us understand.  That\u2019s the way markets work.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. SACK. Purchasing $500 billion through January involves purchasing at a pace of just over $40 billion a month.  We\u2019re comfortable that we could do that program through January of 2013 without significant market consequences, but we couldn\u2019t do it for a number of years.  I think our best judgment is that sometime in the second year, we would become quite concerned about market functioning.  At that point, our purchases would be outrunning the amount of gross supply, so we\u2019d have to be extracting holdings from other holders.  And the deeper we have to go there, the more significant types of market disruptions we think can occur.  So I would say that if the Committee were intent on carrying that pace of purchases for a second year or beyond, we\u2019d want to entertain the possibility of shifting some of the purchases into Treasury securities, in addition to MBS", " MR. ROSENGREN.  I had a question, again, on the language in paragraph 3.  From alternative A at the last meeting to alternative B at this meeting, the language went through a substantial change.  I looked at this language and thought about what the effect of a disruption on oil prices in the Mideast would be\u2014where, over the short term, the inflation rate would go up quite substantially, and we\u2019d probably, over the two-year period, move further away from our unemployment objective.  When we go to a total measure but go to a short horizon, I wonder if various supply shocks become problematic with the threshold.  If it was a horizon further out or if we used a core concept or talked about underlying inflation\u2014there are a number of ways to change that language, either through the actual threshold or through actually what we\u2019re measuring or through the time period\u2014the language would be less susceptible to a supply shock.  Do you have that concern with this language.  And it gets to the Chairman\u2019s comment that this is not binding, that it is conditional language, and there are circumstances where this language wouldn\u2019t necessarily be something that generated us to tighten.  But just looking at the way the language was structured here, it seemed more susceptible than the language in alternative A at the last meeting", " MR. LOCKHART.  Yes", " MR. LACKER.  No, I don\u2019t think we should provide forward guidance at this meeting, either in the date form or in the contingent form, given what\u2019s in the SEP", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B today, but not surprisingly, like others, I would like to suggest some modifications to paragraph 3.  As I stressed in the economic go-round yesterday, I see the outlook as largely unchanged from our last meeting, with a modest economic expansion, a slow decline in the unemployment rate, and an inflation rate that stays near 2 percent.  My outlook supports continuing the maturity extension program and the reinvestment of mortgage-backed securities.  And revealing that the anticipated period of low rates now stretches into 2014 will be seen as another action to support our objective for full employment and stable prices.  While some might see an economic outlook like mine as reason to ease policy even further, I don\u2019t think any additional action is warranted today.  One reason is that my projection for falling inflation is just a projection, and further   declines may not materialize. I would like to see more inflation data supporting my projection.  Just as we were surprised by a rise in inflation last year, we could be surprised again this year or next.  For example, as I indicated in my comments yesterday, we could be surprised by the strength of OER over the next year or two.  If the inflation data come in weaker than my outlook, then that could be cause for further policy action.  A second reason that I prefer to wait on further policy accommodation is that further easing of policy would have some other costs by potentially causing inflation expectations to become unanchored or causing distortions in the Treasury and MBS markets and further complicating our exit strategy.  Based on these concerns, I favor holding off on more-aggressive action today. Regarding paragraph 3, my first preference is to let the Committee speak through our SEP and not put specific guidance in our statement.  We could phase in our communications and let the public digest the new information that we are providing through our policy strategy statement and our federal funds rate path projections in the SEP.  I don\u2019t think we need to rush to give specific guidance at this meeting. However, given the choices offered in alternative B, I prefer paragraph 3 over 3\u2032 because paragraph 3 better ties our forward guidance to economic conditions.  I am concerned with the rate of unemployment given in the paragraph.  I prefer an unemployment rate threshold of 7\u00bd percent.  I think that the natural rate of unemployment is closer to 6, as I mentioned yesterday, than the 5\u00bd percent that is used in the Tealbook\u2019s Taylor rule illustration of the rationale for 7 percent.  My higher natural rate warrants a threshold greater than 7 percent.  That said, I realize that the unemployment threshold needs to reflect the consensus projection of the SEP.  And as President Lacker mentioned, nine of us believe that the unemployment rate will be above 7 percent at the first federal funds rate liftoff.  I also think our experience in the 2003\u201305 period warrants some caution in extending our policy guidance too far into the future.  I recall very clearly that when I joined the FOMC in January of 2003, the optimal policy prescription from the FRB/US model called for significant rate reductions and an extended period of very low interest rates. Two years later, with inflation much higher than had been forecast, the optimal policy prescription called for an aggressive tightening of policy.  While the optimal policy prescriptions at each point in time were certainly valid and very informative, they proved to be subject to considerable change.  Based on this experience, I am inclined to be cautious in following the prescriptions of optimal policy calculations and to leave ourselves plenty of flexibility.  The language in paragraph 3 should clarify our reaction function, but I also want to make sure that it gives us enough flexibility for us to act based on all available information.  So I would be more comfortable with an unemployment rate of 7\u00bd percent and a date of mid-2014 for the liftoff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I support using thresholds, including a 7 percent unemployment rate, but feel we need to rework the language before it is included in the statement. I was somewhat surprised that B does not include additional quantitative easing, given the direction that our discussion was heading at the last meeting and the modest deterioration in the Tealbook forecast since then.  Given how far we are from both elements of the mandate both in the Tealbook and my own forecast, it is likely we will not be tightening until beyond 2014.  To shorten the time period of exceptionally low rates would require either much faster growth than is currently predicted or more accommodative monetary and/or fiscal policy in the near term. If GDP growth is as slow as the Tealbook envisions, and we continue to experience large misses on our mandates, at the next meeting we should consider beginning a large mortgage purchase program to reduce the adjustment period.  I support thresholds because they move us in the direction of a statement based on economic outcomes rather than a calendar date.  That said, I am concerned that the latest version of the statement reduced the inflation threshold from 2\u00bd to 2 percent.  We will be announcing a 2 percent goal today, which should clear up any confusion about our longer-term goal. I am not in favor of language that might be interpreted as making 2 percent sound like a ceiling.  Given our current and expected elevated unemployment rate, I believe we need the latitude to allow modest fluctuations of inflation around our longer-run goal, consistent with a quadratic loss function.In addition, I would not support removing the calendar date from the statement now, for reasons just described by President Lockhart.  The SEP, as of this meeting, reflects the expected funds rate path for all participants, with no distinction between voting and nonvoting members.  The markets will price in the interest rate path that reflects the expected vote of the Committee. I believe paragraph 3, with a calendar date, maintains this distinction and better reflects the consensus of the Committee than a scatter diagram of our individual interest rate paths.  Unless we change the SEP\u2014for example, by distinguishing voters from nonvoters or identifying the submissions\u2014the statement will remain our best way to communicate the consensus of the current voting members, which should include the likely date of liftoff and the economic conditions consistent with that liftoff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Because I\u2019m in my normal spot today, as opposed to President Fisher\u2019s spot, I\u2019m going to return to my normal incoherence.  So I apologize for that.  My hair is not on fire, but President Evans has got a match pretty close to it.   [Laughter] I\u2019m going to argue pretty strenuously on three points, and probably most strenuously on the first point.  I do not think that simply citing high unemployment and low inflation indicates that more should be done.  I\u2019ve argued this before, and I\u2019ll try to be more aggressive today on that point.  Then I\u2019ll discuss thresholds in the statement. I agree with many of the previous speakers that this is potentially quite confusing, both for the Committee and for financial markets.  And then I\u2019ll discuss calendar dates in the statement, which I have opposed in the past, and with the SEP now, it\u2019s not clear that a date in the forecast really means anything compared with the SEP. I\u2019ve already suggested a qualitative statement that lets the SEP do the talking, and I\u2019ll come to that at the end.  I have provided language in a memo. So let me start on the first point, and let me characterize what some of the argument around the table is.  This is a characterization\u2014I\u2019m overdoing it a little bit to make a point:  \u201cUnemployment is high.  Inflation is near target.  That can\u2019t possibly be the optimal policy, and therefore we must do more.\u201d  That\u2019s what I\u2019m hearing.  Let me make the point that if you look at the memo from Jean-Philippe Laforte, this is patently false. Let\u2019s consider the optimal policy exercises that are included in Laforte\u2019s memo.  This is in the Tealbook.  It\u2019s called \u201cUncertainty about the Tealbook Forecast and Alternative Simulations,\u201d and it\u2019s the standard memo that we always get. In particular, figure 2 in the memo shows how unemployment and inflation would evolve, according to the model, under fully optimal commitment strategy for the Committee.  So at least if you\u2019re willing to accept the model, you can\u2019t do better than that.  I\u2019ll come back to the assumptions under the model, but if you accept the model, you can\u2019t do better.  This is the full commitment solution.  In that scenario, unemployment would remain high, and inflation would be about 2.1 percent a year from now.  So you would get to 2013, and you\u2019d have inflation pretty close to target, and you\u2019d have pretty high unemployment.  If you accept the model and acceptthat the Committee was able to pursue the full commitment strategy, then these are the values that would obtain in 2013.  And yet, as I am interpreting the argument around the table, many of you would come back to the Committee and say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve got high unemployment, inflation is essentially at target, and that suggests more should be done.\u201d But that would be a wrong statement in my view, because the most that can be done is already being done, according to that exercise. In that circumstance, in fact, doing more would be making things worse by knocking the economy off the optimal path that\u2019s been calculated.  So the point is that simply citing high unemployment and low inflation is not enough to determine whether the Committee is doing as much as possible or not", " MR. EVANS.  Yes", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Because I view the outlook as largely unchanged over the last few meetings, I see no need for the additional accommodation through our balance sheet as described in alternative A or for the further easing through the date extension in alternative B. In addition, now that we are providing projections for the path of the federal funds rate, I, like others, think we should use this opportunity to revisit the nature of our forward guidance from the FOMC statement.  In particular, I would prefer that policy not be tied to the calendar or to specific thresholds for unemployment and inflation.  Rather, we should set policy as described in our consensus statement based on our longer-run goals, our medium-term outlook, and our assessment of the balance of risk, including risk to the financial system.  This strategy necessarily involves consideration of broader factors than suggested by language that emphasizes a date or threshold levels for unemployment and inflation.  With respect to the thresholds, I am particularly concerned about establishing a threshold for unemployment.  We simply do not have reliable estimates of the extent to which unemployment is structural versus cyclical today, much less several years into the future.  Finally, I continue to believe that our problems are not readily amenable to further monetary policy solutions without potential tradeoffs for low and stable inflation down the road.  I expect that the current softness in inflation will be short lived and that by the end of next year, we\u2019ll see readings closer to 2 percent. I also continue to worry that additional action intended to speed improvement in the housing and labor markets could have unintended consequences in the longer run.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m tempted, in going through my points, to just indicate by reference the colleague who already made the point.  And so I can do that with Governor Duke on communication and MBS, President Kocherlakota on collective versus individual, and a whole plethora of you on the issue of the conditionality in paragraph 3. I\u2019m not really happy with any of the alternatives that are before us. I should start by saying that I wish what we had had today, and even yesterday, was a discussion, as Betsy was just suggesting, of MBS\u2014or, for that matter, Treasury purchases\u2014with, before us, the kind of information that Narayana was suggesting in his questions to Brian earlier and an assessment of efficacy.  Is this really a case in which we need to understand ourselves as not having considerable optionality going forward, but having to make some choices that don\u2019t really have returns.  As Betsy was just suggesting, I wish we had been able to discuss the intersection between the action we take and nonconventional monetary policy transmission mechanisms\u2014 which is to say, how the mortgage market is or is not operating right now.  I\u2019m not saying necessarily that we\u2019d have been in a position to take action even if we had that discussion, but we didn\u2019t.  I hope we\u2019re going to be in a position to do that in the next meeting or two, and I guess it is incumbent on us, as well as the staff, to prepare for that. With respect to what we\u2019ve got in front of us, we put ourselves in a bit of a box here with the initial date.  It was not only predictable, it was predicted\u2014that we were going to create this issue for ourselves later on as to what we do about that.  So I guess since Narayana gave up,there\u2019s not much point in my agreeing with him, but I agree with him anyway on the use of quarters and that the time to do it, of course, would be when you have to make a change anyway.  But I guess we\u2019re not doing that.  We do need to do something, it seems to me. I think we are implicitly tightening right now, although since the markets expect a change, we\u2019re probably not seeing that in reality.  But if we go very much longer without making a change, it will be a tightening.  So I would favor 3\u2032 in alternative B as the best of a not particularly appealing set of options right now. I did want to say one more word on the projections issue.  Narayana and Dennis made the points, I thought, very well, but I did want to add the fact that for other central banks that use projections, and where projections become at least a complementary form of forward guidance, there is a collective process.  And we have no collective process at all here.  And so Dennis\u2019s point about that, which Narayana echoed, is that a collective decision is very important ultimately.  However, even in the projections, we don\u2019t have the kind of discussion that makes people try to align themselves around one or two or, I guess in some cases, three different options.  Instead, we have a scatter point analysis now, which provides some information, but I don\u2019t know how useful it is as a matter of understanding where the Committee may go in the future. Finally, on communication\u2014again, Betsy made the point, but I would just say I think the aim here is effective communication, not maximum information.  And I do fear right now that we are drifting toward this notion that somehow more information of whatever sort is always better.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a question of transparency or not, but it\u2019s the same phenomenon that we all experience with the Internet. Does one feel better informed because one has a massive amount of information available to you, which is unfiltered, and no one has tried to put it together and distill it and figure out what, in some sense, is actually going on.  And I fear we\u2019re drifting a bit in that direction.  That\u2019s why I would have, at the very least, delayed a consensus statement.  And I must say, the discussion today makes me wonder about the concept of consensus behind that statement that you all voted on yesterday.  But I would have at least delayed it so that there\u2019s an ability to gauge the reaction to the SEP, to make adjustments, perhaps\u2014again, in line with questions Narayana has been asking about it\u2014over time, and then, in a step-by-step fashion, to try to provide additional information. I\u2019m going to end with a plea, which I know is a plea that will be made in vain, that people not take the opportunity of the vague language of the consensus statement to immediately go out and offer their own interpretations of what it means, because this is what I fear has happened all along, and I\u2019ve already seen some of it\u2014the speeches that have been given even before the statement was adopted. I was asked by someone\u2014and I couldn\u2019t answer because it\u2019s something within the FOMC\u2014\u201cYou guys have multiple statements that you\u2019re considering right now.\u201d And that\u2019s what the three different speeches reflected\u2014three different statements. I do fear that that is just going to complicate the communication efforts even further.  So again, with a plea that I know is in vain, it would be good if we could let the Chairman initially try to provide some elaboration and maybe let markets and analysts and others try to figure out what it all means. And maybe, if we\u2019re lucky, they will come to the conclusion that this does illuminate somewhat what we\u2019re doing.  But if we all go out and say what we think, it\u2019s going to sound like the conditionality discussion here, and that does not suggest there\u2019s any consensus whatsoever.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Yes", " MR. TARULLO.  Yes", " MR. FISHER.  So wait\u2014Bill, your point is, don\u2019t change it, leave it as it was", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  And the last sentence, the bracketed language", " MR. LOCKHART. I\u2019d eliminate it"], "2012FOMC20120313meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Thank you.  Brian, in your discussion of exhibit 1, you said that survey participants understand that our forward guidance is not an absolute commitment.  Complete absolute commitment suggests a polar case of an entirely noncontingent exit date and one that represents a commitment; at the other extreme is something that\u2019s merely a forecast.  And it seems as though there would be something in between.  So do they think it\u2019s something of a commitment", "MR. SACK.  Could I make a few comments about the reserve draining part of your question. I think it is important to realize that we face a considerable amount of uncertainty about how markets will behave as we drain and what the right strategy should be.  And that uncertainty comes because we\u2019ve never observed how markets act with our ability to pay interest on reserves, except for when we\u2019ve been pinned against the zero bound.  So we don\u2019t know the strength of that magnet for other short-term interest rates, and we\u2019ve never used these tools in large size before.  And not only that\u2014I would add to the list that there are many regulatory reform efforts under way that could substantially affect the structure and functioning of money markets.  So I agree that we face many areas of uncertainty, and I think in some sense, those uncertainties are going to require us to learn along the way and to figure this out.  That\u2019s not to say that we shouldn\u2019t do as much advance planning as possible, but some of this is going to be inherently unpredictable in terms of how markets react, and we\u2019ll have to make adjustments", " MR. BULLARD.  So you\u2019d say, to the extent that energy price increases are very persistent or permanent, that would feed through", " WILLIAMS.  Yes, I have a question on exhibit 1, panel 5\u2014on the term premium on the 10-year Treasury.  Brian, I think you said that currently, your staff estimate is that the LSAPs are pushing down the term premium on the 10-year Treasury by 60 basis points.  So my question, then, is, given our baseline scenario for what our balance sheet is going to look like over the next several years, with exit at, say, late 2014 for the funds rate, how do you see the path for this effect of the LSAPs over the next couple of years.  Or specifically, what do you think the effect of the LSAPs will be on the 10-year Treasury yield, say, at the end of 2014", " MR. KAMIN. We have indeed done some analysis on that.  And I should say that there are some different crosscurrents in terms of the effects that make it difficult to be very certain about these effects.  On the one hand, the United States\u2019 economy is more oil-dependent than is Europe\u2019s in terms of efficiency of oil use.  It\u2019s also true that the United States has lower specific taxes on oil use, so a given increment to oil prices results in a smaller percentage increase in retail gasoline prices in Europe than in the United States.  On the other hand, the United States has less import dependence than Europe.  Europe imports just about all of its oil, while in the U.S., it\u2019s not a full 100 percent.  So these factors offset each other. I guess the analysis that we\u2019ve done to date suggests that the U.S. economy is probably more vulnerable to an oil price shock than the advanced foreign economies, in general.  And that likely applies to Europe, too.  We\u2019ll probably need to do more analysis on that", " MR. EVANS.  Could I ask what this looked like when the unemployment rate fell from, say, 5\u00bc down to 4.4 percent during those periods of relatively strong expansion.  Wouldn\u2019t the relationship hold up. It\u2019s not in the data that you\u2019re looking at, but it\u2019s a regularity", "  MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, the same theme but going in a little different direction. I may not ask this question quite right, so maybe you\u2019ll interpret it correctly and in a sensible way.  You posed the issue about, well, we\u2019ve gotten stronger employment than we thought but continued weak growth\u2014the issue we\u2019ve been talking about.  So over the last several months\u2014actually, most of the fall\u2014we kept having revisions up in employment data.  They come out with an initial number, and there\u2019s been this string of upward revisions.  When the GDP data come out, we see an upward revision in both income and unit labor costs.  We continue to get the pretty strong employment numbers into the first of the year.  I guess there will be another revision of GDP coming up later this month for the fourth quarter.  I understand the risks that you point out.  What I\u2019m trying to ask is, at what point in your thinking about how the economy is evolving do you begin to shift your view about the forecast into a somewhat more positive framework. Is it going to take until we get final revisions of GDP to convince you that maybe growth was underestimated.  How much longer would you need of 250,000 jobs being created every month. I\u2019m trying to understand where the staff\u2019s tipping point is to begin to take a stronger path on board in your forecast, because right now, you seem to be inching it up, but with some reluctance.  So at what point, and how do you think about taking it on board more", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. Yes", " MR. WASCHER.  It does enter in.  I think the problem is that taking much signal from inflation is difficult because the Phillips curve that we use is so flat", " MR. LACKER.  I\u2019d like to follow up on this, if I could, Mr. Chairman.  So despite the evolution you just described, you still are forecasting inflation to return to 1\u00bd pretty soon and stay there a while.  From this box, this analysis on pages 30 and 31, I take it that\u2019s because the size of the gap trumps the stability of expectations still.  Is that correct", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes", " MR. KAMIN.  We\u2019ve heard complaints from Mexican officials about that, too", "   MR. FISHER.  Yes.  It\u2019s not just from Mexico, though, if you talk to the shippers, for example, which I find interesting. And then, lastly, I think we should probably drill further down in terms of the real effects outside the financial contagion aspect because it\u2019s still not clear to me how much, in terms of trade of goods and services, is with the PIIGS.  Our numbers show it\u2019s a very small amount.  And of course, you have to take into account Rotterdam as a distribution point.  But mainly U.S. exports to Europe, which are 13 percent or so of our exports or whatever the number may be\u2014 roughly five-sixths of that goes to the core countries and not to the peripherals.  So I would like to spend some more time on those data.  I don\u2019t wish to discuss it now, but I think we still have an amorphous concern.  You hear less about it with the CEOs and business operators.  It\u2019s very ill defined.  And I don\u2019t want to hang too much of my hat on the downside risk of Europe.  It\u2019s a risk, but we can\u2019t quite put our fingers on exactly what that risk is.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. While the improved economic data are encouraging, I\u2019m reluctant to extrapolate this improvement all the way through the forecast horizon.  I have bumped up my GDP growth projection to 2.8 percent for this year, but my projections for 2013 and 2014 are largely unchanged at around 3 percent. Given the January and February employment reports, I edged down my unemployment rate path, and the revisions to PCE prices and rising gasoline prices have led me to shift up my inflation projection a little.While the incoming data have been encouraging, my business contacts remain cautious about the trajectory for growth.  Here\u2019s how I would sum up their comments.  Earlier in the recovery, they expected things to get better quickly because, from past experience, the economy usually bounces back after a recession.  As this recovery has progressed, they learned not to take the recovery process for granted.  My contacts tell me that only now, in 2012, does a sustainable expansion seem to be taking hold.  Their orders are growing, and they are finally confident enough to resume some hiring.  Still, some have commented that despite the general improvement in business conditions, their customers are still cautious.  Overall, my business contacts have become more confident that the economy is on a stable expansion path, but they don\u2019t anticipate vigorous growth and they remain cautious.  So while the strengthening of incoming data invites some optimism, my projection for the economy is still considerably less robust than it was last year at this time, when we were all forecasting much stronger growth for this year.  On a more hopeful note, I am encouraged that my contacts suggest that economic growth is on firmer footing this time around, even if they expect the trajectory to be lower. The labor market is hinting at the potential for greater resilience in the economy.  Indeed, the employment gains of the last few months have lowered my unemployment rate projection by almost \u00bd percentage point this year and next, but again, compared with our projections last spring, unemployment still remains high. For some time, I have also been concerned that the unemployment rate could decline more slowly than I had projected, in light of the larger numbers of people out of the labor force who might reenter the labor force as the economy recovers.  To assess this concern, my staff conducted some analysis, including labor force participation and its trend in a standard vector autoregression forecasting model. The interesting result was that, based on past recovery patterns, better GDP growth would likely foster a pickup in labor forceparticipation, but that the more rapid rate of GDP growth would be sufficient to keep the unemployment rate declining gradually. That finding would be an attractive possibility, and it helped address my concern about the unemployment rate path, but unfortunately I don\u2019t have this faster GDP growth in my baseline forecast. On my outlook for inflation, the near-term momentum in price data led me to edge up my near-term projection.  Importantly, following upward revisions to the fourth-quarter data and a 2 percent reading for January, the current year-over-year core PCE inflation rate stands at 1.9 percent. The trimmed mean CPI-based inflation measures have also been drifting up.  Unlike my economic growth projections, when compared with March of last year, I\u2019m expecting slightly higher inflation rates throughout the forecast horizon.  For example, last March, I had expected 2012 core PCE inflation of roughly 1.3 percent, but now I\u2019m projecting 1.8 percent for this year, very close to our stated objective.  As for the recent jump in oil and gasoline prices, so far I\u2019ve seen very little evidence of a repeat of the last big spike that we saw in energy prices in 2008.  Unlike during that period of time, other commodity prices have been near flat, and household energy prices have also been flat.  They have been influenced by an ample supply of natural gas and coal, as President Fisher reported, and they are actually down 1.2 percent over the last six months.  Given that household energy and motor fuel have almost equal weights in the consumer\u2019s market basket, the softness in household energy prices should significantly mitigate the pressures from gasoline prices.  Despite the recent pickup in the inflation rate, financial markets don\u2019t seem to expect rising inflation.  Financial market inflation expectations are well below the levels of a year ago. In assessing the risks to my outlook, I still see risk factors for economic growth being primarily to the downside, while risks to the unemployment rate remain primarily to the upside. On my inflation outlook, I continue to see the risks as broadly balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman, you spoke about your tipping point for consumption and other components of spending as being growth rates rising notably above trend.  So I wondered if you\u2019d comment on the prospect of growth continuing at about trend and a gradual but eventual decline in the unemployment rate. I have in mind here this broader difference of views around   this table\u2014those who view the trend line that lies pretty close to where we were in 2006 and 2007 and extrapolate out from this as the norm we\u2019re returning to, and those who think that we suffered a one-time downward level shock of some sort and that we ought to only expect growth at trend rates from here", " MR. ENGLISH.  We thought in C, if your point was to begin removing policy accommodation, then you\u2019d want that last sentence to be a little bit more balanced between your objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The language at the end of paragraph 4 last time and in alternative B this time suggests that the adjustment would be to promote a stronger economic recovery.  So it would suggest that there maybe was a little concern about the pace of the economic recovery as opposed to inflation", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I indicated in our earlier go-round, a lot of us have said, and you summarized very well, that the outlook for real growth has improved a notch since our last meeting.  My reading of the real data, similar to the staff, is that our forward momentum has picked up a notch, and we face less by way of downside risks than before.  Core inflation seems quite close to 2 percent now, and that\u2019s my expectation going forward\u2014that it\u2019s going to hover around 2 percent in the near term. I, like the Tealbook, brought forward my estimate of the time period at which it\u2019s most likely that our first rate increase will occur.  As I said at the last meeting, it was in the latter half of 2013.  Now I think middle of 2013 would characterize where I am on that dimension. In thinking about the statement, I want to buttress the recommendation of President Williams.  I think it\u2019s useful to compare forward guidance language, and how we think about setting that at every meeting, with interest rate setting.  In particular, it\u2019s useful to really think about this well-documented characteristic that our policy-setting displayed away from the zero bound, which is interest rate smoothing.  This is the idea that our interest rate changes tend to be in a sequence in the same direction, they tend to be persistent, and they\u2019re seldom reversed.  So we strive to avoid raising rates and then at the next meeting cutting them, or cutting rates and then at the next meeting raising them.  Now, this has an obvious advantage to us in that if we behave that way over time, then any given interest rate change conveys much more information relevant to the yield curve.  The yield curve moves more, because a given interest rate change conveys much more information about future settings of the short-term rate. In contrast, you could picture us at every meeting ignoring the current setting for the funds rate and, with a blank sheet of paper, deciding on our optimal rate\u2014deciding anew, as if we had no history before us of what we\u2019ve said.  And we\u2019d likely get fed funds rate changes that were more frequent and variable, but they would carry much less information about future funds rate changes.  So this property of interest rates is something we\u2019ve done for a long time\u2014it\u2019s been well documented.  Now, the point I want to make is that this represents a form of commitment in the sense that we set interest rates taking into account what we did before. If we\u2019ve cut interest rates, we\u2019re not going to reverse them at the next meeting.  We\u2019re going to wait a few meetings to see a trend and then reverse them if we\u2019re going to do that. Now, I started thinking about this because I was considering my decision at this meeting.  And I was thinking, all right, in the usual interest rate setting, if you dissent against a cut in the funds rate, the next meeting you might not want to dissent in favor of raising rates again to undo the cut that the Committee voted at the previous meeting. And a good rationale for that would be to maintain the commitment of the Committee to smoothing interest rates so that in the future, when we do cut interest rates, they have the effect that\u2019s consistent with this.  So that suggests something about this meeting, but first, let\u2019s think about forward guidance.  We\u2019ve been really clear that it\u2019s not a commitment. I think the Chairman has been really clear that it\u2019s not a commitment.  Now, I heard something slightly different from the Vice Chairman, and I\u2019m interested in understanding whether your views are compatible with what the Chairman has said about this not representing a commitment, but instead representing a forecast.  But if we go smoothing forward guidance, if we go holding up changes in forward guidance, not bringing forward the date because we just increased it at the last meeting, over time there\u2019s going to be, meeting to meeting, a little gap opening up between what we really think and what\u2019s in the statement, and that\u2019s going to make it look like a commitment. It\u2019s going to potentially confuse the public.  It\u2019s going to give an inertia to the forward guidance language that makes it more commitment-like and less like truly our forecast at that meeting. I don\u2019t think this is a curiosity.  I think that this is relevant to policy-setting. If we keep it frozen at one date, compared with the extent to which forecasts fluctuate on a six- or eight-week basis, it\u2019s going to look like a promise that we change only every now and then, and that\u2019ll be a mistake. I say this, and as you know, I argued against actually including this forward guidance at the last meeting, and this is one of the pitfalls that I think we\u2019re going to have to wrestle with, having gone down this path.  And putting it in the SEP, of course, would have made it a forward guidance communication we change only every two meetings rather than one meeting\u2014and so, to some extent, would obviate some of this issue. As for how I vote at this meeting, I don\u2019t see a value for smoothing forward guidance.  So to my mind, the logical way for me to vote is whether I think economic conditions are going to warrant exceptionally low interest rates through the date in the statement, and I don\u2019t agree with that.  So I\u2019m going to dissent on that.  I have a couple of editing suggestions for the statement.  I\u2019ll just read them", "  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  So that\u2019s my dissent.  I don\u2019t know your views on these suggestions, but I might have some more success. At the last meeting, we officially adopted an inflation objective of 2 percent, and yet in our statement, we use this complicated circumlocution\u2014what is it.\u2014\u201cthe rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.\u201d  It\u2019s like 10 words.  We could just say \u201c2 percent,\u201d right. We\u2019re talking about, \u201c . . . the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below . . . \u201d This is the last sentence in paragraph 2.  Why don\u2019t we just say \u201c2 percent\u201d. Or we could phase out this language by putting, after the word \u201cbelow,\u201d \u201c2 percent,\u201d a comma, and then the circumlocution\u2014and then at the next meeting, delete the circumlocution.  And then there\u2019s a similar issue in the first sentence in paragraph 3.  The statement says \u201chelp ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate.\u201d  We could just say \u201cis at 2 percent.\u201d  That would be clear.  This way, people wouldn\u2019t have to go on the Internet to find out what rate we\u2019re talking about there. So that\u2019s one set of changes.  A second editing suggestion I\u2019d like to make is that we drop the word \u201cdual.\u201d  This occurs three places in this statement. It occurs nowhere in our statement of our longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.  There, we\u2019re careful to mention all three of our statutory mandates.  \u201cStatutory mandate\u201d would be a clearer phrase, a more accurate phrase, one more consistent with the text of the Federal Reserve Act.  So I\u2019d suggest that maybe even if we don\u2019t reduce them all, maybe we could phase them out one at a time, one a meeting. And then the word \u201csignificant\u201d in front of \u201cdownside risks,\u201d I think, got a little bit of discussion last time, and we seem on the edge of whether we have it in or out.  It might be useful to take the temperature of the Committee on whether those downside risks are still significant in global financial markets.  That\u2019s in the third sentence in paragraph 2.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Jeff, I don\u2019t quite understand your rationale on the forward guidance, for the following reason. I understand completely why you\u2019re reluctant to engage in forward guidance and your concern that on the spectrum between expectation and projection versus promise, people will read it too far toward the promise side. But if you stipulate that we\u2019ve done what we\u2019ve done, as I was listening to your rationale for not dissenting from last time\u2019s interest rate moves, for example\u2014because you wanted the impact of action to be greater when it was taken by the Committee, you didn\u2019t want so much fluctuation, you wanted more communication\u2014I don\u2019t quite understand why the same rationale doesn\u2019t apply here, that is, why you would distinguish on these grounds between a classic federal funds rate move and putting in guidance with a particular date. It seems to me that the nature of the \u201ccommitment\u201d is pretty close", " MR. TARULLO.  I\u2019m sorry. I won\u2019t belabor this, but that\u2019s what I don\u2019t quite understand. I guess you\u2019re imputing a commitment to the cut in interest rate that is not incorporated into the text of the FOMC statement in any way, shape, or form, right", " MR. LACKER.  To some extent", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would just respond to President Evans and say I don\u2019t see any models that tell me that running higher inflation is going to help us.  I don\u2019t see any simulations that say, let\u2019s go to 4 percent inflation and that\u2019s the optimal policy.  Have I got the wrong model.  I don\u2019t see any.  There are none.  Here, I\u2019m looking at them right here. They\u2019ve all got below 2 percent", " MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As an independent-thinking independent central banker, my preference would be for alternative C, but I don\u2019t think we should make significant changes at this juncture.  I\u2019m in favor of alternative B. I have heard several things at this table that have affected my thinking.  The first was your comment\u2014which I agree with, by the way\u2014on the broader commodity indexes; the second is what I would call the Lutheran advantage of Minnesota; and the third is the Yellen real estate paradox.  Taking all of those into account, the only things I would recommend changing are a couple.  The statement \u201cthe housing sector remains depressed\u201d is a little bit harsh. If I were to change the language there, I would just say, \u201cIndicators of conditions in the housing sector have improved, but amid uncertainty as to when housing prices will stabilize.\u201d Listening to Governor Duke, setting aside Governor Yellen\u2019s personal decision, I think saying that \u201cthe housing sector remains depressed\u201d is a little bit too strong and contrary to the data that we\u2019re seeing and have heard around the table.As to the point of \u201csignificant downside risks,\u201d we\u2019re saying that global financial markets have \u201ceased somewhat.\u201d  \u201cContinue to pose downside risks to the economic outlook,\u201d I think, is appropriate. \u201cSignificant\u201d erases the \u201chaving eased somewhat\u201d; I would eliminate it. As to President Lacker\u2019s comments, I think we should, at the very end of that sentence\u2014I wouldn\u2019t change the beginning of the sentence because we do have a statutory mandate, we do foster both\u2014since we did make a formal statement as to our long-term strategy, why not update it and say that \u201csubsequently inflation will run at or below the long-term target of 2 percent\u201d or \u201cour stated long-term target of 2 percent\u201d. With regard to the \u201cat least through late 2014,\u201d I was against it in the beginning.  We\u2019ll talk about that in the next session.  As to President Williams\u2019s suggestion, I don\u2019t think \u201cuntil\u201d does it.  If I were to argue that point now, the difficult part I have is with \u201cat least.\u201d  So I wouldn\u2019t fiddle with that at this moment. Let\u2019s defer that to the second discussion.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  In broad terms, my outlook is largely unchanged from our last meeting, so I don\u2019t think a change to the current policy stance is warranted.  While some combination of further improvement in the pace of recovery and a pickup in underlying inflation could warrant pulling forward the expected date of policy firming, I don\u2019t think now is the time to make that adjustment. I don\u2019t think the changes in the outlook since our last meeting have been material, and before we adjust the forward guidance, I would prefer to wait for more information on the pace of the recovery and inflation trends.  I would also prefer to avoid making a practice of moving that date guidance at each meeting, because to do so would imply more certainty about the outlook than we really have.  Today, with considerable risks still surrounding the recovery, it\u2019s hard to rule out the possibility of a significant slowing in the pace of the recovery. My final reason for holding off on adjusting the forward guidance is that it would be difficult to explain the change without a new SEP.  While I don\u2019t see having a fresh SEP as a necessary condition for changing the forward guidance, I think the bar to making an adjustment without a new SEP should be fairly high.  In my view, the outlook hasn\u2019t changed enough since our last meeting to meet that bar.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER. Governor Duke, the approach you suggest of waiting to change the forward guidance language until we\u2019re more confident that we\u2019re going to engage in a sequence of moves, or all of the next moves are going to be in the same direction, would you view that as likely to imply that, at times, we have guidance in the statement that\u2019s at variance with our expectation. Wouldn\u2019t that imply that sometimes our expectation would be second quarter, but not enough evidence has accumulated to move off of \u201clate 2014\u201d. Is that consistent with the approach you\u2019re advocating", "  So would that not risk suggesting to the public\u2014 MR. LACKER.  This is what\u2019s wrong with using forward guidance", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  Thank you for the useful discussion.  Let me just say a word about the broad issue.  I favor alternative B, without a change to the rate guidance, for a couple of reasons.  First, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s been a very large, discrete change since our last meeting.  Yes, things are more positive, but we still don\u2019t have evidence that the recovery is self-sustaining, and the absolute level of conditions remains quite unsatisfactory.  So I think there\u2019s a case, just on the fundamentals here, to take more time to see where the economy is going.  I would raise the related point that if we were to change the date, we don\u2019t know what date to change it to at this point.  We don\u2019t have the guidance of an SEP.  And while we\u2019ve heard some people express views about their changes, we would like to know what the mode is and where the overall change in views is.  So that\u2019s one problem.  A second problem is that, as I hope the second round will help clarify, we need to understand better what this guidance actually means\u2014President Lacker has been at the forefront here of raising this question.  And I think we need to do a better job, perhaps in today\u2019s discussion and in subsequent discussions, of explaining what it means.  Now, it could be, for example, that we do want to include some element of commitment along the lines of the memo on the zero lower bound, where making up for the zero lower bound entails promising to hold rates lower for  longer.  Maybe that\u2019s an outcome we would come to.  I\u2019m not saying we will, but my concern is that we haven\u2019t had the discussion yet. So it\u2019s not clear to me that the outlook has changed radically, and I\u2019m not quite sure how we would go about deciding on where to adjust the date if we were adjusting it today.  But more important, we have very intentionally set up an extra go-round today to really try to get a deeper understanding of how we should be going forward in terms of our communication.  There are some very important issues.  The goal here is to make progress before the next two meetings\u2014 both of which happen to be meetings that are two days and have a press conference, and that are therefore much more conducive to making a more subtle determination, a more considered determination, and one that we can explain to the public.  Again, for all those reasons, I think it would be premature to make that change today. With respect to language, let me make a few comments here. I appreciate what President Williams is trying to do with the \u201cuntil,\u201d but that\u2019s a little too subtle for me, I\u2019m afraid.  And I think for today, I would prefer to keep the critical words unchanged.  There were some questions about \u201cdual mandate\u201d and \u201c2 percent.\u201d I think these are worth discussing in a more considered way.  The particular issue, of course, is the following:  Our policy statement tried very hard to maintain the symmetry of employment and inflation objectives. The word \u201cdual\u201d emphasizes the twoness of those objectives.  Now, I don\u2019t think, actually, that striking \u201cdual\u201d would make a big difference, but it\u2019s something we ought to discuss. Putting in the \u201c2 percent\u201d for inflation is very attractive, and I think we should discuss it.  But the symmetry would suggest in that case, looking at what we did in our statement, that we put in the estimate of the NAIRU in the earlier sentence where we say \u201canticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.\u201d  Well, what are thoselevels. So one could put numbers in both sides.  I think, again, that\u2019s a question to be discussed.  These are critical issues that we need to come back to. The other things that were raised were mostly about language, and I\u2019m happy to talk about them.  In particular, what do we have", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Strike the word \u201csignificant", "  We think that the December and January starts are elevated by the weather, and we expect that to\u2014 MR. FISHER.  Well, let\u2019s wait and see if the weather weathers out", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I\u2019m not sure that everyone agrees with you on that", "\u201d CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Look at the second sentence of paragraph 2: \u201cAnticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually towards\u201d circumlocution", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think it\u2019s obvious already that there are a lot of moving parts here, and the questions and the subquestions reflect that.  So to be selective today, I\u2019d like to make four points in overview, and then I\u2019ll elaborate further on some of them and comment on the specifics of the language that was put in the appendix.  The four points are, first, I think we have a lack of clear consensus regarding the role of the SEP; second, I believe, as has already been stated by one or more, that it\u2019s desirable to get away from date guidance; third, there are complications introduced by elevating the role of the SEP, which I think we already have in policy communications, given that the current practice is that we publish them only four times a year and we have eight meetings a year; and, fourth, it\u2019s desirable that the specifics of any economic conditionality be durable.  So let me make a few more points\u2014not exhaustive\u2014 partly in elaboration of those and some other points. As I said, I think there\u2019s a lack of consensus regarding the role of the SEP practice, and maybe it would be good for the group to step back and have a discussion on this before implementing any further changes.  My own view is that the SEP provides background color and texture that supplement the postmeeting statement and the minutes.  The SEP provides a broad sense of how the FOMC participants as a group are connecting the dots between desired economic outcomes and policy.  If we\u2019re trying to convey in general terms how future Committees might react to economic conditions, one could argue that using the SEP is a more inclusive way of doing that. But at the same time, I would argue that the SEP should not substitute for actionable, consensus-based votes of the Committee. I am a little reluctant to godown the road of providing information in the SEP at an individual level.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy to encourage the public or Fed watchers to indulge in what I call FOMC Kremlinology. I do think an idea worth considering, if we want to add a bit more information to get closer to the constitution of the current Committee, would be to show who are permanent members and who are revolving members, but not necessarily just focus on the current Committee.  After all, in any given calendar year, the value of distinguishing between voters and nonvoters degrades as you get closer to year-end. Now, on the specific question related to the statement, as I expressed in the policy round, I see forward guidance in terms of a calendar date as likely to be a problem going forward, and at a minimum, I would suggest downplaying the date of liftoff by stating the economic conditionality first and putting focus on the conditionality language if we hold to that language.  I do accept that using the statement to provide more information on the Committee\u2019s reaction function and policy conditionality could be helpful and could deliver some incremental stimulus, and I would strongly prefer that any language that is added to accomplish this observe the principle of policy decisions being outlook based or forecast based. I\u2019d also favor words that add some flexibility to deal with the notional reliance on a single indicator for mandate consistency\u2014for example, the unemployment rate. So, following from those points, I actually prefer alternative 3.1 in the appendix.  I think it qualifies the quantitative thresholds with the word \u201cnearing\u201d that suggests a forecast-based discipline.  The phrase \u201cmedium-term inflation outlook\u201d does this as well.  A focus on the unemployment rate could be problematic, as I\u2019ve already suggested, in that changing labor force participation could keep the unemployment rate elevated even while there is robust employment growth.  So the phrase \u201cincluding the pace of improvement in labor market conditions\u201d helps with this problem.  I like 3.1 because it\u2019s simple and concise.  To me, 3.2 adds complexity, although I would say the use of a reference to inflation expectations is helpful.  It is, in my mind, covered by the expression \u201cmedium-term inflation outlook\u201d in 3.1.  Alternative 3.3 strikes me as a restatement of the balanced-approach policy principle, and 3.4 lengthens the statement and adds more complexity than I think is advisable. Regarding the quantitative thresholds themselves, the levels should be chosen with the intent that they be durable and therefore constrain to some degree next year\u2019s and the following year\u2019s voting Committee.  So I think the numerical thresholds have to be decided with the full deliberation involving all participants using techniques like straw votes to determine whether a consensus actually exists, and then that can be voted on by the Committee.  Today, we\u2019re not really deliberating on the specifics, but I do want to mention that, as regards the unemployment threshold in alternative 3.1, I would err on the side of something higher than 7 percent, given all of the imprecision around questions like the level at which the unemployment rate would begin to generate inflation pressures and the speed at which pressures might develop.  Also, perhaps alternatively, I would change \u201cclose to or somewhat below\u201d to simply \u201cclose to.\u201d Finally, on the question of a consensus forecast, I think President Rosengren suggested the same thing.  It strikes me as a painful process and not, in the end, all that productive.  I think the SEP can and should be used to provide the public with a sense of all the views at the table that inform the deliberations of the formal voting Committee, and the forecast information in the SEP, if fully fleshed out, can suffice to give this sense of what the consensus is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the idea of communicating more about how the Committee\u2019s outlook affects its policy decisions, and I\u2019d like to think that we can find a way before too long to provide more conditions-based guidance than date-based guidance. In principle, including inflation and unemployment thresholds would have an advantage over using a date.  Our discussions this morning illustrated the many pitfalls of using a date. Also, we may have more agreement on the conditions for a move, even though we may disagree on the timing.  This is especially true if the main source of our disagreement is about the pace of the recovery in our outlooks.  In practice, however, we appear to disagree on what we regard as the appropriate reaction function to the outlook, and it is this difference that poses the strongest  challenge for reaching agreement on thresholds.  When my staff examined the recent SEP projections for appropriate policy and our projections for the economy, their analysis indicated that a large part of the difference in the takeoff date could be attributed to differences in what we submitted for our long-run unemployment rate.  With considerable dispersion in our views of such a fundamental variable, which is a key input tool of the Taylor rule, it could be hard to come up with a statement regarding an unemployment threshold that accurately summarizes the range of the Committee\u2019s views and provides simple and clear guidance to the public.  I worry, however, that if we find it hard to come up with compromise wording that accounts for differences in our longer-run unemployment rates and other differences in our views on appropriate policy, it would likely be too complicated to still be informative. I totally agree with Governor Yellen\u2019s comments earlier about clarity versus transparency. So I have a preference for a straightforward statement, and quantitative thresholds would be the most straightforward.  But again, if we could legitimately form a consensus around a straightforward statement, such as paragraph 3.1 in part B, I could support it.  I do worry, as we\u2019ve been talking this afternoon, that consensus around this simple phrasing would be hard to achieve. For example, I estimate my long-run unemployment rate at 6 percent, and so I would be more comfortable with an unemployment threshold of 7\u00bd percent.  However, I could accept close to 7 percent, with the phrase that was included in the language of B.3.1 that talked about the pace of improvement in labor markets.  So I would be more comfortable with a straightforward, clearer statement, but given the difficulty that we\u2019re hearing about reaching a consensus, I would be willing to support some qualitative language as long as we have more assurance that the qualitative language would provide clarity.  Again, after listening to this afternoon\u2019s discussions, I know that is a huge challenge, but I\u2019m confident that the subcommittee  on communications is up to this challenge. I want us to avoid making still more changes to our communications that could be hard for the public to interpret.  In my view, there is a lot to be said for waiting and letting the public digest our recent changes and for us to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of further communications changes in our policies before we enact further enhancements. So with that said, I do like the idea of incorporating some medium-term language in paragraph 2.  The current language that we use is too short-term focused.  Paragraph 2 of alternative C is about right in length, and it leaves further details to the SEP or the Chairman\u2019s press conferences.  Regarding other enhancements that are listed or suggested by question 3, I think they are all good ideas worth considering.  I\u2019d like to have more analysis about what we think the strengths and weaknesses of each of these ideas would be.  What would we be hoping to accomplish with each of these ideas.  So I\u2019d be open to more discussion about these various ideas, but I\u2019m not ready today to select any specific proposal.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the comments that have been made to this point, I\u2019m going to set aside my formal comments and just react to a couple of things.  One is, given the changes that we\u2019ve made so far in our communication strategy, I have been leaning toward the comments that President Pianalto made about letting things sit a while in terms of what we\u2019ve already put out there and being very cautious in making further changes given the short amount of time in which we\u2019ve made what I think are important changes here.  Regarding the connection between the outlook and the policy, as I looked at the questions, I really was drawn to the comment that Governor Yellen made about trying to be careful between transparency and clarity.  And so as I looked more at what would be clearer, then you get drawn  to things like thresholds or things that seem more specific.  I could not satisfy myself, as I looked at the \u201cmore specifics,\u201d that they really took into account the full range of things that we think about, which is what makes this difficult to come to terms with\u2014balancing the flexibility that President Bullard talked about with trying to be clearer to the public about what we\u2019re doing.  And in that sense, I go back to the document on the longer-run goals and strategy, which laid out\u2014albeit not in very specific terms, but clearer than I think we had been\u2014what it is we are looking at in terms of our objectives.  So I\u2019m satisfied with that piece, at least for the time being. As it relates to the SEP, I also have mixed feelings there.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go as far as Vice Chairman Dudley in saying it\u2019s a mess, but it might be close.  That said, I think we should not put too much on those projections, too.  Now that we\u2019ve put them out there, it\u2019s fair for the public to look at that as being background to a range of views.  I think we should be careful that they not get in the way of the responsibility of the Committee to come to a decision.  And so looking at those in the context of focusing on their central tendency might be the best we can do in the near term. Thank you", "  MR. LACKER. If I could respond, Mr. Chairman\u2014the way I\u2019d put it is, that\u2019s a commitment that you\u2019d question the credibility of.  You\u2019d question the credibility of that commitment", " MR. LACKER.  Earlier in the meeting about today\u2019s statement, about \u201c2014,\u201d the issue of commitment came up. I interpreted the view that having made the statement raises the bar for action as that it represents some commitment.  That contradicts what you\u2019ve said in public about it being a forecast. I take the status quo to be that it\u2019s a forecast"], "2012FOMC20120425meeting.txt": [" VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes. I think I\u2019m the outlier here in terms of how I reacted to the scenarios. It was a useful exercise, and the surprising thing was how much people actually adjusted their monetary policy forecasts in light of what were really relatively modest differences in the scenarios.  So I thought I\u2019d just explain why I ended up in a very different place than many of you. The first reason is, the differences in the scenarios had very small implications for what was going to happen in 2013 and 2014.  Now, obviously, Thomas made the point that if you specified more about the financial variables, then you might be able to infer more about what would happen over the longer term.  But I don\u2019t think the scenarios, as they were cast, had very strong implications for 2013 and 2014. Second, I thought that even if the scenarios had been somewhat more divergent, it\u2019s not clear to me that it would actually have changed my outlook that much, because what\u2019s really driving my views for 2013 and 2014 are the downside risks.  So you can have a scenario, but you still have this issue of how significant the downside risks are.  And right now, with Europe, the U.S. \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d\u2014those are downside risks that are large in terms of their mass and how I think about the outlook relative to whether GDP growth is two-tenths firmer or two-tenths weaker over the next six months. And then finally, given the fact that we\u2019re at the zero lower bound, the consequences of the downside are not symmetric with the consequences of the upside.  Again, until you actually see a scenario that demonstrably reduces the downside risk significantly, it wouldn\u2019t be likely that I would want to change my monetary policy outlook.  So I was surprised by that. In terms of recommendations on how I would take this forward, I think it was a useful exercise. We should continue to try to see where we can take this.  Given my own personal preference, I\u2019d prefer to have scenarios that have greater divergence.  And, in addition, it would be very good to have the scenarios have a lot more information about what\u2019s happening to financial market variables, so you can see what the market is anticipating from the takeoff point in the fall of 2012, because that will, in a way, provide more color about how the market is assessing the scenarios. I think that will give us more context in terms of what you might want to do about monetary policy", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m going to make a comment that I didn\u2019t send in anything as part of the last request for comments but it occurs to me on reflecting on this briefing.  I think it\u2019s really interesting the way you ask questions 3 and 4.  In 3, you asked, \u201cIn   the scenario closest to your current modal outlook, what would be the outlook for the appropriate stance of monetary policy \u2026.\u201d and \u201c\u2026 what do you think the scenario would imply for the forward guidance regarding the appropriate time to begin raising the funds rate \u2026.\u201d  So you sort of ask, should we change the appropriate stance of policy.  And, if so, should we change the forward guidance.  You left out, it seems like, \u201cWhat is your forecast.  Is your forecast going to change.\u201d  Now, you may have done that under the presumption that, surely, we would change the forward guidance if our forecast changed, but our last discussions haven\u2019t left me with a lot of certainty that that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about our forward-guidance language. I\u2019m assuming that if our collective forecast in some sort of median sense changed, we would change the forward guidance.  And that\u2019s what I was suggesting. I was one of the ones at the last meeting who suggested contingency planning, and what I was thinking is that it would have been nice if, when we adopted the language, we had thought through, well, what happens if our forecast advances in time by four months.  Are we going to change the language or not.  And this doesn\u2019t quite get at that", " MR. EVANS.  I want to thank President Lacker for that comment because it reminded me of something.  At the last meeting, a number of people\u2014I looked at the transcript from last time more carefully this time, and there were a number of comments\u2014Jeff made them\u2014about \u201clate 2014\u201d as a forecast. Is it a forecast, or is it a commitment.  And as I went through this scenario analysis, I thought about that issue.  It seems to me, as I think about this, that it\u2019s much more than just a forecast. Obviously, a date is a forecast, but it also takes into account what the policy response function is that everybody has in their mind.  And so if I were asking a question, I\u2019d ask the staff whether or not you gained any insights from this scenario analysis beyond just  how a different economic scenario plays out\u2014did you gain any insights on what our individual policy reaction functions are.\u2014because I thought Governor Yellen gave a very insightful speech last week where she pointed out that on the basis of the same economic outlook from our SEPs, you could come out in different places in terms of when you thought liftoff was.  If you\u2019re using a Taylor (1993) response function, you\u2019re much earlier than if you\u2019re using a Taylor (1999) response function, and both are earlier than if you\u2019re using an optimal control type of response.  And so it\u2019s understanding that interplay between how the economy, downside risk, and that response function are playing out, plus how we\u2019re thinking about it, that\u2019s so fundamental to this.  If you have any insights, that would be great", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I do have a few remarks on this exercise. First of all, I don\u2019t think that this exercise, as constructed, would do very much to foster  transparency with the public regarding FOMC policy.  And so let me just elaborate on that for a minute.  This is 17 responses to four scenarios.  That\u2019s a maze of 68 possibilities.  I don\u2019t think that kind of information overload is very conducive to improving transparency.  If we actually went ahead with something like this, the number of scenarios would have to be expanded to encompass the full range of outcome uncertainty, but that would add to the information overload.  A lot of these comments actually echo Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s comments.  The information provided for each scenario is limited.  Normally, the Committee makes decisions based on a wide range of data from a wide range of sources. In principle, one would need a separate Tealbook for each scenario.  We would be saying, in effect, that we do not need all of that analysis to decide what to do in various states of the world.  That would simplify our meetings considerably.  I also think it\u2019s an odd time to put heavy emphasis on the nature of the Committee\u2019s interest rate feedback rule.  Adjustment of the policy rate has not been the primary tool of the Committee for years and likely will not be for years into the future. A better approach, I think, would be to get something like a monetary policy report.  Financial markets and other interested observers crave a digestible Fed view of the many issues that face the U.S. economy.  We could provide this by publishing a quarterly monetary policy report, as other central banks do.  A key advantage of a full report is that all of the important issues and uncertainties can be commented on in some way in the text.  This would provide a baseline both for members of this Committee and for outside observers.  To the extent that there are differing interpretations of events, this could also be noted and discussed in such a text.  The policy portion could be based on market expectations of policy at the time the report is produced.  This is what\u2019s done at the Bank of England, for instance.  Alternative scenarios could also be discussed in a monetary policy report.  I think the United States is lagging behind other central  banks in providing such an assessment.  That would be a better way to go, in my view, as opposed to putting out this maze of information or core dump on what everybody is thinking about policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  It would be a staff report, and I think the Committee could comment, if it wanted to, on whether all of the points of view or all of the issues had been represented in the report.  But the report wouldn\u2019t try to necessarily come down on every issue.  It could present different issues", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I\u2019d like to follow up on that, Mr. Chairman.  So SOMA holdings\u2014 presumably, you measure them in some way that lines up with when you expect the   announcement effect, or do you measure them via the September meeting announcement.  And the reason I ask is that I\u2019m wondering how you identify separately the effect of a change in their anticipations of our SOMA holdings from that of a change in their anticipation of the path of the federal funds rate, which surely is influenced by an announcement that we deem the economy and the outlook would warrant a bunch of changes in our SOMA holdings", " MR. SACK. Here we\u2019re talking about a full surprise.  So, first of all, the move by 18 months wasn\u2019t a full surprise.  There was some expectation that it was going to be longer\u2014 not 18 months longer, but somewhat.  There actually is a downward movement in response that  you saw in financial markets.  Clearly, implied volatility responded and Treasury yields responded, and you can see it on the chart.  You just need a magnifying glass to see it. [Laughter] It\u2019s that little notch down in January.  But I agree with the general sentiment that, given the way that was interpreted and the effects it seemed to have on expectations and volatility, especially effects on volatility and the balance sheet path, you would have expected to see a bigger effect.  So I take that on board.  But the move did affect markets, and I think what this says is that it just had a lot of effect through the expected funds rate path and maybe a little bit of effect through the term premium", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  On chart 18, you asked this question in the primary dealer survey about how much the unemployment rate and the inflation rate would have to change to induce a change in the forward guidance.  These seem to be pretty large relative to what we showed in our scenario analysis or what the SEP results suggest.  What should we draw from that distinction, if anything", " MR. LACKER.  On the swap lines, consistent with long-standing principle, I oppose these swap lines.  They represent, in both their origins and their rationale, supporting machinery for two purposes.  One is foreign exchange operations, which, as I\u2019ve said before, I believe are inappropriate.  They\u2019re redundant, they have been abandoned by modern central banks around the globe, and they threaten our independence under our system of governance since they\u2019re always in conjunction with the U.S. Treasury.  Moreover, the second purpose would be to channel intergovernmental assistance to our fine NAFTA partners.  Deserving as they might be of that assistance, that\u2019s a fiscal policy function that I think is best left to fiscal authorities.  So for those reasons, I would oppose the swap lines.  I\u2019d urge you and the staff to begin now to negotiate their dissolution.  But barring that, I\u2019ll vote against them", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019d like to ask the staff about inflation forecasts and economic capacity measures.  The Tealbook has had a string of misses on inflation over the last year or so.  In December of 2010, you were forecasting 1.1 percent for overall for 2011. The latest estimate is 2.7.  And it\u2019s not just energy prices.  On core, you were forecasting 0.9 percent, and it came in at 1.8.  So I raise this with all due sympathy for anyone asked to forecast on a regular basis.  People like that deserve our sympathy and our support.  But I ask because, as you know, around the table, many of us bring very different frameworks to bear on the relationship between inflation and capacity.  So the view\u2014I\u2019ll call it view 1\u2014is that the natural rate or measure of capacity is a very smooth variable.  And as a result, the gap is quite large now, and the gap has large effects on your inflation forecast, as is clear from your text.  This is illustrated very nicely in the box on pages 24 and 25 of the Tealbook A.  And there it shows your estimate of potential output, which has been revised downward over the last several years, at least the projection of it going forward, but it\u2019s still a very smooth time series.  You also present NAIRU as an alternative estimate of economic capacity, and it, too, is very smooth. View 2, you might call it, is that the natural rate responds to all of the shocks that affect  economic production and economic demand and ought to be expected to vary at high frequencies.  This is a point that\u2019s been argued forcefully by Professor Michael Woodford.  It\u2019s a point that\u2019s embodied in all of the DSGE models that we use in the DSGE exercise that\u2019s conducted for periodic meetings. So I have a two-part question.  One is, on what do you rest your a priori weight you give to the smoothness of capacity measures.  And the second is, have your misses been leading you to move at all from view 1 in the direction of view 2", "  They all have\u2014MR. LACKER.  Yes, I know, but they don\u2019t publish the natural rate.  The natural rate is not in there in these", " MR. LACKER.  I\u2019d point out that the DSGE models\u2014as I understand those exercises, we run those models clean, right. We take the data that we have, and then we run them out.  You couldn\u2019t do that, I would guess, with FRB/US.  And you don\u2019t report to us forecasts that represent taking FRB/US through current data and just running it with no adjustments. What you give us\u2014and this is what we expect from you\u2014is a combination of information gleaned from various sources, including model projections, but it\u2019s a judgmental forecast.  And that\u2019s not what we get from the DSGE exercises. We get a mechanical projection that\u2019s devoid of any of the judgmental inputs you provide.  So it\u2019s not quite an apples-to-apples comparison there", " MR. WILCOX.  Okay.  As I mentioned yesterday at the Board briefing, we operate under the tyranny of having to write something down.  But, boy, if macroeconomic forecasting is a shot in the dark, then I don\u2019t know what political forecasting is.  So, broadly, the spirit of what we tried to do was to get fiscal policy one step down the road toward a sustainable area.  Now, even in our baseline assumption, fiscal policy is not yet sustainable, even with that substantial tightening.  That said, in the baseline, we assumed that the 2001and 2003 tax cuts are extended and that the stimulus measures are allowed to expire\u2014the payroll tax cuts and the emergency unemployment benefits. With that set of assumptions, our measure of fiscal impetus, which is the direct effect of discretionary fiscal policy on GDP growth, has a contractionary impulse of about 1 percentage point. Implicit in that is an assumption, maybe a hope\u2014I don\u2019t know, perhaps a prayer\u2014that the Congress won\u2019t allow every contractionary action to go into force that might go into force.  And, in particular, what they forestall in our baseline assumption is, they prevent the automatic sequestration budget cuts to spending from taking full effect, and they extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, which, under current law, are scheduled to expire. If they  can\u2019t get themselves organized to do that, then there would be additional tax payments to the U.S. Treasury amounting to about 2 percentage points of GDP\u2014additional, incremental, to our baseline forecast.  We\u2019ve assumed that GDP growth won\u2019t slow to the full extent of that 2 percentage points of GDP, only by about half of that amount, because households, we think, will react as they usually do by smoothing through what they are likely to perceive as, certainly, a sudden change in their cash flow.  So we think that the additional decrement to GDP growth is likely to be about 1 percentage point in that case.  But surrounding all of that, boy, there would sure be a lot of Sturm und Drang about whether our political system can get its act together and that sort of thing.  And we\u2019ve seen in recent episodes in the past that that can have quite significant effects on household and business confidence.  We wanted to put this \u201cFiscal Cliff\u201d scenario in the Tealbook to elevate it for your attention.  But, gee, whether we\u2019ve got the numbers right or not is really anybody\u2019s guess.  I think that probably what I\u2019d bank my wallet on is, I\u2019d take a line through the numbers and just write in the words \u201cconsequences likely to be very significant", " MR. WILCOX", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay. Let me just follow up a little bit more on the Moody\u2019s thing.  I think where I come out on the whole issue of the Moody\u2019s downgrade\u2014it\u2019s not that on the day, there\u2019s going to be any great catastrophe, because the banks do have lots of capital, they have very large liquidity buffers, and the event is highly anticipated. There will be a little bit of a surprise in the sense that something that you think is likely to happen is different than something that actually does happen.  And there is some question about some of the firms\u2014 how big the downgrade will be and how idiosyncratic it will look.  If all the firms are taken down the same number of rating steps, that will be less severe to particular firms than if certain firms are taken down by more. So that\u2019s the good news.  Nothing will probably happen really quickly. The bad news, though, is that this could really provoke a pretty vicious circle where liquidity flows out; profitability goes down; other rating agencies join in with their own downgrades, so the companies are no longer split-rated, but everybody rates some of these firms P-2; and then it really becomes a question of whether the broker\u2013dealer trading operations are viable, because some customers will say, \u201cI can\u2019t do business with a broker\u2013dealer that\u2019s rated this way.\u201d  And then the question is, can you actually have a viable trading operation if you can\u2019t access the full range of customers. So at that point, the whole trading operation\u2019s viability may be impaired, and then profitability continues to head down, and the whole thing spirals on itself.  Now, I don\u2019t know that it has to go that way; probably in part, it will depend on what the market environment is.  If you have a very good market environment and profitability of this activity is very high, then presumably the firms could do okay, and maybe their ratings could get upgraded over time.  But if you\u2019ve got a less benign environment where profitability of the whole sector is under pressure, then I think the thing would tend to culminate in an adverse way over time. Just generally speaking about the QS effort, Nellie, I thought it was terrific. It was a really good report, a good presentation.  You covered all the right things.  And relative to Steve\u2019s view on Europe, I would be a little bit more cautious or a little bit more pessimistic than what you expressed.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big difference, but I do think it\u2019s a difference.  And I want to explain why.  The important thing about Europe is that we\u2019re still very much in an adverse feedback world.  What are those adverse feedbacks.  Well, one bad loop is the fact that it\u2019s the relationship between the performance of the countries\u2019 economies in a world of fiscal restraint that then has consequences for housing prices; that in turn has consequences for the health of the banking system; and then finally, the deterioration in the banking system increases the claims on the fiscal capacity of the country.  So that\u2019s a very bad adverse feedback loop that hasn\u2019t beencorrected in any meaningful way that I can see. Another one is the fact, of course, that the fiscal austerity depresses economic activity, which causes quite a bit of slippage between the amount of fiscal adjustment that you undertake and how much actual improvement that generates in your outturn in terms of your budget balance.  And the third adverse loop that I think is really important with respect to how the Europeans have done this is that if there is official support forthcoming in a package of the EFSF or from the ECB bond purchases, that effectively subordinates the sovereign debt held by private entities, and so that makes it more difficult for the country to maintain or regain market access.  You could argue that the second adverse feedback loop is political.  The political support for more austerity lessens as this process continues.  So I\u2019m pretty cautious about how this is all going to unfold.  At the end of the day, I guess I think we\u2019re going to go the way we have been going\u2014that you get temporary improvement, then things get worse, and then that provokes more action.  But I worry that each time we undertake the next chapter, the political support for monetary union shrinks or gets strained, and that at some point, the political support for this starts to give way. That\u2019s a comment, but you can also take it as a question, and I\u2019ll allow you to comment on that", " MR. PLOSSER.  So what did that look like in 2007", " MR. FISHER.  And then just a comment in terms of your asset valuation\u2014I continue to be worried, and maybe I\u2019m alone.  But if you look at longer-term trends\u2014you commented in the paper, basically going back two decades; some of the charts you have go back to 1985.  From an equity market standpoint, those are not very long trends.  For example, if you go back pre-1968, current S&P market values are one standard deviation above the trend; if you go back to 1990, they\u2019re right on trend.  So I think we have to be mindful of that fact, particularly given your last point of reaching for returns.  It would be helpful, at least to me as one reader of this who reads it very, very carefully, all 148 pages, that we have, perhaps, some longer-term time frames in terms of asset valuation to establish the trend lines", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Going into the March meeting, we were confronted with labor market data that had been stronger than expected, but spending data that had been weaker than expected.  Since that meeting, we have been confronted with the opposite.  Labor market data were weaker than expected, but spending data were stronger.  What does this imply for the forecast.  The Tealbook seems to split the difference and ends up with an unemployment rate at the end of 2013 at 7.7 percent, only \u00bd percentage point lower than the current unemployment rate, a modest improvement over the next year and a half.  I, unfortunately, concur with this forecast and expect growth that makes only plodding improvements in a dismal employment situation despite an inflation rate that undershoots our 2 percent inflation target. I see a strange dichotomy between my modal and mean forecasts.  The forecast to which I assign the highest probability looks like many others around the table, with relatively subdued growth, modest progress toward full employment, and contained inflation.  After such a long period of stagnant growth, there should be significant pockets of pent-up demand.  Consumers are again purchasing cars, and they\u2019re showing some signs of life in other areas.  In some regions of the country, like New England, we are again seeing cranes and help-wanted signs, harbingers of a better future that have not been present for most of the past five years.  However, my modal forecast is not equal to my mean forecast.  The mean is much lower.  The modal forecast assumes that downside risks do not materialize.  Unfortunately, fiscal sanity seems more a hope than a forecast; the willingness to address nuclearization of the Middle East seems postponed rather than addressed; and the recent spate of articles on Spain only highlights that holding together Europe will get more difficult with time, particularly if there\u2019s not the political will to directly address fiscal transfers and consolidation without taking their collective economies to the edge, a process that surely has economic consequences.  Thus, I am worried that a variety of risks look as though they may deliver coal in our stocking at the end of the year.  Given the uncertainty in the current economic environment, it is important that we do not contribute to the uncertainty.  Unfortunately, I am afraid that we have. As I talk to business people around New England, I am struck by how different people have interpreted our statement.  Some seem to view our statement as a firm commitment and thus have been willing to take positions assuming no immediate risk of rate increases.  Others  seem to view it as a forecast, which may be proven wrong, and view more immediate rate increases as quite likely. Others treat it like a date announced for troop withdrawal\u2014the date will hold unless conditions on the ground change dramatically.  Thus, despite our work on communications and transparency, we need to move to simple and unambiguous language if we want to prevent disappointment and anger from whatever actions or inactions we choose. I will leave that discussion of how best to do that to our meeting tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  How do the data in Las Vegas square with President Kocherlakota\u2019s view on risk aversion. [Laughter]  Governor Tarullo", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While some data have come in more positively, my projections remain mostly unchanged due to a continued concern about more than a modest strength and durability to our recovery.  I\u2019ll focus my remarks on consumer spending as one relevant prism. In particular, there are five factors influencing my ongoing concerns regarding consumer spending.  Let\u2019s call them, one, real disposable income is flat; two, new jobs are low wage; three, student debt can crowd out spending; four, this is a presidential election year; and, five, fiscal policy is becoming increasingly restrictive. The first factor relates to the weakness in real disposable income.  Of all the factors driving growth in consumption, the factor with the greatest effect is real disposable income.  However, Americans\u2019 disposable income has been rising at a subpar pace in recent quarters and, given recent price increases at the gas pump, appears to have been especially anemic in the first quarter. Real wages, in particular, have remained flat for some time.  Unless income growth steps up considerably or households start to take on excessive amounts of debt again, I believe American households have insufficient means to propel faster consumption growth. The second factor influencing my concern about consumer spending relates to the fact that the job growth that has occurred has been concentrated in very low-wage occupations. According to the National Employment Law Project, lower-wage occupations\u2014retail salespersons, office clerks, food prep workers, and stock clerks\u2014grew by 3.2 percent from the first quarter of 2010 through the first quarter of 2011, while mid-wage occupations rose just 1.2 percent, and higher-wage occupations actually declined 1.2 percent.  This may suggest that workers across the distribution are taking less-lucrative positions.  They\u2019re taking whatever jobs they can get.  This is a form of underemployment that isn\u2019t captured by the latest employment data, but will likely continue to contribute to the subpar income growth.  Unfortunately, this may not turn around any time soon.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that five of the top six occupations with the most job growth from 2010 to 2020 will be low-wage jobs. Third, I\u2019m concerned that high levels of student debt coupled with a poor labor market for post-college entry-level jobs may impede consumer spending.  Total student borrowing has grown rapidly in recent years.  Structural forces, such as rapidly rising tuition and an increasing share of high school graduates entering post-secondary education, are the main culprits, though cyclical forces, such as a lack of good job market prospects, are likely also important. Increased levels of education-related debt incurred in youth may crowd out spending on cars, houses, or other items in later years.  This could affect not only today\u2019s youth, but also today\u2019s adults.  Many of my cohort feel pressured to take out loans to help with their children\u2019s education expenses, and are themselves now helping make payments on student loans. Fourth, I project consumption to be damped this year through a worsening of consumer confidence as the presidential election heats up. It may feel as if the presidential debate is about dogs riding on car roofs.  No, the focus of this election year is the economy, and extensive campaigning is likely to accentuate discontent with the economic recovery. So even if the data are improving, that may be nearly irrelevant to people\u2019s perception that the economic recovery is subpar.  This perception could show up in lackluster confidence and consumer spending.   Fifth and last, fiscal policy is likely to be essentially inoperative as a tool to help revive the economy.  In fact, the fiscal policy situation is worse than inoperative. It is actively contractionary.  Current estimates of total fiscal impetus indicate that fiscal policy is expected to impose a drag of a little more than \u00bc percentage point of real GDP this year, 1 percentage point of GDP next year, and then a little more than \u00bc percentage point of real GDP in 2014.  These expectations could be larger if any one of the pieces of legislation that the Congress needs to act on later this year fails to materialize. My projections reflect a sense that the fiscal cliff issues will not be resolved without collateral damage.  As we saw after the debt ceiling negotiations last summer, it is entirely possible that there will be a drop-off of consumer sentiment that will exacerbate the drag on consumption and the overall economy.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  If I could just follow up.  This goes to the relationship of the Committee with the Treasury.  This is sort of a critical thing, and there is an open question in my mind.  Did we ever seek an understanding with the Treasury that it would not offset, in the sense you described, by adjusting its debt issuance policies", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There has been no issue of independence here.  Yes, he volunteered that", " MR. LACKER.  Well, no, paragraph 1 is about the data.  Paragraph 2 is about our forecast, and paragraph 3 is about our policy.  That\u2019s what I thought of as the structure we were gravitating to.  Plus it seems to race to take credit for a gradually improving recovery.  It seems to be a bit of patting ourselves on the back.  I don\u2019t support this last clause here.  We should drop \u201csupported by highly accommodative monetary policy.\u201d I don\u2019t think we want to double the forward-guidance language. If we slip it in there, then it\u2019s going to be hard to take out without being viewed as sending some signal, and it just complicates our policy communication.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Although I don\u2019t think today is the day to change our policy stance\u2014in that sense, I think alternative B is the right direction to go\u2014I do think it is very likely that economic conditions will warrant a change in policy considerably sooner than 2014.  Indeed, based on my forecast, I believe it will be appropriate to begin reducing the level of accommodation as soon as either late this year or early 2013.  Given the large error bands around our forecast, especially those two or three years out, I am concerned that our signaling that policy is likely to remain on hold for two or three years is potentially having more of a detrimental impact than a positive one on the real economy. As President Rosengren said yesterday, many business people come to me and say, \u201cDoes that mean you think   the world is going to be terrible for the next three years.  Why do I want to invest now.  I am going to wait.\u201d There is still great confusion as our discussion continues about what the 2014 date means.  We need to get away from the calendar date language and move to more state-contingent language that better links the changes in economic conditions to the changes in our policy.  Clarifying for the public what factors guide our policy decisions would help keep inflation expectations well anchored and yield better economic outcomes. There are two views that seem to be expressed around this table in various degrees about the calendar date language.  One is that it is a commitment, and the commitment largely flows from models in which you are trying to target the price level as opposed to inflation.  The big challenge with that framework of course is, can we commit, and can we deliver on a credible commitment to do so.  Another interpretation is that it is a forecast, and if it is a forecast then the dates should be moving around as our forecast changes.  There is a variety of views around this table about which of those is in action here.  Our strategy seems to be a little bit of both of them.  That is difficult to sell to the public because it leaves them confused as to what we are doing and why. If we want to make a commitment to a price-level target, we should do that, and then explain that is what we are doing. If we want to make a forecast, then the date ought to change and we ought to tell the public what our forecast is, what it depends upon, and then what are the things that will change it. I am less enamored with optimal control solutions, particularly of FRB/US, and what they tell me.  What we know from our memo that we received before the March meeting about optimal control in different types of models is that optimal control solutions can vary a lot depending on the model you write down and can give you very different paths.  So I am dubious of relying too heavily on a particular model\u2019s optimal control, which is why I prefer the more  robust rules that the Tealbook reports on, whether it be Taylor (1999), Taylor (1993), a first difference rule, or outcome-based rules. I think we need to move in that direction and move away from calendar dates. My suggestion, of course, would be, as I propose in the language, to split the difference and begin introducing the factors that actually go into our forecast and the things that we will consider as we try to move policy around. For some good reasons, the Committee has resisted the temptation in previous meetings to move to either a price-level target or a level of nominal GDP target.  And so, in my view, the \u201c2014\u201d language leaves us in kind of \u201cNever Never Land.\u201d We are neither fish nor fowl.  I think that is very confusing to the public, and it is something we need to move away from.  There is not an easy solution to this.  I proposed one to consider, but we need to move away from the calendar date language to a more contingent statement. I will just leave it at that, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Yes", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B based on the general tenor of recent data, improving forecasts particularly for the unemployment rate, and my own forecast that inflation will average close to 2 percent.  My preferred path for the funds rate recognizes that substantial policy accommodation may need to remain in place for some time as the unemployment rate remains elevated and improvements in the housing sector remain modest.  Even so, I believe it is important that we begin to lay the groundwork for our exit strategy in order to reduce the risk of unintended consequences related to the current stance of monetary policy. Turning to the statement, I generally agree with the description that modestly upgrades the characterization of current economic conditions and the outlook from the March meeting. In addition, the current SEP projections for the unemployment rate do show improvement since the January projections.  In my view, and consistent with the language in the statement, the forward   guidance embodied in the late 2014 date is a forecast by Committee members of when the federal funds rate is likely to be increased for the first time.  I do not believe it is, or should be, viewed as an unconditional commitment.  So in comparing conditions now with those during the January meeting when we moved the date from mid-2013 to late 2014, I think markets and the broader public may likely find it hard to understand why the late 2014 date has not been changed to reflect the firmer outlook.  Moreover, acknowledging that the outlook has improved by shifting the date could also have a positive effect through confidence and expectation channels. Thank you", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. It will cost you a buck, though", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So, people at the time\u20142008 and 2009\u2014would have to know that the Committee was planning to make that correction for it to be helpful, is that right", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let me ask you one question\u2014which I don\u2019t know the answer to, because I am not a lawyer\u2014about your LSAP analysis.  If you are looking at a standard Taylor rule, would it matter if the funds rate had been much lower two years earlier or not so much lower two years earlier. In other words, to what extent does your current setting of the interest rate based on a current Taylor rule depend on stimulative actions that have been taken, say, two years earlier.  I think the answer is it wouldn\u2019t depend at all", " MR. LACKER.  Yes", "\u201d  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  You can leave it in if you wish, but I suggest we take it out, because it\u2019s not necessary", "   MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B, including for this meeting, the \u201clate 2014\u201d language, but I would like to register some reservations.  First, I think the best course of action for this meeting is minimal change.  That said, I\u2019m comfortable with a growing disconnect between the 2014 date language in the statement and my expectation of the policy liftoff date.  Even with the conditionality of the guidance emphasized, I\u2019m seeing the \u201clate 2014\u201d language as increasingly untenable.  My forecast is similar to the Tealbook forecast, including my baseline assumptions about appropriate policy, and it has been noted by others that the Tealbook has brought forward the liftoff date by three quarters since the \u201clate 2014\u201d language was originally published. At the last meeting, I was comfortable supporting the \u201clate 2014\u201d language because at that time my forecast showed something closer to mid-2014\u2014this is very similar to what President Pianalto just related.  Given the imprecision of forecasting that far out, I didn\u2019t see a material difference versus later in 2014.  Since then, however, the mismatch between my projected liftoff date and late 2014 has become more pronounced.  I still think one way to resolve some of this conflict is to introduce economic conditionality into the statement.  President Plosser referred to a state-contingent approach, and President Rosengren mentioned triggers.  These are all thematically the same idea. This is not on the table at this meeting, so I\u2019ll just register my continued support for moving in the direction of expressing forward guidance in terms of some form of economic thresholds.  A move in that direction might allow, in time, dropping the date language.  In my view, we need to move the conversation to economic conditionality.  This is an appeal to keep trying.  Further on that point, my staff did a review of our forecast against various Taylor rule specifications, and we concluded that the liftoff date is highly sensitive to very small differences in economic assumptions in forecasts.  Even when weuse the outcome-based 1999 version of the Taylor rule described in the Tealbook, we get liftoff dates that vary substantially when plugging in forecasts that, to my mind, are not very different one from the other. I\u2019d like to also make a couple of points about the draft statement language, and this is in line with what I believe President Lacker said. It\u2019s best not to change the language unless required to address some perceived change in circumstances and outlook.  The March statement read, \u201cThe Committee expects moderate economic growth over coming quarters.\u201d I think this characterization is still correct, and I don\u2019t see the gain from the proposed new verbiage that distinguishes between coming quarters and the medium term and lengthens, in effect, the horizon of the outlook.  As the staff notes, the inclusion of this language may have the effect of sending members of the public to the SEPs for clarification.  If this is the case, it would only promote the view that the FOMC statement should be interpreted through the SEPs.  Many in the room have questioned whether that really does provide much clarification.  I\u2019m not very comfortable with that approach, particularly considering the divergent forecasts of liftoff opposite the \u201clate 2014\u201d guidance, and for that reason I would not make the changes contemplated in the current draft of alternative B.  I would simply stick to the March version.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can go along with alternative B.  I find the changes in the second sentence of paragraph 2 a little bit less than felicitous, but I have confidence that at your press conference you can make any necessary explanation to put those in context. I think it is useful that the staff has produced some memos on potential additional measures if those are called for. I hope that the expectation that by two months from now things are clarified one way or another proves correct, but it seems to me not inconceivable that we\u2019re going to have somewhat differently moving data between now and then as well, at which point   we\u2019re going to have to start thinking about whether in a situation of continued mixed information and uncertainty, the current monetary policy stance is appropriate. On the SEP\u2014first, I want to say I thought Jeff made a lot of very important points.  The only thing in his affirmative presentation that I would have slightly disagreed with was that he talked only about pulling the date forward, and it\u2019s at least conceivable that it could go further back at some moment. But I thought everything else he said really posed important questions for us to think about, and I would say much of the gravamen of what he was saying was that there is a disconnect between what is going on in the statement and what is going on in the SEP.  I guess a corollary was that there\u2019s an instability in the statement itself one way or another because of the date. I was a proponent of trying to move toward the use of projections, and I still am, but I am even more impressed now with the difficulties of doing so in the peculiar institutional framework that we have got relative to other central banks around the world.  I thought it at the time, and I raised some of the issues. I thought we might be able to modify the SEP once in place.  I do think it\u2019s adding to transparency but not to effective communication, and because the goal is effective communication, it does seem to me we\u2019re going to have to think pretty hard about both it and paragraph 3 language in the June meeting. When I say the idiosyncrasies\u2014we have no real connection now between the SEP and the collective process.  We all do our projections as a single matter.  Those of us on the Board in splendid isolation\u2014it\u2019s just us and our computers.  Those of you in the Reserve Banks with your armies of support staffs [laughter] in your offices\u2014but they\u2019re all done individually, and then they\u2019re just aggregated. As several of us were talking about in the period preceding our adoption of the SEP, every other central bank that has a projection process has some kind of collective or collaborative element to that process before the projection is published.  I don\u2019t think that the models that exist in Sweden or, for that matter, in Britain, are likely to be effective in this Committee, which is way larger than others and geographically dispersed.  But there needs to be some institutional mechanism that ties a collective judgment together with the individual exercises of making projections, because right now we leave it to the Chairman to have to explain that the statement is a collective exercise and the projections are individual exercises.  But they\u2019re both hanging out there, and it does exacerbate communications difficulties. On the specific ideas, I go both ways on identifying current and noncurrent voters.  On the one hand, I don\u2019t think it quite solves the problem.  It\u2019s still a scatterpoint presentation, which is a problem.  On the other hand, ironically, if you\u2019re saying 2014 is your current date, then the public should be more interested in who\u2019s voting in late 2013 and early 2014 than who\u2019s voting in 2012.  So in an odd way, by identifying the current nonpermanent voters, you\u2019re saying, \u201cAh, these guys, you know, they\u2019re not going to be voting a couple of years from now,\u201d again an idiosyncrasy of the Federal Reserve. I\u2019m ambivalent on that one, but I do think something that gets us out of scatterpoints and into a format that has more of a collective element to it is going to be critical so this thing doesn\u2019t end up being at best neutral and at worst confusing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  But I would only say that I\u2019m a little less sanguine on the monetary policy report serving as an anchoring device for that collective judgment.  At best, though, it would take time to do that.  I wouldn\u2019t want to give up\u2014and to a considerable extent it would be giving up\u2014the use of forward guidance both by removing the date or any substitute for the date in paragraph 3, on the one hand, while maintaining a confusing scatterpoint presentation, on the other", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, support alternative B, but not without a vague sense that the actions taken today, i.e., no action, could be eventually interpreted by markets as being contractionary, an interpretation that could eventually effectively make them contractionary. In my view, we\u2019re still dealing with large shortfalls in aggregate demand, and unlike most other recoveries, fiscal policy isn\u2019t helping.  Rather, contractionary fiscal policy is worsening the aggregate demand shortfall.  Accordingly, the policy action in this recovery sits squarely on our shoulders.  We have done quite a bit, but the economy continues its slow slog. I recognize that there\u2019s uncertainty about how effective monetary policy can be at the moment. I read with interest the staff\u2019s memo on the attenuation of the effects of monetary policy.  I took from this memo that there is some evidence that various parts of the monetary transmission mechanism have been impaired.  But I did not conclude that all of the channels are inoperable.  Rather, I concluded that the transmission mechanism is only partially impaired.  In that case, it\u2019s entirely possible that our usual measures of whether monetary policy is highly accommodative, that is, that rates are very low, may be misleading.  When some channels of transmission are clogged, it may be that the current stance of monetary policy is just not sufficient for the magnitude of the crisis. While we may not be prepared to do more at this point, I am concerned about the signal we send by communicating doing nothing.  For those of us who believe the economy is still in slog mode, there is the concern that the longer we do nothing, the greater is the chance that we are unintentionally communicating that we are satisfied.  \u201cMission accomplished\u201d should not be the message of the day. If we are perceived as being satisfied, and many on this Committee will talk publicly about being satisfied, then markets will interpret us as having done the best we can.  Financial conditions will tighten.  The economy will visibly contract and slow down. We\u2019ve done nothing today to counteract what will be a growing sense that we are finished and that we are satisfied waiting for many more years in order to get us close to our statutory mandate.  This message strikes me as the exact opposite of one we have discussed in the past.  We\u2019ve discussed that sending a clear message to markets that we are committed to do everything necessary to meet our mandate could all by itself have a salutary effect on markets   and have an easing effect.  Analogously, if our statement today sends a signal that we are content with the current path of the economy, this could work like contractionary policy\u2014the last thing we need right now in my view.  I hope that is not the message the public takes from our meeting today.  Thank you", " MR. FISHER.  Just for the sake of the minutes since President Dudley made an extensive argument about the MEP, I\u2019d like to note that I would not be in favor of an MEP program as described.  I listened carefully to Brian\u2019s very thoughtful presentation yesterday, and especially to the citations in that one particular box.  I have serious doubts about the efficacy of an MEP.  I don\u2019t want to get into that right now.  We can argue it later. There are enormous risks involved, and there are costs involved that offset the benefits that President Dudley elucidated.  But only for the sake of the minutes, if we\u2019re going to say that an argument was made in favor of considering an MEP, I would like to also make it clear that a counterargument was made not in favor of an MEP", " MR. FISHER.  No, no, no.  If we included it in the minutes, I would just say that there would be a difference of opinion about it", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It\u2019s not on the table.  The scenario analysis suggested that many, but not all of the participants would be prepared in principle if circumstances warranted to undertake further balance sheet actions.  Perhaps that\u2019s the appropriate way to indicate it.  Okay.  Thank you all very much. There\u2019s broad support for alternative B. I do think that maintaining the \u201clate 2014\u201d language is still appropriate.  Bill English gave some good arguments for the particular timing, noting specifically that Taylor (1999) applied to the SEP projections still gives us something below 1 percent at the end of 2014.  Like Governor Yellen, I take some input from the optimal control exercise because unlike the Taylor rules, it does take into account the zero lower bound concerns and the commitment possibility.  But even the optimal control exercise doesn\u2019t take into account downside risks, which I think are greater than the upside risks, nor the asymmetry of the risks in terms of the ability to respond to those risks. From a communications perspective, there are going to be some problems.  I agree with with Governor Raskin that this entire package will be slightly contractionary, given both the SEP and the fact that we\u2019re not acting on the MEP today, but it would be very hard to understand a shift in policy from the March meeting as opposed to January because of the lack of change in the outlook since March. What we are looking at is a great deal of uncertainty about how this recovery is going to proceed.  We can always look ahead and say, \u201cWe\u2019ll get more information between this meeting and the next one.\u201d  There is, in fact, a good deal of information that we\u2019ll be getting, and we need a better conviction about which way the economy is going to go before we take further action. I take very seriously President Lacker\u2019s points about this being a forecast, and in fact, I have said similar things myself.  I do think that this would be interpreted first as a reversal, which would be overinterpreted by the markets notwithstanding the rationality of President Lacker\u2019s position.  But I also agree with a number of people around the table that we need to move forward to both better communication and better state contingency if we can.  In that respect, I would support the view that a lot of people had that we need to do better on the SEP and maybe ask Governor Yellen and her subcommittee to look not only at the points that she raised about the use of these projections internally and about various ways of changing the disclosure process, but more broadly at what improvements that we can make to the SEP that we can put before the Committee for further consideration. I\u2019d also like the staff as we look toward the next meeting\u2014at which we\u2019ll be talking about rules, and we\u2019ll be looking and reviewing the SEPs from both January and March\u2014to consider if not principal statements at least alternative hypothetical statements that might allow for some state-contingent approach but would be broad enough in some sense to capture the   broad center of the Committee. I\u2019m a bit concerned at this point of going to a strictly qualitative approach, but I understand the arguments behind that.  Perhaps there\u2019s an intermediate thing, which can be a little bit more specific without necessarily giving two-digit accuracy to the criteria that we use for easing or tightening. That\u2019s something I think the staff should continue to look at. On the language, there wasn\u2019t a great deal of consistency in theme. I\u2019m perfectly happy to drop \u201ctentative\u201d if everyone is okay with that. Signs are sort of implicitly tentative, I suppose. The only other thing that received significant attention was the language in paragraph 2.  I would summarize President Lacker\u2019s and President Lockhart\u2019s views as going back to the March language in the second sentence, and I think Vice Chairman Dudley opposed that.  I don\u2019t have strong views about it. Is there anyone who would like to comment on that", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Or going back, yes.  Any other. [No response] I do understand the logic.  It isn\u2019t simply another way of trying to have forward guidance.  It is an attempt to explain why we are maintaining an accommodative policy, which is that progress is contingent on our expectation of the policy.  President Bullard", " MR. LACKER.  I worry about the consequences of linking policy to this pickup and what happens as time plays out with that phrase.  When do we drop it.  Are we going to be afraid to drop it", " MR. LOCKHART.  I\u2019d like to pose a question to the Vice Chairman.  At the beginning of your statement you said it is possible policy isn\u2019t so exceptionally accommodative as we thought, and that if it\u2019s highly accommodative, why are we not growing faster.  And then you turned around and supported keeping it in.  I was interpreting what you said as there\u2019s a lot of confusion around words that you\u2019re supporting keeping in the statement, and we may be leading people to aconclusion that we\u2019re very certain about it being highly accommodative.  Can you help me sort that out", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We may not be following as highly accommodative a monetary policy as we think, but we are intending to follow a highly accommodative monetary policy", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right. Bear with me on that. Let\u2019s drop the \u201csupported by highly accommodative monetary policy", " MR. FISHER.  I was going to ask who they are so we could be take them out and shoot them", " MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, the revised schedule for this year conflicted with boards of directors\u2019 meetings. If we\u2019re going to do this, I\u2019d prefer to start in a calendar year where we can make all of those adjustments in a normal way"], "2012FOMC20120620meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I don\u2019t have any deep objections to going ahead with this experiment, but I\u2019m relatively skeptical of the benefits it offers us. Relative to the Summary of Economic Projections we do now, it\u2019s hard for me to see what else we could do that people out there are clamoring for. I understand the benefits of a quarterly monetary policy report that offers a richer narrative discussion of aspects of the forecast, and I agree with President Bullard, President Plosser, President Kocherlakota, and Governor Yellen on the value of that.  But it is not clear to me that the SEP doesn\u2019t convey a fair amount already. I think the central tendency ranges aren\u2019t that large in the grand scheme of things and that fan charts could be incorporated into the SEP without too much bother. Governor Yellen made reference to an inordinate amount of time that might be required to extract from Committee participants the textured information that goes into a broader forecast that some other central banks do.  But I am not quite sure I see how the procedure gets around requiring an inordinate amount of time of all of us without essentially foregoing gathering that information from us.  So I\u2019m not sure what this accomplishes.  The other perspective I bring onthis is that we have made a bunch of changes in how we communicate in the past year with what we did last August and what we did in January.  I don\u2019t think market participants have had a lot of time, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a lot of chances, to have some experience using it, changing it, and seeing how our communications tools vary with economic conditions.  I\u2019m drawn to the idea of taking a pause on our journey and taking some time before we take the next step, and I\u2019m wary of us being seen as throwing communications tools willy-nilly at the public, innovating at an excessively rapid pace in this dimension.  I have a really cautious view about this", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019d like to add my thanks to the subcommittee who put a lot of thought into this topic, and I, too, found the memo comparing different practices across central banks very helpful. In a perfect world, I think publication of a quarterly monetary policy report similar to those published by other central banks would be useful.  It has obvious benefits in terms of more clearly and comprehensively portraying the consensus outlook, the risks to the outlook, and very importantly, the rationale for policy actions.  But I want to mention something that is very important right now in that these benefits come with significant costs.  In approaching this undertaking, we need to think very carefully not just about the benefits, but also of the costs, especially in terms of staff resources. In particular, we should focus, in my view, on the problem we are trying to solve and whether it can be addressed at lower cost using our existing outlets, such as the SEP, the Chairman\u2019s press conferences, and the minutes. I am actually struck by the discussion and the comments so far.  There seem to be multiple objectives out there.  One is a monetary policy report as in done in other countries, which provides this very comprehensive, verbal description of consumption, investment, and the entire economic outlook, and like President Bullard mentioned, really does not take a stand on policy.  It is more of a comprehensive discussion of economic conditions and the outlook.  Then I listened to President Kocherlakota\u2019s comments, which I am very much in sympathy with, that expressed the view that what we are trying to do is provide the rationale for our policy decisions\u2014that is, provide the forecast that goes with the policy decision\u2014which is very different than, say, what the Bank of England does. Regarding staff resources, I am very concerned that the Board staff, in particular, has a very full plate.  The subcommittee\u2019s proposals represent a significant undertaking in terms of staff time.  I know that the Chairman mentioned that an important goal was to have no net additional burden on the staff, but I think that is going to be hard to do.  I would also just emphasize that key senior staff really have the greatest burden today, and they are the ones who are going to have a major role in the development of something such as a QMPR.  Moreover, given the heightened uncertainty about future events and the fact that we may soon need to dig deeper into our toolkit of unconventional monetary and liquidity policy tools, this is a particularly inopportune time to distract the staff\u2019s attention from the all-important policy analysis, which is what we actually need here and what we rely on so much for our policy discussions and decisions. If the main problem that we are trying to solve is to focus the public\u2019s attention on the consensus forecast that underlines and provides the rationale for the policy decision, then a lower-cost solution might be to leverage our existing communication platform, such as the SEP, the press conference, and the FOMC minutes.  President Kocherlakota gave an example of that in terms of the FOMC statement.  We could redesign, for example, the presentation of the SEP in terms of the tables, the charts, and the verbal description to highlight and focus attention on the consensus forecast, and this could be the consensus forecast of the voting members of the Committee.  It could be chosen by the Chairman based on, say, preliminary SEP submissions from the FOMC members as described in one of the memos.  I do see a great value in having the consensus forecast that provides the rationale for the policy decisions.  That is far less work, however, than actually writing a quarterly monetary policy report.  In this model, in my view, the full range of SEP submissions would still be presented in order to convey the diversity of views across participants.  That information would play second fiddle to the main message of the consensus forecast.  That is very important.  However, I also view, as Governor Yellen mentioned, that the diversity of views portrayed in the SEP has advantages and benefits, too.  It sends the important message that we are not locked into group-think, focused on one point forecast, but rather are regularly confronting and synthesizing a wide range of perspectives in coming to our policy decisions. In sum, I support developing a consensus forecast and the trial runs that are laid out in the memo.  As President Plosser said, this is a journey that we should be on.  From the point of view of staff resources, we should now focus more on improving our communication with a consensus forecast using tools we already have and should put off development of a full-blown QMPR until later, benefiting from the experience that we have from developing the consensus forecast through the existing means.  Thank you very much", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I very much support trying to move forward to develop a consensus forecast and a quarterly monetary policy report, and I thank the subcommittee and Governor Yellen, for their efforts.  A lot of thought and I\u2019m sure a great deal of time went into this exercise.As I have noted before, where we are right now is not a good place.  The SEP is deeply flawed in a number of respects\u2014no linkage of the individual interest rate forecast to the individual forecasts of economic growth and inflation, the ongoing potential for a disconnect between the median SEP liftoff date relative to the liftoff date expressed in the FOMC statement, difficulties in assessing what changes in the SEP mean when changes in the composition of the Committee occur, such as Governor Powell\u2019s and Governor Stein\u2019s accession to this Committee. That has changed the SEP, but in ways that are not going to be obvious to the public.  And, lastly, the SEP unfortunately focuses attention very much on our differences rather than our similarities. We should take our time in doing this, and we should be willing to test several different approaches before going public.  A model in which the Chairman generates an initial consensus forecast before seeking outside input does have a number of attractive features.  It is not cumbersome, and it has the advantage that the individual Committee participants don\u2019t have to come up with their own forecasts.  Also, it presumably can be done within a relatively short period of time. It is going to be up to date as circumstances change. But there are several potential shortcomings to this type of approach that we at least need to note.  First, this approach could make the staff forecast very central to the process.  Not only could this make it more difficult for the staff, over time, to produce a truly independent arms-length forecast, but it also runs the risk that the consensus forecast would rest too heavily on a single model or perspective with respect to the economic outlook.  Second, and this is more important, a too-centralized approach without sufficient iteration might not lead to a true consensus.  This is critical because the goal should be to have the policy deliberations and judgments of the Committee match what is ultimately communicated in the monetary policy   report in terms of the consensus forecast.  If this doesn\u2019t all hang together, then we will still have a problem in that what we are communicating doesn\u2019t match how we are actually evaluating the outlook and the reaction function that we collectively use in the conduct of monetary policy.  For these reasons, it might be worthwhile trying out other alternatives as well, and I note in your comments, Mr. Chairman, that you introduced a wrinkle, which I think maybe goes in the right direction.  Conceivably, you could start the process with the Committee participant submissions of those who wish to do so.  The Chairman could then develop the first iteration of the consensus forecast from these submissions.  That is one alternative, and it might be interesting to try others.  Third, as others have said, in conducting these experiments we have to think very carefully about how robust the process is likely to be over time, as the composition of the Committee and the identity of the Chairperson changes.  I endorse what other people have said on that point. Now, in terms of a vote or not a vote, I have been wrestling with this.  It is not clear to me that a vote on the consensus forecast is absolutely necessary, but I do think that the process has to conclude in a way that there is an explicit endorsement of the outcome by the Committee.  This is necessary so that market participants will perceive that the forecast does in fact represent the Committee consensus.  Now, the endorsement doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be agreement about the consensus forecast itself, but, instead, could represent agreement that the consensus forecast is somehow a \u201cfair\u201d representation of the consensus.  In this latter case, the Committee participants could still endorse adoption of the consensus forecast, even if their own forecast differed in material ways from that consensus. In terms of the quarterly monetary policy report, I do think it is a good thing to work toward.  I\u2019d put the emphasis for right now, though, on developing a consensus forecast\u2014the monetary policy report can be the caboose, assuming we actually succeed in this first process", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In order not to repeat a lot of what has already been said, I don\u2019t have any concerns with an approach that meets all of the criteria that you laid out.  I am not certain how much stronger it is.  I agree with President Lockhart that we can come to a consensus on action; I am not sure we can come to a consensus on what led us to that action.  A lot of our discussions on communication have really been discussions about a level of consensus that I am not sure is possible with 19 different people. As we have gone around the room, everybody seems to have different ideas of what this idea actually means, and so I would be careful about that. I also agree with President Williams that we have to be careful and that this is not without cost.  And the trial period is particularly not without cost because if we are going to do this without increasing the burden on staff, it would imply that there is something we are not going to ask staff to do anymore after they start doing this", "  [Laughter] MS. DUKE.  When you are in a trial run, you are going to be doing both.  And so I think the trial period in particular will create some burden.  The second thing is that it seems to me this changes the timing of our process because if we are going to submit projections two weeks earlier, then I need the Tealbook two weeks earlier.  I know that wouldn\u2019t create any extra burden on staff.  And then, you would have the update to that Tealbook.  We do have to be careful on that. I would suggest a couple of things.  One is that we make a moratorium on other changes to our communication while we are testing this one.  We rushed out the changes adding the fed funds rate to the SEP, and we have now been unhappy with some of the things we learned about the peculiarities of the size of our Committee and the voters versus nonvoters.  I liked the suggestions that were made by Presidents Kocherlakota, Williams, and Plosser on ways to change the statement.  But I worry that if we go back to that, all of a sudden we are now changing our statement in ways that are pretty noticeable, and the public is going say, \u201cOkay, why are you changing that.  Is this the communication change that was foreshadowed in the minutes, or is it something else.\u201d If we think we have an idea of what we want to go to, we shouldn\u2019t do other things in the meantime.  And second, because this is going to create some burden, we should be clear that this takes a backseat to policy action.  We are in an arena where policy action might require an awful lot of staff time, and I would hate to see them torn between working on the new consensus forecast and working on what we are going to do at the next meeting.  That could create some conflicts. Finally, on the quarterly monetary policy report, we already have a semiannual monetary policy report to Congress, and it certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt to work on the format of that.  Most other central banks have shorter reports.  I can\u2019t imagine we\u2019d get any congressional complaints that our monetary policy report was too short or too skimpy, so we can certainly work on that as we are doing the monetary policy report.  But we are going to have to think of a way to make that report quarterly without also doubling the opportunities for the Chairman to appear in front of the Congress and explain what it is that we are doing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman, I was very struck by President Rosengren\u2019s suggestion that the experiment be in September.  I don\u2019t know what your thinking and Governor Yellen\u2019s thinking was on that", " MR. FISHER.  And then the second question relates to extending the MEP in the 6-to-30-year maturity range where we would end up holding one-third, according to this table.  With regard to exit, the sell side is always different than the buy side, and we are going to be holding a significant portion of the issuance in that maturity period.  Do you have any concerns about that; do you think we can ably negotiate our way through or sell our way through in a rising interest rate environment.  And how does it affect the buy side, those we would be selling to", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You have a similar number for three to six years. Oh, it\u2019s the fact that we don\u2019t own bills", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Understood.  The second question I had was on the fiscal cliff. From my perspective, it seems like you have an awfully mild impact of plunging over the fiscal cliff, especially given that you are at the zero bound with no ability to offset the fiscal cliff through monetary policy and the rest of the world is very weak.  You have the European economy in contraction.  For the U.S. economy you have a big fiscal contraction along with presumably a big confidence effect because if you plunge off the fiscal cliff, it is not just plunging off the fiscal cliff, but also a tremendous loss of confidence in the political process in the United States.  The CBO had, I think, a mild recession in 2013 but a deeper one than what you have.  And CBO was assuming that, absent any fiscal contraction, the economy would be growing 4.4 percent in calendar year 2013.  I\u2019m curious why plunging off the fiscal cliff in your view isn\u2019t more negative than what you had.  It seemed an awfully mild effect.  I wouldn\u2019t want the Congress getting its hands on that", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Two questions.  What is the Tealbook scenario for Europe going out two to three years.  What I have in mind is that the periphery countries are clearly not competitive, and they need some type of devaluation, which currently is being pursued as an internal devaluation along with austerity programs.  It is not hard to speculate that this is going to lead to political turmoil and be largely unsuccessful in most of those countries.  At any rate, one bookended alternative for Greece and other countries is exiting the euro and see how things play out afterwards.  The other end of the bookshelf is full fiscal union where the northern European countries and core Europe agree to some sort of transfers. That seems likely to lead to political turmoil, too, among a different segment of the populace.  And so I am wondering if somewhere in between is there an intermediate set of outcomes that are sustainable over some two-, three-, or five-year period; how does the situation play out, or is that the empty set.  You have to be thinking about this in your outlook", "   MR. ENGLISH.  Just one other point, though, on the optimal control policy. It has a lot of assumptions buried in it that we have talked about before here about the credibility of the assumed future behavior of the Committee.  The Committee is assumed to be able to credibly commit to a path for the funds rate, and that path is believed by the public and taken into account by the public.  And so if you wondered about the ability of the Committee to make that commitment, or if you wondered whether\u2014even if the Committee in some sense could commit to do that\u2014it would be believed, then this may not be a trajectory that you could necessarily get to", " MR. ENGLISH. Yes, I think that\u2019s right.  It represents a behavior that isn\u2019t necessarily consistent with past behavior", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to focus on the question of Greek exit.  I think we are throwing around the phrase \u201cexit\u201d very blithely here. What does exit actually mean.  And what can be achieved through exit.  As you know, there are two treaties in Europe for the EU and the EMU.  They have legal obligations within the European Union.  Greece could abrogate those treaties if it wanted to, because it\u2019s a sovereign country, but that would have a lot of implications for the nation.  It probably would not want to go that route.  It is supposed to have renounced printing its own currency.  I could imagine, nevertheless, it printing its own currency and having dual currencies.  So I think there are a lot of issues here that suggest that exit is not nearly as clean an event.  It is not like you wake up one Monday morning, and you say, \u201cOkay.  We have exited, and now we are going our separate ways.\u201d  It is a more complicated thing than that.  That is one thing I want to get my head around\u2014what you are thinking on that.  And the other is whether the more logical scenario is that there will just be ongoing restructuring of debt over several years, and so we gradually not pay a lot of the debt, or maybe all of the debt, for some of these countries", " MR. BOWMAN. That would depend on what the rest of the euro area does in response to that default.  If, while Greece is still running primary deficits, the euro area just cut off all payments, the banks would probably collapse anyway, right.  Greece could be facing a very severe recession even under those conditions.  It is matter of debate whether at that point it would be better off leaving the euro area and letting its currency depreciate a lot or trying to stay in", " MR. BOWMAN.  That\u2019s correct.  We look at the staff forecast versus consensus, assuming that we\u2019re right and they\u2019re wrong.  If we are more pessimistic, then we would expect commodity prices to fall as financial market participants learned over time that they had been too optimistic; we also correct for our forecast of movements in the dollar", " MR. BOWMAN.  Yes", " MR. FISHER.  The third point goes back to the international side.  What I am hearing from nonfinancial business operators is, of course, a concern about Europe because of all the uncertainty.  But I am also hearing increasing concern about China, and that goes to your second line of exhibit 3 of the charts.  And to go back to your expression, does this have legs. If you travel through the peripheral countries to China, Indonesia, all the way to Japan and Korea, or you visit with people like Lee Kuan Yew, in Singapore, there is a deep concern over China right now, much deeper than seems to be reflected in the numbers.  And I am just wondering\u2014 because we have tended to be a little bit more negative in the Tealbook, which is good because you have been right.  We know that there is a knock-on effect from Europe.  We can see a diminution in trans-Pac cargo flows from air or sea.  How bad do you think things are in China. Are they getting dramatically worse, or is it something we just need to monitor carefully.  What I am worried about is that Europe is a much-discussed risk factor, but I want to make sure we are not taking our eye off the Chinese ball, which seems to be increasingly complicated and more difficult.  So any comments on China.  And I know that the Chairman wants to pick up the pace here, but if you could do that quickly, thank you", " MR. BOWMAN.  Well, as we discussed, we believe that the risk of a hard landing has increased in China.  We did want to give ample room to China in my presentation, and the April and May data were unquestionably weaker than we had expected and, I think, than markets expected. And the real estate sector has been the source of potential risk for some time, and it is the source of concern.  Indicators, like the one I showed on the amount of unsold inventory, are a   worry, and there have been reports for a long time that real estate developers could be highly overexposed, which would then feed back to the banking system and feed into the nonperforming loans.  The Chinese authorities, to some extent, have attempted to engineer a housing slowdown, so the price declines that we have seen so far have been gradual and largely seem to have been desired on the part of the government.  Right now we don\u2019t see a severe contraction in real estate, but we are not trying to downplay the potential risks.  On the other side, though, we believe that the Chinese authorities have ample room to increase monetary or fiscal policy stimulus if there does appear to be a sharp slowing in economic growth.  In particular, in a year in which a political transition is going to take place, they have a lot of incentives not to see a sharp slowdown in economic growth. So we see slowing as a risk.  We don\u2019t think a sharp contraction is under way right now, and we do have some faith that there is ample room for policy stimulus.  It is not our baseline, but we do acknowledge that the risk has increased", " MR. PALUMBO. It is puzzling actually.  Given the proximity of these tail events especially, I would have thought we\u2019d see a much more elevated VIX.  When we were puttingthis together last week, the VIX was hovering in the mid-20s.  That seemed low but not outside the realm, and then subsequently the VIX moved down to 18 against nothing that I could see or even hear\u2014there wasn\u2019t even chatter about solace over the Greek election. It wasn\u2019t as if there was delusion in the reports.  They seemed to be negative and dire and focused on the adverse scenarios, but not showing up in the VIX.  All I can say is it\u2019s not the first time. The VIX can\u2014 as you made clear in your speech two weeks ago\u2014provide good information that we try to cull to get color on what investors are thinking in the tails.  But the VIX is not a terrific forecaster of what\u2019s going to happen.  In the summer of 2008 there were plenty of days when the VIX was trading in the 18s, more days when it was trading in the 18s than in the 30s.   I think it is just one of those things where, as Brian put it, we view financial markets as in a fragile state. When you look at the liquidity reports that you are hearing about short-term funding markets, those stresses seem to be getting a little worse day by day by day, even as measures like the VIX and the overall stock price index are actually reversing course.  So I do think there is an uncomfortable tension here, and at this point, I don\u2019t really take much solace from those latest moves.  Right now it\u2019s in the puzzle bucket as opposed to having relieved some tension, but we will just have to keep an eye on it", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our previous meeting, there has been a notable change in the incoming data.  Concerns about a global slowdown and escalating European problems have caused Treasury rates here and in other safe havens to fall, oil prices to decline, and consumer and business confidence measures to retrace earlier gains. These trends are also reflected in my forecast, which envisions less business fixed investment and employment than I had in my April forecast.  Business fixed investment was already weakening before European problems heated up, and my contacts with businesses around the District indicate no desire to increase investment or hire more workers until the uncertainty in the outlook is reduced.  Because of concerns among some firms that have significant trade exposure to Europe and others who will be affected by reductions in federal research and military spending, many of my contacts are more focused on possible retrenchment than possible expansion.  I now forecast the unemployment rate to remain at or above 8 percent through 2013 and the total and core PCE inflation rates to remain below 2 percent.  These outcomes are achieved conditional on assumption of appropriate monetary policy that both extends Operation Twist and engages in additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities. However, even this gloomy forecast is conditioned on Europe avoiding a severe outcome that would undoubtedly spill over to the United States.  This assumption is consistent with enlightened self-interest in Europe and seems consistent with the results from the recent Greek election.  Nonetheless, this assumption is becoming harder to maintain.  In discussions with Europeans since our previous meeting, I have been struck by the hardening of their positions and the view that it was not whether but when Greece would not be able to satisfy the conditions for continued aid.  This is in sharp contrast to views being expressed by Europeans last year.  Despite their increasing resignation about Greece\u2019s likely failure, few Europeans seemed confident that effective firewalls are being built. In safe havens around the world, longer-term interest rates have fallen below the inflation target set by the respective central banks. In the United States, the 10-year Treasury rate declined rapidly as Greek and Spanish problems escalated. For investors to purchase 10-yearTreasury securities well below our inflation target implies either significant skepticism that we will be hitting our inflation target or the expectation of a protracted period of a negative real policy rate, or both.  These assessments are, no doubt, motivated by financial market participants\u2019 assessments of the probability and possible severity of unfolding European problems. Similarly, wages and compensation continue to surprise on the downside, highlighting that labor costs are likely to continue to be very well contained.  Firms are describing being inundated with qualified applicants, causing them to lower the entry-level wages they are offering.  Discussions with officials at colleges and universities in New England continue to highlight the very challenging hiring environment for new graduates.  Many new graduates are forced to accept underemployment to avoid unemployment. The domestic economy is not growing fast enough.  With global pressures likely to continue to impede growth, with increasing signs that we may significantly undershoot our inflation target, and with fiscal restraint likely to increase, we should provide more monetary support for the economy, a topic for discussion tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I certainly agree with others that the forward momentum of the economy has slowed.  It seems that the earlier conundrum of relatively rapid job creation and a sizable decline in the unemployment rate versus more sluggish real GDP growth is being resolved by job growth slowing down and the unemployment rate flattening out rather than by GDP growth picking up.  But I also think that taking the most recent figures completely at face value may be a mistake because, as I have noted at the past two FOMC meetings, unusually mild winter weather may have pulled activity forward, so that now we are seeing some payback. If this is indeed the case, then activity would look artificially weak during the payback period.  Moreover, I think that there is some scope for a pickup in consumer spending, given that we have had a sharp drop in gasoline prices.  That will be providing a temporary boost to real disposable income, which until very recently had been quite anemic.  Nonetheless, I am still very worried about the outlook for economic growth and the lack of progress we have been making toward our objective on the employment side of our dual mandate for several reasons:  One is what I see in terms of the economic data.  Another is the fiscal cliff that President Lacker and others have commented on.  In our discussion with business people, they really do say that the uncertainty about how the fiscal cliff is going to be resolved is slowing growth now in terms of hiring and investing, irrespective of whether the fiscal cliff gets resolved in a good way or a bad way.  I think, if anything, that is going to intensify over the next six months.  In addition, I am obviously very concerned that the downside risks to economic growth have increased significantly.  People do see that, and I think that has an independent effect on household and business confidence. On the inflation side, I think we are likely to fall short of our 2 percent objective.  Not only is headline inflation falling quickly now because of the drop in oil and gasoline prices, but there is also little inflation pressure elsewhere in the system, notwithstanding some recent firmer readings on core inflation.  For example, many commodity prices have fallen recently\u2014it is not just oil and gasoline prices.  Labor compensation cost trends remain unusually muted.  If you put in a 1\u00bd percent productivity trend, unit labor costs are roughly running about \u00bd percent a year. And the dollar\u2019s recent strength should be another factor limiting import price inflation. In terms of downside risk, given what I said before, it is no surprise that I view Europe as the most significant one by far.  And I cannot overemphasize how dangerous the situation is.  I actually think that the Tealbook might be optimistic about how bad the effect on the U.S. would be if Europe broke up in a particularly messy way. If the situation in Europe goes the wrong way, we could see capital controls, ring fencing, and a total breakdown of financial market functioning.  And if that were to happen, the repercussions on us would be severe.  I think we understate the number of the different channels by which we would be affected.  It would affect our imports, the perceived health of our financial institutions, the state of financial conditions, general household and business confidence, market functioning, and possibly the credit intermediation process. I am a little skeptical that any model really captures all of those effects.  Obviously, we need to get ready for this as best as we can, and that means contingency planning\u2014and that is very much under way\u2014to deal with worst case scenarios.  The other thing we need to do with respect to Europe is think through now, if things go badly, how would we escalate on the policy front. There are really two elements of policy that we need to think about.  One is the monetary policy accommodation, supporting the macroeconomy, but two is how we would intervene to support financial market functioning.  I think we need to get that worked out in our minds today, so that if things go badly, we can respond in a timely way.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am supportive of alternative B, though I think there is a strong case to be made for alternative A.  My earlier remarks about the economic outlook imply that we should provide more monetary accommodation, and extending Operation Twist will provide some modest support.  However, I strongly suspect we will need to do more.  I remain very concerned about the international economic and financial outlook.  Because we\u2019re likely to miss on both elements of our mandate through the forecast horizon even without a crisis, ideally I would pursue asset purchase policies that expand our balance sheet.  However, I would support using swaps as the tool of choice if most expect us to remain close to our inflation target but continue to miss significantly on the unemployment target. In terms of swaps, if that is the preferred choice at this meeting, my own preference would be to swap short-term Treasury securities for mortgage-backed securities.  The housing market is showing some tentative signs of improvement, and we should provide additional support for an area that is both interest-sensitive and one of the sectors that has been an impediment to a more robust recovery. It seems to me increasingly likely that Greece will not meet its obligations to Europe, that Spanish banking problems will worsen, and that we and other central banks will need to act more forcefully. I also expect that at that time, we will need to consider 13(3) facilities, with the primary dealer facility the most likely candidate, because I am concerned that broker\u2013dealers will once again find it difficult to obtain short-term wholesale financing should we have another crisis.  We should begin to consider more-creative use of the discount window to focus on where asset spreads are particularly wide. Finally, we need to be prepared should international conditions seriously impair our outlook.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  If you don\u2019t mind, Mr. Chairman, thank you for clarifying that; it\u2019s good that it\u2019s going to be there.  But I don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re choosing\u2014and maybe others will be able to clarify this for me\u2014in June to describe the details of the program in that way, in the directive, whereas in September, we actually had it in the statement itself", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. If you go to the very end of the last sentence of B(3), it says something about \u201ceconomic conditions\u2014including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run.\u201d  Whereas in A(3) that\u2019s been crossed out, and it says that we\u2019re \u201cmaintaining exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate . . . in order to support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, . . ", "  MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m going to support alternative B as well. I have struggled with the nagging thought that there may be a plausible alternative, which is to hold off for now, wait and see how the economy and the situation in Europe evolve, and perhaps keep our remaining powder dry in case there\u2019s a need for coordinated intervention.  I do share many of the concerns raised around the table.  Briefly, to start back at the beginning, I am somebody who does see a substantial output gap, although I\u2019m mindful of the history and of the dangers of relying on contemporaneous estimates of it.  Nonetheless, I believe that the chances are that there\u2019s a substantial output gap now. However, I harbor real doubts about the efficacy of further balance sheet actions to close that.  So the argument is, why not try.  And that leads you straight to the issues that the Chairman raised succinctly at the beginning, which I continue to struggle with, particularly the thought that we\u2019re approaching the limits of asset purchases. I note that there is an article on FT Alphaville this morning talking about illiquidity and that being a bar to the MEP.  I mentioned this to Brian beforehand, and they\u2019re far ahead of Alphaville; I understand that.  But just to echo what President Pianalto and Governor Tarullo said, I\u2019d personally like to understand those limits much better.  To the extent it\u2019s possible to be more precise about what they are, I would love to do that.  But perhaps that\u2019s an argument for using further quantitative easing if we have to, beyond the MEP, as more of a defensive weapon going forward.  As I weigh the arguments against extending the MEP, in the end, I don\u2019t find them carrying the day, mostly because of the presence of significant financial market stress and the very real threat that it could get a lot worse.  This is a particularly bad time to withdraw accommodation.  And I agree with what Governor Stein said\u2014it\u2019s important that the Fed send the signal that we do have additionalammunition and we\u2019re prepared to use it.  I also would say that what is proposed is a relatively small program.  It doesn\u2019t cost us much to extend the program and let events clarify themselves. Finally, it\u2019s hard for me to say whether this action will have much of an effect on longer-term rates or produce the forecasted reduction in unemployment or the slight increase in inflation.  It does seem fairly likely to me, however, that it would produce more-accommodative financial conditions, by which I mean lower risk premiums, increased liquidity, and reduced risk aversion at the margin\u2014in the markets and, perhaps ultimately, in the real economy.  So, on that basis, I find myself in support of alternative B. Finally, I join the chorus of those urging the non-inclusion of paragraph 5.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think most of us agree that we\u2019re not making adequate progress toward our employment objective\u2014we don\u2019t expect that we will make adequate progress over the next year or two\u2014and that the downside risks to our outlook for economic growth predominate.  All of that implies to me, at least, that there is a good case for moving more forcefully now.  Nevertheless, I support alternative B at this meeting because I think we\u2019ll soon know a lot more about the economy and Europe and because the statement holds out the prospect for further action should some of the downside risks we face begin to be realized. I don\u2019t think the continuation of the maturity extension program would do very much\u2014it\u2019s just not that powerful\u2014and it could actually result in tighter financial conditions if it were viewed as ruling out a further large-scale asset purchase program.  Thus, to me, it\u2019s very important that the statement be written so as not to imply that the MEP extension precludes an additional LSAP\u2014in other words, that we\u2019re somehow out of ammunition.  I think that would be very damaging.  Alternative B, as written, does meet the test. I read it as saying   that we are extending the MEP through year-end and are open to stronger action should the situation continue to deteriorate. The question then is, what would that further action be.  Obviously, that depends on the circumstances. In terms of monetary policy actions, as opposed to special liquidity facilities, if we need to escalate, I\u2019d be most inclined toward another large-scale asset purchase program. I would favor agency MBS over Treasuries, at least at the start, because I think the MBS purchases work on two margins:  first, the level of long-term interest rates; and second, the spread between agency MBS yields and Treasury rates. However, the potential size of an MBS purchase program is constrained by the volume of new agency MBS production, and if we go beyond a certain point, we start to disrupt market functioning.  If you wanted to do something that was larger and more powerful\u2014say, going beyond $500 billion over the next 12 months\u2014 that would almost certainly argue that some portion of the purchases would have to be in Treasury securities. I would also strongly consider altering our forward guidance and working to see what could be done in a coordinated way with our foreign colleagues.  I can imagine that a coordinated LSAP program might be well received by markets. I think that seeing what could be done in terms of a long-term discount window lending program is something that we need to consider.  I do think, though, that we have to be very clear in that about what problem are we actually trying to solve with such a program, how operationally feasible it is, and how quickly it could actually be stood up.  I remember that during the crisis, there were a lot of proposals to do things, and then they took so long to come into effect that the programs actually turned out to be very ineffective.  Also, we should recognize that the Bank of England is doing this in conjunction with the U.K. Treasury, and so we also have to be very careful that we don\u2019t step beyond the border and do something that\u2019s actually engaging in fiscal action.  In terms of the statement, I frankly don\u2019t read A(3) as that different than B(3). I read it a couple of times, and I don\u2019t really read it as meaningfully different.  It\u2019s a very subtle distinction, and I think that changing the language would just confuse people:  \u201cWhy are you making this change.\u201d Regarding the KPW consortium and B\u2032, I\u2019m certainly open to going down that track in the future, and I encourage them to keep working on it.  I am really torn on paragraph 5.  I think it\u2019s an accurate statement of how we feel.  We should include it if we think it\u2019s reassuring; we should exclude it if we think it\u2019s scary.  And I\u2019ve read it a couple of times, and I can\u2019t decide\u2014 which way does it tilt. Is it reassuring, or is it scary.  So I could go either way on that. Finally, let me make one final point about communication.  We have these meetings, and some people don\u2019t always get what they like, and so the policy decisions of the Committee can diverge from what some of us would like to do individually.  It\u2019s very important, when people don\u2019t get their way or when they disagree with the policy choices, that they do not totally trash the policy choices that the Committee has made, because in totally trashing the policy choices that the Committee has made, you\u2019re basically undercutting the efficacy of that policy. For example, I think, President Fisher, using phrases like \u201croad to perdition\u201d just goes too far.  State why you disagree with the policy, state why you think the costs of the policy are greater than the benefits, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to then use such inflammatory phrases associated with the policy that we\u2019ve actually decided on, because it damages the Committee and the efficacy of the policy", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. That\u2019s not trivial.  And even though term premiums are very low and interest rates are very low, this program should work through a variety of channels, including other asset prices and spreads, and should have some beneficial effect on financial conditions.  I have some trouble with the argument that Europe has done the work for us.  It\u2019s true that European stresses have lowered our Treasury yields, but they have, at the same time, lowered stock prices, increased volatility, increased spreads, and strengthened the dollar.  If you put all of that together, you get an overall financial impulse that is a negative rather than a positive for economic growth.  I take many of the useful comments around the room very seriously, and I think we should consider ourselves in a watchful mode, trying to evaluate both the underlying situation in the economy and the global risks that we are currently facing.  With respect to the language\u2014Steve, today has been pretty calm, I think, in Europe.  Is that correct", " MR. LOCKHART. Can we really support to the general public that the lower 10-year bond rate, combined with zero-lower-bound interest rates and a fluctuating equity market,  constitutes tighter conditions. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to resonate with everyone out there. We\u2019re really referring to conditions that are related to Europe, it strikes me", " MR. SACK. Given the movement in equities, other risk prices, and the strengthening of the dollar, it seems that financial conditions broadly are tighter.  Yes, the fall in yields is a partial offset to that, but we think the net effect is clearly tighter financial conditions", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  By a nose", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. How about, \u201cand some tightening\u201d\u2014I-N-G\u2014\u201cin financial conditions, the Committee expects economic growth . . .\u201d  Okay", " MS. DUKE.  Yes.  I was in favor of it, but with this much discomfort with it, I think I\u2019d be more comfortable leaving it alone"], "2012FOMC20120801meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I compliment the staff for an excellent trio of papers providing an overview of a large subject.  I have two general comments in reaction to this.  The first one is that there were some findings that were quite a surprise to me, although they probably shouldn\u2019t have been.  In hindsight, I probably should have expected this.  What I\u2019m referring to is where the memo showed that the frequency distribution of liftoff dates is relatively broad and flat, covering a wide range of plausible dates. I think I was assuming that if you took a given model and a given rule\u2014if you wanted to place a lot of confidence in one model and one rule\u2014you\u2019d have liftoff dates fairly tightly bunched around your modal forecast of a liftoff date.  Instead, the results showed that even with a given model and a given rule, you should be relatively agnostic about when it\u2019s likely for us to lift off.  Then you back away from certainty about the model and the rule, and you\u2019re going to get more uncertainty because you don\u2019t quite know the model and you\u2019re not sure which rule characterizes good policy, and so on.  This was a really striking finding to me\u2014and I know we\u2019re not going to talk about policy now, but it\u2019s about policy rules.  To me, this suggests that the proponents of the forward-guidance language we have in the statement now really need to reconcile the certainty that is conveyed by the language in the statement with the agnosticism that the staff\u2019s analysis suggests ought to  July 31\u2013characterize our assessment of liftoff date. You might have some strong views, but you need some explanation of how you reconcile the staff\u2019s results with that relative certainty that\u2019s expressed in the statement. The second comment has to do with a couple of issues.  The memo describes circumstances in which first-difference rules are relatively attractive.  One is that the more that expectations are forward looking, the better first-difference rules do relative to alternatives. I would just point out in this context that over the last at least 10 years or so that I\u2019ve been involved with the FOMC, I\u2019ve seen the staff move decidedly in the direction of  adopting the approach of assuming expectations are more forward looking, both in their analysis of the economy and in their analysis of policy.  It\u2019s obvious that the profession moved decidedly in that direction as well, although the timing might have been different.  To me this is an argument in favor of giving first-difference rules a little more weight.  The staff also points out that uncertainty about the natural rate favors first-difference rules, and, obviously, there\u2019s a large literature on this\u2014for example, Orphanides and Williams\u2014documenting historical evidence that misjudgments about the natural rate can lead to pretty serious policy errors.  The only thing I\u2019d add to this is that while there\u2019s been research out there, I don\u2019t think it takes on board necessarily the extent to which\u2014and this is extra evidence here\u2014that within the Committee, there\u2019s a tremendous range of views about the natural rate.  And in this regard, you made a comment, Jon, that ignoring the level of the gap seems to go too far, and as I listen to you, I think you base that on two things.  One is that when the output gap is really large, we should care about it.  We do care about a large output gap.  And the other was that large output gaps tend to be persistent.  Well, there are estimates of the output gap based on DSGE models in which the output gap is smaller.  Moreover, that\u2019s the welfare-relevant gap in those models.  The argument that we care   July 31\u2013about large gaps is based on some less-than-agnosticism about the level of the gap; it\u2019s based on some views about the gap.  And then I think it is true as well that in DSGE models, those gaps are less persistent than the ones based on a notion of potential that imposes a substantial amount of smoothness on the estimate of potential.  The argument seems to be, well, the first-difference rule is really good if you don\u2019t know much about the output gap, but we do know enough to say you shouldn\u2019t ignore the rule.  Those are my two comments about the rules, and again, I commend the staff", "  [Laughter] MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  But the point is that you can even follow a fairly mechanistic rule and still have a probability distribution for liftoff that is even further out in the future than the statement might be interpreted as having", " MR. EVANS.  Could I just ask a question of President Plosser.  I\u2019m really puzzled over the logic behind why, at this point in the economic cycle, we would want to be carrying on an evaluation of these rules in terms of normal times when we are far from normal times. It\u2019s akin to thinking that if I wanted to carry around a radio that is the best radio under normal conditions, I might choose a model that\u2019s got lots of bells and whistles and really takes a tremendous amount of energy and drains the batteries quickly; but that\u2019s okay because normally I can plug it in and recharge it or whatnot.  However, then I find myself on Gilligan\u2019s Island where the transistor radio runs out of batteries within about two hours, and I want to make it last for however long it takes. It seems to me like what you\u2019re describing is a perfectly reasonable approach to how we   July 31\u2013would evaluate normal approaches to policy, but at the moment we want to think about the special features", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to thank the staff as well for an interesting set of memos concerning policy rules. I do think this is a fascinating literature, and one that very much informs the debate here at the FOMC.  It\u2019s one that I have tried to contribute  July 31\u2013to myself, and I know many around the table have also done work on the topic.  I have several remarks on the memos. I\u2019m just going to list them, and then I\u2019ll expand on them a little bit.  The first remark is that it\u2019s pretty clear that this literature is not mature enough to give good advice on the commitment of actual policymakers to a particular policy rule.  Accordingly, I think that the policy rules discussion has to remain a step outside the actual policymaking process, which is sort of how I view it now\u2014that it\u2019s informing the process, but the Committee does not actually commit to a particular rule.  The second comment is that much of the discussion and analysis has the flavor of lining up the adoption of a policy rule with the date of liftoff in the policy rate.  This echoes some of the earlier comments. I think that this is inconsistent with the idea that the reason the Committee is naming a potential liftoff date is to suggest a commitment to staying at the zero bound longer than would otherwise be called for by ordinary policy. I\u2019ll expand on that a little bit in just a minute. The third comment is that in much of the analysis the ties to household utility are weak.  In my view, policymakers should not be free to choose objective functions arbitrarily as is done in parts of this analysis, but should be required to map policy actions back to the welfare of actual households inside the model.  Comment four is that I would suggest evaluating the rule somewhat more holistically based on long-run simulations.  Committing to these rules means committing to keep unemployment higher than it would otherwise be in some states of the world.  I\u2019d like to see what those states are and how long they would last, and ask whether the Committee is willing to accept this feature of committing to a policy rule.  Number five is that in many models in this class, the worst policy is the so-called interest rate peg policy.  Such a policy inside the model allows many possible equilibrium outcomes.  The rules suggested here have the policy rate unchanged for years and years,July 31\u2013approximating the interest rate peg policy. This could be viewed as an additional and much more virulent\u2014Richard, is \u201cvirulent\u201d a word", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, if I heard your question correctly, I have spent enough time with Finn Kydland to do two things: One is to appreciate microbreweries because he has become quite good at it\u2014and oddball wines\u2014and the other is to appreciate the value of using a rule to develop a perspective on policy.  There is a strong theoretical case for developing a rule.July 31\u2013The question is, how do we develop a rule for the world that we currently live in. My colleague just touched on this\u2014not only are we at the zero bound, but we are post-crisis.  And one of the things I have had a problem with, and I have discussed at great length with John Taylor, is this whole issue of an output gap.  You and I have had discussions on this, but how do you define an output gap in a globalized world. Jim just referred to globalization.  I think that\u2019s one of the issues that I\u2019m not sure we properly take account of, and I wonder\u2014and this is a question, again, not being as sophisticated as other people at this table\u2014about the degree to which we tend to think in terms of a closed economy when we develop these rules, and how much we can possibly develop a rule, not just against a zero bound, but in the kind of world that we actually live in.  It\u2019s just not clear to me if we can easily do that.  I think the subject should be pursued.  I thought Jon did a great job in his presentation.  I must say, I actually enjoyed reading these memos.  I thought the Philadelphia memo raised some very good questions, not only questions about a real-time data problem but also about the zero bound.  And it also hinted at\u2014at least the way I read it\u2014the concern about globalization.  So it is not clear to me that this is doable, but I understand the theory behind wanting to do it. Just two other quick points.  On page 12 of the longer memo there was a sentence that really caught my eye. It said, \u201cAn impairment of the transmission mechanism would call for more accommodative conventional monetary policy than that implied by the simple rules, all else equal.\u201d I wonder about that.  To me, it represents just pouring it on.  And the question is, why not try to affect the transmission mechanism rather than increase the quantity of accommodation.  I know that\u2019s not what we\u2019re talking about here, but that did catch my eye.  The second issue I have is that none of this addresses whether these were the right outcomes. If you look at that exhibit 1, the rule may have led this Committee to lead to a very low interest rate   July 31\u2013environment prior to 2005 and 2006.  Was it the right decision to raise rates as quickly as we did.  The reason I mention all of this\u2014again from a less sophisticated perspective than President Lacker or our other two interlocutors\u2014is that these are simple questions that I think we need to address in order to be effective.  And then, also constantly asking ourselves, does the rule lead us in the right direction.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FAUST. Here\u2019s the answer that I think is most appropriate to that.  The whole simple rules literature attempted to distill some truths that are out there across all the models and imbed them in a rule.  That\u2019s great. Now, if we were in a position right now to distill some truths about current circumstances that we could all agree about\u2014did we fill the hole with past LSAPs; are labor markets functioning in a standard way.\u2014then maybe we could have a simple rule that would be appropriate.  But in my view, we get into a bit of a stone soup situation if we say, \u201cI really like simple rules if we just adjust for A\u2014and then B\u2014and then better adjust for C and D.\u201d  And then we\u2019ve left the simple rule behind.  And from the standpoint of the staff, there\u2019s a problem that if you come up with an adjustment that encompasses myriad factors, the appropriate response by the policymakers who would like help could be, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that.  What\u2019s in that adjustment.\u201d  And then we\u2019d go back to discussing A and B and C.  It\u2019s a complex situation, and maybe we should go back to Einstein here; it\u2019s not amenable to a simple characterization. I am particularly reticent to recommend:  \u201cThere\u2019s this one adjustment on which we have a bit of theory and that only holds in certain models.  It\u2019s not robust across models, but at least we have some theory that tells us what that number would be.  Let\u2019s goJuly 31\u2013ahead and add that one in.  We\u2019ll leave the other adjustments vague.\u201d  That strikes me as particularly dangerous because you might attribute a false precision to a single adjustment.  You could goad the staff into providing more information about each of these things that we\u2019re saying one needs to adjust for.  Well that\u2019s we are trying to do; we\u2019re working pretty hard on that, as are your staffs. It\u2019s a complicated topic, and we\u2019ll report back as frequently as we have something useful to say", " MR. POTTER.  I have confidence in the short run in the gross issuance in the agency MBS market being quite strong.  The memo was reasonably clear that in year two we have less confidence.  There is model error in the prepayment speed, we could affect the total that we\u2019re buying because of the reinvestments, and the conditioning assumptions are more likely to deviate in practice from what we assume", " MS. PIANALTO.  Mr. Chairman, it would also be helpful to have that information under different interest rate scenarios because obviously you\u2019re making some assumption about where longer-term rates are going to be, especially in those out-years.  So it would be helpful to have some different interest rates scenarios", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A question for David Wilcox.  If I understand your discussion of the fiscal cliff, you assume it will be avoided in the baseline, but you treat it as a risk to the baseline.  Are you picking up any indications that it is already here. That is to say, in terms of employment, investment, contract renewal, or procurement, have you seen any indications that there is a discounting of the possibility of it that is already affecting behavior in advance of the deadline", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  One, I want to follow up on President Lockhart\u2019s question about the issue of the fiscal cliff. I thought his question\u2014 excuse me for paraphrasing\u2014in part has to do with the fact that if the data we see today already reflect a slowing economy because people are anticipating a fiscal cliff and changing their behaviors now, then there is a question of how you would interpret the current data versus add-on effects that would come when the fiscal cliff actually occurs.  I thought his question was, how are you parsing that assessment.  Or are you assuming that the fiscal cliff is irrelevant until it actually occurs", " MR. BULLARD.  And, therefore, they\u2019re going to look a little constricted compared with maybe the true amount of uncertainty that might be sitting there", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In January when we adopted the end of 2014 language, the full SEP range for real GDP for 2012 was 2.1 to 3 percent.  Six months later, and with additional easing through the MEP, the revised consensus growth rate for real GDP in 2012 is 1.8 percent\u2014weaker than any of us thought last January and with more accommodative monetary policy than many of us submitted.  In retrospect, the economic data have come in much softer than any of us thought.  How likely is it that we are repeating this mistake.  I am concerned that while the consensus forecast has been written down from the June SEP, the consensus forecast for this year remains too optimistic.  The July employment report produced only 80,000 jobs, and real final sales rose at only a 1.2 percent rate in the second quarter.  The revised consensus forecast expects real GDP growth to be 2 percent in the second half of this year.  With 2 percent growth in the first quarter, this would imply the weakness of the secondJuly 31\u2013quarter was an anomaly. An alternative viewpoint would be that concerns about Europe and the fiscal cliff intensified in the second quarter, causing households and businesses to retrench and that the second quarter to be much weaker than the first. What is the likelihood that businesses and households will believe that the fiscal cliff or European problems will be of less concern very soon.  My conversations with a wide variety of businesses and financial market participants suggest that they believe the problems will likely intensify in the second half of this year.  They are not anxious to hire or invest until there is much clearer resolution of both problems.  In particular, few on either side of the Atlantic seem confident that Greece is on a sustainable path, or that adequate firewalls exist. Furthermore, I don\u2019t know anyone who expects a quick resolution of the fiscal cliff.  I, unfortunately, agree with this assessment, and, thus, I am concerned that the consensus forecast is too high.  Without substantial additional accommodation, we will once again be underestimating the likely persistence of recent weak economic data. While we can do little to resolve problems in Europe or to address the fiscal cliff, it does not imply there is nothing monetary policy can do.  Mortgage rates have come down as a result of our actions and the flight to quality.  There are tentative signs that this is having an effect on the housing market, which, as several people have noted, is beginning to improve.  I am particularly heartened that we are seeing some regional variation in housing markets, with stronger markets, such as Boston, experiencing housing price appreciation.  Not only prices of single-family houses, but also condo prices are increasing in Boston, and, interestingly, many Realtors are reporting a surprising number of all-cash sales.  Given the improvement in sentiment, and the low interest rates for creditworthy borrowers, it is interesting that cash sales seem to be on the rise. With apartment rents rising in many markets, and real estate prices   July 31\u2013improving in many markets, now would seem to be a good time to clearly generate a self-sustaining domestic housing recovery, by looking for ways to convince people that both the costs and availability of financing makes this a propitious time to buy.  Even if the cost and availability of credit is not the cause of the current slowdown, it can help prevent the slowdown from becoming more severe. I fear that monetary policy has been assuming we are the Roadrunner and that our momentum will carry us over any short-term chasms. In reality, we risk being more like Wylie Coyote as we once again realize that we have paused without solid ground beneath us.  The Roadrunner accelerates across the chasm; the coyote does not. It is time to mimic the Roadrunner.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At our last meeting, I downgraded my economic growth outlook based on the weak incoming data and the increased strains in Europe.  And since then, the disappointing news has continued to accumulate.  It is clear that the economy has less momentum than it originally appeared.  And as a result, I have downgraded my near-term forecast yet again. The song remains the same: The economy continues to be weighed down by household sector deleveraging, tight credit, and fiscal consolidation.  In addition, the looming fiscal cliff and the European financial crisis are undermining confidence and pose significant downside risks to the outlook. Regarding fiscal policy, I expect\u2014or, maybe more actually, hope\u2014that some kind of agreement will be reached to prevent us from driving off the cliff.  Even so, many of my contacts continue to tell me, as others have said, that uncertainty about government spending and taxes is already restraining hiring, spending, and investment.  Moreover, the nation\u2019s broader long-term fiscal problems are unlikely to be resolved no matter what agreement is reached later this year orJuly 31\u2013early next year. I\u2019m echoing here a comment President Fisher made; the sad truth is that the best that we can hope for is that Washington kicks the can down the road.  And that approach hasn\u2019t worked so well in Europe.  I also want to think about this option-value argument.  It is hard for me to imagine that in January of 2013 we are going to have significantly less uncertainty, given the fact that we are talking, really, about kicking the can down the road on the Bush tax cuts and a lot of other things.  Maybe uncertainty is getting worse and worse right now, but I don\u2019t see it really becoming that much less next year. For its part, the European crisis is damping our exports, squeezing corporate profits, and unsettling financial markets.  European authorities have made some promising moves recently to support Spanish banks and establish a single euro-wide banking supervisor.  And my forecast, like the Tealbook, assumes that the European crisis won\u2019t spin out of control, and the euro area will experience only a relatively mild recession this year.  However, while my heart wants to believe that European policymakers will act decisively when the time comes, my mind reminds me that previous declarations and promises brought only temporary relief. In the future, the euro area now seems to hinge on whether Spain and Italy are, if I may use the expression, too big to fail.  Alternatively, it could be that they are too big to save.  The fact is that a concrete, comprehensive, and credible\u2014those are three C\u2019s\u2014solution to the European problem is still out of reach.  That leaves Europe at a risk of a longer, deeper recession, which would undoubtedly intensify financial and economic strains in our own country. These, then, are the hurdles the economy must surmount\u2014relatively little underlying momentum, a looming fiscal cliff, and a protracted European crisis.  Together, they are offsetting a significant portion of the monetary accommodation we are providing.  This can be seen by a variety of private-sector and Federal Reserve financial condition indexes. Many of the variables  July 31\u2013in these indexes are forward looking, and as a result, the indexes can provide useful signals about future GDP growth during periods of stress, such as the one that we have been experiencing. Although these indexes show a clear improvement in financial conditions since the depths of the 2008\u20132009 crisis, they indicate relatively little additional progress since late 2010. More importantly, the recent readings are generally nearer their long-term average levels despite the dramatic increase in monetary stimulus that we have introduced. By my staff\u2019s estimates, current financial conditions point to, at best, only moderate economic growth. Since our June meeting, I lowered my real GDP forecast for 2012 by about \u00bc percentage point.  I now forecast 1\u00be percent growth this year and 2\u00bc percent in 2013.  This moderate pace of economic growth is somewhat higher than the Tealbook projection, but that is only because I assumed considerable additional monetary stimulus.  In particular, I assumed that the fed funds liftoff is in the first half of 2015.  I also assume further expansion of the Fed\u2019s balance sheet through open-ended purchases of mortgage-backed securities.  Absent this additional stimulus, my forecast would foresee no progress on our employment mandate until 2014.  Even with this added stimulus, I expect only modest progress on closing the unemployment gap over the next two years. Finally, let me turn to inflation.  The recent data have come in more or less as expected, and I haven\u2019t changed my medium-term inflation forecast much. I expect overall PCE inflation to come in below our 2 percent target, both this year and next, reflecting subdued compensation costs, as we saw in the latest ECI, and import price inflation. In terms of commenting on the consensus forecast, given the assumed policy path in the consensus forecast, my forecast would be more pessimistic about economic growth and the unemployment rate and would have lower inflation", " MR. BULLARD.  I think we flip between sometimes using the arguments that come out of Woodford and his coauthors, which are based on what I\u2019m talking about, and sometimes going to just straight empirical evidence that might be kind of distant from what that theory is talking about.  And that creates confusion around the table", " MR. KILEY.  We maintain a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model with sticky prices and sticky wages and a number of financial frictions.  That model has a particular model of the labor market that does include unemployment, and so there is a natural rate of unemployment that corresponds to the flexible price natural rate.  When we look at that, it\u2019s really quite smooth, consistent with other research like that of Gal\u00ed, Smets, and Wouters, where it looks like the natural rate of unemployment is quite smooth, and you can attribute most of the fluctuations in the unemployment rate within a DSGE framework to fluctuations in \u201caggregate demand,\u201d although within the DSGE framework, people don\u2019t use that kind of language very often.  I would also note that in a framework like that, it\u2019s exactly true that when there are only sticky prices and wages and not much dynamics and not too much capital, the social welfare function basically has in it the output gap that President Bullard described. In a more complicated world, though, other factors may be involved.  For example, our DSGE model takes into account the fact that there are different sectors of production, that the prices in different sectors might be different, that there might be different wages and different wage adjustment processes in those different sectors, and that there may be financial frictions. In all of those distortions, the world is just not the same as one in which welfare is maximized simply by closing the output gap.  For example, research at the Cleveland Fed shows that you want to take  July 31\u2013into account impediments in the credit system\u2014that those lower welfare and those enter the social welfare function.  So I do think that the analysis we have\u2014and it\u2019s only one model; other models would provide different answers\u2014is perfectly consistent with the view that a modern macro model would have a reasonable unemployment gap in it.  And that theory is consistent with the view that, like you do around the table, you want to take into account many factors in thinking about how to achieve social welfare", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Just to follow up, I like the idea of having a little more flexibility between mortgages and Treasuries.  If the constraint is the ultimate capacity\u2014let\u2019s say if you\u2019re doing $1 trillion\u2014would there be any reason not to start with more heavily weighting the mortgages at the outset and then, if there were issues that were cropping up, to reduce the amount of mortgages over time. Alternative A has fixed proportions over time, but would it be  July 31\u2013beneficial to have a more flexible program that focuses more on mortgages at the outset and then, as problems crop up, if they do crop up, to alter that allocation", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think there\u2019s an issue of what actually gives you the most bang for buck.  On the one hand, you could argue that buying Treasuries gives you a bigger bang for buck because of the longer-duration asset.  On the other hand, you could argue that agency MBS gives you more bang for buck because you\u2019re working on two margins\u2014not just the level of long-term rates, but also the spread between mortgages and Treasuries\u2014and it\u2019s more directly related to the housing market.  I think there are two separate issues here.  One, what\u2019s the magnitude of bang for buck for Treasuries versus agency MBS.  And then, two, what are the capacity constraints, and how quickly do you run into the market functioning issues.  My personal opinion\u2014I was going to save this until my comments later, but I think it\u2019s probably germane to say it now\u2014is that I would like the staff to do a little bit more work on these issues of what gives you the most bang for buck and what are the cost\u2013benefit tradeoffs as you push further down in terms of the potential risks to market functioning.  I look at the alternative A numbers as a little bit of a placeholder until we do some additional work that will allow us to have a deeper discussion about what that split should be and how much flexibility there should be as it evolves over time", " MR. POTTER.  The 6 to 30", "  MR. BULLARD.  Could I map some of the confidence bands that are around, say, the consensus forecast exercise. Could I put those on this", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Yes. The policies in both cases are designed to cause the economy to settle down at the assumed equilibrium, which is an unemployment rate of 5\u00bd percent and inflation at 2 percent", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Several people have alluded to their concern about how we prepare for when we will have significant clarity about the outlook. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue that we have right now.  Given the very substantial downside risks, I think we should be preparing to avoid a wake.  While I support alternative A, as does President Evans and President Williams, it appears the Committee needs more time. However, with a July 31\u2013forecast that misses on both elements of the mandate, there should be a strong presumption that we implement alternative A at the next meeting. I am concerned that alternative B is still too restrained.  I would change the language from \u201clate 2014\u201d to \u201cmid-2015.\u201d  Failing to do so would indicate that we are impervious to the fact that six months have elapsed and the outlook is worse than when we implemented the \u201clate 2014\u201d guidance. I also support lowering the interest on reserves.  With three-month Treasuries much lower than 25 basis points, I see no reason to maintain such an elevated rate.  As was highlighted in the staff\u2019s comments, the ECB\u2019s reduction of their deposit rate has not generated severe dislocations in money markets in Europe. In terms of the asset purchases, I would prefer a heavier weighting toward mortgage-backed securities.  As Governor Stein mentioned yesterday, we should be focusing on programs where spreads remain wide. I would support paragraph 3 in alternative A if it was clear that we currently expect the program to last at least a year.  The LSAPs will not be effective if the markets expect that the action could be quickly reversed.  Finally, I would consider how we could utilize the discount window to more clearly signal a desire to increase Main Street lending. It is becoming increasingly difficult to explain that we still have tools but we are not using them despite a weakening forecast and missing on both elements of the mandate. Given the strong possibility of further weakening, I am concerned that a shock from Europe not only places us in danger of continuing to miss on both elements of the mandate, but also raises questions about whether we can credibly hit either element of our mandate. The least-credible central bank in the developed world right now is Japan\u2014not because of too much inflation; not because they didn\u2019t increase their balance sheet, as the balance sheet has increased significantly.  They\u2019re not credible because they did too little too late.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I\u2019d just reinforce the point that I think the channel of the cost of capital affecting business fixed investment is actually probably one of the weaker channels, as opposed to one of the more powerful channels", " MR. FISHER.  Obviously, I disagree.  We all talk about the fiscal cliff and the uncertainties that derive from it.  It\u2019s a reality, and you made the message yourself, Mr. Chairman, as you said.  I would include it", " MR. LACKER.  I agree with President Kocherlakota.  I\u2019d take it out", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Actually, I have three differences with the forecast, but they\u2019re qualitatively quite different in importance. The first two differences are due to a different   July 31\u2013assessment of the current state of the economy.  I think there\u2019s less slack than most of you do, and that leads me to favor less accommodation", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  President Lacker, I believe the table has in it a forecast for the federal funds rate. I\u2019m trying to explain why my forecast of the federal funds rate would differ from that in this table", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. I don\u2019t view these differences in terms of policy as being that critical.  At any given point in time, we\u2019re going to have heterogeneous views of the size of the gap.  The point of a consensus forecast is to aggregate as best as possible our heterogeneous views.  And I think the current consensus forecast does that in a fair and reasonable way. But my last concern of the three is that the consensus forecast appears to imply that the Committee\u2019s objective function over inflation and unemployment is inconsistent with the Committee\u2019s January statement of principles, and this is a much more significant issue for me. Basically, my point is that the consensus forecast is much more important than what the Committee thinks is going to happen; it\u2019s a way for communicating what the Committee is trying to make happen. And I think this forecast, as written, is not consistent with our longer-term strategies. In terms of my own forecast, as I\u2019ve said before, I think the output gap is less negative than is implied by this. Essentially, I look at measures of utilization\u2014at capacity utilization, average weekly hours, the box on labor shortages on pages 10 to 11 of the Tealbook A\u2014and I would say everything, though, indicates that slack is roughly equivalent to early 2004.  Here, IJuly 31\u2013guess I disagree slightly with Governor Powell that it matters whether the output gap is minus 4 percent or minus 2 percent.  And if you go back to late 2004, the FOMC estimated the output gap to be minus 1.4 percent, inflation was actually running lower than it is right now, and the FOMC was raising rates.  And they certainly had less accommodation in place.  So my view is that I expect inflation to be rising more rapidly than is in this consensus forecast.  I think it\u2019ll be rising to over 2\u00bd percent by mid-decade, and I favor less accommodative policy than is described in table 1 as a result.  But the name of this forecast is \u201cconsensus,\u201d not \u201cunanimous.\u201d If these were the only differences, I would be comfortable with table 1 being used as a description of the consensus forecast of the Committee in a press conference, Mr. Chairman. However, I see my final difference as being considerably more material.  I think that most of us would agree that by changing the proposed path of monetary policy, we can affect the inflation rate and unemployment rate in 2014.  So the forecasts for 2014 inflation and 2014 unemployment are actually saying something about what we\u2019re trying to achieve for those variables in 2014.  And by doing that, it\u2019s signaling how we\u2019re applying policy to trade off unemployment versus inflation in response to future shocks.  The Committee voted in January to follow a balanced approach to the dual mandate.  The consensus forecast in table 1 seems inconsistent with a balanced approach.  As I highlighted earlier, the consensus forecast says that inflation will be 1.8 percent in 2014 and unemployment will be 7.6 percent.  A balanced approach would indicate, I believe, that the Committee should be providing more accommodation in order to generate inflation above 2 percent.  And this matters because, Mr. Chairman, as I said, I think the benefit of a consensus forecast is that it tells people what we\u2019re trying to achieve, and that, I think, feeds into Governor Raskin\u2019s perspective that it\u2019s importantJuly 31\u2013for people to know what we\u2019re trying to achieve with our policy in order for the policy to have as much effectiveness as possible.  Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota is saying that he disagrees with the forecast on the grounds that the monetary policy underlying it is not one he agrees with it", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. So you want a more stimulative monetary policy to generate a higher inflation outcome", "  But if we start opening it up to everybody\u2019s appropriate policies\u2014 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think you could dissent on the action, for example, because you thought that this wasn\u2019t accommodative enough, and then you could say, \u201cWell,   July 31\u2013conditional on what the Committee has decided to do, I think this is an appropriate forecast.\u201d Does that sound right", " MR. EVANS.  Right", " MR. EVANS.  Yes", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You still might say, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t care for this policy path.  But given this policy path, I\u2019m okay with this forecast", " MS. YELLEN.  I agree with that, except you have people who have actually voted in favor of no action today who are very strongly inclined toward action in the very near future, like me.  I\u2019m looking at this forecast, I\u2019m with President Evans.  As far as the economics go, I\u2019m fine with it, but it really calls into question the appropriateness of the policy.  And so I guess I\u2019ll say\u2014sorry, I guess I\u2019m taking my turn\u2014that I have significant reservations.  I would think you would want to be able to walk into a press conference and be able to say\u2014when you discuss this July 31\u2013forecast, of course\u2014something along the lines of:  \u201cMany participants, including those who voted for it, are concerned about the contours of it and understand that it points toward additional action under some conditions,\u201d or something like that", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the subcommittee should discuss it, but I guess if you disagree to the extent that you think it seriously misrepresents what your policy inclinations are, that might be a basis for not agreeing with it", " MS. GEORGE.  I found myself agreeing with the economic variables, but I might choose a different policy path\u2014different enough that I might raise a question", " MR. LACKER.  I\u2019ll now go on to deliver a lengthy statement. I\u2019m assuming that\u2014but this is a little murky for me\u2014the intention is that this would supplant the SEP mechanism.  Is that correct", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, I thought this was a very useful exercise. The issues that Governor Yellen raised in terms of participants providing input and circulating inputs\u2014those things would be very helpful and we should continue to make progress on them.  I was listening to Dennis very carefully, and I thought I was in complete agreement with him right up until he got to that subjective probability stuff, and then I wasn\u2019t quite sure.  But then again, I was with Vice Chairman Dudley, too, until he started with three different assumptions.  I think those are all very interesting ideas, and if we have a lot of time to work through them, they\u2019ll be quite useful.  [Laughter] As I say, I like the initial exercise; as a communication device for the Committee, it was useful.  It focused on our areas of agreement, which I thought was very useful.  A lot of times, with the SEPs, for some reason our eyes are drawn to the outliers and the ranges.  I thought that the common monetary policy assumption was really critical, because I might not agree with it, but at least, you tell me this is the assumption, and then I\u2019ll tell you what my inflation outlook is going to be.  President Lacker will approach it the same way, right.  And that\u2019ll provide a lot of the information that\u2019s relevant for this.  Another alternative might be if you identify who the participant is and I have some idea of the kind of model of the economy that person is working their way through, there\u2019ll be more information, but probably not a tremendous amount.  At any  July 31\u2013rate, it could be useful.  Frankly, I think what\u2019s really important here is whatever helps you in your press conference discuss the outlook in a coherent fashion.  You always do it coherently, but you\u2019re provided a collection of forecasts that don\u2019t speak well among themselves because we have different policy assumptions.  I would think that something that you have looked at very carefully, and in some sense own, would help facilitate your discussions, and it would be useful if you provided some preferences on that.  But I think that it will be useful to continue to make progress.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  What do you mean by that.  Do you mean a single point path for the funds rate or a reaction function", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard", " MS. DUKE.  I\u2019m going to confess that I\u2019m not finding this helpful at all.  I find it hard to even follow all of the subtleties of everybody\u2019s expression of whether or not they agree with the consensus forecast.  When I try to think of how you condense this into a simple message that you\u2019re going to communicate to the public, it\u2019s really hard for me to come down to that.  I think it would be helpful if we started with something that we all thought in common, and then tried to see how far apart we were. In terms of the policy assumption, it seems to me that it\u2019s a good idea to start from a single policy assumption. If the single policy assumption is, \u201cIf we do nothing different than what we had said at the last meeting, what would you expect the forecast to be, based on incoming data.\u201d that at least says, to me, that everybody is starting with the do-nothing scenario, and if we do nothing differently, this is how we think the economy is going to evolve.  Then we use that baseline to decide what we think is the right policy. Second piece, as far as the timing and the number of iterations, I certainly have no confidence in my own forecasting ability.  I use the Tealbook, I use the information in it, and I use questions to the staff.  And it\u2019s everything I can do to get my submissions in by five o\u2019clock on Friday.  If you want me to make submissions a week or two earlier than that, they\u2019re going to be pretty close to guesses\u2014in fact, they are going to be guesses. So I have a little bit of a problem with that.  I don\u2019t think it would be good to require me to guess just because we needed it at a certain time.  And I would hate to move the thinking that goes into the Tealbook forecast  July 31\u2013back a couple of weeks, because then it\u2019s based on less-current information, and I think it\u2019s more important that we have current information to base our decisions on. Finally, I think it would be helpful if we could agree on using a particular policy rule, at least for the Tealbook.  You take a common assumption about what policy starts out at, you use that to forecast what you think the outcome would be, and then you use some kind of specific policy rule.  It might not be your favorite, but, in my opinion, if we can all agree on one that we could use so that we\u2019re all talking about the same thing, it keeps us from having too many moving parts.  I think we could also ask the staff, in the Tealbook, to follow that policy rule with all of the alternative simulations, and it might be one that, when you\u2019re at the zero lower bound, requires you make some adjustment, either you wait a longer time or you wait until it calls for 75 basis points on liftoff or you wait for some conditions to be met.  But again, we specify what rule we want the staff to use in terms of how they show us the alternatives, and then I think it is helpful to look at the options\u2014if you choose alternative A, you\u2019re choosing this path; if you choose alternative B, you\u2019re choosing this path; if you choose alternative C, you\u2019re choosing this path.  If you disagree that this policy option would create this much difference in terms of the ultimate outcome on the economy, then we can talk about that.  If you think that more LSAPs are not going to be that effective, and so you don\u2019t think that the actual outcome would be what it shows in there, then you can talk about that difference.  But somehow it would be more helpful to me if we could start to narrow in on where the differences are and keep as many other pieces of it constant as we can.  It\u2019s just hard for me to think in that many dimensions.  That\u2019s the exercise I would like to see"], "2012FOMC20120913meeting.txt": [" MR. PLOSSER.  To interrupt just a second on that point, though, that begs the question about buying MBS\u2014let\u2019s say, even if it might help the mortgage market.  You don\u2019t have any evidence on whether that pass-through to corporate and other asset classes is either differential or  the same or less than it would be with Treasuries. Are you assuming that other asset classes would follow the same amount then, in that kind of story", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. I\u2019m going to come to that directly.  First, just to reiterate what Seth said, your logic is correct.  To the extent that you think that the pass-through from buying Treasuries into corporate bond yields, stock market prices, the exchange rate, and things like that, are less than in the model simulations, you are going to get smaller results. Second, I agree with Seth that the pass-through effects that we have in there\u2014as we have been saying right from the start back in 2008, early 2009\u2014are highly uncertain.  And as time has gone on, I think the one source of uncertainty that has gone down is the concern about whether purchases would have any effect.  At least we now think they have an effect. But having said that, there is still much uncertainty around these estimates. In terms of actually coming up with a confidence interval, I can\u2019t do that, but I can say the following qualitative things that I think are helpful. First, take the model that Min Wei and Canlin Li developed that we are mainly using for pricing the effects on Treasuries and MBS.  Now, that model kicks out a standard error.  I don\u2019t know what it is, but it does not have tight error bands.  There is considerable width to the confidence intervals.  That said, we think the number is reasonable.  But could the number be somewhat smaller or somewhat bigger.  Yes. One point on why it could be bigger is, if you go back to the first LSAP, the event studies  suggested the LSAP might have lowered Treasury yields by 100 basis points.  In the analysis that Min and Canlin are doing, it\u2019s 50.  So that\u2019s an example, where they are not necessarily taking the highest-side estimates. There are other studies that suggest that we could be getting lower effects on financial markets than in the FRB/US analysis.  On the other hand, FRB/US ignores some things, such as the potential pass-through to house prices; it has no effect in the simulations.  And, there are confidence effects that Seth alluded to.  Even if you knew what the financial effects would be, there would still be a substantial confidence interval for the economic effects.  I don\u2019t have them off the top of my head, but we have generated confidence bands for FRB/US impulse responses over the years.  They are a lot like those in other models.  They are fairly significant around what the unemployment rate effect would be.  The effect could be considerably closer to zero, or it could be bigger.  Let\u2019s say that, for a given LSAP, the point estimate is a half a percentage point on the unemployment rate after three years\u2014that\u2019s true for the way we are scoring alternative B. Could it be a quarter.  Yes.  A quarter is certainly inside the 70 percent confidence interval.  Could it be three-quarters of a percentage point. Yes.  That would be inside the 70 percent.  So that\u2019s just saying what, I think, everyone agrees upon: there are very wide confidence intervals on these effects", " MR. FISHER.  While I was listening to Seth\u2019s disclaimers at the beginning, it sort of sounds like an Allegra ad on television [laughter]: These are the risks, et cetera.  And the papers actually were quite good.  The paper you particularly referenced had a lot of disclaimers in it.  And what I am interested in seeing vetted more thoroughly is the degree to which this compounds the complexity of an exit when we decide to exit.  It seems to me one of the virtues of, particularly, \u201cThe Effect of an Additional $1 Trillion LSAP on the Exit Strategy\u201d was the discussion of substantial uncertainty.  There are lots of quotes in there that are qualified. It seems to me that the proponents of an extended LSAP would take a view from a signaling channel perspective that one of its benefits is that it is effective precisely because it makes it more difficult to either raise short-term interest rates or shrink the balance sheet for some time.  And in a way, what I am concerned about\u2014and I am interested in learning more\u2014is the degree to which we tie the hands of our successors, or if not tie\u2014maybe that is too strong a word\u2014we tangle their hands, and how much more difficult the exit strategy becomes. It strikes me that the stronger the recovery\u2014that is, the more rapidly we achieve equilibrium interest rates\u2014the harder it is going to be for us to exit.  And I would like to see that vetted a little bit more. I thought the papers touched on that, particularly the paper you referred to, but I think it would be helpful, Mr. Chairman, if we got a better sense of what complexities this imposes upon exit at the right time. Just a comment", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Which may or may not prevail, with one very important caveat.  Because housing is at such an extraordinarily low percentage of GDP, in essence, that historical correlation has been marked down in these analyses.  Ordinarily housing is a big source of a kick.  In these scenarios, the direct channel on housing construction activity is worth hardly anything.  It\u2019s a little bit, but it\u2019s very small.  That could be right or wrong, but in the results that Seth was showing and that were in all the other analysis we\u2019ve sent you, there is, in that very important sense, an attenuation of the effectiveness of monetary policy, whether it\u2019s conventional or unconventional right now", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to follow up on this issue about confidence intervals.  In figure 1, there would be data uncertainty; there would be uncertainty about transmission channels; there would be uncertainty about models.  If you layered all of that together, you are going to get very wide confidence intervals.  But onexhibit 2, where we are looking at the SOMA holdings, there we can sort of mechanically map out, more or less, what is going to happen.  There is some uncertainty based on interest rates, and so on, but I just want to be clear on this: This is much more solid, I would say, than page 1, which is very uncertain and very speculative about what the effects might be. Is that a fair assessment", " MR. BULLARD.  Just one other comment, Mr. Chairman.  On exhibit 2, panel 4, \u201cDeferred Asset.\u201d  That is kind of a nice term, \u201cdeferred asset.\u201d As far as I know, the Committee has never used the deferred asset.  It strikes me as a possible political firefight to bring that into play.  All of the scenarios here, other than option 1, if I\u2019m reading this correctly, would bring the deferred asset into play, with possible repercussions, I think, for the Federal Reserve", " MR. LACKER.  An economist there was arguing that the effect of our forward guidance occurred more via revisions in investors\u2019 expectations about future economic conditions rather than a change in their views about our future reaction function, and because you folks have such rich interactions with the dealer community and you talk to them about this forward guidance, I wondered if you guys had a view as to the economist\u2019s assertion", " MS. LOGAN. We\u2019re currently purchasing about a third of gross issuance.  That number is going to go up to 60 to 75 percent, depending on which option the Committee chooses", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  At the margin, and the 5-year is obviously being affected by the oil price movements", " MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman", " MR. WILCOX. Yes", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to come back to the financial stability handout, exhibit 2, chart 1, which is \u201cNonfinancial Sector Credit-to-GDP Ratio.\u201d In answer to the earlier question, you said that the cross-country evidence on this was all over the map, and that does not gibe with what I understood the cross-country evidence to be, which was that this line is basically trending up across the developed economies.  So it looks very similar actually", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen and I were in Basel over the weekend, and I have to say that there was a pretty strong sense of unanimity that what the ECB did was essentially the best that they could accomplish, given the various constraints under  which they were operating.  The fact that the purchases could be unlimited means that the program has the potential for actually being an effective backstop, and the fact that the ECB will be pari passu with other bondholders is important because it really will reduce the pressures on private holders.  So in effect, there may be private holders, if they view this as credible, who will actually want to invest in these sovereign instruments for a carry trade because the yield curves in these countries, of course, are very, very steep. There\u2019s also a bit of carrot now to incent proper actions by the government.  So if you do the right thing, we will intervene and we will hold down your debt service cost.  And I don\u2019t think there was that carrot before, so I think that\u2019s pretty significant.  I think that the ECB has essentially put on the table something that could take the risk of an interest rate-debt service-fiscal deficit spiral a bit off the table as long as the countries do the right thing.  And in addition, if these purchases do, in fact, materialize, I think this does push you in the direction toward further fiscal union.  After all, the ECB is backstopped by the entire euro zone, so such purchases will increase the joint and several nature of the union.  And finally, I thought the other thing that was noteworthy about the ECB action was that it was a 22 to 1 vote, with only Weidmann of the Bundesbank dissenting.  Given the fact that the German political leadership, at least for now, seems to be supporting the ECB actions, this means that the Bundesbank\u2019s opposition is somewhat marginalized at this point. So that\u2019s the good news. Despite this, I don\u2019t think we should kid ourselves.  I think the situation remains very tenuous despite the ECB\u2019s supports.  I\u2019d be, probably, slightly darker than Steve\u2019s comments on this.  Several issues worth highlighting: First, the ECB program would only activate if the countries actually negotiate an MOU with the euro group, and already we\u2019re hearing signs that Spain seems to be reluctant or slow in terms of pursuing it.  In fact, the Spanish may decide thatthe backstop might be effective even if they don\u2019t seek an MOU.  That seems like a highly risky strategy, but it is something that they might decide to do.  Second, the program obviously will only continue if they stay on the program. And, third, it\u2019s going to take a while for this all to be implemented because the MOU has to be negotiated with the euro group, and all of the finance ministers have to agree, and several parliaments actually have to approve the MOU.  So this idea that this is going to be happening very, very quickly\u2014I think the market is probably a little bit ahead of itself in terms of how quickly this will come into play. Other issues\u2014the ECB program will not necessarily crowd in investors, because it\u2019s not clear how long this is going to last.  So you might buy things, but you still have quite a bit of risk.  You still have a very bad feedback loop from the austerity programs to the economy, to fiscal performance, and the state of the banking system.  This doesn\u2019t take any of that off the table, and there\u2019s still no road map as to where we\u2019re actually going in terms of the ultimate destination:  What does greater fiscal union in Europe look like. So this is a very important thing that the ECB has done.  I think they did the best that they could possibly do, and the good thing is they put the problem back in the lap of the governments, where it belongs.  They have done what they can do now, and now it\u2019s up to the governments to decide, both in the core and in the periphery, if they\u2019re going to go along. The basic model, though, of this whole situation hasn\u2019t changed.  Countries have to show they\u2019re on a sustainable path to regain market access.  The core countries are unwilling to be explicit about the level of support because of fears that this will undermine the effort.  The constitutional court decision in Germany today, which was actually mostly positive, affirmed that the German commitment is limited to \u20ac190 billion\u2014that\u2019s it, and so that\u2019s sort of significant. I think the unwillingness of the German Constitutional Court to be explicit does create uncertainty that makes progress more difficult.  So we do still have a long way to go, and we don\u2019t have big, solid backstops to absorb shocks or support confidence.  The ESM\u2013EFSF resources are still very much too small to credibly backstop Spain and Italy, and the ECB support may be too uncertain as to its sustainability.  So it\u2019s progress, but there are still a lot of questions on the table", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. You have this issue that the SEP has some people who have no change in policy; others have changes in policy.  That\u2019s going to still be an outstanding issue going forward", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Yes\u2014thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I like the idea, in principle, of having a consensus forecast based on status quo policy and then a consensus forecast based on the policy action.  I think, though, that in practice, the latter is going to be very challenging, because you could easily imagine that the Committee could come up with a choice of a policy action that they had not considered ex ante.  And then it becomes very difficult to know how the timing would work and to get the logistics to work", "MR. EVANS.  Could I ask a question that\u2019s a little bit different. It was triggered by some comments that President Fisher made earlier in asking questions, where he alluded to the fact that some people around the table would be, however you put it, more accepting of a higher inflation rate than others, or whatever.  And in exhibit 2 on page 5, this question comes to my mind, which is, there is an optimal control path that is shown that has inflation rising to\u2014I think it\u2019s 2.3 percent, if it\u2019s consistent with previous Tealbook-style analyses. I personally don\u2019t see anything in this path that\u2019s inconsistent with our longer-run strategic approach that we adopted in January, and I just wonder if that\u2019s the sense of the Committee or if there\u2019s an important divergence of opinion there, which seems to be one of the points that President Fisher might have been raising", " MR. EVANS.  I wasn\u2019t asking a question about communications.  I was asking more a question about how we interpret our longer-run strategic document, because at various times, we   make different comments about these types of outcomes, and it strikes me that there\u2019s less agreement on that particular observation than sometimes is given by the words that we use", " MR. LACKER. New York.  I forgot New York.  And there are others around the System.  I know that Atlanta operates a pretty elaborate model as well.  So each of these taken to the data would give you a different estimate of the gap, and they\u2019d give you a different decomposition of what the gap was about.  We\u2019d be able to look at those, if we had them in front of us, and say, \u201cWell, attributing the gap to this is persuasive to me.  It matches up with what I think is out there,\u201d or, \u201cThis reason for the gap to be large isn\u2019t persuasive to me.\u201d  And we could have a discussion that goes beyond, \u201cI think the gap is big.\u201d \u201cNo, I think the gap is small.\u201d  \u201cNo, I think the gap is big.\u201d \u201cNo, I think the gap is small.\u201d I think we could make progress by putting the cards on the table, by putting some more-explicit analysis on the table. So that\u2019s my suggestion for improving our discussion of the gap going forward.  As I said, the estimates of the 3 percent gap in EDO seem implausible to me compared with factors that I\u2019ve talked about that are likely to affect the natural rate rather than the gap\u2014things like the labor market, skill problems, the housing overhang, and policy uncertainty, which aren\u2019t captured by the models.  We could have a debate then about what is in the model or not.  This is what goes into my thinking\u2014that we shouldn\u2019t expect much from monetary policy now.   Moreover, we might be pretty close to where the policy-relevant natural rate is right now.  Thank you\u2014I took some extra time here.  I appreciate it.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don\u2019t really understand why the DSGE model should be particularly relevant to the current set of circumstances, given that this is a financial shock, a huge financial shock, and my understanding is that DGSE models are very rudimentary, if they have anything, in terms of the financial sector.  To go to the DSGE models as a source of determining the natural rate versus the NAIRU and the size of the gap seems a little bit \u201coff the reservation\u201d relative to the source of the shock.  So I\u2019m just curious what your reaction is", " MR. FISHER.  Can I just make a point to that", " MR. FISHER.  At least in the drafts of our statement, we were saying that business fixed investment was weak.  The question is, are we affecting business fixed investment.  And, more important than that, are we affecting employment. My point is that in the responses I\u2019m getting to anecdotal inquiry\u2014not systematically organized, although the systematic surveys that we see, through the NFIB and others, show that it is questionable whether or not we are actually affecting employment.  The question is, are we affecting employment over the short term or the long term.  We have a wealth effect.  The Chairman has made that a very strong argument, including at the last meeting. If you\u2019re advising a corporation about what to do with the savings that they can achieve through cheaper capital, they can invest it in greater plant or equipment expansion, they can buy back their stock, or they can increase their dividends.  And I would argue that the former would have a more immediate impact on employment creation than the latter. Excuse me", " MR. FISHER.  We\u2019re going to hold you to that", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook has not changed materially since the July\u2013August meeting.  Maybe incoming data have been mixed, but forward-looking indicators still remain consistent with an economy growing in the near term in a range between 1\u00bd percent and 2 percent. Similarly, the factors shaping the medium-term outlook have not changed significantly; the general contours of my outlook remain the same.  Yes, some of the incoming data during the intermeeting period suggested modest increases in household spending and employment, and the household sector showed some further slight signs of improvement.  But no data are yet showing a basis to believe that these modest increases will be sustained to such an extent that faster momentum might be expected.  Indeed, other data, such as those for business spending and consumer confidence, remain soft.  It is not yet obvious that this path, or even a couple of months of stronger-than-expected economic activity, could reduce the amount of slack in labor markets or alter the trajectory of expected inflation to a degree that would obviate the need for a further easing of monetary policy.  Last week\u2019s employment report\u2014 payroll employment only 55,000 higher than reported in July, after taking into account revisions\u2014does not suggest above-trend economic growth or a declining trend in the unemployment rate.  It suggests, instead, that the unemployment rate is likely to move sideways with no sign of a substantial and sustainable strengthening in the pace of economic recovery.  And this unsatisfactory modal projection is what exists before even considering downside risks to the outlook.  One particular downside risk that remains quite elevated relates to what we\u2019ve been talking about\u2014the depressed level of labor participation and the enhanced level of long-term unemployment. The decline in the labor force participation rate since the beginning of the recession is ominous, and although the Board staff predicts that over the next couple of years the labor force participation rate will flatten out, the recession, as Governor Yellen described, may well have permanent effects on the labor force participation rate, just as the high-pressure labor market of the late 1990s pulled people back into the labor force who had been excluded for a long time\u2014only now, unfortunately, in reverse. In addition, with a substantial and growing proportion of unemployed workers having been jobless for long periods, we face an elevated risk that such a high level of long-term unemployment will persist long enough to permanently depress labor supply and potential output.  Unlike downside risks emanating from the European crisis and U.S. fiscal policy\u2014which, were they to occur, theoretically can be addressed with accommodative monetary policy after the fact\u2014the potential hysteresis created by drops in the labor force participation rate and increases in long-term unemployment will prove intractable to address with accommodative monetary policy that isn\u2019t inflationary.  So I find the particular downside risk of hysteresis to be especially pernicious because it\u2019s difficult to address after the fact. But, more optimistically, it is one downside risk that monetary policymakers do have some ability to mitigate prior to its occurrence. Similarly, I wonder about the permanent or transitory nature of household and business expectations.  The economic outlook appears damped by some form of pessimism.  Look at the Michigan survey question on the proportion of households expecting unemployment to improve.  Earlier this year, that number had recovered, but now it has dropped down again.  Similarly,   households\u2019 income expectations for the coming 12 months have hardly recovered at all since the recession despite the fact that actual income has somewhat increased.  On the business side, expectations for business conditions six months hence as measured in the Empire State and Philadelphia Fed surveys have dropped back sharply again.  In the case of the Empire State survey, they\u2019re back close to levels seen during the recession.  Capital spending plans also don\u2019t look great.  Surveys from the National Association for Business Economics show capital spending to have dropped sharply in the second quarter.  Surveys from the National Federation of Independent Business show capital spending to be gradually rising, but still remaining at less than half of its pre-recession level. It\u2019s difficult to project whether these expectations will transition from being temporary blips to permanent shifts, but the fact that these expectations have tried to recover from the recession before but been knocked back, sometimes more than once, might be a factor that could keep households and businesses from getting too hopeful again. The longer we have an economy that looks bleak as far as the eye can see, the more this bleakness gets built into expectations.  Households and businesses now see a recovery slow to materialize.  They assume that things will get better because they always have, but then things don\u2019t get better.  So households and businesses start to wonder if this is just a delay or if it\u2019s just the new normal.  If they think it\u2019s the new normal, it could become just that.  Thank you", "  [Laughter] MR. STEIN.  I\u2019m going to just start juggling next time. Anyway, just to underscore, really\u2014on the Michigan survey, we had a very interesting briefing a few weeks ago by Claudia Sahm, in Research and Statistics, who\u2019d been looking carefully at these data.  And the gist of the finding is, not only is it low, but also, basically, it fell from 2007 to 2009, and it really hasn\u2019t recovered since.  Moreover, it\u2019s not well explained by household characteristics\u2014there\u2019s a large negative residual there in a way that seems different from previous experience. In a similar vein but much less scientifically, I looked at a different survey, the Conference Board\u2019s Consumer Confidence Index, which also fell in August.  Very much to your point, they do a breakdown of the index into views of the current situation\u2014a present situation index\u2014and a future expectations piece, and all of the drop was coming from the future expectations piece.  So I was curious.  I went back and compared it with previous peaks of unemployment that we\u2019ve had.  The ones I looked at were May 1975 and December 1982.  What you see is, at those times when unemployment was also very high, if you asked people about the present situation, it was dismal, but if you asked them about future expectations, it was not nearly so bad as it is today.  These are just a couple of data points, but they\u2019re consistent with what I take to be the spirit of Claudia\u2019s  work, which is, it\u2019s as if, given where we are today and given the current situation, people feel the future is considerably more pessimistic.  And again, I think this is pessimism as opposed to uncertainty, which has a slightly different implication because it\u2019s less clear that, if the fiscal cliff resolves itself, this kind of thing gets fixed. Another survey on the business side: I just yesterday got a survey that Duke University does in conjunction with CFO magazine, where they talk to 900 CFOs of U.S. firms.  One of the new questions in there this time\u2014I think, actually, Steve Sharpe helped them design this question\u2014asked the firms if they would in any way change their capital spending plans for a given change in interest rates.  Here, it is strikingly like a large-sample version of President Fisher\u2019s CEO conversations, where only 3 percent of the firms say they would in any way change their capital spending for a 50 basis point movement in rates.  Now, I take Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s critique here.  First of all, in this one, unlike consumer confidence, we don\u2019t have a benchmark, so I don\u2019t know what people would say in normal times.  But as a Bayesian, I\u2019m inclined to think that there\u2019s something going on here, even though I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a huge thing. So, putting this together\u2014now, this part is very impressionistic, but I guess the overall feeling I get from looking at these various pieces of survey evidence is the sense that when we make a policy move now, we\u2019re playing more for whatever effect we can have on consumer and business confidence than for the normal hydraulic effect we would have on financing conditions per se.  That is to say, we may know more about how to move interest rates than about how to influence confidence, but it\u2019s the latter that, in some sense, is the dragging anchor.  This is not an \u201calways\u201d situation.  I think it\u2019s, in some respects, the opposite of where we were in 2009 at the  time of QE1, when really the thing to do, the imperative, was to fix financing conditions, and people would figure it out one way or the other. I don\u2019t know if this has any implications for policy. It strikes me that, if this is right, it should color particularly how we think about the communications aspect.  I, like many others here, believe that the need for action is clear, but I think, less so than usual, the bond market is not really our primary audience.  So maybe when we think about policy, we want to worry less about putting together the biggest, most inclusive package that has the maximum bond market impact, and worry more about, how do we deliver a simple and coherent message that normal humans can understand, as opposed to mainly Fed watchers.  I think we\u2019ll have a chance to talk about some of these issues.  I\u2019m not sure if this concept is fully operational, but I have this conviction that we really have to think about our audience as being business managers and households\u2014more so than at other times.  There\u2019s so much talk about, what are the Fed watchers expecting us to do.  And I think we don\u2019t want to get overly caught up in delivering just to them.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. POWELL.  Yes.  The hedge funds are, as a staff memo from Matt and Fabio pointed out, unanimously not believing a long-run solution in Europe.  They\u2019re just very pessimistic.  I   would say the private equity firms are in the same place.  You see very little private equity interest in Europe.  There\u2019s great uncertainty and that kind of thing.  In the United States, you see a lot of activity\u2014again, restrained only by a lack of supply.  When there\u2019s a good company that\u2019s out there, the bidding is furious, and they\u2019re all saying, \u201cThis is the time.\u201d  This happened 10 years ago. And Asia\u2014I can\u2019t really give you any call on that", " MS. LOGAN.  That\u2019s the cap", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. One important point here:  The black line\u2014the consensus forecast\u2014implicitly has in it a significant disappointment for the market because they pull back their expectations for liftoff to late 2014, and they remove their expectations of any further expansion of the portfolio", " MR. BULLARD.  Roughly speaking.  Well, I guess, Mr. Chairman, I have a concern whether we have three options that are live options.  And I think it\u2019s been hard while the Committee has been trying to think about ways to ease, and when the Committee shifts in the other direction, the same thing will happen", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. It means that we\u2019re looking for improvement in a context of price stability. If we see improvement without price stability, that\u2019s not a good thing, and we won\u2019t continue purchases", " MR. LACKER.  But this says you\u2019re going to wait until you get improvement with price stability", " MR. LACKER. Aren\u2019t other rates going to be higher if we buy mortgage-backeds rather than Treasuries.  Because presumably, that means Treasury rates will be higher than they otherwise would be.  Presumably, some other rates are linked to Treasuries and not mortgage-backed securities, and presumably, they\u2019re higher. Isn\u2019t there some other rate that\u2019s going to go up if we buy mortgage-backeds rather than Treasuries", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Go down by less", " MR. LACKER.  Oh, okay.  Well, no\u2014but, see, I\u2019m asking to compare buying X amount of Treasuries with buying X amount of mortgage-backed", " MR. POTTER.  Not necessarily for the economy as a whole", "MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. That\u2019s the main argument.  There\u2019s a second argument, which is not in the model sims we\u2019ve run, but a lot of people believe that MBS could have effects that the model isn\u2019t picking up\u2014say, larger effects on house prices, bigger effects on mortgage refinancing, or something like that", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  And so I guess I\u2019m asking, what kind of expected date do we think they can work out", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Again, it\u2019s the outlook and not the actual", "  MR. PLOSSER.

No, but last winter, though, it wasn\u2019t really that convincing because, remember, payrolls were strong but GDP was weak, and we had this riddle", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  And so you could argue that you wouldn\u2019t necessarily stop last winter, because you didn\u2019t have the GDP growth to support the labor market", " MR. PLOSSER.  \u201cFederal Reserve All In", "  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any other questions.  Are we all set.  [No response] Bill, what do you want us to do with these handouts. Do you want us to take them home and bring them back", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B with the forward guidance on the funds rate in paragraph 5\u2032.  The case for further action is clear. In the absence of significant additional monetary stimulus, progress toward our policy goals would remain stalled.  Such an outcome is simply inconsistent with the notion of appropriate monetary policy and, in my view, is unacceptable. We must aim for a path that brings us measurably closer to our goals over the forecast horizon, and we must take concrete actions that get us on that path.  Open-ended purchases of MBS represent a substantial step in that direction.  With this action, unemployment will fall more quickly and inflation will return toward 2 percent faster than under the status quo. The flow-oriented asset purchases in alternative B also provide flexibility that\u2019s particularly valuable, given all the uncertainties of the economy, the fiscal cliff, and Europe.  They serve as a useful automatic stabilizer as market expectations about the ultimate size of the program adjust in response to changes in economic conditions and the outlook.  If the labor market shows signs of substantial improvement sooner than expected, the program can be curtailed.  In contrast, if the recovery falters, the program can provide additional needed support. There would be similar benefits from incorporating such an automatic stabilizer into our forward guidance of the future path of the funds rate.  The language in paragraph 5\u2032 does just that.  Incorporating this language into our statement would allow us to finally get the calendar-date monkey off our back and provide better guidance on our policy reaction function\u2014 importantly, at least, on economic conditions\u2014for funds rate liftoff that is both clear and consistent with our dual-mandate objectives.  It\u2019s also flexible enough to handle a variety of future paths for the economy and inflation.  Indeed, the beauty of this approach is it provides guidance for contingencies where our forecasts go wrong, which they inevitably do. Finally, I continue to favor lowering the interest on excess reserves rate, the IOER rate, to 15 basis points.  We should be using all of our tools in the same direction.  Thank you", " MR. BULLARD.  Can I respond to that.  I agree that that is the language in there, but I think markets will interpret it as a trigger.  Or let me say, as a fair way, I think there is a danger that markets will interpret that as a line in the sand or a trigger", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start by saying something positive about alternative B.  [Laughter] I very much like the idea in paragraph 5\u2032 of replacing our problematic calendar-based guidance with language that is conditional on future economic conditions.  I think this is much needed change.  It focuses our communication, our forward guidance, on a reaction function, and reduces the danger that Michael Woodford very eloquently laid out that our forward guidance is actually just making people gloomier about the economic fundamentals. It\u2019s a very real danger, and I think there is a very real possibility that that is the effect our forward guidance has been having over the course of the last year. Okay.  That was my positive remark.  I would like to move on now to some improvement opportunities I see.  [Laughter] I think in 5\u2032 that it would be better if we avoided using a specific numerical value for the unemployment rate as a threshold or trigger, whatever we are going to   do. I took a step back.  This is a large change in our statement.  This is a fairly dramatic change in the set of language we use to characterize our forward guidance. It\u2019s an ambitious statement. In view of our experience with the forward guidance earlier this year, where we got boxed in for something that in hindsight we could have anticipated, I tried to think of ways in which this language could unexpectedly box us in or tie our hands in ways that we don\u2019t anticipate now.  I think this numerical unemployment rate is one of them. President Lockhart was very eloquent about this.  This makes us hostage to labor force participation rates.  We would be vulnerable to a scenario\u2014he sketched it out\u2014in which employment picks up, and that starts drawing people into the labor force.  This is not an unfamiliar phenomenon historically, in which labor force growth that tails off and turns negative when the unemployment rate goes up, then picks up when employment growth starts rising.  Given the behavior of the labor force over the past several years, I don\u2019t think we should have a lot of confidence in our ability to project how the unemployment rate would behave in a scenario in which employment growth picked up a lot.  I think this is a really serious risk.  It would be better to write the statement in terms of the qualitative language used earlier that President Lockhart was referring to. For example, we could say, \u201cThis exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least until the Committee has seen substantial ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.\u201d I think that formulation would be preferable to the language that uses a specific numerical target. The second opportunity I see has to do with the inflation language in the same statement.  We used the phrase that \u201cthis exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as\u201d blah, blah, blah, \u201cprovided that inflation at a one- to two-year horizon is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\u201d  So the logic is  clear, to give ourselves an out if the inflation picture deteriorates substantially.  Personally, I think the \u201cclose to 2 percent\u201d language would be better.  That\u2019s more consistent with the kind of standard we described in our consensus statement.  Proliferating conditionality language can be confusing.  But there is a deeper problem with this language.  My sense is that it has been true for the past 20 years in which we have achieved price stability\u2014I believe it has been true\u2014that inflation over the medium term, the next couple of years, was projected to be close to 2 percent or below that.  I haven\u2019t gone and checked, but I am virtually sure that\u2019s true.  This was a period during which we achieved and maintained price stability.  It is essential to maintain that credibility because it can be costly to regain, but we started this period by moving preemptively, before the forecast of inflation moved away from that low rate.  And in the future, it is going to be important for us to be able to move preemptively. If this condition is violated, it is in some sense too late. It\u2019s not like we are going to go back to the 1970s right away if this condition is violated, but I think this sets too low a bar.  There is a way to word this that tightens this. We can say, instead of \u201cprovided that inflation at a one- to two-year horizon,\u201d we could say, \u201cunless inflation, at a one- to two-year horizon, would be projected to be more than \u00bd percentage point above the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective.\u201d  Something like that makes clear that we would move to keep this condition true, that we are not going to wait until this condition is violated in order to move. The third suggestion I have for improvement in B(5) concerns the last sentence. I suggest we delete it. I think it is quite confusing.  This represents the fifth different statement of conditionality on the second page, in two paragraphs", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Despite massive monetary policy accommodation over the past four years, a stronger recovery has not yet materialized, and last week\u2019s labor market report was a frustrating reminder of this long slog.  Like others, my forecast accounts for any number of risks related to Europe, the U.S. fiscal cliff, and the regulatory environment, and does recognize that policy accommodation may need to remain in place for some time in order to support the recovery.  I understand the case for taking action in order to spur the recovery and bring down unemployment faster.  To that end, the Committee agreed to undertake additional balance sheet actions only a few months ago.  Today, we contemplate doing more.  Certainly, the data flow since the last meeting was a bit softer than I had expected, but not sufficiently so to warrant a further expansion of our balance sheet.  In that regard, I note that the Tealbook had pulled forward the timing of the first rate increase since our last meeting. As I weigh the cost of action versus the status quo, I have appreciated the thoughtful analysis of Board staff and a number of my colleagues around this table about the effects of another asset purchase.  Unfortunately, I find that the risks associated with further action carry less precise measurement, but, to the extent they are possible, pose significant cost if realized.  Impairing market functioning in certain financial markets, the potential for the Federal Reserveto experience financial losses in the future, and risks to financial stability due to the extended low rate environment all strike me as significant when weighed against potential benefits.  A larger balance sheet also has the potential to further complicate an exit strategy. Another LSAP also may have near-term adverse consequences.  Given the recent rise in gasoline prices, additional asset purchases could generate a further rise in oil and gasoline prices, which would weigh on middle- and lower-income households and, thus, partially offset estimated benefits. I also remain concerned that a balance sheet expansion could at some point raise inflation expectations.  Longer-term measures of inflation expectations, or breakeven inflation, appeared to respond strongly to past LSAP announcements.  Given that current longer-term breakeven inflation measures are consistent with our stated goal, I am concerned that another LSAP program could push longer-term expectations above a level consistent with our objectives. If this were to occur, we would face a difficult tradeoff between allowing longer-term expectations to drift higher or reversing course by reducing the size of the balance sheet.  Either option strikes me as damaging to both the real economy and our credibility. In terms of the forward guidance, I agree with those who note the time-contingent guidance has been problematic.  And so conceptually I agree that the state-contingent guidance is preferable as long as we can articulate this guidance in a manner that is fully consistent with our January 2012 strategy statement, including our assessment of risk to the financial system.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  My preference is for purchases of $40 billion MBS a month, and with respect to forward guidance, my preference is for 5\u2032. The data we have received since our August meeting provides yet further confirmation that economic growth is proceeding near or slightly below the economy\u2019s potential, and downside risks continue to be substantial.  For quite some time, the Committee has been in watch-and-wait mode.  We\u2019ve patiently monitored the economy to see whether the MEP and our forward guidance would be sufficient to produce a stronger recovery.  The verdict now seems clear.  Absent further policy action, I see little chance that unemployment will decline in the foreseeable future.  We should not delay action any further.  Indeed, I hope we will send the message loud and clear that we intend to provide additional accommodation through new assetpurchases until we observe substantial and sustained improvement in labor market conditions, and will maintain policy accommodation for an extended period as the recovery strengthens. I support the open-ended and conditional nature of the asset purchase program in alternative B. I think it\u2019s very helpful to spell out the goal of the program and to articulate the economic conditions we\u2019ll need to observe before halting those purchases.  In particular, we should promise to add accommodation through asset purchases until the outlook for labor market conditions has improved substantially, and we would stop doing so only if our outlook for inflation or assessment of the efficacy and costs of the program changes significantly.  The challenge with such an open-ended program is that its effectiveness will depend on market expectations of the ultimate size of our asset purchases, and we\u2019re offering no clear guidance on how long we expect them to continue.  In addition, we\u2019ve included some escape clauses relating to efficacy and costs.  I, therefore, think it\u2019s important that our public communications, including the Chairman\u2019s press conference, emphasize our commitment to continue the program until we have seen ongoing and sustained improvement in labor market conditions. Even though the open-ended nature of the program creates challenges in shaping expectations, it also has the very desirable property that market participants should adjust their expectations about the size of the program in response to changing economic conditions.  And this means that the program should induce stabilizing movements in financial conditions as expectations adjust automatically to incoming data indicating a stronger or weaker economic outlook. There\u2019s been quite a bit of debate both inside and outside the Fed about the likely economic impact of asset purchases, and there is sizable uncertainty about the effects of LSAPs. I appreciate ongoing staff efforts to refine our estimates of these effects.  Nonetheless, in light of  the evidence that I\u2019ve seen, I\u2019m persuaded that this program can be a helpful tool for achieving our objectives.  And while I\u2019m mindful of the implications of further asset purchases for capital losses and remittances down the road, these concerns pale in comparison to what I view as the potential economic and human costs of failing to reduce the unemployment rate as aggressively as we can. I\u2019m hopeful that a determined commitment to continue providing accommodation until we achieve more rapid and durable progress in attaining our employment goal may bolster household and business confidence and spending.  Any stimulus provided through this channel will boost its effect relative to the staff\u2019s estimates. I think it makes sense to direct our new purchases to MBS to provide additional support to the housing market, and I support purchases at the higher rate of $40 billion per month, which is a rate that in the Desk\u2019s assessment could be sustained for the next year or two.  Consistent with the open-ended approach, I\u2019d be prepared to scale the flow of these purchases up or down as the economic outlook evolves.  If this flow of purchases is maintained through the middle of next year, our holdings of longer-term securities would increase by about $800 billion, which I think is large enough to have a substantial economic effect. Paragraph 4 of the statement spells out the conditions under which we will provide additional accommodation through asset purchases.  Paragraph 5, in contrast, concerns the conditions under which we will maintain the level of accommodation that\u2019s reached when our asset purchases end. If we end up adopting 5 rather than 5\u2032, I consider it critical to make clear that an extension of the expected calendar date to mid-2015 is intended as a policy shift to improve the economic outlook, and that it does not convey a downgrading of our outlook in the face of disappointing new data.  Whereas our previous language tied exceptionally low levels ofthe funds rate to economic weakness, the new language incorporated into the beginning of B(5) is much more positive, and I think it\u2019s a very significant improvement. As between the alternative versions of paragraph B(5), while I can support B(5) today, I strongly prefer version 5\u2032. We contemplated a formulation along these lines when we introduced calendar-date guidance in August of last year, and we have discussed this formulation extensively for many months now.  President Evans, in his speeches, and Presidents Kocherlakota, Williams, and Rosengren have explained in detail and very persuasively why a formulation like this makes sense.  I don\u2019t want to go over the arguments again that they have set before the Committee. I simply think that clarifying the economic conditionality of the funds rate path is useful for precisely the same reasons that it\u2019s useful to tie our asset purchases to economic conditions.  And I also think\u2014a point that President Kocherlakota emphasized\u2014that the language has the possibility of bolstering household and business expectations about their future incomes, and this would be a very important mechanism potentially for supporting additional spending. In summary, I support the provision of additional monetary accommodation.  I anticipate that continuing our additional purchases will be warranted well into 2013.  I also support 5\u2032 today and hope that if we end up going with 5, we will make further progress in future meetings on refining our forward guidance", " MR. POWELL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will vote in favor of alternative B.  My support for alternative B leans heavily on the language in paragraph 4 requiring us to consider the likely efficacy and cost of further actions when and if they are proposed and considered, and I join strongly Governor Stein and Presidents Pianalto and Lockhart in an editing of paragraph 4 that moves very much in the direction that Governor Stein just read. I am a supporter of paragraph 5.  I think that the arguments that have already been raised and vetted about 5\u2032 are dispositive at this time.  I will say that the two things that need to be done\u2014the good news is there are only two things.  The bad news is those two things are, first, the Committee has got to reach agreement on the desirability of moving to a state-contingent forward guidance. I\u2019m very open to the intellectual appeal of that, but going around the table, it\u2019s quite obvious that we don\u2019t fully have that, particularly around the levels in the language and the conditionality. The second is clearly the public communication aspect.  There\u2019s nothing about it in the Jackson Hole speech.  There really hasn\u2019t been any supportive discussion of it by the Chairman lately that I\u2019ve seen. We could get ourselves to a place where this could be announced.  It would be the work of some months both internally and externally, in particular explaining how it does fit in with the principles that we adopted in January.  It\u2019s not something that can happen in the next 45 minutes. I will also vote in favor of extending the guidance to mid-2015 as proposed.  My own view of this is that the market moves the estimate of the liftoff date every day, and our proposed guidance doesn\u2019t contain any surprise element. The idea that the date can contain a negative, contractionary aspect is certainly plausible in a different setting, but not on the facts we face today. Let me say a couple of comments about LSAPs.  As I look back on the use of LSAPs so far, I too believe that the evidence supports the view that the effects of any LSAP are highly dependent not only on some mechanics, but also on the setting in which it is launched.  The main driver of real effects is probably that of enhancing confidence, confidence that bad outcomes will be avoided, and that there is reason to hope for good outcomes. In this view, it is really our credibility, the design of the program, and the setting that make it work.  For me, an argument in favor of alternative B is that it is limited to MBS at a time when the housing market is consistently surprising on the upside.  This alternative can be well explained and understood by the public as welcome support for housing as well as for the broader economy.  So presented, it stands a decent chance to actually be noticed and appreciated by people who are neither Fed watchers nor professional market participants nor economics bloggers.  I encourage an emphasis on support for housing in our public communications around this action. My view is that alternative B can have positive effects on the economy but that these effects are likely to be quite modest, and I do come to that view without a great deal of certainty.  It does seem clear to me that LSAPs have affected asset prices, and to deny that does call for\u2014as was done in a certain well-mentioned Jackson Hole paper\u2014that most hackneyed of all economist jokes that while it may be observed in reality, it will simply never work in theory.  [Laughter] But of course, affecting MBS and Treasury prices is just the beginning.  We need translation to rates that actually matter for private economic activity and then translation to the real economy. Looking at the channels through which we believe our policies operate and the caveats, confidence intervals, headwinds, and multiple uncertainties that surround the estimates so well addressed in yesterday\u2019s meeting, my strong sense is that the real effects will be quite modest, and it is all too easy these days to find credible private forecasts that agree. The last two forecasts that I\u2019ve seen both from well known, credible sources who happened to be broadly supportive of accommodation, point to estimates of unemployment effects of around 20 or 30 basis points for a program the size of QE2\u2014use that as a rough proxy for this.  That would be 300,000 to 450,000 jobs under those forecasts.  That might be equivalent to bringing the recovery forward by a couple of months. As far as the costs, I certainly agree that they appear manageable in the near term. There\u2019s enough risk and uncertainty about the medium and long term that if the view of the likely benefits is right, one would have to believe further that the likely costs are close to nil to want to proceed with a large LSAP.  I also agree with President Bullard\u2019s point earlier in the meeting that the problem has not been the lack of aggressive monetary policy.  As a separate matter, taking the Chairman\u2019s points from yesterday, I do not feel that additional aggressive monetary policy is likely to provide much of a solution. I know that every member of the Committee struggles to balance these highly uncertain costs and benefits.  I\u2019m supporting alternative B with a certain lack of enthusiasm, and I am somewhat uncomfortable with the road that we are on.  As others have mentioned, this is not  , 2009, or 2010.  We\u2019re now using LSAPs as a straightforward jobs program.  There is no credible threat of deflation, recession, or financial crisis, any of which could present a compelling case for action and the use of all of our tools, including LSAPs if appropriate.  Again, these are concerns about the medium and the long term, not the next six months.  My concern is that for very modest benefits, we are piling up risks for the future and that it could become habit-forming. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, I had the same reaction that you had. I didn\u2019t see how it would fit in 4 because you hadn\u2019t really explained the forward guidance yet.  One could take the last sentence of 4 and the last sentence of 5\u2032 and make a new paragraph 6 and sum up.  Then you\u2019d have the statement about asset purchases, the statement about forward guidance, and a summary paragraph that said, \u201cin determining both these things.\u201d  That would be more logical", " MR. LACKER.  A paragraph full of escape clauses, in other words", " MR. LACKER.  I want to re-ask a question I asked earlier this year.  When we adopted this language, we never really got clear on whether it\u2019s a commitment or not.  We wrestled with different versions of what that meant.  Is this signaling that we\u2019re going to pursue an action that later on we would not want to pursue then", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I think it\u2019s still conditional because it obviously depends on the timing of the recovery and so on", " MR. ENGLISH.  I don\u2019t actually think we know very much about what would happen to private-label MBS yields because there\u2019s so little issuance; there\u2019s so little pricing information. It\u2019s conceivable that pushing down agency MBS would also push down private-label MBS yields, but I don\u2019t think we know because there hasn\u2019t been much issuance there and we don\u2019t have information", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.9 Let\u2019s go on to the consensus forecast.

The other possibility is if you just disagree with the forecast, you should say so and explain why, and then they\u2019ll write up the monetary policy report with attribution\u2014that\u2019s the plan\u2014and say, again, what it is that you disagree about.  Yes, President Lacker", " MR. ENGLISH.  Two different options", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You can disagree violently and for attribution", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

Congratulations, and we\u2019re trying to recover here in Washington. Okay.

As you know, we currently have guidance that suggests the date at which we expect to begin to raise rates.

This is the broader point we\u2019ve talked about before on this topic, about the role of the inflation escape clause. The policy rules we implement and the models we have possess the property that it\u2019s always the case that inflation is expected to return to the monetary policy authority\u2019s target.  Always.  Probability 1.  Very definitely.  These thresholds sound like, \u201cWell, we\u2019re going to run a policy that might not be consistent with that, and then when inflation goes away from that, we\u2019ll change our mind and come back.\u201d And it means you have to wait and see that happen.  Ideally, you want to run a policy that maintains price stability, not one that lets it drift around", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Quite a number of my points have been made already, but I will go through some thoughts anyway.  I haven\u2019t been a great fan of date guidance for a number of reasons.  Date guidance is hard to adjust with changing conditions, and although we went to great pains to describe it as conditional, the date is taken as a commitment or promise by much of the public.  In principle, I think expressing forward guidance in the form of economic conditionality ought to be preferable, but on consideration, I\u2019ve concluded that specific numerical thresholds taken alone might not improve the clarity and effectiveness of our communications.  So I\u2019m going to advocate for thresholds that are pretty substantially qualified, even at the risk of diluting their influence on economic conditions. I\u2019m especially skeptical of a single numerical threshold for the unemployment situation.  In my view, the unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic for describing the economic conditionality we ought to have in mind.  The Chairman put some emphasis on this point in his last press conference.  In response to a question on the new LSAP, the Chairman emphasized that the decision process for continuing, adjusting, or halting the new LSAP program would be based not on a single market metric, but rather an array of indicators that collectively present a full  picture of labor market conditions and prospects, and that the decision would involve a qualitative judgment in the end.  I don\u2019t want to speak for you, Mr. Chairman, but that\u2019s my interpretation of what you said.  I\u2019m not sure I understand why this holistic approach to the conditionality that will guide our asset purchase decisions should not also guide our policy rate decisions.  If the Committee chooses to adopt a numerical threshold for employment, I think it\u2019s likely that the threshold we introduce would have to be accompanied by substantial qualification to the effect that the unemployment rate is just one of several indicators; that, in practice, the Committee will synthesize a view from an evaluation of a dashboard of relevant data; and, therefore, that the single unemployment rate should not be taken as decisive.  I have similar concerns about the risk of conveying simplistic and potentially misleading specificity around a single inflation metric.  However, I don\u2019t feel so strongly on this side of the threshold question because there\u2019s been a lot of public education explaining that we look at a variety of inflation numbers to discern the trend.  So I do not advocate full substitution of single numerical thresholds for the current practice of date guidance. Now, to answer some of the questions:  \u201cShould the thresholds replace the date-based guidance or be combined with the date-based guidance.\u201d  On balance, I favor a combined approach, repeated routinely for a while, at least until conditions are such that we would want to change the date. The public has become accustomed to the date-based guidance.  Keeping the date-based guidance provides more information, even if it may dilute somewhat the primacy of the thresholds and create a little confusion.  Because the date currently projected is far in the future, it might make sense to use this combined approach for some time and then later drop the date guidance when the economy has evolved further.  \u201cWhat variables should the thresholds reference.  Regarding inflation, should the thresholds reference actual inflation or a projection.\u201d I think this was said by someone earlier, by President Bullard, but I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a good idea to specify an unemployment threshold in terms of a realized value while expressing an inflation threshold solely in terms of a projection.  Symmetrical treatment is desirable in order to preserve a sense of a balanced approach.  And I think it\u2019s possible to craft language explaining that the threshold both acknowledges realized values and places weight on the outlook for each threshold indicator.  For example, focusing on inflation, the statement might read something like this:  \u201c. . . provided that realized inflation as indicated by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, taken together with the Committee\u2019s projection of inflation at a one-to two-year horizon, does not deviate by more than \u00bd percentage point above the Committee\u2019s 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\u201d  I realize that that\u2019s a mouthful, but I think it\u2019s possible to combine both backward looking and forward looking in one statement.  I\u2019m comfortable with an unemployment threshold of 6\u00bd percent and a \u00bd percent tolerance above the inflation objective, if sufficiently qualified as I said earlier. There is a question of, \u201cIn what way, if at all, should the language indicate that the Committee may tighten policy before any thresholds are crossed.\u201d I favor explicitly communicating that conditions may develop in which, in the Committee\u2019s judgment, policy would be tightened before a threshold is crossed.  This may have to be repeated ritualistically to ensure that it isn\u2019t lost on the public consciousness.  I think language to this effect could be easily enough included in the statement.  The final question:  Should, and how should, \u201cthe Committee provide guidance about the timing of liftoff after a threshold is crossed and the likely course of policy after the initial increase\u201d in the fed funds rate.  The language that the staff members developed in their memo works quite well in that respect.  So I think it\u2019s quite sufficient. To summarize my views, I believe the tests of an approach to thresholds, if adopted, should be as follows: improves clarity of the Committee\u2019s reaction function to the extent possible, and I think there are limits in how far we can achieve that; allows flexibility to deal with various circumstances; recognizes that multiple indicators must be considered, and the Committee will make a judgment call in the end; and does not convey that thresholds have a hard and fast mechanical character.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to thank the staff for this thoughtful memo.  It was helpful to me.  Given the communication challenges that the memo highlights, and taking into account the number of changes that we have already introduced into the statement, my support for numerical thresholds is, admittedly, reluctant.  Ideally, I\u2019d prefer to return to more qualitative language in the statement and omit the date. I do view removing the calendar date, though, as potentially positive.  And changes in the date, I understand, are always open to interpretation\u2014either that the Committee\u2019s outlook has changed or that its view onappropriate policy has changed.  In that sense, I think thresholds could allow us to replace the date-based guidance and clarify how the Committee\u2019s view of the appropriate policy path is related to economic conditions.  On the other hand, I would not want to restrict the flexibility of the Committee to respond to unforeseen events, especially if conditions dramatically improve or deteriorate.  So escape clauses along the lines of those in the mockups, I think, are important considerations, including financial conditions as factors in the Committee\u2019s decision on when to tighten policy.  These clauses suggest that the Committee is equally ready both for the possibility of a liftoff before thresholds are crossed and for the possibility of maintaining a fed funds rate close to zero even after thresholds are crossed.  And in that sense, I prefer that the language not emphasize the latter. If thresholds were to be adopted, I would prefer that they replace the date-based guidance.  If the date were retained alongside the thresholds, I would be concerned that the private sector would continue to put too much weight on the date.  In addition, at each meeting, the Committee would have to agree on the date at which one of the thresholds would likely be crossed. Turning to the specific questions, rather than using only the unemployment rate as a measure of broader labor market conditions, I agree with the language in the mockups making clear that the Committee will consider other factors besides the unemployment rate.  While a threshold for unemployment would signal the Committee\u2019s intention of continuing to support the economic recovery, it is also important that the Committee guard against inflationary pressures. A buildup of such pressures is always a concern, whether it is due to misestimating the amount of slack in the economy or to a persistent shift in inflationary expectations. The condition in the mockups that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored is therefore another important escape clause, in my view.To make yet clearer that the Committee is guarding against such unforeseen consequences of its policies, I would also prefer to describe the inflation number in the forward guidance as a trigger rather than a threshold.  Having an inflation trigger ensures that if inflation rises too much, accommodation will be removed.  To capture broad inflationary pressures, I would suggest setting a trigger based on observable inflation rather than simply a forecast of future inflation.  My hesitation to rely on an inflation projection is based on the well-known challenges involved in forecasting inflation.  In particular, I\u2019m concerned that these inflation forecasts may be based on misestimates of the amount of slack in the economy.  In terms of an observable measure of inflation, we might consider the 12-month change in both the headline and the core PCE measures.  Policy action would then be based on observing both inflation measures moving above the designated trigger level. By using these two measures as a joint trigger, if you will, it communicates the importance of headline inflation in the Committee\u2019s mandate while emphasizing that the Committee primarily responds to underlying inflation pressures and not transitory price movements. Finally, at this point, I would not favor providing additional guidance on the fed funds rate path after liftoff, because I would question the value of such a commitment to policy so far in the future.  Thank you", "   MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also want to thank the staff for the very useful and thorough background memo that was given to the Committee.  When we began to provide forward guidance about the liftoff of the federal funds rate, I preferred specifying economic conditions rather than a date.  After thinking about the issues raised in the staff memo and listening to my colleagues\u2019 comments around the table today, I\u2019ve concluded that agreeing on an effective threshold framework is going to be difficult, and such a framework would entail its own risks. Turning to some of the questions posed to the Committee, I see little value in publishing both dates and thresholds, because publishing both is very likely to confuse the public.  To me, the question is whether we should completely scrap our date-driven language and replace it with thresholds.  While the answer may be yes in principle, in practice the devil is in the details. There are many crucial challenges that we\u2019re going to have to address before we could switch to thresholds.  And my assessment of these challenges leads me to be hesitant about adopting numerical thresholds. In response to the question of what variables to use, I would choose the unemployment rate as the appropriate proxy for our employment threshold.  A more problematic question, though, concerns what inflation measures we should use in our thresholds.  As the memo describes, using projections of inflation minimizes the chances of violating the inflation threshold prematurely.  However, there is a credibility problem that would be associated with the verifiability of our forecast.  And in light of this problem, I would prefer to use backward-looking measures of actual inflation, which have the clear and crucial advantage that they are easily verifiable. To mitigate the chance of prematurely violating the threshold, I would prefer to use core PCE inflation. Still, this is a far from perfect choice. It just seems to be the best among a range of imperfect options. It would seem prudent to set a relatively lower threshold for the unemployment rate, and a relatively higher inflation threshold, so that we\u2019re not led to tighten policy before the thresholds are breached.  But generous thresholds can lead to the problem that unemployment or inflation might not have crossed a threshold when we want to tighten policy.  This problem is endemic toany threshold.  The distinction between thresholds and triggers is therefore important, but conveying this difference to the public may be very difficult.  This is especially the case when a threshold has been breached but there\u2019s no reaction on our part.  How we communicate that thresholds matter, even when they\u2019re not being reacted to, is important. If we\u2019re going to proceed with the adoption of numerical thresholds, to me, a reasonable balance, given our objectives, would be 6\u00bd percent on unemployment and 2\u00bd percent on inflation, using the wording that\u2019s outlined in the memo that keeps the emphasis on our 2 percent longer-term inflation objective.  Regardless of whether we use thresholds or dates, the macroeconomic efficacy of our monetary policy depends critically on what reaction function or rule we use after we begin increasing rates.  The staff memo clarifies that from a pure efficacy-of-policy perspective, the big gains are associated with informing the public of the likely path of the federal funds rate after liftoff.  A rule with inertia provides the strongest policy accommodation, as it promises to keep rates lower for longer.  I personally prefer adopting a guidepost for policy that is similar to the Taylor (1999) rule with inertia.  And I do hope that we can make some progress on this issue.  But after listening to today\u2019s comments, it\u2019s undoubtedly going to require some additional discussions.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  But it precludes moving to maintain that and prevent expected inflation from rising above 2\u00bd", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also found the staff memos to be very helpful, especially in understanding the potential outcomes from various thresholds.  And a number of people around the table, at this and previous meetings, have been quite persuasive in their arguments in both directions.  [Laughter] Still, my preference is not to use thresholds.  It\u2019s still not clear to me that the use of thresholds offers significantly better results than more-general communication in indicating that we plan to hold off liftoff until after the recovery has begun to strengthen.  Furthermore, I think it\u2019s easy to underestimate the communication challenges that are posed by thresholds, especially if you consider a wider audience than the dealer community, the narrow academic community, and the financial press, whose feedback we hear most clearly and who may be more inclined to pay attention to the nuances of our language.  And finally, as someone who has spent most of a lifetime reacting to the level of interest rates and the speed of change, I prefer a solution that gets us off the zero bound earlier and that has a gentler slope afterliftoff.  Thus, looking at the simulated outcomes under alternative policies in the Tealbook, I prefer the inertial Taylor (1999) strategy as having nearly the same outcome as the extended baseline but with a gentler slope.  Having said all of that, my preference is a preference rather than a strong objection.  And the memo did help me clarify my thoughts about thresholds should they be implemented. Taking the questions in turn, if thresholds are implemented\u20142.a.\u2014I think they should replace the date-based guidance, even in their first use. On 2.b., of the alternatives tested in the memo, my preference would be to use thresholds of 6\u00bd percent unemployment and 2\u00bd percent projected inflation one to two years out.  On 2.c., I will admit that I lean more toward the forecast than the commitment side of the date guidance, and I think the date gives us room to consider a range of factors.  But much as I yearn for every degree of flexibility possible, including too many escape clauses negates the benefits of the policy that we\u2019re trying to implement, especially when combined with all of the exit ramps we had to provide to reach agreement on LSAPs.  So if we do adopt thresholds, I don\u2019t think I would indicate that the Committee might tighten policy before the thresholds are crossed.  Rather, I would view any such decision as something to be explained if and when it happened, or language that could be added if the possibility became more likely. For 2.d., along the same lines, I think too much discussion about the likely actions after the thresholds are reached would have many of the same difficulties, not the least of which would be agreement as to what those actions might be and how to articulate them.  Combining my responses to 2.c. and 2.d., I find it hard to see how our \u201ckinda/sorta/maybe\u201d approach, such as articulating thresholds but modifying them to say that we might act before they\u2019re reached or that we might not act after they\u2019re reached, depending on other measures that aren\u2019t specified in the threshold\u2014how is that preferable to date guidance thatwe might or might not move in response to incoming data, and that might be a forecast or might be a commitment.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  How about neither", " MR. BULLARD.  Yes, and I\u2019ll just add one thing, which didn\u2019t really come out around the table here:  On the quantitative easing side, we already have the language that I would prefer to have also for the interest rate.  So I would say that you could align the two and then have it be the same way. I think that\u2019s something that didn\u2019t come up a lot here, only a little bit", " MR. EVANS.  Sensing the warm feeling for qualitative state contingency in the language in our current statement about substantial improvement in labor markets, I feel similarly about that, but I want to point out that I would guess most people\u2019s expectations were that we would stop asset purchases before we got to the point where we\u2019d want the funds rate to lift off.  So we need a second qualitative description of \u201csubstantial\u201d substantial improvement in labor markets", "  So for the translation, you\u2019d back off at least\u2014MR. POTTER. Put 2.3 to 2.5, and then you have to decide what the inflation risk premium would be", " MR. EVANS.  Did I miss a magnitude", " MR. POTTER.  The models that we have, which try to look at the recent relationship between the secondary rate and primary rate, would suggest we\u2019ve seen most of the pass-through.  However, some of the structural features that you pointed out and other people have pointed out might suggest that we could see more competition in the market.  I think Governor Duke pointed that out, that this is one area where the banks are actually making money.  That would then disturb the relationship we\u2019ve estimated over the past few years.  You might see more pass-through, but on the models we have right now over the past two years, most of the pass-through is there", " MR. FISHER.  Maybe, Mr. Chairman, we could just monitor that as we go through time in terms of the efficacy of the program. Then regarding your chart 8 and your comment that net issuance is expected to be negative:  One of the things I\u2019m a little bit concerned about in terms of composition is that you have private sector issuance being positive, and unless you correct me, I think it\u2019s correct that we\u2019ve had a significant uptick in junk issuance", "  MR. FISHER.  Steve, you may remember some time ago that WikiLeaks had this release of a cable and a conversation with now Vice Premier Li when he was chairman of the Communist Party of Liaoning, which is a northeastern province in China, and they were asking how he and the Politburo got the best measurement of economic growth; he referred to rail shipments and electricity consumption as well as lending activity. We\u2019ve been tracking this.  I\u2019m sure you have as well, but I have a question at the end of making a few data points.  One is that electricity consumption, at least in the series that we\u2019ve been able to construct, is expanding at about 2 percent\u2014not a very robust number.  If you look at freight in terms of train shipments, it\u2019s down 7 percent, and that\u2019s the lowest we can construct going all the way back to 2003.  And last, intercoastal shipping activity has dropped 34 percent, year to date.  So I\u2019m wondering if we are able to parse from that how much is related to fallow export activity\u2014you mentioned Europe, which is certainly hurting, and the slowdown elsewhere\u2014or what it might tell us about their own domestic activity and how weak things really are.  Because if you look at the indicators that I just mentioned, the growth rate, which I\u2019ve always found suspect, would seem to be much less than what they\u2019re reporting.  I wonder what your take is on that", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Most of our contacts in the Sixth District continue with their wait-and-see approach tied to broader concerns about well-recognized uncertainties.  A few more of our directors said they anticipate some greater deceleration in the short term than they expressed at the time of the previous FOMC meeting. For example, a director from the country\u2019s second-largest retailer, a national home improvement chain, said that despite the fact they had experienced better-than-expected sales recently, they are budgeting a slowdown in 2013 tied directly to fiscal cliff effects. In our board meetings and advisory councils, we continue to hear reports of deferred projects across several sectors.  While this does not bode well for demand in the short term, it   suggests there may well be a significant level of pent-up investment activity that will take shape quickly once greater clarity regarding the near- to medium-term outlook is established. Regarding the national outlook, my GDP growth projection aligns pretty closely with the Tealbook over the next few quarters, but I\u2019m more cautious about an acceleration in growth materializing in the medium term.  The reason I asked the questions earlier of David Wilcox is I note that the Tealbook sees an acceleration beginning mid-2013, and it appears this acceleration triggers the staff\u2019s assumed cessation of the LSAP3 after eight months.  Because my forecast has lower GDP growth toward the back end of the forecast horizon, I don\u2019t have the same confidence that policy will have done its work by mid-2013. My outlook for inflation runs a little higher than the Tealbook, holding at the Committee\u2019s longer-term objective, and my outlook for 2013 and 2014 year-end unemployment is essentially the same as the Tealbook, but the quarterly jobs growth stories differ enough to mention.  My projections assume relatively even jobs growth across the quarters, while the Tealbook shows a pretty steep acceleration starting in the back half of 2013, following on weaker numbers in the first half. I mention this because it raises in my mind\u2014and again, was the reason for the question earlier\u2014the basis for the Tealbook\u2019s assumption of the LSAP stopping at midyear. I\u2019d like to comment in this round on two questions related to the performance and outlook of the economy that I expect the Committee will confront in coming meetings.  In the intermeeting period we engaged a number of contacts across the Southeast to gather anecdotal observations on these questions.  The first question was about the housing sector and any perceived impediments to effective transmission of MBS-related monetary actions through the mortgage credit channel to the real economy.  Improvement in the housing market is gaining traction in my part of the country.  Builders and realtors report a bounce in construction and sales activity.  There was widespread agreement among bankers that HARP2 is making headway in addressing underwater mortgages for those that were current on their payments.  That said, the banking and real estate contacts report that several obstacles to stronger mortgage activity exist, including impaired credit quality of potential borrowers, conservative loan underwriting, and administrative backlogs. Regarding the transmission process through mortgage credit originators, my contacts indicate that a capacity problem does indeed exist.  The larger mortgage players have not committed sufficient resources to expand refi capacity because the refi business is not viewed as sustainable once rates begin to rise. It\u2019s worth mentioning that a member of President Rosengren\u2019s staff provided my staff with a preliminary analysis of pass-through from the secondary MBS markets to primary markets, and the work suggests\u2014or at least our interpretation is\u2014that there has been substantial but not complete pass-through from secondary to primary mortgage markets.  I think more analysis needs to be done to map pass-through from rates all the way to originations, closings, and upward pressure on house prices. The second question is related to labor market conditions in general, with a particular focus on elements that might be relevant to the Committee\u2019s future assessment of sustainable improvement in the outlook for employment.  In the near future, the Committee is going to have to evaluate the outlook for employment looking at a range of data inputs, of course, but perhaps some attention to anecdotal information.  My comment is anecdotal, of course, but we continue to hear that some industries, notably the retail sector, are planning to increase the relative size of their part-time workforce in order to minimize the cost associated with mandated health care coverage.  One of my directors, the CEO of a multi-format national restaurant firm, recently made news by announcing his company\u2019s intention to move to an increasing use of part-time employees in anticipation of implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Our home-improvement chain director has said the same thing.  This bears watching, I think, as we interpret the data on employment and labor markets, particularly as an alteration of the recent LSAP3 policy is considered.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I look at the Ninth District, I think that the economic tale is an unusually tangled one.  There are definitely positive signs.  In the Minnesota labor market, the number of job vacancies and the job vacancy rate recovered to their pre-recession levels.  At the same time, Minnesota\u2019s unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in the second quarter of 2012, only about a percentage point higher than in the second quarter of 2007. There are also positive signs in the housing market.  According to the Case-Shiller index, housing prices in Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul were about 6 percent higher in June than the year before.  But there are also reasons for concern.  Our business contacts report that their desire to engage in either cap-ex or hiring has declined significantly since the beginning of the year.  As you can probably guess, the one-word explanation for their caution is uncertainty, primarily about international demand and United States fiscal policy. This mixed picture is true at the national level as well.  In housing, the recent surge in housing starts is a positive element.  More important, at least from my point of view, housing prices seem to have begun to rise from what we hope is the bottom.  In the labor market we see signs of improvement, such as household employment having grown at about 180,000 per month over the past three months.  Measures of financial market uncertainty, such as the VIX and VVIX, remain low by post-2007 standards.  This month\u2019s Michigan survey of consumersentiment jumped to levels not seen since the beginning of the recession.  That\u2019s all on the positive side. On the negative side, manufacturing has slowed.  The Tealbook reports that nonresidential investment is likely to be slow in the near term, and the NFIB survey of small business attitudes toward hiring has really a near-recessionary feel to it. Financial markets continue to exhibit levels of risk aversion that I would have to say are extraordinarily high.  The 20-year real TIPS yield is essentially zero.  This means that on the margin, investors do not see any investments better than giving up a unit of purchasing power today for a unit of purchasing power 20 years in the future.  Now, as somebody who has spent much of my life teaching about the time\u2013value of money, I find this quite disheartening.  [Laughter]  Even though some observers view equity prices as being inexplicably high, the Tealbook documents that the equity risk premium is actually higher now than at any point in the past 20 years. My outlook for the national economy is reflective of this mixed picture.  My benchmark outlook is about the same as the Tealbook\u2019s, albeit with slightly less economic growth and slightly more inflation in 2014, somewhat similar to what President Lockhart was saying. But I would say that the uncertainties of my benchmark outlook are much more important in my policy thinking than the outlook itself.  On the one hand, slowing international demand or a trip over the fiscal cliff would lead to downward pressure on both employment and prices in our own country. On the other hand, it is also possible that we could see a protracted increase in housing prices.  Such an increase would generate a welcome boost to median household net worth, there would be an increased demand for goods and services, and this would push upward on employment and prices.  So in my outlook I see a great deal of uncertainty about our rate of progress to our dual mandate objectives.  We need a way to communicate to the financial markets and to the public that we stand ready to be appropriately supportive in case of an adverse shock to employment and prices, while remaining appropriately vigilant against unduly high inflation.  In the next go-round I will discuss how, not surprisingly, a threshold policy would provide exactly that kind of communication.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like President Pianalto, our own trimmed-mean work at the Dallas Fed indicates that inflation is well contained and is running at roughly a little bit below our 2 percent longer-term target; so inflation isn\u2019t the issue.   I noted President Williams\u2019s comments, and I listened to them very carefully.  I agree with him fully that China and Europe are a deep concern to at least those that operate globally.  I would add that for the first time, Steve Kamin, I am actually hearing of slow pays in China and lagging receivables. For example, in the case of Foxconn, which has 1 million employees\u2014the way the semiconductor companies work with them is through a collection agency.  That collection agency is reporting slow pays from Foxconn.  You are seeing other similar signs of lagging in payments and cash flow issues.  There may be more there.  We just need to watch it.  But it adds to the angst in the business community.  Europe is already full of angst as you mentioned, and I am not going to comment further on that. Unlike President Williams, my corporate contacts continue to talk about the fiscal cliff, and the differentiation is as follows. It is one thing if measures are taken, particularly temporary measures, to avoid the fiscal cliff.  We all know that it would have at least a stay on the gross GDP impact.  The real issue is employment and how you plan and budget for employment.  And, again, citing the people that I speak to\u2014which is a pretty good survey I think, including not just my directors, but a broader group\u2014they continue to worry about whether or not they will be able to have specifics around which to plan not only expansion of cap-ex but also expansion of head count. President Kocherlakota mentioned the NFIB survey.  I have talked quite a bit about that publicly.  It is not very encouraging.  As one small business leader told me, it is very hard to build a railroad when you don\u2019t know where you are going to be able to lay the tracks.  I think that still remains a problem.  And drilling down on this issue in terms of how corporations actually budget, in terms of payroll and the larger corporations\u2019 job enhancing cap-ex, temporary solutions to the fiscal cliff do nothing but push out their budgeting cycle.  It is pretty clear, citing a direct quote from one of my most reliable corporate contacts, a large national operator, that already \u201cstrategic positioning steps for the second half of 2013, fourth quarter 2013, are being shelved.\u201d My principal concern is employment.  It has been for a very long time.  I think that when you mentioned uncertainty, President Kocherlakota, that is still the operative word in the private sector.  And I don\u2019t think we can take any relief from whether or not there is a short-term solution to the fiscal cliff.  What I care about is employment.  So we may not have the dent to GDP that we might fear.  But I do not think it is going to lead to more robust employment activity if we have temporary measures, which is what I expect. I would like to conclude, Mr. Chairman, with a comment that President Lockhart made because it\u2019s not unimportant.  The restaurant industry claims that they have 1 out of 10 workers in the workforce.  I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s correct or not.  But the Affordable Care Act is not extended to people that work 30 hours or less.  What is interesting about that industry is the average restaurant worker works 48 hours.  Most of the restaurateurs and\u2014I love this term\u2014the casual dining establishments are actually taking steps to move their workers to less than 30 hours or to make them, in one way or another, temporary employees. This may screw around with the employment data for a while, which is why I mention it. I think President Lockhart is correct: We ought to pay attention to it.  It is not unimportant, if it is, indeed, that significant a portion of the workforce.  The Act may have an effect that is counter to what was originally planned by the authorities that framed it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Broadly speaking, the Eighth District economy appeared to experience relatively strong growth of real personal income and consumption expenditures over the first half of 2012, compared with the growth seen during 2011. Since then, however, the District economy may have lost some momentum, as growth measured by state-coincident indicators has begun to slow", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The information that has rolled in over the past few weeks has been puzzling.  To my mind, the jury is still out when it comes to judging its implications for the economic outlook. On the positive side, data pertaining to the household sector have generally been heartening.  Spending has picked up noticeably.  And according to the preliminary October Michigan survey, consumer attitudes turned decidedly rosier.  A sizable fraction of consumers now judge their financial situation more favorably, and they seem blithely unperturbed by the impending fiscal cliff. More households expect good economic conditions over the next year and the next five years, and more anticipate that the national unemployment rate will move down.  The same improvement in confidence since mid-September is evident in the daily Gallup poll, although, interestingly, it is confined to Democrats and Independents.  Incoming data on housing has also been upbeat.  In contrast to this encouraging news, data pertaining to the business sector reveals disconcerting trends.  We have seen a worrisome decline in core capital goods orders and sluggishness in manufacturing output.  Moreover, surveys suggest that confidence among businesses is weak.  They seem preoccupied with the fiscal cliff and their prospects for earnings and sales, and these concerns are impeding hiring and investment.  As Narayana and Richard noted, in the NFIB, for example, small business hiring plans recently plunged.  The latest Conference Board measure of CEO confidence reveals greater pessimism about both current conditions and the short-term outlook. The latest employment report contains similarly conflicting signals.  On the one hand, the unemployment rate declined notably, which is a welcome and favorable development.  Some of the decline may conceivably reflect statistical noise, but the fact that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the Gallup poll also declined by a similar amount between mid-September and mid-October supports the view that there is signal in this decline.  The Gallup poll is a completely independent survey that reaches around 30,000 households over a 30-day period.  In contrast, private nonfarm payroll gains were lackluster.  The magnitude of job gains in the household survey was eye-popping, but as Glenn Follette discussed yesterday at our pre-FOMC briefing, when adjustments are made to put the household survey measure on the same conceptual basis as the payroll survey, the two figures come into close alignment at around 100,000. In sum, more-recent data point to some improvement.  I don\u2019t think we have yet seen anything that qualifies as a substantial improvement in current labor market conditions or in the outlook going forward.  I, therefore, think that at our December meeting, we must be prepared to continue our MBS program and undertake additional longer-term asset purchases to replace those now associated with our maturity extension program. We reaffirmed in September that we would monitor both the efficacy and costs of our asset purchase program.  In this regard, it appears that our September announcements were successful in meaningfully shifting market expectations and yields.  Simon summarized some of the effects we have seen.  At this point, the modal date for the end of our flow-based purchase program is early 2014.  And as he noted, a number of dealers interpret conditions that would constitute a substantial improvement in the labor market outlook as a decline in the unemployment rate to around 7 percent, coupled with a sustained period of above-trend growth in payroll employment.Our September announcement was followed by noticeable declines in MBS yields.  Stock prices rose and the exchange rate declined following the announcement by amounts that roughly accord with the staff\u2019s earlier expectations. Nominal Treasury yields, in contrast, did not fall following our announcement, but I do not necessarily interpret this as a negative signal.  First of all, the roughly 10 basis point increase in measures of breakeven inflation over the next week reversed only part of their precipitous decline in the summer of 2011.  That decline was certainly unwelcome, most likely reflecting flight to safety and heightened concerns about negative tail risks. Furthermore, to the extent that the recent increase in breakeven inflation reflects greater confidence in the durability of the recovery and lower odds that we will undershoot our inflation target, I would interpret the response of nominal Treasury yields as fully consistent with the intent of our statement, provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with our price-stability objective. And I interpret the evidence from both TIPS and recent surveys as indicating, indeed, continued confidence in our price-stability commitment. In this case, modestly higher inflation expectations actually facilitate the attainment of our employment goal.  After all, in modern macroeconomic models, inflation expectations are a key channel through which monetary accommodation stimulates growth.  Higher inflation expectations lower real interest rates, thereby boosting spending.  Indeed, TIPS yields at both the five-year and five-year-forward horizons declined during the day and week following our announcement. Overall, then, I am very pleased with how markets have interpreted our actions in September and responded to them.  I will discuss the policy implications during our go-round tomorrow", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While I see some improvement at the margin, it still feels to me like a world with 2 percent inflation and 2 percent economic growth, which is obviously not strong enough to reduce unemployment.  Like others, I found a dichotomy between the household sector, where there\u2019s been a fairly strong run of data, being to some extent canceled out by the weakness of the business sector. It has been well covered by many around the table, so I\u2019ll skip to the punch line on that dichotomy to say that it\u2019s not easy to   generate a story that accounts for both the strength in households and the weakness and uncertainty in business.  I think the hope has to be that a good part of the business weakness comes from the decline in global trade, as President Plosser suggested, and that does seem to be part of the story\u2014the overall weakness in Europe and Asia and the decline in global trade\u2014 rather than activity here at home. Or it could be that businesses are seeing weakness that the households haven\u2019t seen yet but soon will or vice versa.  I guess time will tell. I will just mention a couple things that I thought were interesting in my conversations with investors.  First, a number of hedge fund managers that I talked to are now saying that thanks to the ECB, sentiment has turned markedly more positive regarding Europe after the events culminating in the OMTs at the end of the summer.  For example, the founder of a large multi-strategy hedge fund told me that it had gone heavily to cash at the time of the Greek elections in June, and his firm now believes that post-OMT the bad outcome is really off the table for now and it\u2019s safe to invest and it\u2019s safe to stay invested, despite expectations of bumps in the road.  That\u2019s a big change in risk sentiment in the past 60 days, and it\u2019s much broader than just the handful of firms that are buying peripheral sovereign debt, the courageous few.  So I think it\u2019s really a central bank stepping in and cutting off tail risk. In that light, the second thing I would share is that a number of investors said to me in the past few weeks the same phrase, which is, \u201cWell, your policy is working,\u201d but what they meant in context was, \u201cWell, you want people to take some risk, and they are.\u201d And one place that is showing up big time is in lower-quality fixed income.  There was not a lot of pass-through in our September announcement to Treasuries or to super high-grade corporates, but the pass-through to BBBs and to high yield was very strong, and it does speak of a reach for a yield.  Investors are clamoring for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, anything with a decent yield. So that part of it is working.  In fact, a number of investors\u2014this is a bit of a cautionary note, more than a bit\u2014say that deals are being done in the high-yield market on terms that are very similar to the bubble terms of 2005 to 2007.  You\u2019ve got the return of dividend deals, and in a dividend deal, ownership doesn\u2019t change hands, but fixed-income investors fund a large one-time dividend to private equity investors, and it typically involves structural subordination, peak leverage levels, payment-in-kind bonds, and no covenants.  So this is a very peaky, bubbly structure, and we\u2019re seeing more and more of those. In the new deal market, there\u2019s a large industrial deal that I\u2019m pretty familiar with that is being done at 6\u00bc times leverage in the next few weeks. It\u2019s rated CCC by both Moody\u2019s and S&P.  In most ordinary markets there is no CCC market for paper, and this is being done at 6\u00bc times leverage with a weighted average cost of capital of under 6 percent.  So private equity firms are more focused on the level than they are the spread, and under 6 percent for that kind of paper is an all-time record, again, very reminiscent of a bubble period. So demand for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds is far in excess of supply.  This can be expected to continue.  On the bright side, you do not yet see the return of that leveraged mark-to-market structure that was so unstable in the crash, and you also don\u2019t see very large deals getting done yet.  There\u2019s sort of a cap around $5 billion, and you don\u2019t see dealers committing their balance sheets. I think all three of these things are positives for holding down the systemic risk aspects of this emerging bubble, if you will.  But we\u2019ve seen the competitive dynamic develop into a race to the bottom before, and so these markets are definitely worth keeping a close eye on.  I pass that along.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ENGLISH.  I wanted to present this information precisely because I thought the expectations in markets for the total amount of purchases are different than what we\u2019ve written down in alternative B. I mean, we had to write down our alternatives before we had the dealer survey in hand.  The dealers\u2019 expectations moved from immediately after the September meeting, when the Desk did kind of a flash survey, to the final dealer survey for this meeting.  So we ended up in a place where we were writing down balance sheet sizes that were, to us, reasonable\u2014as we discussed yesterday\u2014but are not that well aligned with what\u2019s in markets", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you.  Bill, I noticed that in all three alternatives, in the first paragraph in terms of our statement of current conditions we\u2019re mentioning higher energy prices.  I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that decision, especially given the fact that in the go-round we actually heard very little about higher energy prices.  If, in fact, we were to make a change in this direction, I wonder whether we\u2019d be maybe signaling more than we\u2019re actually seeing. I just wanted to hear your thoughts on including energy prices", "MR. ENGLISH.  I think one issue that comes up, if the balance sheet gets bigger by more than roughly $750 billion, is that the exit principles say sales will take place over three to five years.  The staff has generally assumed five.  And normalization of the size of the balance sheet will take place over two to three years. If the sales take place over five years and the balance sheet gets more than about $750 billion larger, the normalization will take longer than three years.  So as you go from alternative B to alternative A, the normalization would take longer than the three years that we have written down in the exit principles", " MR. ENGLISH. I think in the past we have been hesitant to just use whatever the market\u2019s forecast is for policy in the staff forecast because we don\u2019t necessarily agree with the market\u2019s assessment of the outlook or your likely reaction function.  I wouldn\u2019t want to say that no matter what, we are going to be writing down the market participants\u2019 expectations for policy in the staff forecast.  We are going to have to make judgments about the outlook and about the likely policy response to that outlook", " MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Well, another way to look at it is the market is expecting more accommodation, but they don\u2019t really have an appreciably different forecast from what we do.  They think it is going to be less effective than we do.  That\u2019s why they think we are going to have to do more than what we think", " MR. ENGLISH.  I guess I would want to look more carefully at the dealer survey to see whether that is the right way to interpret this, or whether the right way is that they have a different reaction function built in than we do", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I have just a few things to say.  One is to second what you just said.  If we want to communicate that our anticipation about the future path of policy is close to what the staff\u2019s forecast is, well, we should figure out ways to do that. If we are happy with what the market participants currently expect, then I guess we should take that on board in the way we think about the future path of policy. I have a separate question, though.  At the end of paragraph 2 of alternative B, there is a line that says, \u201cThe Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.\u201d  This sentence made more sense to me at the previous meeting, as it referred to what would happen if we did not take action.  Now that we\u2019ve taken action, it makes less sense to me.  I think it would be read, perhaps sloppily by people reading the statement, as saying that the Committee anticipates that under its current policy choice that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.  I guess my question is, what is the staff trying to communicate by including this sentence at the end of paragraph 2 of alternative B. Is it about the path of inflation without sufficient policy accommodation, or is it about the path of inflation under the path of policy described in alternative B", " It \u201cwould\u201d be\u2014 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes, I disagree with that.  It says, \u201cwithout sufficient policy accommodation,\u201d \u201cmight not,\u201d and \u201cwould", " MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was happy to hear you refer to The New York Times this morning because that article confirms what many people at this table have been saying meeting after meeting. (Although in the upper right-hand side of that newspaper, it has always been proud to say, \u201cAll the News That\u2019s Fit to Print,\u201d there are cynics who would say, \u201cAll the News That\u2019s Fit to Tint.\u201d) I\u2019m not quite sure if that is an affirmation or something that I should be worried about, having made the points that are made in that article, many of them this morning.  The underlying point is that, again, the macroeconomic effects of short-term solutions to the fiscal cliff may be one thing, but how it affects businesses\u2019 confidence is another.  I\u2019m glad you made that point.   I listened very carefully to the conversation around the table yesterday, and I want to make a couple of quick points because I went early and then actually listened to what other people were saying.  [Laughter]  Governor Tarullo made the point some time ago that we shouldn\u2019t be reading statements, we should actually be having a dialogue.  I want to respond a little bit. We have to be very careful. I sensed\u2014let me try to state this politely\u2014a little bit of self-congratulation that QE3 had had such a great impact on the market.  Of course it has had a great effect on the fixed-income market.  This is a principle of hydrodynamics.  It\u2019s Bernoulli\u2019s principle.  If you shove a lot of volume through a narrow space, you\u2019re going to get a faster flow. Simon gave a brilliant report yesterday\u2014as he always does\u2014and we saw the reaction in terms of the spreads and what has happened with MBS, and we had some conversations.  Governor Powell and I pointed out certain activity, at least in the CCC and lesser category\u2014the junk bond sector\u2014and some of the activities being seen were fully expected.  What I didn\u2019t hear was that the stock market is actually down since we previously met by 3.2 percent.  It rallied the day after.  It\u2019s off 3.6 percent since then. The real issue was raised by Betsy\u2019s intervention, in my view.  I simply want to make the point that I have questions about the wealth effect, and I would like to see further studies on that.  You mentioned that, Mr. Chairman, in your brilliant summary.  Stock prices are questionable.  How much does it really affect, at least in a reasonable time frame, the median household.  And then, Betsy\u2019s point, as I interpreted it, was a key point.  And that is, the transmission between MBS prices and what actually happens to the average household\u2014and we think it will take time. I am always thinking at this table: I don\u2019t work for the big banks; I don\u2019t work for the dealers; I work for the average American household, and that is our job.  And the question is  efficacy. I think it is a little bit too early to judge an effect. Besides that, as we know, despite contradictory data that Governor Yellen presented from Zillow, and so on, the housing market actually took off before we launched QE3.  We were not quite sure, but that has been confirmed by the data now.  We have to be very careful and take our time to understand what the real effect of what we have done is, in addition to what we see in terms of immediate financial indexes.  That is my point. With regard to the options that have been presented to us, although I was not supportive of QE3\u2014and I still think it is to be determined whether it is successful\u2014I would support alternative B. I appreciate some of the language tweaking that took place in the first paragraph to indicate a little peppier consumer behavior.  I had suggested that in a memo. I\u2019m grateful that you took it, and I consider it certainly less worse than alternative A.  And because we are already going down that path, it is the most likely option to adopt, and, even though my heart tells me that alternative C is closer to my thinking, I would support alternative B.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support option B.  Minimizing changes to the statement until we get more visibility into fiscal policy and the effect of our earlier actions seems appropriate. At our next meeting, I would ideally like to adopt thresholds for actions based on economic outcomes and to build a consensus around beginning Treasury purchases when the MEP ends.  Reducing our gross purchases at the start of 2013 risks a noticeable reversal in the configuration of asset prices that our initial announcement set in train.  To me, that seems   premature and would further risk an undesirable return to the weak recovery that we have experienced to date. The Tealbook assumes that we will stop purchases next June with the unemployment rate at 7.9 percent, nonfarm payroll growing in the first half of 2013 at the same pace as the second half of this year, and the PCE inflation rate below 2 percent.  The optics, if not the economics, of stopping under such circumstances seems troublesome.  Our statement is clear in suggesting we will continue purchases until we see substantial improvement in labor markets.  I do not view substantial improvement as consistent with an unemployment rate 0.1 percentage point higher than it was in September. My own threshold for discussing the end of an $85 billion purchase program for Treasury and MBS securities would be 7\u00bc percent, assuming that inflation and inflation expectations remained well behaved. At that point, the discussion should center on whether overall labor market conditions were consistent with substantial improvement.  For example, whether the lower unemployment rate reflected job creation rather than reductions in the labor force; whether we had seen sustained, robust payroll employment growth; and whether we envision continued substantial improvement in labor markets for some quarters to come.  Under those conditions, I would stop asset purchases and stop reinvesting. My threshold for beginning the discussion about raising the federal funds rate would be an unemployment rate of 6\u00bd percent\u2014again, assuming that inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved.  Whether the threshold became a trigger would, again, be determined by whether the lower unemployment rate reflected a real improvement in labor markets and the likelihood that it would continue on.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  I will spare you my John Wayne.  [Laughter] I cannot support additional asset purchases at this time.  Further stimulus, I think, is unlikely to result in a discernible improvement in economic growth.  And I think if it does, it will cause an unwanted increase in inflation. Economic activity has been growing at a modest pace on average. Inflation has been fluctuating around 2 percent.  Unemployment does remain high by historical standards, but the improvement in the labor market appears to have been held back by real impediments beyond the capacity of monetary policy to offset.  In such circumstances, I think further monetary stimulus runs the risk of raising inflation and destabilizing inflation expectations.  Moreover, I think further expansion of our balance sheet would make our exit strategy riskier and more challenging. The proposed statement says, \u201cThe Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.\u201d  I read this as saying that we will keep the funds rate near zero for a considerable time after we see a marked increase in the growth of employment and output.  I don\u2019t think a policy conforming to this characterization would be appropriate because it implies providing too much stimulus, beyond the point at which I think we are going to need to begin raising rates. Finally, I remain opposed to purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities.  Because we\u2019re doing imitations, I am tempted to channel the \u201cMost Interesting Man in the World\u201d and say I don\u2019t often support purchasing assets, but when I do, I prefer purchasing Treasuries.  [Laughter] As we discussed last time, and as the staff analysis documented, purchasing MBS can be expected to reduce borrowing rates for conforming mortgages by more than it reduces borrowing rates for nonconforming mortgages or for other borrowing sectors, such as small business, autos, or unsecured consumer loans. I haven\u2019t seen any convincing analysis of why such a credit reallocation would be preferable, relative to our objectives.  Moreover, deliberately tilting the flow of credit to one particular economic sector is, in my view, an inappropriate role for the Federal Reserve.  And I will, again, cite the joint statement of the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve on March 23, 2009, which says, \u201cGovernment decisions to influence the allocation of credit are the province of the fiscal authorities.\u201d  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I support alternative B for today, and I have one suggestion for a change in the language based on President Kocherlakota\u2019s earlier comment concerning the last sentence of paragraph 2, which reads, \u201cThe Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.\u201d I see that, based on his comment, as a little bit inconsistent with what we think now, because we did take the aggressive easing action at the last meeting, and we do think that that\u2019s supposed to keep inflation a little bit higher.  So maybe instead of \u201cat or below,\u201d how about \u201cnear\u201d\u2014\u201cwould run near its 2 percent objective\u201d.  And that would suggest that the Committee feels like it has responded to this as opposed to just saying that we\u2019re going to accept the lower inflation that would otherwise be projected.  So instead of \u201cat or below\u201d it would be \u201cnear", "\u201d MR. ENGLISH.  Sorry, could I just make a comment. I think the Chairman was correct earlier, that that sentence was intended to be conditional on \u201cwithout sufficient policy accommodation.\u201d  So the earlier sentence on economic growth and labor market conditions said \u201cwithout sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate,\u201d and then the last sentence says, \u201cThe Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective,\u201d again, if there were not sufficient policy accommodation", " MR. BULLARD.  But we do have sufficient accommodation, or we think we do.  We\u2019re trying to adopt a policy that\u2019s addressing this.  So I just think it\u2019s confusing.  I took it that the first part was to say, well, if we hadn\u2019t taken action, we\u2019d be in trouble, but now that we have taken action, we\u2019re getting close", "  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.  This preceded Professor Woodford by how many years", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would refer both Presidents Bullard and Lacker to Iv\u00e1n Werning\u2019s paper, in which something like a Woodford period is an extremely effective part of monetary policy without any boost in inflation because prices are fixed. I agree that our September actions, Mr. Chairman, have proven more successful than I, for one, expected.  And I think the shift to the more forward-looking policy approach in the statement language was critical in achieving the success that we have seen so far. With that in mind, I am willing to support alternative B at this meeting. But I think I detected\u2014as President Fisher referred to\u2014a note of complacency in our discussion of our September actions yesterday.  And I think as we look forward to December\u2019s meeting, I would caution against that complacency. Yesterday in her remarks, Governor Raskin made her bid to add to the relentless Fed drive for acronyms with what she referred to as MMP:  muddled messaging possibilities.  And I think we can maybe avoid MMP by following what I am going to call ROMP, R-O-M-P: results-oriented monetary policy.  ROMP means judging our level of accommodation not by historical standards but by how we are doing in terms of our dual mandate objectives.  Now here,   I fear the news continues to be challenging.  The outlook for the labor market, however one chooses to measure it, is hard to describe as being consistent with the dual mandate.  In terms of inflation, suppose you just want to think about price stability.  The Tealbook forecasts for inflation remain below 2 percent for five years.  This is after the policy accommodation we adopted in September.  And this is consistent with the projections of those who voted for the statement last time, who have inflation running below 2 percent through the forecast period. This path for inflation, and the associated path of labor market conditions, I think, is hard to think about as being consistent with the relentless pursuit of our dual mandate objectives that we have been given from the Congress.  And, again, I would say that even if you were just purely a price stability person and all you cared about was inflation targeting\u2014say, you worked at the Bank of Canada, and that\u2019s your job\u2014this path would not be seen as being a success on the part of your operation. So we follow results-oriented monetary policy and we should be doing something more.  That raises the question of how we should be doing more.  And there is probably something that can be done on the asset purchase front.  I\u2019m just not going to talk about that, though; I\u2019m going to focus more on forward guidance.  We could extend the date from mid-2015 to mid-2016, mid-2017. I think, as President Bullard alluded to, and we have talked about\u2014and changed the statement language, in fact, because of this\u2014extending the date is just problematic.  The signaling component is very challenging for households and firms to extract and could just be perceived as our saying that the economy is going to be lousy for two more years.  I think what is better would be to communicate that our reaction function is different from what is currently expected by market participants.  The staff memo gives great guidance on this, and I was disappointed we didn\u2019t really dig into the details of the staff memo as much as I was hoping we would yesterday.  I thought the staff showed, in the context of FRB/US, that the thresholds of 2\u00bd percent inflation and 6 percent unemployment worked extremely well. I would encourage them to go further, to explore 2\u00bd percent inflation and 5\u00bd percent unemployment, because I feel confident that that would actually work even better because it is more tailored to our dual mandate objectives.  Why do these thresholds work well. We have talked about that yesterday.  Part of it is delivering more accommodation, because you are surprising markets with your willingness to be more accommodative than they think.  But a lot of it also has to do with this automatic stabilizer effect that I have been emphasizing.  And for those who are worried about inflation risks, being as explicit as we are talking about being through thresholds is a great way for us to be vigilant against upside inflation risks. The problem I heard yesterday about thresholds is the Committee wants to retain full optionality at all times, and I understand that. I think you can sit here in October of 2012, and you do not know what is going to happen in 2013, 2014, 2015, and that is fair enough.  I think that the solution to this is to adopt strong, but not ironclad, language.  I would be stronger than what the Vice Chairman suggested yesterday.  I think \u201ccurrently anticipates\u201d is a little too weak for my taste.  But I would say something along the lines of, \u201cThe Committee\u2019s current assessment is that as long as long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, it is unlikely\u201d\u2014I would prefer \u201chighly unlikely\u201d\u2014but \u201cit is unlikely to raise the federal funds rate until the unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent or the inflation outlook has risen above 2\u00bd percent.\u201d  This is a way to try to get some of the optionality that people wanted around the table, while still conveying a sense that it would take something unusual for you to change these numbers.  Where are the benefits of this.  It means that the market expectations of when we\u2019re going to raise the fed funds rate will change in terms of the conditions that prevail when we\u2019re about to do that.  All of this is obviously forward-looking toward December, but I hope to reengage in this conversation at that time, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the pace of the recovery, the elevated unemployment rate, and the current level of inflation, I expect monetary policy accommodation may need to remain in place for some time to provide continued support to this recovery. That said, I remain concerned about the open-ended approach to expanding our balance sheet and the current rate guidance indicating that we expect that low rates \u201cwill remain appropriate for a considerable period of time after the economic recovery strengthens.\u201d My   concern rests with how a prolonged period of highly accommodative policy could risk higher inflation and financial instability, in addition to complicating our exit. I remain concerned that the ongoing expansion of our balance sheet poses upside risk to market-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations.  Breakeven measures have a tendency to exhibit volatility, but the recent rise in response to our September actions is a reminder of the risk that further balance sheet expansion, as proposed in alternative A, could push longer-term expected inflation still higher, and potentially create some tension between what markets expect and our stated 2 percent inflation goal.  Thank you", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was opposed to the new round of asset purchases we undertook last time.  My view on that really hasn\u2019t changed.  I see the costs of the program as exceeding the benefits.  I think the nature of the program makes it particularly important that we think hard about our stopping rule for our open-ended purchases. I appreciate President Rosengren\u2019s comments about how if we go to a threshold system about the funds rate, we have to be very careful not to necessarily have people infer that what we mean by substantial improvement in labor markets isn\u2019t what we just told them in the thresholds. Distinguishing between what is the stopping rule for asset purchases as opposed to the funds rate guidance is going to be an important part of that communication, if we go with thresholds.  I think there is a lot that we need to talk about in terms of that, and I am worried that if we don\u2019t get that communication right, we could have some very confused markets and bad outcomes. Part of the reason I have been concerned about the nature of forward guidance and the challenges we face is I am not convinced, as some people are, about the quantitative effectiveness of this forward guidance.  People seem to attribute movements in asset prices to be driving all of that, but I\u2019m not sure that in terms of the real economy and the unemployment rate we have seen much benefit from that.  So I am concerned about the effectiveness of our forward-guidance tools.  Relying so much on that and relying on managing expectations, I think, is a very tricky game. Trying to signal, through a commitment that we may or may not be able to reach, that we are going to maintain low rates longer continues to make me concerned about the consequences that happen at the exit. I am very concerned that the built-up effects of keeping interest rates too low, too long, so to speak, could actually cause long-term rates to rise very rapidly at the point when the markets begin to get a whiff of the idea that it is time to change policies.  And we will have a long way to go to catch up to where, perhaps, standard policy might say it needs to be.  And if that happens\u2014interest rate risks, the effects on bank balance sheets, the effects in the market, the difficulties of interest rate risk on our own portfolio, and our ability to raise rates fast enough without losses and turmoil in the marketplace\u2014that could be quite traumatic and quite challenging for us and for the economy.  I hope not. So, given that I don\u2019t think the effectiveness of that forward guidance is quantitatively as important as we seem to think it is, the risks on the upside are quite troubling to me.  And we are taking potentially very large risks to achieve what I think are dubious and meager gains on our dual mandate, if you will. I think it is very important at our next meeting, as we continue to discuss the threshold argument, to combine that with how we are going to think about stopping rules for asset purchases and how those are going to relate to one another. Okay.  I do have one comment.  I can live with alternative B, but I do want to go back to paragraph 2, because I think it is kind of confusing.  President Kocherlakota focused on the last sentence on inflation.  I actually think the confusing part of paragraph 2 is the second sentence:\u201cThe Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.\u201d It seems to me we put that statement in last time to signal something about what the action was we were taking.  At this meeting, we are not taking an action.  I am concerned a bit that this sentence actually could be very much misinterpreted as saying that we don\u2019t think we have sufficient accommodation in place at this time or won\u2019t in the future.  Is the interpretation going to be that this is signaling that we will continue to do more accommodation come January, when we really haven\u2019t made that decision yet. So I am a bit worried about that sentence.  I think it would be more straightforward to go back to a sentence that says something like, \u201cThe Committee outlook is for gradual improvement in labor market conditions.\u201d I think tying it in this paragraph to policy is what makes this paragraph confusing.  The second paragraph, typically in the past, I think, has been a paragraph about our outlook for the key variables.  And this is sort of saying something about policy\u2014we make the statement later on, I think it\u2019s in paragraph 4, that we are prepared to take further action if we view our employment and price objectives at risk. So I think putting this statement in the second paragraph is actually the source of confusion here.  So my own modest suggestion is that we just change that second sentence, and then I think the paragraph hangs together better, and we still have the indication of policy in paragraph 4.  So that is my suggestion, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you", " MS. RASKIN.  I support alternative B.  The additional accommodation that we put in place last month still seems appropriate to me.  The recent improvements in the household sector notwithstanding, we are a long way from maximum employment.  Payrolls continue to rise onlygradually, and I think it will be some time before we see considerable momentum in the labor market. At the same time, inflation appears to be well contained.  Core inflation, which seems the most relevant measure right now as food and energy prices swing, looks like it is about 1\u00bc percent in the second half of this year.  So, if anything, inflation may be on the low side.  And survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down.  In addition, in my view, the primary risks to the outlook are still large and to the downside.  For all of these reasons, I support keeping in place the accommodation that we agreed on in September. In particular, our new \u201clower for longer\u201d language begins to clarify for economic agents our commitment to better outcomes, more in line with our mandate.  With this forward guidance, the lower tail of possibilities that households and businesses might worry about gets cut off.  For instance, the odds that this Committee begins to tighten at the first sign of good labor market news and prematurely slows the economy now seem reduced.  Similarly, the chance that this Committee will greet worsening economic data with a shrug and a \u201cwe\u2019ve done all we can\u201d probably seems less likely to economic participants. In September, we not only changed our forward-guidance language, we also backed up that strong language with flow-based large-scale asset purchases.  In my view, this combination of clearer forward guidance and asset purchases may currently be having a beneficial effect, not only on interest rates but also on public expectations of where the economy is headed.  I continue to believe that there is a strong argument to be made for being even more explicit with our forward guidance. In particular, I think now would be an excellent time to introduce quantitative thresholds in the context of qualitative guardrails, as a refinement of the work that we did in the September meeting. We have taken the first step in clarifying our policy, and market participants seem to have understood it pretty well.  However, the longer we wait to adopt explicit thresholds, the higher the likelihood that our message will become muddled. If we decline to clarify our thresholds, markets and the public will be confused about what they are, and speculation likely will fill that vacuum.  Bloggers and editorial writers, and maybe even individuals at this table making speeches, will likely start to offer opinions about what those thresholds are and should be.  It seems to me that by allowing others, rather than the Committee as a collective whole, to frame that discussion, we are shirking our responsibility to communicate clearly and to help shape expectations. As argued so well this morning by President Kocherlakota, confusion about our thresholds could also affect inflation expectations.  If outsiders begin to believe that we have a lower inflation threshold than we do, when inflation moves above that level, there might be some concern that we have lost our resolve or our ability to keep inflation in check, thereby raising inflation expectations. Thus I am ready to implement thresholds because I think they will enhance the clarity of the policy moves we made last time. I also think that as we continue to wrestle with the effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases, the need to focus on refining our forward guidance becomes increasingly more pressing.  That said, I am content to support alternative B at this time", " MR. PLOSSER.  Excuse me.  Or perhaps it might be inferred that we don\u2019t believe sufficient policy accommodation is currently in place", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  When we launched the consensus forecast initiative in June, we did so based on the premise that a consensus forecast had the potential to significantly enhance the Committee\u2019s communications by clarifying the rationale for our policy decisions.  We agreed to explore this initiative in a systematic and deliberate manner, and I think the two experiments we have conducted yielded a number of valuable insights.  I\u2019d like to thank the staff for the memo and presentation, which summarized the most important lessons and our options for either continuing the initiative or, alternatively, pursuing enhancements to the SEP.   My subcommittee circulated a memo with questions.  The first group of questions concerns possible directions for further development of the consensus forecast.  The second set pertains to possible modifications of the SEP.  And finally, bottom line, we\u2019d like to know which of these two routes you consider to be more promising in terms of improving communications. Personally, I would say that I think there is a problem with our communications, and I think we need to address this problem one way or another.  So I do consider it very important that we decide today which path for providing further information about the rationale for our policy decisions is apt to be most effective, and that we make progress on providing this information soon.  The memo highlights what struck me as the biggest challenge associated with the consensus forecast, namely, that we would need to reach agreement one way or another about the future path of monetary policy, including, in current circumstances, the path of the balance sheet on which the forecast would be conditioned. If we detach ourselves from the policy paths incorporated in the forecast by describing them as merely illustrative, or if we instead resort to conditioning on financial market expectations of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet, we would end up depreciating the value of the forecast for its core purpose, which is to explain the rationale for whatever policy decisions we make. If, on the other hand, we condition on the path with which those who support the statement can associate themselves, I fear that the task of reaching agreement at any given meeting may become unmanageable. Of course, our inclusion of forward guidance in our statements has taken us some ways toward communicating a consensus about monetary policy sometime in the future, but this guidance has often been a bone of contention, and not all of us always agree on its interpretation.  To go forward with a consensus forecast, we would need to go beyond agreeing on, for example,   the time of liftoff to also agree on the post-liftoff pace of firming and the ultimate level to which the nominal funds rate is expected to converge.  The problem of reaching consensus on the future path of policy is even more severe now, given that we\u2019re operating with two tools. When I think back to my first stint on the Board, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we have made enormous progress in communicating to the public the rationale for our conduct of monetary policy based on a coherent framework with well-specified goals and objectives.  But specifying a forecast based on a common, agreed-upon path of policy under all kinds of contingencies is, I\u2019m afraid, still a project for the future. The other questions we have posed concerning the consensus forecast are almost as hard as the first one.  I think it would be much more desirable to have a consensus forecast conditioned on the policy action taken at the current meeting, but the cost from a communication standpoint of not having the projections available in time for the Chairman\u2019s press conference is quite high.  The reality is that a comprehensive Committee forecast seems to work well for committees the size of the Bank of England\u2019s or the Riksbank\u2019s, but probably not for us, given our size and geographic diversity.  For that reason, the issue of how to convey the degree to which participants associate themselves with the forecast is much more difficult in our context. So for all these reasons, I\u2019ve reluctantly concluded that we may be better served by exploring enhancements to the SEP that would enable it to provide greater clarity about the outlook that motivates our policy decisions.  Because these decisions are ultimately taken by those members supporting the statement at any given meeting, I find it eminently sensible to publish the median of the projections of those members.  Not only does this focus attention on the projections of those whose preferences the policy decision reflects, but also the collection of median paths for real activity, inflation, and the funds rate should come much closer to   presenting an internally coherent outlook.  The materials that were circulated to illustrate how these medians differ suggest that there hasn\u2019t been much difference with respect to the economic projections of those who voted \u201cyes\u201d and others, but on a few occasions, there have been noticeable disagreements about the associated policy paths. I\u2019d also strongly support publication of the scatter plot of combinations of inflation and the unemployment rate prevailing at the time of liftoff. If we introduce quantitative threshold language, this would seem a perfect complement to these thresholds.  But even without thresholds, the scatter plot is quite informative about participants\u2019 views concerning economic conditions consistent with liftoff.  Releasing both the median projections of those who voted \u201cyes\u201d and the scatter plots are steps that have very high value and require almost no additional logistical effort.  I think we should start doing so as soon as possible. Given that we released to the public our projected time of liftoff, it seems only logical to release some information concerning our projections for the balance sheet, which is currently of interest and concern to markets.  However, there are several possible options here.  For example, we could disclose the date at which we expect to stop purchasing assets or the ultimate size that we expect the balance sheet to reach.  And here, I think we should carefully evaluate our options before taking any decision, to avoid the risk that publishing balance-sheet-related projections could undermine the efficacy of our asset program. As for the other proposed modifications, I\u2019m entirely comfortable with circulating individual SEP submissions internally, with names attached.  In fact, seeing the submissions and commentary that we provided for the consensus forecast experiments helped me understand better the thinking of some of my colleagues around the table. I\u2019m not opposed to coloring the dots, that is, providing some information about whether a particular projection was made by a current voting member, but if we stop there, we know we will only fuel further speculation among Fed watchers about the identities of the dots in our liftoff chart.  Moreover, coloring the dots doesn\u2019t help to link participants\u2019 views about policy with their economic projections.  So that suggests going further to publish the SEP full matrix, with or without attribution, perhaps with an indication of which participants are voters. My guess is that Fed watchers will quickly guess the identity of many of the matrix rows.  So, ultimately, we should only move in this direction if we\u2019re comfortable with full attribution.  I am not unalterably opposed to this step, but I admit to some qualms.  With individual attribution, each of us will have to be prepared to defend our forecasts and explain the methodology on which they\u2019re based, a situation that may eventually prove uncomfortable for those of us who lack the necessary background and staff resources to prepare a rigorous and independent forecast. So to conclude, even though I do not advocate continuing the consensus forecast initiative at this time, I believe we\u2019ve gained useful insights, and it has served to sharpen our collective understanding of the commonalities and differences in our views and thinking.  If it has thereby enhanced the quality of our discourse, it has, to my mind, been well worth the effort.  I\u2019m optimistic that we can take meaningful steps toward better communications through SEP modifications, and my subcommittee would be happy to work with the Chairman to propose concrete steps", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I put together these comments looking out my second-floor view of the new Chicago Speaker\u2019s Corner, with all of the people out there complaining about everything.  [Laughter] At any rate, the consensus forecasting exercise certainly has turned out to be an eye opener.  I didn\u2019t think it was going to be this hard.  The staff memo does a very good job in describing the range of issues we have had to confront and the difficult decisions that we would have to make to produce such a consensus projection.  As always, thanks for all of the hard work; it was really well done. Rather than discuss all of the nettlesome details, I think it is useful to remember the first-order issue.  In its current form, the SEP is a problematic tool for describing the forecast rationale underlying the Committee\u2019s policy decision.  As President Williams alluded to, theApril press conference, I thought, was particularly challenging\u2014certainly to watch, and probably to experience in person.  Our goal, then, should be to find a better way to provide the Chairman, by the time of the press conference, with the information he needs to effectively communicate the role of the outlook in our policy decisions. I don\u2019t think we are close to being at that point with the consensus forecast, and I am not really sure we can get there.  Of course, if the Chairman really wants this, we could try harder.  There are just too many issues to work out at the moment, from handling assumptions for a complete path for future policy to the conventions for endorsement.  We might be able to come up with a satisfactory way to handle the issues and produce an informative product by the time the minutes come out.  And we may want to pursue some experimentation with putting together a forecast conditioned on common policy assumptions consistent with the actions of the Committee at the meeting.  But I don\u2019t see how we could ever do this in time for the postmeeting press conference.  Certainly, we could not do so without severely compromising the FOMC meeting itself as a deliberative process. I think, however, that we can make improvements to the SEP that would make it a much better tool.  First, at the press conference, I think we should highlight the median forecast of those Committee members voting for the policy.  True, this need not be as fully a coherent economic projection as the consensus forecast would be, but it has to be an improvement over 19 different viewpoints.  The median of the supporting voters would go a long way to describing the collective judgment that underlay the policy decision.  When we add in other members or participants who didn\u2019t agree with the policy decision, it is not helpful for explaining any nuances in the decision.  We could go ahead and publish the median of the voters who were in favor of it, as well as the median of everyone.  There are all kinds of cuts of the data that we could produce if we chose to do that. It probably doesn\u2019t surprise you that I would be willing to publish the entire matrix of SEP submissions myself. I am fine with doing that with attribution. If we can\u2019t get there, I would at least identify the members voting for the policy decision, if that were possible.  With the matrix, the public would be able to see the individual projections and judge the rationales for themselves.  They could put together the scatter plots that they like\u2014although the particular issue you were talking about, President Williams, would not be conveyed.  At a minimum, I would distribute these internally with attribution and also include balance sheet assumptions whenever possible.  Thank you", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The staff memo is quite persuasive in describing the challenges with the consensus forecast at this time.  Different weighting of the dual mandate, different views on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, as well as the many operational challenges in reaching a consensus with such a large committee\u2014with members with rotating votes\u2014make a quick resolution of these problems unlikely. It is important to focus on what the primary communication objective should be for this exercise.  My own view is that the most important objective for communication is to make clear what outlook for inflation and unemployment justifies the Committee\u2019s policy decision as communicated through the statement.  The second most important objective is to make clear how unexpected changes in the path of inflation and unemployment are likely to influence future policy actions, particularly given that we are setting policy, at least in part, by being more explicit about our future intentions.  At this time, I do not believe a consensus forecast is the best way to meet either of my primary communication objectives.  I do believe that an enhanced SEP is the best way forward.  Each participant should provide a forecast based on the median forecast of the path of the federal funds rate and the balance sheet path from the previous SEP, which I would do at every meeting. This would eliminate the problem of vastly different policy variables being used as optimal policy.  At meetings where policy is changed, forecasts based on the previous SEP would presumably show outcomes that necessitated further action. I would prefer to make these submissions public with attribution.  The public would then see the views of those who supported the statement and those who did not.  This would avoid the problem of not distinguishing voters and nonvoters that occurred at the April meeting.  The public could also associate forecasts with those who are likely to be voting members in future years.  It also makes each participant accountable for his or her own forecasts, and the public could discount those forecasts that have large systematic errors or that have serious consistency problems.  However, there is a legitimate concern that attribution may make participants less willing to compromise during the meeting.  If disclosure with attribution does not have support, I would propose an enhanced SEP that distinguishes voters from nonvoters, based on the year they are voting.  I would release all of the variables by participant, but with the participants not identified. An enhanced SEP with full disclosure could begin with the first press conference next year.  That would give us time to work out any remaining concerns with the approach we adopt.  Thank you", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I tend to agree with the assessment of the hurdles associated with the consensus forecast and support moving forward with an enhanced SEP.  In order to better illustrate the Committee\u2019s views, I would support identifying voters and nonvoters in the charts. I would not publish the scatter plot of the unemployment rate and inflation rate expected to prevail at liftoff because I think it would confuse the public and, therefore, not enhance our communication. And finally, I would not publish the full matrix of projections with attribution because I think it could discount the value associated with the independent views of the Governors and the Reserve Bank presidents. Thank you", "   MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have not been a fan of the consensus forecast idea, and I didn\u2019t even like the idea of rushing to publish the fed funds rate projections.  So these efforts just don\u2019t feel to me like they are designed so much to provide more transparency about the range of views in the room but, rather, as an attempt to show more agreement than I believe actually exists. And as one who has occasionally struggled to support the decisions about current policy, I feel even more conflicted about signing up for a more comprehensive level of agreement about the decisions that are going to be made over a number of years than I found necessary to allow me to support the policy at any given meeting. The reason why it is so hard to formulate a consensus forecast might actually be because there is not that much consensus.  So I feel like trying to shoehorn a large majority into agreement on several dimensions could actually increase the level of dissent and be counterproductive to the strength of the policy statements. I know the communications in the current environment have been awkward at times, but I think it is because decisionmaking in this environment is really hard.  And there are a lot of moving parts, and we are in uncharted territory, and knowing what we are going to do in three or four years is especially difficult.  So trying to come up with more detailed communication devices doesn\u2019t necessarily reduce that complexity.  So to the extent that the consensus forecast implies any commitment, it seems to me more likely that such efforts will yield better results when the path of the fed funds rate is actually the only policy variable available. As Governor Yellen noted earlier, there is a lot of work to do for the next meeting, primarily by the staff.  There is always a lot of work for the next meeting to be done primarily by the staff.  And this effort seems an unproductive use, or less productive use, of critical staff resources that are also needed to understand the costs and the benefits of the policy actions that we are actually taking.  So I strongly believe that this is the wrong priority for these valuable resources. By now, my answers to the first set of questions are probably obvious.  I also don\u2019t see the value in separating the submissions of individuals, or voters, or voters who supported the action, or any other subgroup.  If you are talking about projections of policy for three years, everyone submitting projections will be voting at some point in the projection period.  And, once again, separating the views of those supporting the action from those who did not could have one of two outcomes\u2014either exposing varying degrees of conviction in support or pushing some who are on the edge of support into dissenting positions.  I fail to see how either of these actions strengthens our policy statements. I also think it is a real possibility that this solution could create a new source of awkwardness for the Chairman to explain at a press conference. If our objective is to be truly transparent, and we do decide to go down this road, the policy variables that are in the SEP should include a balance sheet variable as well as a fed funds variable.  If we had adopted this approach prior to our last meeting, the public would have been able to see the diversity of expectations about continuing LSAPs among the voters, and the market reaction would likely have been quite different. So I guess I am in the camp of \u201cbe careful what you wish for,\u201d and let\u2019s be very careful that we know the consequences of what we plan to do before we go public with it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman"], "2012FOMC20121212meeting.txt": [" MR. POTTER. We have the measure for disagreement in their point forecasts, the darker blue line, and that captures different views about the FOMC\u2019s reaction function and how the economy might evolve.  And then the lighter blue, which you only have two recent observations on because we only just started to ask this question, captures each responding dealer\u2019s uncertainty around that point estimate and gives the average of that uncertainty. It\u2019s trying to separate out disagreement about how things might evolve in point expectations from uncertainty in terms of the average level of uncertainty that dealers have.  If we had a longer history of the balance sheet question, we could see whether this was relatively high or low for the balance sheet. What I wanted to make clear is that this number for what the federal funds rate would be 12 months ahead is relatively high compared with the earlier history, particularly if you look at 2007, 2008\u2014quite turbulent times", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you.  Simon, I heard this morning in Steve Liesman\u2019s CNBC report on the Fed Survey that close to 70 percent of those surveyed are concerned that with our continued asset purchase program, there are going to be both market disruptions and pricing issues.  And what was interesting about the survey is that it is a very sharp reversal from the September survey.  I know that in our primary dealer survey, we don\u2019t ask questions about market disruptions, and in your comments you said that the staff does not believe that our continued asset purchase program would cause market disruptions.  But are you hearing any comments from the dealers about concerns about market disruptions", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to talk about exhibit 3, chart 17, \u201cExpected Pace of Asset Purchases.\u201d I thought your characterization of this was that\u2014and I may be reading the graph wrong, so let me know\u2014all or most of the probability was on $45 billion.  But it looks to me that more than half of the probability is actually on something less than $45 billion", " MR. LACKER.  Opposed", " MS. DUKE.  I just have one question, and you may not have the answer with you in your notes, but you mentioned that the deferred asset would still be larger than the capital.  What about the unrealized losses in the portfolio. Where would they be", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  So my overall response is:  How uncertain am I. I am not very certain at all.  In terms of the first thing you focused on, the pass-through into corporate rates, I am less worried about that.  There is a lot of evidence that it may not be one for one, but nonetheless the evidence supports a pretty high pass-through into corporate bond rates.  However, the evidence on what it does to the exchange rate and the stock market, and going from there to what these various changes in long-term interest rates and other asset financial conditions do to the real economy\u2014there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty about that.  These effects could be smaller.  It could be that the effects have changed over time because the conditions that existed back in 2009, when we first got into these purchases, are different now.  So expectational effects, confidence effects, market functioning effects\u2014these effects may be different now from what they were. So, without belaboring the point, I\u2019d say there is a lot of   uncertainty.  There are reasons to think the effects could be smaller than what we are generating with FRB/US. I should say, though, that one also has to worry that maybe FRB/US doesn\u2019t capture all of the relevant channels and that there could be offsets in other directions.  For example, we are not taking account of any positive feedback on house prices.  In reality, the low-mortgage-rate environment that you have put in place is bumping up house prices.  Moreover, maybe that bumping up of house prices is having favorable effects on certain households\u2014increasing their access to credit or the willingness of banks to provide credit, and so on.  Anyway, my point is simply that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty.  There are good arguments for why FRB/US\u2019s effects may be too large.  I think there are also arguments for why FRB/US may be neglecting some things that could be important. It is extremely difficult to tie these forecasts down", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019d like to thank the staff for this detailed memo on balance sheet options, which I thought was very good.  I have two comments on the memo.  One comment is that I would like to see more emphasis on the adjustability of the balance sheet policy and the associated automatic stabilizer effects.  The second comment is that I thought that some scenarios seem politically untenable to me, as I think the Congress would reconsider allowing the payment of interest on reserves. Let me just talk about balance sheet adjustability first.  The memo emphasizes the total expected amount of the increase in the size of the balance sheet when discussing the impact of the balance sheet policy in the near term.  I see this approach as a practical way of laying down some alternatives for the Committee.  However, I think it also tends to deemphasize one of the great strengths of the September 2012 decision, namely, that the program can and should be adjusted as the data on the economy arrive.  Committee adjustments would send an important signal to the private sector concerning how the Committee thinks the economy is performing relative to expectations.  Private sector expectations about the total size and duration of the program will also adjust according to the relative strength or weakness in incoming data.  This is  the automatic stabilizer feature of the current policy.  The great advantage of this approach is that we do not have to lay down today exactly what the total size and duration of the program will be\u2014a guess that will likely turn out to be inaccurate as events unfold during the coming quarters.  Instead, we can lay down a baseline path in the expectation that the path will likely be adjusted as the data arrive. One implication of this approach to policy is that there is less need to commit to an extensive program today, before we know how the 2013 U.S. economy is actually going to perform.  So I thought that, maybe by necessity about the way the analysis had to be done, that part just couldn\u2019t be captured; I think it would be too difficult to capture that.  But I think it\u2019s an important consideration for the Committee. My second point is about the political feasibility of some of the balance sheet scenarios.  The Federal Reserve was granted authority to pay interest on reserves in 2008.  The Congress had previously opposed use of this tool for monetary policy for many decades.  Some scenarios in the memo have the Fed claiming a deferred asset for purposes of remittances to the Treasury but simultaneously making rather large interest payments to mostly very large banks.  My view is that such a scenario is politically treacherous and may result in the Congress reverting to the previous policy of not allowing the payment of interest on reserves to large banks.  Losing the ability to pay interest on reserves would, of course, have devastating consequences for the Committee\u2019s exit strategy.  So I caution the Committee that we probably do not want to be in the situation where the perception is that payments to the Treasury are on hold but payments to banks are substantial.  I think that the staff also recognizes political difficulties, but that is up to the judgment of the Committee here.  So I just wanted to point that one out because I think it is a glaring one in this particular analysis.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a comment and related question, and the comment was inspired by the line of questioning from Governor Raskin and the staff\u2019s response.  First, a compliment:  This memo is exceptionally helpful on a very important issue.  Set aside two things:  one, that we would run out of assets that we would want to sell to draw down our liabilities; and, two, the political risks of no remittances and a big deferred asset, which are highly consequential. Set those aside. I always thought that the economic argument for the irrelevance of unrealized capital losses and the zero remittances was the fact that on the Treasury\u2019s balance sheet there is an equal and opposite sort of capital gain due to the fall in the real market value of their liabilities. Now, viewed through this lens, this analysis sort of shines a spotlight on a can of worms here that we haven\u2019t really talked about. This whole analysis is based on the implications of taking duration risk, and it points out that it doesn\u2019t disappear:  It flows through our income statement eventually.  So the traditional approach to these kinds of things\u2014you know, in some settings you can sort of consolidate the Fed\u2019s and the Treasury\u2019s balance sheets, and in others it makes sense to keep them separate.  But looking at the balance sheet naturally draws you to looking at the government\u2019s intertemporal budget constraint, and through that lens, there are going to be ramifications down the road for tax or spending policy.  If you truncate your horizon and just look a certain number of years ahead, you have this sort of free variable\u2014debt at the end of the horizon.  And I\u2019m assuming that in all your analysis of taking duration out, you haven\u2019t really gone through the implications of the government\u2019s intertemporal budget constraint; you   just let debt at the end of the period be the free variable.  And that is consistent with figure 2 in exhibit 2 up here.  I don\u2019t know if it is empirically consequential or not, but it suggests that it would be useful to at least check to see that there aren\u2019t any implications\u2014especially at a time where many perceive us as getting close to the limits of a debt-to-GDP ratio that we find sustainable.  I don\u2019t know if you have thought about that or not", " MR. LACKER.  Does that come into play across scenarios here", "MS. ROUSH. Through mid-2013.  That\u2019s right.  And then, seven thought there should potentially be higher purchases.  And there was a range, but some of those continued through the end of 2013.  And then, there were three additional participants who saw a lower level of purchases.  One of those saw a beginning of tapering, and two of those saw an end of purchases now", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you.  I also have a question for Michael concerning financial stability.  First of all, I want to thank you for an insightful and important presentation.  But one concern I have around financial stability is an unexpected sharp rise in interest rates, and I applaud the work that\u2019s being done to see how banks can handle an interest rate shock, as well as our CCAR exercise where there\u2019s an adverse scenario that considers such interest rate movements.  I think those results will help us understand and give us some insights into how banks will react. But I also think that we should be examining how community banks and other investors will adjust to a sharp rise in interest rates.  My contacts report that the FOMC asset purchase programs have led investors to take on more duration and credit risk, and, while, as you   point out, Michael, that may be the FOMC\u2019s intention, they are starting to express a number of concerns.  Senior officials who I talked to at a large mutual fund company noted that $1.5 trillion has moved from money market funds into bond funds, making individual investors\u2019 portfolios more vulnerable to rate increases when they come. In addition, my contacts have stressed that this current low interest rate environment is unfamiliar and is starting to upset some of the longstanding behavioral patterns of investors.  For example, I\u2019m being told that younger people are staying out of the stock market because all they\u2019ve mainly seen is losses over this period of time, while retirees are moving into the stock market to get the dividends. Given that people may be changing their behaviors and not reacting as they did in the past, I think we should be aware of the unintended and perhaps unexpected consequences of this low interest rate environment.  I don\u2019t see a sharp rise in interest rates on the list of the risk scenarios that were handed out in the package on financial markets and institutions, and maybe we should consider putting it on that list.  The memo that was circulated mentions that such developments bear watching.  So my question is, how are we thinking about monitoring and assessing that risk as we think about financial stability in the future", " MR. KILEY.  We think it\u2019s very important to monitor that risk, and we have done so in a variety of ways related to the CCAR exercise or the exercise you referred to with regard to banks.  Let me talk about a few things that we\u2019re looking at and doing and a few things about which some people are concerned and some people aren\u2019t as concerned yet.  As you know, there has been guidance issued over the last several years that banks should be focused on interest rate risk, so certainly, with supervisors going out to smaller banks, not just those involved in the CCAR exercises, it is on their radar screen. In thinking about other investors, certainly we\u2019ve heard\u2014and we have teams that monitor thinking about developments in pension funds or at insurers\u2014and there have been signs of some changes, perhaps, in the duration of their assets or in their willingness to take on credit risk at insurers, for example.  They are heavily regulated, and they actually do go through quite a few interest rate scenarios as part of their normal stress testing.  They\u2019re called the New York Seven, and they involve various changes in the shape of the yield curve and movements that can be sizable.  That\u2019s performed; we don\u2019t necessarily see all of those results, but we know that\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s something we want to be more attuned to.  But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen any large changes in the positions at large insurers, for example, over the last several years.  There seem to be some gradual shifts, but nothing dramatic. One thing that some people have talked about is this shift into bond funds from more retail money, perhaps facilitated to some degree by ETFs.  And there are staff members who are wondering about the degree to which, if that money were to reverse, it would place strains in corporate bond and loan markets\u2014that those markets just are less liquid, and not especially liquid today.  So if there were a large reversal, I think there is potential for concern there.  That concern could involve individuals losing a lot of money.  There is a question about the degree to which that is a financial stability risk.  One might imagine, for example, that some retail investors, to the extent they\u2019re driving bond funds, may move out quickly for a retail investor, but they will, perhaps unfortunately for them, have moved out after highly interconnected dealers or others may have moved out.  So we are not as clear on the degree to which that is a financial stability risk, but it is something we want to think about", "   MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I appreciate that, but I was also noting that, particularly in the bottom-right panel, the blue line representing the policy uncertainty index is actually highly volatile, it seems to me.  So the way you described it and the Tealbook described it, you\u2019ve got this pessimism and uncertainty sort of waning very gradually but continuing to weigh on things for what appears to be a fair amount of time into the future.  Yet this index seems to be highly volatile, and it could turn out that it could drop very sharply under some circumstances, right", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  A few thoughts on Europe.  I\u2019m generally pretty close to where Steve is.  I think there are two pieces of good news.  The ECB\u2019s OMT program promising secondary-market purchases for Spain and Italy if they enter into a formal adjustment program has been effective in settling down sovereign debt markets.  And I think that has been important because it kept the bad equilibrium at bay\u2014the equilibrium where debt-to-risk costs go up, which then feed back into bad fiscal performance, which leads to even higher debt service costs.That\u2019s a good development.  Second, I think Germany has made a very conscious decision that it doesn\u2019t want to kick Greece out of the EU, at least through the October 2013 German elections.  I think that\u2019s important because if Greece isn\u2019t going to get kicked out, then no one else is going to get kicked out in the interim because everybody else looks quite a bit better than Greece.  So the risk of a contagion event in Europe, or an expectation that other countries might be forced to exit, is very much reduced at the current time. And that\u2019s important because it buys time for fiscal consolidation, structural reform, and pan-European institution building to actually proceed. In the near term, I am sort of where Steve is.  I don\u2019t think that Europe is likely to be a source of big instability over the near term.  That\u2019s the good news.  The bad news is that it\u2019s not obvious to me, at least, that the time that they\u2019ve bought themselves is actually going to be spent wisely or that the programs of fiscal austerity are going to soon generate a more favorable set of outcomes in terms of macroeconomic performance and sustainable debt-to-GDP trajectories. Of course, without better performance the political support for austerity may not prove sustainable, and we\u2019re already seeing some backsliding in the case of Italy.  Also, I think that the reduction in market pressure is leading to backsliding in terms of pan-European institution building, which I think is absolutely essential for this to work in the longer run.  The European Deposit Insurance System now seems pretty much off the table completely, and the Europeans are having great difficulty reaching agreement on what the scope of an ECB-led pan-European bank regulator would be.  So bottom line for me is that the situation is a long way from being fixed, so I\u2019m not really optimistic about the longer term, but it\u2019s probably not going to go off the rails in the near future, which I guess is an improvement relative to where we\u2019ve been for most of the last couple of years. Thank you", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Looking beyond the near-term effects of extreme weather on the economy, the underlying story of a gradual recovery remains intact.  Indeed, my medium-term forecast hasn\u2019t changed much over the past few months.  I expect the economy will pick up steam over the next two or three years, with real GDP growth of about 2\u00bd percent in 2013 and averaging about 3\u00bd percent in 2014 and 2015.  However, this somewhat encouraging outlook hinges on two key policy actions:  The first is that the Congress and the President will reach an agreement that allows us to dodge the full brunt of the fiscal cliff.  The second is that we continue buying Treasuries and MBS, which I expect we will need to continue well into the second half of next year.  Without both of these policy actions, I would expect little,if any, progress in reducing unemployment next year and a real risk of falling further behind on our maximum employment mandate.  Further monetary accommodation is required to offset the stiff headwinds holding back aggregate demand.  Households continue to trim debt.  Many potential borrowers still face tight credit.  Public sector budgets are under pressure, and global economic growth remains sluggish.  It seems that every time a signal is about to turn green, the caution light flashes again.  In this regard, the sharp drop in December consumer sentiment was a reminder of how quickly households can lose their resolve in the face of contradictory signals over the outlook for fiscal policy and the economy. Businesspeople are particularly worried and uncertain.  This anxiety is undermining the willingness to engage in longer-term commitments, such as investing in capital expenditures and in hiring full-time employees.  My staff has studied how uncertainty affects business decisions about both investment and employment.  They found that when uncertainty rises, capital spending and full-time employment fall, but part-time employment rises. That is, under heightened uncertainty, employers hedge their bets, adjusting hours rather than jobs to meet output demand.  These effects are sizable and consistent with the downshift in business investment and the increase in part-time employment that we\u2019ve observed in recent months.  Indeed, involuntary part-time employment has grown considerably this year, accounting for about 40 percent of civilian job growth since March.  The observed pattern of reduced investment and greater use of part-time employment provides additional evidence that heightened uncertainty is playing a significant role in holding back the pace of recovery.  And as I mentioned at previous meetings, this research also shows that uncertainty affects the economy like an adverse demand shock, reducing desired investment in employment while also puttingdownward pressure on inflation.  And these are exactly the kinds of shocks that monetary policy can and should seek to offset. Of course, the important question is whether the tools that we have left\u2014I think mainly further asset purchases\u2014will still be effective and, in particular, whether further reductions in longer-term interest rates will boost aggregate demand.  Certainly, there may be limited returns to pushing down long-term corporate bond rates and stimulating capital investment, especially, as I\u2019ve said, because many businesses appear nearly paralyzed by uncertainty. But capital expenditures represent only one of the channels through which interest rates affect the economy.  Purchases of Treasuries and MBS have also helped lower auto loan rates and mortgage rates, thereby supporting consumer spending and the housing sector.  But there\u2019s more.  The exchange rate is another important channel by which LSAPs affect the economy.  For example, according to the FRB/US model simulations, roughly one-third of the effect of monetary policy on real output occurs through the exchange rate channel.  My staff\u2014clearly we\u2019re at the end of the evaluation period, so I\u2019m getting a lot of research from them at this time [laughter]\u2014recently examined the response of the exchange value of the dollar to LSAP announcements.  Using intradaily data, they found that the dollar typically depreciated in response to surprise expansionary monetary policy announcements since the end of 2008.  Furthermore, the effects of the announcement surprises on the dollar over this period were similar in magnitude to the effects of similarly scaled surprise movements in the federal funds rate over the period from 1994 to 2008.  This analysis suggests that the exchange rate channel of monetary policy is still very much alive and kicking. Now, so far I\u2019ve focused on the modal forecast, but there are also important risks to the outlook, notably the fiscal cliff.  As I mentioned, I hope that we\u2019ll avoid the worst case scenario,  but we can\u2019t rule out that negotiations might break down along the lines of the Tealbook alternative simulation, which would result in serious damage to the economy.  Moreover, I am worried that the Tealbook analysis may underestimate the potential fallout from going over the fiscal cliff.  Recently we had a symposium at the San Francisco Fed, with leading academic researchers from around the world discussing issues around the fiscal cliff.  The academic experts found that tax multipliers are significantly larger than typically assumed in models such as FRB/US. In addition, with limited options for increasing monetary accommodation, the tax multipliers are probably even larger than estimated in the recent literature that I\u2019m referring to. Moreover, in a fiscal cliff scenario, there\u2019s a danger that households and businesses could lose confidence in the ability of our elected leaders to govern.  The potential for a collapse in confidence is clear from the August 2011 brinksmanship around the debt ceiling, which resulted in plummeting consumer confidence. So together, the larger multipliers and indirect effects on confidence imply that going over the fiscal cliff could drag economic activity much more than what is shown in the Tealbook scenario. Finally, turning to inflation, the recent data have been a little softer than I had anticipated.  Compensation data have also been below expectations, suggesting little upward pressure on core or headline inflation in coming quarters, and I continue to expect that both headline and core PCE inflation will remain below 2 percent for the next several years. Thank you", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many around the table have noted, the conundrum of what appeared to be a schism between consumer confidence and business confidence\u2014business confidence was down while consumer confidence was up\u2014is no longer a schism.  We now know that both are down, so we have one less puzzle to solve.  Looking at the glass as half full, there\u2019s the good news.  [Laughter]  More seriously, aggregate U.S. household net worth is now approaching the level it had reached before the financial crisis cracked the nest eggs of many households.  Net worth has been driven up over the past few years by welcome gains in the value of homes and equities, and at the same time that these household assets have increased in value, household debt has been reduced.  In particular, home mortgage debt has been on a downward trend.  All told, the value of household net worth stood at $64.8 trillion at the end of the third quarter.  Although adjusting these figures for inflation and a rising population diminishes the positive wealth news story to some extent, it is still true that real per capita household wealth positions appear to have improved somewhat over the past few years, which should bode well for economic growth. But it\u2019s not the whole story, and that\u2019s because these are only the wealth effects, and any story about the household sector leans importantly on income, which is a much more significant driver. Income has been pretty lackluster in this recovery.  Over the most recent four quarters, real disposable income rose just 1\u00bd percent, following an increase of just \u00bd percent in the preceding four quarters. The latest data are weaker than the staff had been expecting, and, of course, the anticipated expiration of both the payroll tax cut and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program at the end of this year will further reduce households\u2019 disposable income.  The effect this income drop is likely to have on consumption was foreshadowed by the recent drop in consumer confidence, which turned down as households pondered the possibility of repeal of the Bush tax cuts and payroll tax cuts and the accompanying lower monthly paychecks. The recent weak income is a further symptom of a weak economy.  It\u2019s taking a long time for the typical household to recover.  The typical household, after all, probably has more housing wealth than stockholder wealth.  The typical household has been touched, if not brought down, by the effects of unemployment.  The typical household has flat real wages, so it is not experiencing a comfort in spending as had been typical for that typical household.  I\u2019m very concerned with the slow dynamics of this recovery. In that regard, I found the Aaronson, Fallick, Nekarda, and Wascher memo on assessing labor market conditions particularly illuminating from a perspective of putting these slow dynamics into the context of different employment measures. We need to look at a variety of measures because a given level of unemployment today is translating into lower real wages for the typical household than it would have a few years ago.  One thing we\u2019re seeing in this recovery is that more jobs don\u2019t always mean jobs that produce enough disposable income that can move us out of the mud.  The unemployment rate alone doesn\u2019t tell us much about the quality of the employment associated with the job creation.  Back in 2007, there was a small difference between the unemployment rate, which was 4.4 percent, and the measure of unemployment that included discouraged workers, which was then slightly higher at 4.6 percent.  Back in 2007, the U-6, which also includes marginally employed people seeking full-time work, was 8 percent.  Today, as President Williams and Governor Tarullo suggest, the differences in these labor market measures are much wider.  The standard unemployment rate is 7.7 percent, but it is higher at 8.4 percent when discouraged workers are included and even higher at 14.4 percent when the underemployed are included.  Having such a large set of people underemployed may be a reason that the employed are not generating much income. If the jobs that are available right now are increasingly low-wage, part-time, dead-end jobs, it will take more time for real disposable income to begin to rise rapidly enough to kick off a more promising recovery.  Even if the new jobs themselves are not inherently low-wage, part-time, or dead-end, for those households still in debt and attempting to pay monthly bills, for those households who have experienced a loss of a significant source of repayment for their debts and their bills, for those households looking to find a job with the same income-producing capability as before, with the ability to negotiate a higher starting salary still very much impaired\u2014for those households, there appears to still be no sense of a robust recovery.  Thank you", " MR. ENGLISH.  I think it\u2019s potentially both.  It\u2019s saying that rather than just looking at these two variables that we just talked about, unemployment and inflation, we\u2019ll be looking at a bunch of stuff and reacting to a bunch of stuff, and I think potentially that could cut either way", " MR. ENGLISH. The sentence in paragraph 2 is saying, if you wanted to really spell it out, that inflation over the medium term is likely to run at or below the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run objective for inflation.  So it\u2019s using 2 percent, the longer-run objective, as a benchmark and saying that in the medium term, which is presumably sooner, you\u2019re expecting  the inflation rate to be at or below that 2 percent figure.  So I think there actually is a distinction being made between a forecast over the medium run in paragraph 2 and the Committee\u2019s longer-run objective of 2 percent", " MR. FISHER.  I raise that question because I worry that it could create some confusion.  And then we talk about \u201cno more than \u00bd percentage point above the Committee\u2019s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.\u201d What I worry about is that we\u2019re shifting a little bit here, and particularly when we introduce the \u00bd percentage point above the longer-term goal. A lot of this, Mr. Chairman, it seems to me, depends on your press conference.  You\u2019ve already drafted that; it has been vetted.  Some of us haven\u2019t had the privilege of seeing those drafts. I\u2019m assuming\u2014just to cut to the chase here\u2014that it must be geared toward an alternative, and I would assume that it must be geared toward a variation of this alternative.  And if we go down this path, we have to be very, very careful that it be well articulated.  The statement itself isn\u2019t sufficient, even though we try, by adding these sentences that other people have mentioned.  To me this whole thing depends on how you explain it at the press conference, and we got a very good insight into that by this exercise you put us through earlier", " MR. BULLARD.  I\u2019m looking at the first figure on page 1 of the handout, the dealer survey versus alternative A, alternative B, and alternative C.  Alternative B is sitting up here, and all the dots are down to the right and south.  It\u2019s making me a little nervous that market expectations are a fair amount off from where we are as a Committee or what we\u2019re thinking of.  Is that how you would interpret this graph, or are you not as concerned about that", " MR. ENGLISH.  I think they\u2019d actually have to read all three of those bullet points.  That eight of you were reasonably comfortable with what the staff was writing down; that\u2019s alternative B.  Seven of you felt there should be more purchases than that, and four of you less.  Given that, I think their distribution would move down", " MR. ENGLISH. Yes", " MR. ROSENGREN.  One of the challenges that President Bullard showed with that figure, I think, is partly the result of the Tealbook being more pessimistic on the unemployment rate than most of the rest of us.  The central tendency is 7.4 to 7.7 percent for 2013, and the Tealbook is at 7.8 percent.  So if you looked at the central tendency of the voters that are voting for this was, my guess is that that dot would be a good bit lower than the dot that you\u2019re showing right now.  I can understand why the dealers are coming up with a different answer, which is that substantial improvement in labor markets doesn\u2019t look like something higher than where we are now.  I think some of the inconsistency is tied to that paragraph 4, and the difference between the Tealbook and some of the rest of our forecasts that are shown in the economic projection.  So they\u2019re not going to see those three dots for A, B, and C, but I do think that some of that disconnection is tied to the differences in both the forecast and people\u2019s reading of paragraph 4", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman. I\u2019m sorry", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I apologize.  I came in late.  Is it possible to make your handout available on SDS", "\u201d MR. LOCKHART.  I suggest either to say the \u201cmost recent date-based guidance,\u201d so that there is no confusion as to the two previous date-based guidances, or to say, \u201cThe Committee currently views these thresholds as consistent with the mid-2015 forward guidance introduced last September", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The economic situation calls for additional, ongoing monetary stimulus, and continuing our Treasury and MBS purchases is a good way to accomplish that.  Vice Chairman Dudley summed up the arguments for a combined strategy very well, and I agree with his comments in terms of using both Treasury and MBS purchases.  I would also mention that I agree with him that I would strike the bracketed \u201cit sees a substantial improvement\u201d phrase from paragraph 5.  In terms of LSAPs, I will echo President Lockhart\u2019s remarks. My own view is that appropriate policy will include extending these purchases well through most of this year, probably ending them in the fourth quarter.  That is just my own expectation.  And I would like to respond to President Fisher\u2019s remarks about the research done at the San Francisco Fed. It is true there are issues about how do the Treasury purchases affect financial conditions.  They have identified those\u2014both a signaling channel and a term-premium channel.  There is a lot of uncertainty about how much of a role each channel plays.  Of course, both are beneficial to the economy.  But, again, going back to the Vice Chairman\u2019s comments, there is a lot of uncertainty about these tools in general, so that argues for using both of them.  That\u2019s my own conclusion from reading that research. I do support the thresholds language in paragraph 5, but I confess to seeing this as a closer call than the decision to extend our asset purchases.  On the positive side, thresholds are a simple and clear way to link our policy to economic outcomes in a way that conveys that we are staying low for longer.  Nonetheless, quantitative thresholds present challenges and risks of both  substance and communications.  First of all, we should recognize we are shining a very bright spotlight on the unemployment rate.  I find the theory of rational inattention developed by Chris Sims and others instructive in this regard.  It reminds us that people have limited capacity to absorb information, and are, therefore, selective in what information they pay attention to.  When we stated a specific date for liftoff, the spotlight was cast on the calendar, and that\u2019s what everyone focused on, for better or for worse.  Once we start talking in terms of an unemployment threshold, it will be the unemployment rate that takes center stage, commanding all of the attention of our audience.  Of course, it is important that we communicate the various modifiers and exemptions and footnotes around the use of thresholds.  But in the end, we should be realistic and recognize that most eyes will be following the spotlight.  Second, we don\u2019t have a solid foundation on which to base our specific numerical choice for the unemployment threshold.  That came out in some of the comments already.  Over time, with new information and analysis, we may regret choosing a 6\u00bd percent threshold.  For example, as I mentioned at our previous meeting, movements in r* or the natural rate of unemployment could change the appropriate conditions for funds rate liftoff.  Now, this is not just a theoretical concern.  A year or so ago a 7 or 7\u00bd percent unemployment threshold seemed eminently reasonable.  In the future, we may well find ourselves in the awkward position of having to change the announced threshold either up or down.  Third, thresholds represent a major intellectual shift in how we think about and communicate policy compared with, say, a standard linear reaction function.  Even if we just focus on unemployment and inflation, our usual reaction function is a function of both unemployment and inflation together.  We don\u2019t normally shine the policy spotlight on either unemployment or inflation separately.  Looking further ahead\u2014I am still looking to the time when interest rates are above zero\u2014once rates do rise above zero, our use of thresholds will  create some new challenges as we try to explain our return to a normal policy approach and communications. Weighing these costs and benefits\u2014and, important, in the current situation where the funds rate is stuck at zero and our other policy options are limited\u2014I am comfortable supporting thresholds.  Many of the communications challenges specific to this approach can be addressed in your press conference, Mr. Chairman\u2014we\u2019re loading everything on the press conference", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The decision to support alternative B is, for me, not a close call as it is for Betsy, but I find myself sympathetic to much of what she just said.  From my point of view, the situation that we confront is the one that Janet alluded to earlier, which is we agreed on a program in September that most, if not all, of us thought would not be perceived with quite the heft that it was by markets.  That leaves us, or at least me, in something of a dilemma.  On the one hand, given my quite strong view that more accommodation is appropriate at this time, one of the few things I am sure about is that labor markets are not anywhere near healthy yet.  Given that belief, I wouldn\u2019t want us to do anything now that would remove any of the heft that we got in September.  I think dialing down the Treasury purchases would be a signal that would at best be uncertain and unclear and almost surely would be perceived as some removal of accommodation, but markets wouldn\u2019t quite understand why and what had changed.  On the other hand, for many of the reasons that Betsy and Dennis have already alluded to, I am not as sanguine about the communication challenge here as some of my fellow supporters of alternative B are. I think Betsy has rehearsed the problems well, and so I won\u2019t repeat it.  That is also why I, like Betsy, thought you might want to pair the thresholds language with the first time that a signal was being given that this thing may   not extend quite so far as market expectations believed it would.  But as I said, given where we are and where alternative B is, I have no trouble supporting it today. I would say that with respect to the issues around the LSAPs, there are two sets of distinct issues that are of greater or lesser relevance to people depending on their substantive positions.  One is the actual question about the purchases.  As I listen today, there are a number of people who would be perfectly comfortable stopping them right now\u2014would prefer that we had not even undertaken them in September\u2014and so that is a pretty clear answer. Although no one has said so in an unqualified way, I suspect that some of us around the table expect that they will be comfortable for some time to come continuing purchases.  So, from their point of view, the communication challenge of trying to ramp back expectations is not as imminent a problem.  And then, there is a group of people in the middle\u2014I suspect Elizabeth is one of them\u2014who are genuinely not certain how long they may be comfortable because they do want to see what kind of impact is being had and may sense that they will get a better idea of the efficacy question along the way.  To the degree that that group of people actually becomes an important fulcrum of future decisionmaking\u2014no inside information here, but the Chairman may well find himself in that middle position at some point along the way\u2014we do want to preserve optionality for the Committee as a whole. And so the question, just to restate it is, how does one begin to communicate in such a way as to affect expectations.  And, like Betsy, my eyes were drawn to the Tealbook assumption that investors will gradually realize that cumulative purchases will be about $500 billion.  Well, how exactly is that going to happen\u2014that it is nice and gradual. How can we achieve that without giving negative signals quickly, which would thereby undermine some of that heft that I indicated earlier.  My personal sense is today is not the day to begin giving negative signalsbecause it would undermine the heft.  A clearer statement of criteria in a somewhat abstract, disembodied way is probably the best that can be done. But this is a challenge beginning, probably with the March press conference, and maybe even the February monetary policy testimony, and a challenge for all of us individually and collectively because, boy, this one has \u201cBabel\u201d written all over it with everybody coming out and giving their views of what LSAPs mean and what improvement in a labor market is and where the costs or where the benefits are. That has not proved helpful for the institution in the past.  However, people do have different views and feel greater or lesser compulsion to state them.  I put that on the table as a difficulty, which I think is a shared difficulty, of figuring out how to thread that needle over the course of the next few months.  It is dependent, of course, on people\u2019s substantive views as well as a communications challenge. On thresholds, I have come around, as I have said earlier.  The fact that I have come around reveals the fact that I think there are some shortcomings or costs as well as benefits, and people have already mentioned them today.  If I had my druthers, I would get rid of all of the other verbiage besides the thresholds themselves in paragraph 5.  But I am not going to win that one, so I won\u2019t even pursue it.  The only specific thing I would say is, Charlie Plosser, on this one, I actually think the potentially incomplete information given by the unemployment rate works in your favor on thresholds, given what I understand to be your policy inclinations, because to the degree that the unemployment rate comes down more quickly because of transitory labor market participation developments, that would get us to the point of thinking about tightening sooner. In this context at least, I don\u2019t think those kinds of problems that Sarah and I and others have talked about are of particular concern, but that\u2019s not to dismiss all of the communications concerns around thresholds.  I think the problem with thresholds is that   everybody is for reaction functions and communicating reaction functions, but then people begin to get nervous when you actually get specific.  Well, if you don\u2019t get specific, and you just restate all of the things you think about, then you are not communicating the reaction function.  At some point, you\u2019ve just got to pull the trigger and say, \u201cOkay.  This is the best we can do.  We\u2019re going to do it.\u201d  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I don\u2019t think there is anything logically wrong with what Governor Powell is suggesting.  I think it does establish a little bit of a separation between asset purchases and the funds rate"]}
