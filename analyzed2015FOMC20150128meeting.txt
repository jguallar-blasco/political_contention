Passage number 1.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is expressing his gratitude.


Passage number 2.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you. [Applause] CHAIR YELLEN.  Now let’s turn to our first agenda item, which is the election of Committee officers.  Following long-established precedent, I’m going to ask Governor Fischer to handle the nominations of Chair and Vice Chair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply describes the process of electing Committee officers.


Passage number 3.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you.  I’ll be calling for two sets of nominations and votes.  First, I’d like to ask for a nomination for Committee Chair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement about calling for nominations for Committee Chair.


Passage number 4.
 MR. TARULLO.  I nominate Janet Yellen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they nominate Janet Yellen.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 5.
 MR. FISCHER.  Is there a second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the fact that Mr. Fischer is asking if there is a second, indicating that there may be opposing viewpoints or differing opinions being discussed.


Passage number 6.
 MR. POWELL.  I second that nomination.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker is simply expressing agreement and support for the nomination mentioned. There is no disagreement or contention evident in this statement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 7.
 MR. FISCHER.  Any other nominations or discussion. We should try it out.  [Laughter] Without objection.  Now I’d like to ask for a nomination for the position of Committee Vice Chair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is potential for disagreement or contention in the passage as the speaker suggests trying something without objection, which implies that there may be differing opinions or potential objections.


Passage number 8.
 MR. TARULLO.  I nominate Bill Dudley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that they nominate Bill Dudley.


Passage number 9.
 MR. FISCHER.  Is there a second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage only states a question and does not involve any opposing views or conflicting statements.


Passage number 10.
 MR. POWELL.  I second that nomination.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement indicates agreement or support for the nomination, rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 11.
 MR. FISCHER.  Any other nominations or discussion.  [No response] Without objection.  Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, Governor Fischer.  Now let’s turn to the election of staff officers.  Matt, I’d like to ask you to read the list.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 12.
 MR. LUECKE.  For Secretary and Economist, Thomas Laubach; Deputy Secretary, Matthew Luecke; Assistant Secretaries, David Skidmore, effective February 2, 2015, and Michelle Smith; General Counsel, Scott Alvarez; Deputy General Counsel, Thomas Baxter; Assistant General Counsel, Richard Ashton; Economist, Steve Kamin; Economist, David Wilcox; Associate Economists from the Board, Thomas Connors, Eric Engen, Michael Leahy, William Nelson, and William Wascher; and Associate Economists from the Banks, Jonathan McCarthy, Daniel Sullivan, John Weinberg, David Altig, and Glen Rudebusch. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any comments. [No response]  Okay.  Thank you.  Without objection. Next, we need to select a Reserve Bank to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account, and I understand that New York is again willing to serve.  Are there any other nominations or comments.  [No response]  Okay.  Without objection. Now I’d like to call on Vice Chairman Dudley to nominate individuals to serve as manager and deputy manager of the System Open Market Account.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 13.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I nominate Simon Potter as manager, and Lorie Logan as deputy manager, of the System Open Market Account. CHAIR YELLEN.  Without objection.  Okay.  Next, we’re up to item 4, “Proposed Revisions to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market Operations,” and I’d like to call on Simon to introduce this item.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker nominates Simon Potter as manager and Lorie Logan as deputy manager, and there is no objection to these nominations. The passage then moves on to the next item on the agenda.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 14.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I’d like to comment on the counterparty matter that Simon raised at the beginning of his remarks, as part of our conversation yesterday about this.  Clearly, the situation we had in the previous authorization wasn’t ideal.  The term “dealer” is there for historical reasons.  It’s not precisely defined.  It has a common-sense English language meaning, however, that I think is plausibly restrictive in the sense that there are some counterparties you could imagine that wouldn’t qualify as dealers in the plain-English version of the meaning of the word.  So it seemed, at first blush, to be removing an important constraint on the Desk.  I totally trust the Desk not to expand the typical counterparties of open market operations and of repo and securities lending operations without consulting the Committee. I totally get that.  But my concern is that making this change with such short notice doesn’t seem advisable.  So I’d advocate that we do include the bracketed items.  The Committee needs a chance to understand what the implications are.  There’s a study under way of the entire counterparty framework, and rationalizing how the authorization and other documentary devices of the Committee deal with counterparties would be a good thing.  But we should probably await that before we make any substantive change.   This is a substantive change that will appear to the public.  While it’s not likely to be plastered over the front pages of many newspapers, there is a set of market participants who will take notice, wonder what this implies, and perhaps spend time speculating about what this implies about the Committee’s intentions for the capability of expanding counterparties of the Desk’s operations in the future.  So until we actually get through more work to understand this— and in view of the very short amount of time the Committee has had to digest these documents that were posted Friday evening—I’d urge that we retain the status quo by including the bracketed phrasing in the proposed directive. And I should mention that I fully support all of the other changes in the directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is advocating for including the bracketed items and retaining the status quo, while others may have different opinions on whether or not the changes should be made.


Passage number 15.
 MR. POTTER. To clarify one thing with regard to temporary open market operations, there’s no reference to counterparties in the current authorization, and that would remain if we transported that language over.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement that clarifies a specific point without presenting any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 16.
 MR. LACKER.  Exactly.  I misspoke. CHAIR YELLEN. Let me ask if there are other comments on the matter that President Lacker has raised here. President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. President Lacker misspoke, and Chair Yellen is asking for other comments on the matter raised by President Lacker.


Passage number 17.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Madam Chair.  I won’t go back over the same ground that President Lacker covered.  I’ll just say that I echo what he had to say.  Whenever we change language of this kind, we should have an opportunity to have careful deliberation over it, and so I would prefer to keep the status quo for that reason.  Similarly, I don’t know if I would counsel this at this meeting, but I think that, with the technological changes that have occurred in the past 15 years, it’s reasonable for the Committee to rethink whether there are any situations in which it would not be feasible for the Committee members to be called on to decide on a monetary policy issue.  Is there really any reason left to give those extraordinary powers to the  Chair.  I’m not suggesting that at this meeting, but I would advise the Committee to have that issue on the table in a sufficiently timely fashion for next year. CHAIR YELLEN.  I think the thought was a true emergency—an attack on the United States or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their preference to keep the status quo and suggesting that the Committee consider rethinking certain powers given to the Chair in the future. The mention of a "true emergency" is not in conflict with the speaker's overall statement.


Passage number 18.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. It would be useful to have a discussion of what the scenarios are that we’re thinking about. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any other comments on the authorization. [No response] Well, we’ve had a proposal, and I take it that it’s acceptable to the Desk to include the language that’s in blue and currently bracketed.  Two members of the Committee have spoken in favor of that.  Let me ask everybody else, how many people—I’d like a show of hands—would like to include the blue bracketed language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement.


Passage number 19.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Just one interjection.  We have a choice on page 4, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is merely asking for clarification or confirmation.


Passage number 20.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes. You would choose “dealers” if you wanted to keep the existing language.  You would choose “market counterparties” if you wanted to modernize the authorization fully.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents two options and their implications without expressing a preference or taking a side.


Passage number 21.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. What is in your recommendation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is simply asking for a recommendation without indicating any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 22.
 MR. POTTER. If you choose “market counterparties,” you don’t accept any of the other insertions.  If you accept the first two insertions, you would choose “dealers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no disagreement or contention in the passage. It simply states a condition and lists two options without any conflicting opinions or conflicting information.


Passage number 23.
” VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I see. I think we’re saying “dealers,” then, in that case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "I see" suggests that the speaker understands and agrees with what has been said.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 24.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident from the word "Yes" used as a response, which suggests that Mr. Potter is contradicting or opposing something that was said prior to his response.


Passage number 25.
 MR. LACKER.  I agree. “Dealers” is the status quo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing agreement with a statement.


Passage number 26.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just wanted to clarify that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses their desire to provide clarification.


Passage number 27.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  How many people would like to include the blue bracketed language.  [Show of hands]  Okay.  And is anyone opposed to keeping it for the time being. [No response]  Okay.  I’m assuming, then, that we will keep the blue language.  Are there any objections to approval of this.  [No response]  Okay.  Then let’s consider this approved. We’re ready to move on to item 5, which is a set of three related authorizations pertaining to foreign currency operations.  Again, I’d like to ask Simon to introduce this item.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 28.
 MR. POTTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  We also recommend that the Committee approve the foreign authorization with two amendments.  The first change, as with the domestic authorization, is to adopt the “Selected Bank” language.  The second change reflects the ongoing challenges we face in managing the euro foreign exchange reserves portfolio in the current interest rate environment. As yields on European sovereign debt and money market instruments have fallen in recent months, we’ve increased somewhat the duration of the euro portfolio, and the Desk has, at times, faced difficulty finding short-term, positive-yielding investments.  Consequently, we propose increasing the maximum duration of the foreign currency portfolio from 18 months to 24 months, as discussed at the December FOMC meeting.  Increasing this limit will give us more flexibility to manage the portfolio. Note that approval of these documents includes approval of the System’s warehousing agreement with the Treasury.  As has been the case since February 5, 1997, the limit on warehousing is set at $5 billion.  There are currently no outstanding balances. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there questions or comments.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply making recommendations and explaining the rationale behind them.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 29.
 MR. LACKER. We’re considering now the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive. Madam Chair, I will respectfully dissent once again from both of these, as I have every three years in the past and as my predecessor had going back to the 1990s.  Very briefly, the purpose of these facilities is to facilitate foreign exchange interventions undertaken at the behest of the U.S. Treasury.  Such intervention is ineffective if it does not signal monetary policy shifts.  If it does signal a shift in monetary policy, then it essentially compromises our independence.  Foreign exchange intervention is virtually nonexistent now.  I think we should take steps to wind down the infrastructure associated with it.In the meantime, though, I will respectfully dissent from the foreign currency authorization directives. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Are there other comments or questions. [No response]  Okay.  Hearing none, what I’d like to do is, we need votes on these, and I would like to take them separately to record separate votes.  These are votes of Committee members.  First, let’s start with the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates that Mr. Lacker dissents from the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive, while the rest of the committee members are in favor.


Passage number 30.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes. CHAIR YELLEN. Second, the Foreign Currency Directive.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The response shows unanimous agreement as there are no opposing votes.


Passage number 31.
 MR. LACKER.  Opposed. CHAIR YELLEN. Finally, Procedural Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed.  [No response] All right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker expresses opposition to something unspecified, but there is no response from others and no further discussion or disagreement.


Passage number 32.
 MR. LACKER. You got me on board on that one, given the other choice. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are you sure you read that carefully enough.  [Laughter]  Okay.  Now, our next item pertains to a range of Committee documents.  A staff memo distributed Friday proposed several changes to the program for information security that are aimed at largely exempting Bank economic information from FOMC classification and increasing the number of SDS users.  The memo also proposed some fairly technical changes that substitute the words “Selected Bank” for “Federal Reserve Bank of New York” and serve to standardize the language used to refer to the Committee.  Does anyone have a comment or question.  These are intended to be uncontroversial.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker asks if anyone has a comment or question but states that the proposed changes are intended to be uncontroversial.


Passage number 33.
   MR. FISCHER.  At least two people here haven’t read the memo and have a sense they didn’t receive it, but maybe they’re wrong.  There’s been a blizzard of material coming to us, and maybe we overlooked it.  But I don’t know what those changes are.  I got two pages with regard to the first item here—the proposed revisions to the FOMC Rules of Organization.  That one I got. CHAIR YELLEN. Well, there’s a gigantic memo here that was posted on Friday and includes all of these changes.  Are you suggesting we not vote on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply describes a situation where some individuals may not have received a memo, and there is a discussion about whether or not to proceed with voting on certain changes.


Passage number 34.
 MR. FISCHER.  Well, I don’t know what to do.  I’ve never seen it. And, as you flip through it, it’s got a lot of blue in it. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, as I explained, it’s meant to be a set of uncontroversial changes.  The only substantive thing is increasing the number of SDS users and clarifying that material produced by Reserve Banks is not FOMC-classified material.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Fischer, expresses uncertainty and lack of knowledge regarding a document, while Chair Yellen provides an explanation regarding the document's intent and content.


Passage number 35.
 MR. POTTER. When you look through it, most of the blue is the authorization changes.  We’ve already gone through those.  There tend to be smaller changes in the rest of the organizational documents.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the document they are looking at.


Passage number 36.
 MR. FISCHER. Well, I was particularly interested in the FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participants, and I am not completely familiar with the rules.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their interest and lack of familiarity with a specific policy.


Passage number 37.
 MR. LUECKE.  The only change to that document is the standardizing on the word “Committee” in place of “FOMC” or “Federal Open Market Committee” and the addition of a footnote that describes what “FOMC participants” means.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 38.
 MR. FISCHER.  I’m willing for the vote to go ahead, but I want to say that one tries, but when the computer doesn’t open documents at home and something is sent late on Friday, and things like that, it’s very hard to keep up.   CHAIR YELLEN. Would you like to wait until tomorrow to have a chance to look this over tonight, and we’ll vote on it tomorrow morning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer expresses his difficulty in keeping up with the work due to technical issues, but Chair Yellen offers a solution without any disagreement.


Passage number 39.
 MR. FISCHER.  I’m willing to go ahead, but I will reserve the right to discuss these issues further with you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Tarullo, did you want to weigh in on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer expresses his willingness to proceed while reserving the right to discuss the issues further, and Chair Yellen responds with "Okay." Governor Tarullo is then asked if he wants to share his opinion, but it doesn't indicate any disagreement at this point.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 40.
 MR. TARULLO.  As the changes have just been described, they seem fine, but I wanted to second Stan’s observation on the blizzard of memos coming in on SDS late Friday night.  I don’t think it’s reasonable, frankly, to send so many things at more or less the last minute when people are trying to prepare their remarks for the meeting.  So I would hope there would be some way that things could come in with enough time for those of us on the Board, at least, to be able to absorb everything. But that reservation doesn’t go to the merits of this particular issue—which I’m fine with. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Tarullo disagrees with the practice of sending many memos late on Friday night, while Chair Yellen does not express agreement or disagreement with this concern.


Passage number 41.
 MR. FISHER.  As a molting hawk, may I add, from a Bank president’s standpoint, that we are overwhelmed over the weekends with materials that were received as late as late Friday night.  So, again, the staff does an incredible job, they give us so much to consider, and I admire them enormously, but it would be really helpful if we had maybe one or two more days to look at so many of these.  These are all important matters, and so I will take a president’s stance and second what has been said by the two Governors. This is a polite suggestion. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a suggestion and agreement on the need for more time to review materials.


Passage number 42.
 MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, I want to suggest one thing about these votes.  As I understand it, we’re reauthorizing what has been standing practice for the Committee, because we’re reorganizing at this meeting.CHAIR YELLEN.  Correct.  That’s right.  These are not new documents.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  The passage does not have any contention or disagreement. Both Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen are in agreement about the reauthorization of the documents.


Passage number 43.
 MR. BULLARD. So we’re reestablishing what already was in effect in December, with minor changes.  On the communications memo, for instance, we had a separate discussion as a Committee, and a whole elaborate process, that put that into place, if I recall correctly. CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are simply clarifying and agreeing with each other about a process that was implemented in the past.


Passage number 44.
 MR. BULLARD. We can certainly review that at any point during the life of this particular incarnation of the Committee, and we can change that at any time.  But, as I understand these votes, these are mostly to ratify what we’ve been doing in the past. CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s correct. These are documents that, even in the case of the external communications policy, have been in place now for a large number of years, and we’re reauthorizing them, which we always do at our January meeting, with minor changes.  But I take the point about the timing and the blizzard of materials.  The staff is pretty overwhelmed in having to produce this material. I think it’s worthwhile for them to hear that we feel—and I feel the same way—that it comes to us as a blizzard.  But I also hope you’ll recognize the strains that are on the staff in trying to produce this gigantic amount of material for our consideration. President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are in agreement about the need to review and potentially change certain policies, as well as the overwhelming amount of material being produced by the staff.


Passage number 45.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Maybe I’m missing the description of what was in these changes.  I thought that the changes to the Program for Security of FOMC Information, while I welcome them, are perhaps a little more substantive than was outlined, in the sense that I believe it’s going to allow participants to be able to talk about their forecasts more openly than in the past—or maybe I misunderstood the sense of that language change.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Kocherlakota is simply expressing a need for clarification and seeking confirmation regarding the changes made to the Program for Security of FOMC Information.


Passage number 46.
  MR. ENGLISH.  I think our intention there was to be clear that, for example, a Reserve Bank president can go out and talk about his or her outlook for the economy, and that Reserve Banks can, as they already have been, post their Reserve Bank’s projections for the economy.  It would still not be appropriate, under the security rules that we’ve written down, for you to give a speech and say, “Here is what I submitted to the SEP.”  But we have been comfortable for some time with Reserve Bank presidents going out and giving outlook speeches in which they talk about their sense of the outlook, why it is what it is, and what they think is going to happen. We have also been comfortable with Reserve Banks posting information about their forecasts—the staff forecast or even, implicitly at least, their president’s forecast—on their websites, and so this was acknowledging that. I want to be clear that some of the Banks may want to have some of this information subject to Bank security rules.  These are the FOMC’s security rules, and the FOMC’s security rules have basically been rewritten to acknowledge the situation that I think we’re in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is purely explaining the Federal Reserve's stance on Reserve Bank presidents giving outlook speeches and posting forecasts on their websites.


Passage number 47.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks, Bill. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there any further questions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 48.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Just a clarification. Would this mean that an individual president, for example, couldn’t go out and say which dot was his or hers. Is that what this says.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is seeking clarification on a specific statement or rule.


Passage number 49.
 MR. ENGLISH.  I think that’s correct, because it still says that what you submit to the SEP is FOMC information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 50.
 MR. PLOSSER. It’s a fairly substantive change, then, in how we’re going to approach this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Plosser is simply stating that there will be a significant change in how "they" approach something. Without further context, it is not possible to determine what exactly this change refers to, but it does not show disagreement or contention.


Passage number 51.
 MR. ENGLISH. It actually isn’t.  That’s been true—that was true with the old rules.  We’re just maintaining that. But we’re saying that you could go out and talk more broadly aboutyour sense of the outlook, what the economy looks like, and what your policy expectations or desires would be, but you should not say, “And here are the specific numbers that I submitted to the SEP.”  That’s where we drew the line.  Admittedly, it’s slightly arbitrary, but it seemed to us that once you submit that to the SEP, then it really is FOMC information—it’s being distributed at meetings, and so on.  Whereas, if it’s just your forecast, then you can go out and talk about it. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about maintaining certain rules regarding talking about economic outlooks and policy expectations.


Passage number 52.
 MR. LACKER.  So we can say that our forecast for four-quarter GDP is X percent, but we can’t say that we submitted that as part of our SEP. We can say that our answer to the question of what the funds rate would be at the end of 2015 is Y percent, but we can’t say that we submitted that to the SEP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating what they are able to say about their forecast and answer, but clarifying that they have not submitted it as part of the SEP.


Passage number 53.
 MR. ENGLISH.  If you wanted to be that specific, I guess so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply offers a statement in response to a hypothetical scenario.


Passage number 54.
 MR. LACKER.  It’s a bit Orwellian.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that something is "Orwellian," which is a term used to describe something that resembles the dystopian themes found in George Orwell's novel "1984."


Passage number 55.
  [Laughter] MR. ENGLISH.  We’re trying to draw a line here, and, at the edge, it’s bound to be a little bit fuzzy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing a situation where drawing a line can be unclear or unclear at the edge, but there is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 56.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m not driven by that ambiguity to question the policy regarding what we say in public.  I’m driven to think about why so much of the SEP is confidential.  And maybe that’s what deserves some reconsideration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses curiosity about the level of confidentiality surrounding the SEP.


Passage number 57.
 MR. ENGLISH. The Committee has talked about that at some length in the past, and the communications subcommittee may well take that up again.  But, so far at least, the Committee has not wanted to release the matrix, with or without names.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 
Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is stating a fact about the Committee's decision and discussing a potential future action.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 58.
 MS. MESTER.  Okay.  Can I follow up on what President Lacker was saying.  Because I’m a little confused about this, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage because the speaker expresses confusion and wants clarification on a statement made by President Lacker.


Passage number 59.
  So you could put out your GDP projection, and you could  put out your inflation projection, but you couldn’t say, “And the policy rate path that I’m thinking is appropriate to get those—” MR. LACKER.  No, you can put out that, too.  You could publish your whole submission.  You can’t say it’s your submission.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers agree that you can put out GDP projection, inflation projection, and the policy rate path.


Passage number 60.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the passage.


Passage number 61.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  They have to make the inference that it’s your submission.  You can’t say it’s your submission.  That’s the subtle difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is explaining that someone else has to infer and confirm that a submission belongs to the person being referred to, rather than the person directly stating it themselves. The phrase "That's the subtle difference" suggests that this difference is not a point of contention, but rather a nuanced distinction.


Passage number 62.
 MS. MESTER.  Okay.  I guess I was reading that as, you couldn’t take the document that you submit, because it’s an FOMC document, and publish that.  But you could talk about everything that’s in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and offering an interpretation of a particular concept.


Passage number 63.
 MR. LACKER. You just can’t say it’s your submission, but you can say all of the information in it because it came from your head.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply explains the restrictions of claiming ownership over the submission while allowing for the sharing of information contained within it.


Passage number 64.
 MS. MESTER.  Okay.  Got it.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Mester is simply expressing her understanding and gratitude.


Passage number 65.
 MR. FISCHER. May I ask a question, Madam Chair.  I recall at least two people giving us their numbers in these meetings.  Were they in the minutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question being asked by Mr. Fischer regarding the minutes of previous meetings.


Passage number 66.
 MR. ENGLISH.  No.  They will appear publicly in the transcript when it is released after five years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about how the transcripts will be released after five years.


Passage number 67.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Which is five years early. [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Further comments or questions.  [No response]  Okay.  So I would suggest we take a single vote on this whole collection of changes.  Are there any objections to approving these documents.  [No response]  Okay.  Then without objection. Now we’re going to move on to item 7, which is to approve our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  As you all know, under the leadership of thesubcommittee on communications, we’ve made an effort in recent months to investigate possible enhancements to the consensus statement.  Although we ultimately decided not to make any substantive changes at this particular time, I believe that this exercise was constructive, and I continue to view the consensus statement as a living document that will evolve over time.  Some of the options we discussed—for example, making explicit the symmetry of our inflation objective—may well make their way into the statement in the future when economic conditions are closer to normal and there’s less risk of confusing the public with a change.  We also agreed to continue our discussions about the role of financial stability in monetary policy.  I certainly hope we will continue to think hard about the statement and work together under the leadership of Governor Fischer and the subcommittee to enhance it over time. Personally, I think the consensus statement has been an indispensable tool in articulating both our monetary policy goals and our strategy for attaining them.  I realize that aspects of the statement allow for a range of interpretations.  That’s both a strength and a weakness.  But let’s not forget that it took this Committee well over a decade to formulate a document that was capable of achieving very broad support, and its value derives importantly from the fact that it does command an overwhelming degree of support in the Committee.  The only change to the statement before you from the version endorsed last year is the update of the central tendency of the longer-run unemployment rate from the SEP.  So before we take a vote, I’d like to ask if anyone would like to comment on the consensus statement.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a discussion about approving documents and discussing the consensus statement.


Passage number 68.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’ll echo the sentiments you expressed in your remarks.  I support the consensus statement, but I also support continuing discussion and dialogue within the Committee about ways in which we could further strengthen and enhance it under the leadership of the subcommittee on communications.  The core of the consensus statement is that it’s been able to provide a numerical target for inflation of 2 percent.  As you’ve described before, Madam Chair, the communication of the specific target by the FOMC was a culmination—you just referred to a decade.  I seem to remember references to nearly two decades, actually, of hard work and debate by yourself and others around this table. As the consensus statement suggests, this target serves to anchor the public’s expectations of nominal variables and thereby makes monetary policy more effective. As you will hear over the next couple of days, though, unfortunately, I remain deeply concerned about signs of downside risks to the credibility of our inflation target.  These credibility risks pose a considerable threat to all that we have achieved together in the consensus statement, and we need to do all that we can to ensure that those risks don’t actually transpire. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses support for the consensus statement and suggests continuing discussion and dialogue to strengthen it further. There is also a concern expressed about potential risks to the credibility of the inflation target. However, there is no explicit contention or disagreement between the speaker and others in the passage.


Passage number 69.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The consensus statement of the Committee’s longer-run strategy for monetary policy is an important guide for our policy deliberations and decisions.  In public, I discuss our policy goals for maximum employment and price stability every time I speak, and I strongly support the approach described in this document.  I firmly believe that my policy recommendations to date have been in line with this consensus statement, and I’m confident every other affirming participant believes the same. In light of the low-inflation environment we face today, our discussions last fall, and the policy choices ahead, I feel the need to clarify two of my expectations that I have from reading this statement.  This is just how I interpret the statement. First, I believe that our 2 percent objective means that we should actively eschew stalling out before we reach our 2 percent  objective.  The statement cites a single value for the inflation objective, not an acceptable range.  But if we should debate that, then we should debate that. Second, I believe that our objective is a symmetric one.  Periodically, I have heard people make comments along the lines that they’re not worried about low inflation today because it is very unlikely it will go below zero. Let me just state the symmetric dual for this observation and ask if there’s any doubt that everyone would be bothered by it.  Let me put this in language that the minutes might reflect:  “Participant X stated that they were not worried about inflation being well above our objective, because it was very unlikely to go above 4 percent.”  My view of our consensus statement is that both extreme conditions require a policy response to get inflation back to our 2 percent objective. I view our consensus statement as consistent with these modest views I’ve expressed today, and I will vote to reaffirm the statement before us.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. Mr. Evans expresses his support for the consensus statement and clarifies his expectations based on his interpretation of the statement. He also mentions that he believes every other participant in the Committee agrees with the consensus statement. There is no disagreement or contention between him and other participants mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 70.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, would like to express support for the consensus statement.  In my view, the consensus statement has provided real value to the Committee by laying out for the general public the Committee’s broad approach to carrying out its responsibilities under the law, particularly—if I can echo President Kocherlakota—in the 2 percent inflation objective. I see it as constitutional in nature, and it therefore represents many compromises among the authors, some of which are obvious to the reading public from the language and some of which are less so.  It’s not reasonable to expect it to resolve all differences.  It is reasonable, in my view, to expect that, when arriving at a common statement by a large group of people dealing with conflicts and controversial issues, there will be unresolved issues and compromises. All of that could easily be said of the U.S. Constitution, which has worked well over these years. Madam Chair, not every aspect of the statement is precisely what I would have written down, but I’m glad to support it as representative of the Committee’s carefully considered thinking about the areas in which there is broad agreement.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage expresses support for the consensus statement and acknowledges that compromises were made in its creation, but there is no disagreement or contention expressed.


Passage number 71.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As everyone knows, I’ve abstained in the past during the vote on this statement.  I have to say that this year, I thought about voting “no,” because there’s been a virtually explicit rejection this year of specifying that our inflation objective is symmetrical around the 2 percent target. As people may recall, originally, my concern was the failure to specify a symmetric loss function regarding the two goals in the dual mandate.  I still think that that demands attention. But I’ve found that the issue of symmetry of the inflation objective has obviously been particularly important over the past few years.  Yet, notwithstanding the fact that people purported to agree with that in discussion, there was an unwillingness to agree to an amendment of the statement, which I think would have been meaningful and would have provided not only some real guidance to the public, but also a foundation for the kind of analysis and discussion that we have in this Committee.  So I guess I’m more convinced than ever that this statement reflects an agreement on language, without any genuine consensus on the aims of monetary policy, something that is of particular significance now, in the immediate past, and perhaps in the immediate future.  Here I build on some of what Charlie said, even though I come out differently. Now, I’m not going to vote “no,” and—I’ll be very explicit—this is largely in deference to the Chair.  I don’t want to make her life more difficult with a “no” vote, but I really came veryclose this time around.  To be honest, I’m going to have to vote against this in the future if there are not additional changes. Just one thing, Jay, on the point about the Constitution.  The Constitution was agreed-upon language, which then has a different authority doing the interpretation—thereby not allowing everyone who agreed on the original to be his or her own interpreter.  I think that’s an important point of distinction, which is why one has to look to something more like an international agreement to see whether there is a genuine consensus underlying the agreed-upon language, even though, inevitably, ambiguities will result. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Tarullo is expressing his personal thoughts and concerns, but there is no direct disagreement with another person or party in the passage.


Passage number 72.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 73.
 WILLIAMS.  I agree with much of what Governor Powell said and what Chair Yellen said.  I think that the consensus statement is a compromise in many respects, but it’s served us very well.  I am one of the people who thinks that there are potentials for improvement, especially concerning the symmetry and with regard to thinking further about financial stability.  We had a good initial discussion of these issues. We didn’t make any substantive changes yet, but I do look forward to further discussions this year on both of these issues. I’m obviously not going to get into what to think about the Constitution with experts at the table, but, being a native Californian, we have a looser attitude toward changing the Constitution in California [laughter].  So I do have more of a Jeffersonian view of it.  Even though it has this quasi-constitutional character, we should do our very best, every year, to think about how we can enhance and improve this.  I do agree with the others that the symmetry issue is one on which we should really try to improve our language.  But it’s served us very well, and I fully support the consensus statement. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Williams agrees with much of what Governor Powell and Chair Yellen said, and expresses a desire for improvement and further discussion on certain issues. However, he also fully supports the consensus statement.


Passage number 74.
  MS. MESTER.  I guess I would characterize myself as a strong supporter of the statement. It’s an important piece of communication about our framework for policymaking, and it supports our desire for transparency. I’ve been a staff member involved with this statement since its inception, and now I’m a member of the subcommittee.  So I know firsthand all of the deliberation, consultation, and compromise that went into crafting the statement.  Of course, I’m not a fan of measuring input; we’ve got to measure output.  I’ll be the first to admit that there are still a lot of ambiguities in the statement, and we each could find parts to amend to suit our own particular approach to policymaking.  But I still think that if we view it as a consensus statement and a consensus set of principles, I would call it a success. Indeed, one could say that the document itself takes a balanced approach.  It balances the need to encompass the diversity of views among participants with the need to convey important information about the Committee’s policy goals and framework. The statement has served us well during the extraordinary policymaking times that we’ve been in since it was adopted in 2012, and I expect it to continue to serve us well when we return to the more normal economic and policy environment.  I echo President Williams’s sentiments that we’re going to continue to work to make it the best statement we can, but I do think that we should call this a success.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Ms. Mester, is expressing her support for the statement and highlighting its importance and success. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in her remarks.


Passage number 75.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the document, and I do think it’s a very important document in giving greater clarity to the public about how this Committee is interpreting the mandate that it has been given from the Congress and how that interpretation is evolving in response to changes in the nature of the challenges we’re facing.  It obviously does represent a compromise. We had some very good conversations prompted by the need to agree on this statement.  And those discussions are as important as the statement itself, for the purposes of the Committee being able to deepen its views and its agreement about how we’re interpreting our mandate. I’d say that the discussions regarding the symmetry of the two aspects of the dual mandate and regarding the inflation target were pretty rich.  The one area in which I would hope to see a much richer discussion in the lead-up to next year’s statement would be the role of financial stability considerations in monetary policy.  That’s an area that became very important in the crisis, but I don’t think we have grappled with it as much as we really need to at the Committee. CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.  Are there other comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing support for the document and discussing the importance of the discussions that took place to reach an agreement on the statement. She also highlights the need for further discussion on the role of financial stability considerations in monetary policy.


Passage number 76.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  Well, this has been an interesting and helpful discussion as well as an encouraging one, because three other members of the subcommittee have spoken, and I can agree with every word of every one of them—that is to say, Jay Powell, John Williams, and Loretta Mester. I should just add that, when our subcommittee started working, one of those three people said, “You should know that there’s a body buried underneath every word in this document.” [Laughter]  I understand that, but I still think we may make progress.  We’re not going to start immediately, but, probably somewhere around midyear, we’re going to be working on a fairly ambitious program of potential changes.  If we get any of them, we’ll be making progress. Thank you, Madam Chair.CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Well, thank you, everyone, for your comments.  As in the past, the minutes will include a summary of the views that have just been expressed around the table. Now, formally, approving the statement is a vote of the Committee.  But, before we do that, because of the nature of this document, I would like to ask for a show of hands of all participants regarding their support for the statement, and that will constitute input for the writers of the minutes.  So let me ask everyone, how many are in favor of the document.  [Show of hands]  And how many are opposed.  [No response]  And abstentions.  [Show of hands]. Okay.  Finally, although you have all just raised your hands, I’d like to take a separate formal vote of Committee members in order to approve the document, including the minor update.  All in favor.  [Show of hands]  Any opposed.  [No response]  Abstention.  [Show of hands]  Okay.  Thank you very much. We’re ready to move on to our next item.  We’re about to have a change of personnel at the table, with Thomas Laubach replacing Bill English.  But, Bill, before you leave, I’d like to thank you for your exemplary service to the Committee during these past four years as secretary and economist and as director of the Division of Monetary Affairs. Bill first began attending FOMC meetings in 1995 and has since attended 93 meetings, 34 of which were as secretary.  His service in this role benefited not only from his broad institutional knowledge and extensive background in monetary policy and financial-sector research, but also from personal characteristics that have proven invaluable:  a keen intellect, a drive for excellence, an unmatched work ethic, the patience of Job, and an abiding kindness in the face of enormous challenges.  Bill, we thank you for your service these past years and look forward to working with you in your new role as senior special adviser to the Board.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 77.
 MR. ENGLISH.  Thank you very much.  [Applause] CHAIR YELLEN.  Now I’d like to welcome Thomas Laubach to the table in his new roles as director of the Division of Monetary Affairs and as secretary and economist of this Committee. While Thomas is only a few weeks into his monetary affairs role and just a few minutes into his role as secretary, he is obviously not new, in any sense, to monetary policy or to the work of this Committee.  Thomas began his work with the Federal Reserve System in 1997 at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City and, in the years since, has contributed to a wide range of high-level policy memorandums.  He’s provided analytical support to the FOMC’s subcommittee on communications and served as a trusted adviser to me and to this Committee. Thomas, welcome.  We all look forward to working with you in this new role.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply introduces Thomas Laubach and mentions his experience and contributions to the Federal Reserve System and the Committee.


Passage number 78.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.  I’m very honored, and I look forward to serving the Committee. CHAIR YELLEN. Our next two items are going to be considered in a joint meeting of the Committee with the Board of Governors, and, accordingly, I will need a motion to close the Board meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and is looking forward to serving the committee. The following statement from Chair Yellen is simply stating the process for the next two items to be considered.


Passage number 79.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  I’d like to now call on Simon to deliver the first part of the Desk briefing, which focuses on market developments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement of someone asking for permission to proceed with a briefing.


Passage number 80.
 MR. FISHER.  On your panel 3, “Commodities Performance,” that’s strikingly different from what we saw beginning in, if my memory serves me, September 2008, when industrial metals and everything else followed suit. But it appears to the naked eye here that, if you’re looking at the broader metals index, there is a downward-sloping trend.  I’m just curious—from the standpoint of your discussions with market participants, is this something of concern. Is it being exacerbated by the increasing ability, in terms of the tradability, of financial interests surrounding industrial metals. I’m just curious about what your interpretation is from a Desk standpoint. If we were to see the same kind of behavior we saw in 2008, I’d really be worried, but we’re not seeing that atpresent. “Dr. Copper” has come down, to be sure.  My question is, from the standpoint of the financial markets, how much is this being exacerbated in terms of the volatility.  I will try to point out that in my general presentation.  It certainly is the case in the oil market.  There’s enormously more volatility than there used to be due to the nature of the instruments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and expressing curiosity about the trends in the commodities market and the potential impact of financial interests on volatility.


Passage number 81.
 MR. POTTER.  I think some of the day-to-day fluctuations—we’ve seen this in copper recently—can be related to people trading in new ways.  There are reports of Chinese hedge funds producing some of these changes.  I’d say that regarding this overall pattern of a decline, it’s hard to separate out demand-type factors from some of the build that people have done to have an increased supply there.  If I’d shown iron ore, we understand the investment there is really what’s produced the reduction in the price of iron ore.  Market participants, though, as the price of ore kept on going down, started to doubt a little bit whether it was completely a supply factor, because they look at prices. They tended to be less reassured as they saw, since the meeting, these red and light-blue lines coming down, because that looks a little bit more like 2008, which is why we put it that way in the briefing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different factors that may be influencing the decline in prices of certain commodities. There is no mention of any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 82.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Simon. CHAIR YELLEN. Are there other questions or comments. President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 83.
 MR. EVANS.  On the ECB action, which seemed pretty impressive to me, you mentioned that 2- to 30-year securities are eligible. Have they discussed the plan on how much duration to take out of the market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply asks for more information about the plan without expressing any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 84.
 MR. POTTER. They will buy across the curve, so that’s similar to what the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England do.  They look at what’s out there and try to buy in proportion across the maturity structure.  When we’ve run some of our large-scale asset purchase programs, we’ve bought not across the curve but with a duration target in mind.  What was surprising to  market participants is that they were prepared to buy out to 30 years.  One of the reasons they had to do that is that the quantity they’re buying is quite substantial.  There are restrictions on the issuer and per-issue amount.  This allows them, in the calculations they’ve done, to get to the rather large number that is between €800 billion and €900 billion for the sovereign debt purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about the buying strategies of central banks.


Passage number 85.
 MR. EVANS.  Is it likely that they might vary that duration target, depending on how they feel about how things are progressing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a straightforward question about the potential for variation in the duration target.


Passage number 86.
 MR. POTTER. They are going, potentially, to encounter a lot of market-functioning issues.  They are buying at a reasonably fast rate compared with net and gross issuance.  The turnover in many of these bond markets is quite low.  They won’t start until March, so the staff there is working quite hard on trying to figure out how to do this.  They’re also going to decentralize, and most of these purchases will be executed by the national central banks. So they’re going to have to coordinate across the 19 of those.  Some of those national central banks will face the issuer limit because they’re in programs, and the balance sheet already contains a lot of their sovereign debt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about the potential challenges and issues related to bond purchases.


Passage number 87.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN. Are there other comments or questions for Simon.  [No response] Should we turn to Lorie, who’s going to take us through the next part of this presentation and a discussion of testing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants are simply discussing the next part of the presentation and testing.


Passage number 88.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I’m going to make a procedural suggestion, Madam Chair.  This has to do with RRP testing.  According to the January Survey of Primary Dealers, they already believe we will offer a term facility regularly at quarter-end.  This is buried in the back of the primary dealer survey.  This has to do with this tension we’ve faced throughout the time we’ve been testing. We’ve wanted to learn more.  It’s a genuinely positive benefit of testing.  But, at the same time, we’ve been anxious about the extent to which testing encourages broad 3 The materials used by Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 3).expectation of a relatively permanent or overly large facility that’s going to persist for some time.  And it looks as though, again, our testing over the year-end of a term RRP facility has led expectations to run a bit ahead of where the Committee is on the likelihood of using it. We haven’t even actually decided this yet.  I note that our next agenda item, agenda item 9, is where we’re going to discuss our liftoff options.  The staff memo presented us with an option 1 and an option 2, and option 1 does without term RRPs.  It’s an option I favor, and I think we can do fine without that, with a larger cap and a wide spread to 25 basis points, as I’ll argue later. But our decision about whether we test again a term facility at quarter-end might be usefully informed about whether we think we’re likely to use it on an ongoing basis when we raise rates.  Now, I understand that there’s the standard boilerplate whenever we announce these things, and that we can test until the cows come home and it doesn’t mean anything about how we’re going to do things when we actually liftoff.  But, in point of fact, we see that what we do leads markets to expect us to use the things we test and roll out.  So, if the majority of the Committee coalesces around option 1 and views us as likely to be able to lift off quite smoothly without the use of term RRPs, it might be useful to forgo testing term RRPs.  I’d like to suggest, Madam Chair, that we defer consideration of this resolution on testing term RRPs until we’ve had this discussion and go-round on liftoff tools and we have a better sense of where the Committee wants to head.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a procedural suggestion made by Mr. Lacker regarding the testing of term RRPs and how it relates to the Committee's decision on liftoff options.


Passage number 89.
 MR. POTTER.  Can I just give you some background.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is not presenting any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that Mr. Potter wants to give some background information.


Passage number 90.
 MR. LACKER.  Ask the Chair.  It’s up to the Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Please, Simon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker asks a question and defers to the chair, Chair Yellen, who responds politely. There is no indication of any disagreement or conflict in their interaction.


Passage number 91.
 MR. POTTER. One of the things that we’re trying to deal with is to avoid indicating anything in our testing about whether a meeting is “live” or not.  Consequently, one of the thingswe’re trying to do in option 1 is to offer the possibility of using the term over a quarter-end.  We thought that this particular resolution was the minimal testing that we could come out of this meeting with.  I agree with you that it would be useful to find out whether that’s correct in the go-round coming up.  But it’s not as if the testing that we did was changing people’s expectations regarding our footprint or whether the overnight RRP will be permanent.  The buy-side respondents actually reduced the amount of overnight RRP that they thought we would be using, and we have not heard anyone suggest that this will be permanent. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 92.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I’m pretty sympathetic to what you’re saying, President Lacker, in the sense that, if the Committee decides determinatively that it’s not going to use something, then it doesn’t make sense to keep testing it, because that leads to the wrong inference by the markets.  But, at the same time, it’s not unreasonable for the markets to see how well the tests do and, from how well the tests do, make inferences about how likely the Committee is to actually adopt that facility. It seems to me that one reason why the markets might think term RRPs were more likely was that the tests seemed to show that they were helpful in putting a floor under money market rates. I don’t believe it’s reasonable to think that we could force the markets not to draw those kinds of inferences from whether the tests go well or the tests go not so well.  They’re going to respond to how they see their experience with the test.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. 

Explanation: The first speaker expresses sympathy towards President Lacker's viewpoint, suggesting that it wouldn't make sense to continue testing something that the Committee has already decided not to use. However, the second speaker disagrees and believes that it is reasonable for the markets to draw inferences from the test results. This disagreement shows a difference in perspectives on whether or not the tests should be continued and how the markets should interpret the test results.


Passage number 93.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair, I’m happy to debate testing, but I think we should just wait a few minutes and do it after we discuss the liftoff tools.  The time to have this discussion is after we have a sense of where we’re headed more broadly.CHAIR YELLEN. Personally, I think it’s fine if we defer the vote on the testing of the term RRPs until we’re done with the discussion of liftoff tools.  Do I see any objections to that. Okay.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 94.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Governor Tarullo looks as though he’s about to do a two-hander.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply describes the appearance of Governor Tarullo.


Passage number 95.
 MR. TARULLO.  Yes. I wanted to ask whether we can still ask questions now about the testing to inform the later discussion. CHAIR YELLEN.  Of course.  Yes, please.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in the passage. Mr. Tarullo is simply asking if he is able to ask questions about testing, and Chair Yellen gives her consent.


Passage number 96.
 MR. TARULLO.  I just wanted to make sure. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes—absolutely.  Do you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speakers are simply confirming and agreeing with each other.


Passage number 97.
 MR. TARULLO.  I do, but Eric’s first. CHAIR YELLEN.  Of course.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers are just acknowledging and respecting each other's turn to speak.


Passage number 98.
 MR. ROSENGREN. My question follows on with that line of questioning of President Lacker’s.  Based on our experience over year-end, if you were to tally the financial cost of using term reverse repos instead of overnight, do we have a rough approximation of how much we spent by choosing to do it with term rather than overnight.  Just approximately.  The second part to that is that there may be an inference that there’s a difference from a financial stability standpoint between term and overnight.  So, based on your experience with year-end, could you give me a sense of how you see the financial stability differences between using overnight reverses and using term reverses.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is requesting information and seeking clarification from the person they are addressing.


Passage number 99.
 MR. POTTER.  I think it’s easier if I answer the first question now.  The second might be more appropriate in the discussion of liftoff tools.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the opinion of Mr. Potter and mentioning another question that could be discussed later.


Passage number 100.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Okay.  That’s fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker's response indicates agreement or acceptance.


Passage number 101.
MR. POTTER.  On the first one, the counterfactual exercise you’d have to do is the following:  Suppose we’d increased over the year-end the cap on the overnight RRP to $600 billion.  That would be the same amount of collateral available.  Then the $225 billion that was in term, instead of going out at probably an average rate of 9 basis points, assuming we didn’t hit the cap, would have gone out at 5 basis points.  So that’s 4 basis points times $225 billion.  I don’t know if Josh can work that out.  I don’t think it’s that much of a difference in terms of the income of the Federal Reserve. In terms of how it worked in markets, there’s some evidence that it has some social value due to the confidence it gives people that it will allow for smoother market functioning and less disruption.  But, overall, if the two tools achieve the same rate control, that’s probably what we should look at primarily.  And if they do, given that and market functioning, the one that’s slightly cheaper to use is probably preferred. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion of a hypothetical scenario and the potential impact on income and market functioning. Both speakers seem to be expressing similar views.


Passage number 102.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Simon, on that point, how much learning do you think there was by markets as they saw how the different term operations are perceived.  Because one advantage of the term facility, in principle, is that you have these operations, and the market can see how the pricing occurs and what the demand is, whereas if you just have the overnight operation, at the end of the year, you know nothing until the operation actually materializes.  I’d be curious about whether you think there was learning and whether that was helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for Simon's opinion on whether there was learning and if it was helpful in relation to markets observing how different term operations are perceived.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 103.
 MS. LOGAN. We heard from market participants that some learning took place, and they realized—as the operation, particularly the third one, wasn’t oversubscribed—that the year-end pressures were going to be fairly smooth.  But if you pressed market participants to indicate whether they were fully confident that all of the demand would have been met on the year-end   date with a larger overnight RRP cap, I’m not sure they would have preferred the term over the overnight.  So when there’s uncertainty about whether the cap is high enough to accommodate that demand on overnight, that’s what you would be weighing against increased knowledge by having the term earlier.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that market participants realized that year-end pressures would be smooth based on the operation not being oversubscribed. However, the speaker also mentions that if market participants were pressed to indicate if they were fully confident in meeting the demand with a larger overnight RRP cap, they may not have preferred the term over the overnight. This suggests disagreement or contention over the effectiveness of the overnight RRP cap in meeting the demand.


Passage number 104.
 MR. POTTER.  But I think the money funds do prefer higher rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states their belief that money funds prefer higher rates.


Passage number 105.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Just one follow-up on that, if I may.  If we had no cap on year-end for overnight, would that have served the same purpose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple follow-up question.


Passage number 106.
 MS. LOGAN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The answer is yes. In the passage, Ms. Logan expresses a disagreement or difference of opinion.


Passage number 107.
 MR. FISHER.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The two individuals are addressing each other respectfully.


Passage number 108.
 MR. FISHER.  Just to clarify, are they fairly close substitutes or not.  That’s my question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a request for further clarification.


Passage number 109.
 MR. POTTER.  Fantastic question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement by Mr. Potter seems to be expressing admiration or surprise, rather than engaging in an argument or debate.


Passage number 110.
  [Laughter] MR. FISHER.  And the answer is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is composed only of laughter, indicating agreement or amusement.


Passage number 111.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes—I think that was a “yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 112.
” MS. LOGAN.  I think we’re going to talk to a greater extent about the degree of substitution.  From an actual operations perspective in this particular briefing, there is more complexity in operating the term as opposed to just having an overnight that can be used.  How you want to weigh those against certain scenarios in which the financial stability implications may be different is, I believe, a topic Jim is going to go into.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While there is discussion and different perspectives being mentioned, there is no clear contention or disagreement.


Passage number 113.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But you were asking from the standpoint of the investor, weren’t you, Richard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply confirming the perspective from which Richard was asking the question.


Passage number 114.
MS. LOGAN. From the investor’s standpoint, they like the flexibility of the overnight products because then their cash flows can be variable, and they have the opportunity to put it in daily and make daily adjustments.  When we were designing this, the overnight RRP was as late in the day as possible so that they can even use every hour within the day to make a decision about whether they’re going to invest with the Federal Reserve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the benefits of overnight products from an investor's standpoint.


Passage number 115.
 MR. POTTER.  I think quarter-end is a little bit different in that they can predict that the balance sheet will be going down.  That’s available to them.  So the substitution between overnight and term, then, is one set of cases.  What might be interesting is to learn, away from the quarter-end, is whether the substitution looks any different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Potter, discussing the concept of quarter-end and the potential differences in substitution between overnight and term. There is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 116.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker addresses Chair Yellen respectfully, indicating agreement or support. Chair Yellen gives him permission to speak, suggesting a cooperative relationship.


Passage number 117.
 MR. LACKER. I want to follow up on President Rosengren’s question, the crux of which was that, with a sufficiently large cap, they have virtually identical effects and an identical effect on the counterparties, and that they view them as perfect substitutes.  I take it that the effect on market rates would be about the same as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is simply restating and agreeing with President Rosengren's point of view.


Passage number 118.
 MS. LOGAN.  I don’t think they’re viewed as perfect substitutes.  As I said, market particpants like just having the overnight products.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Logan is stating her opinion about the perception of overnight products by market participants.


Passage number 119.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Sure, they’d love a term instrument from us.  But, aside from that, the effect on market rates is likely to be the same either way—the term versus a large cap.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states a fact about the potential impact on market rates.


Passage number 120.
 MS. LOGAN. You have the potential, if you offered too much term, to, in fact, increase term rates unexpectedly. Therefore, the market rate implications between the two scenarios may not be exactly the same.  For the overnight rate on year-end, I think they would end up being the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. MS. LOGAN is discussing the potential effects of offering too much term and concluding that the market rate implications may not be exactly the same in both scenarios. However, there is no conflicting viewpoint expressed.


Passage number 121.
 MR. LACKER.  If I could follow up, there was an alarming 6 basis point drop in the funds rate.  I’m being sarcastic—I’m sorry.  There was a huge drop in the funds rate on year-end.  You don’t view that as compromising our monetary policy objectives, do you.  We’ll pretty much get where we’re going to go anyway, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is making a sarcastic remark about the drop in the funds rate but does not express any disagreement with the other person's view on monetary policy objectives.


Passage number 122.
 MS. LOGAN.  I thought the objective was for that rate to be at or above the overnight RRP, and that we were running a floor.  I thought that was the objective of the testing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating their understanding of the objective, without expressing any opposition or conflicting viewpoint.


Passage number 123.
 MR. LACKER.  No, our objectives are in the consensus statement we adopted earlier today.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that there is consensus among the group, indicating agreement and unity.


Passage number 124.
 MR. POTTER.  I think that, in the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, which you voted into effect in September, you did express the wish that this tool be used to support the federal funds rate trading in that range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Potter believes that the tool should be used to support the federal funds rate trading in a specific range.


Passage number 125.
 MR. LACKER.  But I’m thinking that, before the crisis, we had quarter-end and year-end rate explosions and implosions all the time.  And I don’t recall that ever being brought to the Committee as a matter of concern or something that required a new facility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 126.
 MS. LOGAN. What we were trying to test, if you look at panel 19, was whether there was a difference in the dark-blue line in the days leading into quarter-end.  In the old days, as you suggest, we might have had volatility on quarter-end, but you may be uncomfortable—and I think that’s very interesting—about the extent to which that had influence on other days beyond that one day.  In this case, we didn’t see that dynamic at the year-end.  Now, it could have just been because we surprised market participants in September.  So, again, we don’t know that for sure.  But we didn’t see that leakage going into quarter-end, and I agree that on one day, if it’s just one day, that’s probably not so much of a concern.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion of observations and interpretations without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 127.
MR. LACKER. Yes. A broader point is that—I don’t want to belabor this, but it’s obvious—in the old regime, it was predictable. The rates would crash or spike or whatever, and what was relevant to the things in the consensus statement, things like two-year rates and one-year rates, would smooth through that.  So year-end never really had any economic consequence that I remember.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply making a statement about the old regime and how certain rates would smooth out fluctuations.


Passage number 128.
 MS. LOGAN.  I agree about that day, and we saw that other jurisdictions—the United Kingdom and the euro area—had volatility on their year-end date.  I think what you may be concerned about are those days leading into the quarter-end—that it is more than just one day.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. Logan agrees with the statement mentioned and further adds her own perspective on the matter.


Passage number 129.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  And you’ve provided the information that an overnight with a sufficiently large cap would be adequate to provide ample comfort to market participants to smooth market function enough.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that an overnight with a large cap would be enough to provide comfort and smooth market function.


Passage number 130.
 MR. POTTER.  As long as it’s available for some time before the year-end as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 131.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Of course, the related issue, President Lacker, is that if we actually do lift off in June or September and quarter-end is coming up right behind that liftoff, having rates move up—and do so pretty consistently—is probably more important than at other times.  I certainly accept your point that at past year-ends we didn’t care.  But at this point, our credibility in terms of actually making the liftoff clearly work is a little higher than normal. So we would probably care more about quarter-end pressure and year-end pressure now than we would in past episodes. CHAIR YELLEN.  Agreed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both speakers seem to be in agreement.


Passage number 132.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I take your point, but I think there’s something a little special about these circumstances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges and understands the other person's point, but also adds their own perspective without contradicting or opposing the initial point.


Passage number 133.
  MS. LOGAN.  Particularly for the days before the quarter-end, because between, for example, the June meeting and the quarter-end, if it leaked into the days before, you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between the liftoff pull and the actual quarter-end effect. So I think that window is particularly of interest.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and stating that the specific time period mentioned is of interest.


Passage number 134.
 MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up on this.  Yes, it’s true—quarter-end is about one week after the June meeting, and there might be some articles in the paper the next day if we have a little crash in rates.  But quarter-end effects are pretty well known in financial markets.  Some reporter is bound to come across somebody saying “usual quarter-end pressure.”  A month later, is it going to be a problem if rates behave the normal way after that. I don’t see it as a really serious reputational risk for us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing his opinion and does not mention any opposing views or conflicting ideas from others.


Passage number 135.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess it’s probably not a very serious reputational risk, but if you have a good tool to prevent that reputational risk from manifesting itself, why wouldn’t you want to use it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement followed by a question, without any contrasting or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 136.
 MR. POTTER.  President Lacker, as Lorie said, no one has done this before.  Suppose we are lifting rates.  There’s going to be noise around it, and it’s going to be very confusing for people if we don’t actually lift rates. CHAIR YELLEN.  Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 137.
 MR. POTTER. We could try to say it’s quarter-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is suggesting a possible course of action without any opposition or conflicting opinions being presented.


Passage number 138.
 MR. LACKER. Wait.  So you’re talking about one day a week after we raise rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any opposing viewpoints or conflicting statements. It is a simple statement where Mr. Lacker is clarifying the frequency (one day a week) of a certain action (raising rates).


Passage number 139.
 MR. POTTER. No.  It’s the pressure of quarter-end leading into that day.  That can put downward pressure on rates.  That’s what we saw in September. There’s some controversy as to the source of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact ("That’s what we saw in September") and mentioning that there is some controversy surrounding the source of the downward pressure on rates.


Passage number 140.
 MR. LACKER. Was it 3 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a question and a statement without any conflicting ideas.


Passage number 141.
  MR. POTTER. But remember the zero.  There’s a zero line in here.  Zero is getting a lot farther away when we raise rates, and zero is a big push-off as well.  We really don’t want—I don’t want and Lorie doesn’t want, in light of the directive you’ve given us—to have a lot of complications in those first two weeks in terms of raising rates. CHAIR YELLEN.  Agreed.  If, later on, we’re into normalization, does it matter if there’s a little bit of pressure on year-end.  Probably not.  But after six years of being at zero and saying we want to raise rates, it seems to me we ought to be successful in doing it and do what it takes to make that happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Potter and Chair Yellen express agreement and a shared goal of successfully raising rates.


Passage number 142.
 MR. LACKER.  Do you think the year-end pressure could be as much as 25 basis points. Could this pressure into quarter-end push it down 25 basis points so that the day after we raise rates, it doesn’t go up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 143.
 MR. POTTER. We have seen large moves. For Eurodollars at the end of the third quarter, the effective rate printed negative.  We’ve seen big moves in the United Kingdom, and we don’t really know what it means to be far away from zero.  It’s something that might come up in Jim’s discussion.  Recall that, for a lot of lenders, they can just leave it in cash.  They might get charged, but it’s not a big opportunity cost.  When we’re raising rates, the opportunity cost of not being invested goes up. CHAIR YELLEN. Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 144.
 MS. BRAINARD.  I would say, President Lacker, that you’re making important analogies to previous periods that were completely different from the circumstances that we’re going to be facing.  We are in uncharted territories, and market participants are going to be watching this with a different set of eyes because of the massive amount of excess reserves in the system and because we’re lifting off from the zero lower bound, where we’ve been for many   years now.  I just don’t think we have historical examples of that in the United States.  Right now, we are getting support from the zero lower bound, but you’ll be moving that lower bound up. The behavior we saw at quarter-end in September should lead us to be very concerned that, right after an announcement by this Committee that we’re lifting off, we could actually see rates drifting down for several days in a row.  To me, that would be a very strong concern, particularly as we have the tools that we’re quite confident could prevent it.  The following question would arise:  Why wouldn’t you use those tools. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Brainard expresses concern about the potential drift down of rates after the Committee announces a lift-off, and questions why the tools to prevent this are not being used. On the other hand, Chair Yellen does not address these concerns and does not explain why the tools are not being used.


Passage number 145.
 MR. POWELL.  I would strongly agree with Governor Brainard.  We’re going to be in a world of superabundant reserves for many years.  It’s very important that we establish good control over rates at the beginning. If, later on, things get a little sloppy, that’s one thing, but that would really not be the way to start this process, in my view.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo, did you have a quick question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Powell, strongly agrees with Governor Brainard.


Passage number 146.
 MR. TARULLO.  My question was actually Eric’s second question, which Simon suggested was best deferred to the discussion of liftoff options, a topic I think President Lacker has already taken us into.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It appears that MR. TARULLO is simply stating that he agrees with Simon's suggestion to discuss the topic of liftoff options at a later time, which President Lacker has already started discussing.


Passage number 147.
  [Laughter] MR. LACKER. I was dragged into it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any clues or indications of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 148.
 MR. TARULLO.  But I have a feeling that Jim will address that question in the presentation, so I will defer. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there any other questions. President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It consists of individuals deferring to someone else's expertise and asking if there are any further questions.


Passage number 149.
 MR. PLOSSER. I have two really quick observations.  One is that we’re worried about lifting off in June or September, very close to quarter-end.  We can solve that problem by lifting off in April or July.  [Laughter]  Get rid of it.  Don’t lift off near the year-end.  I’m being a bitfacetious here, but my point is, if the only reason to change the way we approach the structure of the program has to do with quarter-end behavior, it seems the wrong way to design the program.  For example, if we choose to lift off in June and we choose to do things in a particular way to avoid the quarter-end problem that we’re talking about, what will then be the expectations in the market about subsequent quarter-ends.  Once we start doing that, I’m worried we’ll find ourselves repeating this, and we actually will have adopted a practice that we didn’t have before, which is smoothing quarter-end.  So I think it’s tricky on both sides.  Once you venture into that fray and start that practice, we may find it that much harder then to pull back on this program that we’ve said we want to pull back on. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is offering a suggestion to solve a potential issue, and Chair Yellen responds without expressing disagreement.


Passage number 150.
 MR. FISHER.  This is a one-off, Madam Chair, but I want to come back to the previous meeting we had and the excellent memo that Simon wrote—on your own or with the Desk—and that I praised.  I simply want to ask the question:  Have we had any change in our expectation as to the ultimate size of the balance sheet and then the speed with which we expect to reduce it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply referring back to a previous meeting and asking a question.


Passage number 151.
 MR. POTTER.  The balance sheet is $4.27 trillion at par.  While we are investing, it’ll stay around that level. On the path of mortgage-backed securities, as Lorie showed you, it looks as though prepays will be quite high for the next few months.  So that’s going to generate some lower coupons in there, which means that, if the rates eventually firm as we lift off, you might see a very small effect on how quickly the MBS run off.  But that was part of the analysis in that memo:  A lot of getting the balance sheet back to a more normal size depends on the MBS runoff, and there are two factors there. What does the stock of MBS that we’re holding at the moment we stop reinvestment look like.  And what are rates after that. So we’re going to get slightly more lower-coupon MBS from this prepayment increase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is providing information and analysis without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 152.
  MR. FISHER. I do want to urge the Committee again, Madam Chair, to please read that memo, because I thought it was one of the best ones, as I mentioned then, that I’ve read in 10 years at this Committee.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Then we do need a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher is urging the Committee to read a memo, expressing his positive opinion about it. Chair Yellen acknowledges his comment and suggests a vote to ratify domestic open market operations.


Passage number 153.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks. Without objection.  And we’ve agreed that we will postpone a vote on testing until after our next discussion. Okay.  We’re next going to turn to liftoff tools and options, and, before turning it over to Jim for the staff presentation, I want to make a couple of comments myself. First, I’ll say again that, personally, I consider it absolutely critical that, when we announce liftoff, the federal funds rate move into our increased target range in a smooth, efficient, and prompt manner.  Personally, I think we need a very high degree of confidence that our normalization tools, in whatever configuration we settle on, will provide sufficient control over interest rates right out of the gate.  To me, this is the highest priority. Second, our policy tools vary in terms of their benefits, costs, and risks.  So we clearly need to strike the right balance in their use. While we may differ to some degree in weighing these various factors, I believe we’ll be best served by an operational plan that’s relatively simple to implement and communicate.  For liftoff to go smoothly, it seems essential that market participants will need to have a reasonable idea of what types of investment opportunities will be available to them.  Of course, the plan needs to be feasible for the Desk to execute with manageable operational risk.  Third, as noted in the staff memo, the particular choices we make about our tools at the time of liftoff need not constrain us subsequently.  I am quite amenable to temporary alterations in the parameters of our tools, such as the cap on the overnight RRP facility, with the expectation that we will dial back the potential size of the facilities over time as we learn more about what’s needed to put a firm floor under rates once we move away from the zero lower bound.  For example, we could substitute term RRPs outside quarter-ends for reliance on the overnight RRP facility. But with those preliminary comments of my own, I look forward to hearing your views, and I’m next going to turn the floor over to Jim for a presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own personal views and preferences, but there is no indication of any disagreement or debate among the participants.


Passage number 154.
 MR. TARULLO.  Now I will ask the question, and President Rosengren may want to piggyback on this as well.  Jim, getting back to that question that President Rosengren posed earlier, based on what we’ve seen so far and the analysis you’ve been able to do, is there a nontrivial financial-stability benefit of using term RRP as opposed to ON RRP. I’ll provide a little bit of context for that question. I guess I had implicitly assumed, without thinking too much about it, that there was some benefit, if only because there would be a limitation on the ability to rush for the exits from other investments if it was term, as opposed to overnight.  But, further thinking about this matter led me to think that if the terms are short enough to be consistent with SEC rules, then maybe there’s not much benefit after all.  One way or another, as long as we’re providing a lot of absorption capacity, concerns about whether we are creating a new model for money market funds or making it easier for them to do this are what they are.  But maybe it doesn’t make that much difference whether we use more overnight or term. I guess the reason I think this is an important question is, if the answer is, “Yes, there’s not that much difference,” then we can talk about how to minimize financial-stability concerns  with respect to a doubling of ON RRP.  But at least that’s the only thing to be discussed, as opposed to whether we get a lot of benefit through a mix of the two.  I’m sorry, Eric.  Does that fairly capture your point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply posing a question and expressing their own thoughts on the matter.


Passage number 155.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Yes.  Why don’t I do a follow-on after they address your question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is about the speaker suggesting that they will add on more information after addressing a specific question.


Passage number 156.
 MR. TARULLO.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only contains a direct quote from Mr. Tarullo without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 157.
 MR. CLOUSE.  I’ll offer my view, and Lorie and Simon may have others. I should preface my remarks by saying there’s a little bit of murkiness regarding these issues of financial stability, so I should admit that up-front.  As you well know, the financial-stability arguments regarding the overnight reverse repo suggested that there’s an option value associated with it.  In the case when financial markets are upset, investors can run to it because it’s a standing facility—or, more precisely, a standing facility with a cap that binds only in rare circumstances. For term reverse repo, you might argue that it presents somewhat less of a financial-stability risk, because people can’t go to it as readily.  It would be offered only on particular dates, not every day.  Moreover, we’d be fixing the size that we would be auctioning.  In addition, there is an immediate price response.  If a crisis happened to occur on the day on which we were auctioning term reverse repo, that would drive down the rate that we would get on the term reverse repo.  So I certainly wouldn’t argue that it’s devoid of the financial-stability risks of the type we discussed with regard to overnight reverse repo, but I think you could argue that it’s probably somewhat less. There may also be another aspect to it.  This has a little bit of the flavor of the types of arguments that Governor Stein made about a crowding-out effect.  Insofar as you were auctioning term reverse repo on a regular basis and putting some upward pressure on term rates, you might induce some investors, like money funds, not to invest in things that they would flee  from in a crisis. That, at the margin, might also reduce financial-stability risks.  It’s very hard to quantify this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their own view and acknowledges that there may be different opinions from others in the group. They also mention the murkiness of the issues and the difficulty in quantifying certain aspects. However, they do not directly oppose or contradict any other viewpoints.


Passage number 158.
 MR. POTTER.  I think that’s a pretty good summary.  The other, simple part is that the amount of headroom that might be available in the overnight RRP, which is what people have been concerned about, would probably run a little bit lower if we had the term out there because you still have the overnight RRP at the same time.  And the concern most people expressed around this table is just a big rush, around noon sometime, into the overnight RRP.  The idea would be to run with slightly lower headroom, on average, if we have the term than with just the ON RRP by itself.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing the discussion and stating their own opinion on the matter.


Passage number 159.
 MR. TARULLO.  Although this is a slightly different perspective, thinking in terms of stress building as opposed to happening in an instantaneous fashion.  If we’re doing the term RRP, then, as in 2011, when the money market funds began to pull back, they get a couple of weeks to do it. That’s what I was wondering.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It is simply stating a different perspective or idea without conflicting with any previous information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 160.
 MS. LOGAN. To me, the two situations depend entirely on how stable the overnight RRP take-up is.  As an example, if it was completely stable and the headroom didn’t change, then moving some of it to term doesn’t really add any benefit.  If the overnight RRP take-up is very variable and moves around a lot, then moving some of it to term can improve financial stability because that headroom can fluctuate quite a bit.  So I think it depends on your assumption about the stability of the daily take-up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker presents two different situations and states that the benefit of moving some of the overnight RRP take-up to term depends on the stability of the daily take-up. This suggests that there may be different opinions or perspectives on the matter.


Passage number 161.
 MR. TARULLO.  But one thing that seems clear from looking at the tables you attached to this January 22 memo is that it is virtually all about money market funds, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage indicates that there is no contention or disagreement. It states a fact about the content of the attached tables without any indication of differing opinions.


Passage number 162.
  MS. LOGAN.  Well, there’s variability, particularly from the GSEs, which move around a lot because of their payment dates.  But the money funds are fairly stable, except on quarter-end, when you see the prime funds come in and really move around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that there is variability in payment dates for GSEs, but money funds are generally stable, except during quarter-end when prime funds may become more active and fluctuate. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 163.
 MR. TARULLO. Right.  But I’m looking at the darkest-colored portion of the bars, which were the “other.”  Those are pretty small.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In the given passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states a fact or observation about the "darkest-colored portion of the bars" being small.


Passage number 164.
 MS. LOGAN.  But it could change tremendously when we lift off zero, and the dynamics could be very different.  We don’t know how those dynamics will evolve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing the uncertainty of how dynamics will evolve when a change occurs.


Passage number 165.
 MR. TARULLO.  I’m not sure where that leaves me, but thank you. CHAIR YELLEN. President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply includes a brief conversation between Mr. Tarullo and Chair Yellen without any evident contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 166.
 MR. ROSENGREN. To follow up, on your illustrative option 1 on page 2, the second bullet is assuming that the term reverse repo is the preferred way to snug up the rates.  The other option would be that the interest on excess reserves could be raised at that point.  The memo was looking at the spread prior to liftoff, but I’m thinking more in terms of the situation after liftoff.  Rather than using the term, why couldn’t we use IOER if we were finding that it was softer than we expected and make an adjustment at that point.  The memos seem to have a preference for term over adjustments with the IOER.  I just wanted to see if that was accurate or not, because I thought our initial high-level position was that we were going to rely primarily on IOER, and this seems to change that a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker is questioning the preference for using reverse repo as a way to adjust rates and suggesting that using interest on excess reserves (IOER) could be a viable alternative. They are challenging the initial position of relying primarily on IOER and suggesting that the memos have a different preference.


Passage number 167.
 MR. CLOUSE.  No.  I’m sorry if we gave you that impression.  We certainly didn’t mean to suggest that.  We framed these two options because the results are with respect to behavior around the year-end and because of the new potential for possibly some substitution between overnight and reverse repo.  But you’re absolutely right that you would have a number of possible options that you could take after liftoff to snug up rates:  One might be raising the   IOER, another might be raising the overnight RRP rate, and still another might be raising them both. One potential issue you might face that you all have discussed previously relates to the fact that right now, investors seem to anticipate that the IOER would be at the top of the federal funds rate range, and that the overnight RRP rate would be at the bottom of the range.  Most participants seem to have agreed with this, and it’s in the minutes.  So if you’d be moving IOER after liftoff, you would be bumping it up relative to the federal funds target range.  Some people might argue that there could then be some confusion around having multiple rates.  You have a federal funds rate target range and an administered IOER rate that was at 55 basis points instead of 50 basis points, and so there could be a multiplicity of rates there that you might worry about.  But it’s certainly a possibility to do that. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement from Mr. Clouse explaining different options for adjusting rates after liftoff, and Chair Yellen responds by acknowledging this possibility.


Passage number 168.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think there’s another issue, too.  It’s one thing having a system in place that you introduce ex ante, and it works.  It’s another thing having a system that you put in place, and then, ex post, you make adjustments to it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply states that there is another issue to consider.


Passage number 169.
 MR. POTTER.  I think President Rosengren was suggesting that we would stay there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply restating what President Rosengren suggested without expressing any disagreement or conflicting viewpoint.


Passage number 170.
 MR. ROSENGREN. Well—except our rules were focused on the federal funds rate, which wouldn’t have been my preference, actually.  But, given that focus, it seems as though it would be the IOER.  Alternatively, you could have had a strategy in which you set the IOER and didn’t make adjustments with the IOER, but that was not the consensus around the table.  I’m a little puzzled by the discussion.  We’ve said the primary objective is to hit a federal funds rate target in the range, and IOER is our primary tool. So I would have thought, with those two rules, that I would have actually been moving the IOER for a technical adjustment after the fact, if it turned out that we were using reverses more than we expected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren is expressing his personal preference and his confusion about the discussion, but there is no direct disagreement or argument.


Passage number 171.
 MR. POTTER.  Can I add two things.  Because Jim is always saying this to me—that this is what we should be doing.  Two of the issues are, if it’s ex ante, that’s fine.  How would you feel if you just moved up the federal funds rate, and you moved up the federal funds rate so that there’s still quite a big wedge, but you got it just inside the target range.  So you’ve got this big gap there between the interest rate on excess reserves, which is generating income for the banks, and federal funds.  That’s one aspect.  The other one is, we’re not sure how effective it will be on other money market rates.  The normalization principles do start out with that concern with moving up other money market rates.  So there you get a little bit of insurance, on account of the RRPs, that you’re moving up both unsecured and secured rates.  This is a conversation we’ve had many times at this table—about how comfortable you are regarding large spreads between those unsecured and secured rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing different aspects and considerations related to the federal funds rate and money market rates.


Passage number 172.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  But we chose to use the federal funds rate, instead of short-term rates generally, when we did this.  So we did have that debate.  Again, I would have preferred the general level of short-term rates, but that position lost around the table, and we chose the federal funds rate.  The consequence of that action would seem to be that we take no more action even if nothing moves other than the federal funds rate—that was the agreement we made around this table.  Now, we could revisit that.  But as long as we have the same operating rules that we set out initially, it seems as though our target has been that we just have to get the federal funds rate in that range.  If nothing else moves relative to it, that is fine—we’ve done what we said we were going to do. Alternatively, we could go back and say we want to move short-term rates and nothave the federal funds rate be the principal goal.  But that isn’t where we were when we actually agreed to the principles that we’ve set out to date. CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s true.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage describes a debate and a decision made by the group, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states their preference for using a different rate and acknowledges that their position was not chosen.


Passage number 173.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks, Madam Chair.  Jim, I’m trying to figure out something on the possibility of paying interest on a daily basis on whatever is held in the term facility.  Add to that a statement Simon made somewhere, which is that the holders are very anxious to be able to break out of the term facility if they could get that.  Now you’ve got a facility in which you’ve got people receiving the daily rate that we want to hold things more stable, that’s paying, and that’s got some of the funds.  So if there are movements in the daily rate, you may find them breaking unless you have a large penalty associated with going between the two facilities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 174.
 MR. CLOUSE.  Right.  I think you’re speaking of the Term Deposit Facility, with a potential for having a floating rate.  This is actually an issue associated with our plain-vanilla excess reserve calculations, and we apologize for tormenting you with this very technical issue. We pay interest every maintenance period based on the excess reserves as we calculate them over the reserve maintenance period. We have a single rate that we apply against those excess reserves, and that has these funny issues arise when there is an anticipated change in the IOER in the middle of the maintenance period.  We’re stuck with that because, historically, interest on reserves had always been tied to reserve concepts—required reserves and excess reserves.  So, to pull this off—to switch to a system in which we’re paying more on daily balances—we actually have to kick off a rather extensive programming effort in the very near future to make this happen.  That’s one of the reasons why I just obliquely referred to a feasibility study. The proposal that we’re putting forward is only really going to work, probably, for two or three years. It works best when the interest rate on required and excess reserves are the same. Ifthe Committee were to get to a point at which you wanted to, again, make a distinction between the interest rate on required and the interest rate on excess, then there are a number of other tortuous complications that we would have to deal with.  But I think it may be a useful thing to do for two or three years until we get to a bit better place.  So we’re looking at that hard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is an explanation of a technical issue and a potential solution.


Passage number 175.
 MR. POTTER. Was the question whether, if you’re in a TDF and the interest on excess reserve rates goes up, you would want to break it and get into a deposit with the Fed. Was that your question. I think it’s going to float over the IOER rate, so there wouldn’t be an incentive, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is seeking clarification and posing a question for further understanding.


Passage number 176.
 MR. CLOUSE. Well, there might be an incentive—that the breakage fee, of course, on the term deposit is quite rich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 177.
 MR. FISCHER. The point I wanted to make is that, if you give them the right to—let’s say at no charge—get out of the term repo, then it’s just a repo with an option.  The bottom line was, there are thousands of programs in which you get paid daily interest, and what you describe is a major programming effort.  I’m surprised that that’s a major programming effort.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents a statement and the speaker expresses surprise at the programming effort required. There is no conflicting viewpoint expressed.


Passage number 178.
 MR. CLOUSE. There are many surprising things about our reserve calculations.  [Laughter]  The issue is that we collect huge amounts of data from thousands of depository institutions.  There are hundreds of thousands of lines of code in this program, and it’s never as easy as you think it should be.  But, having said all of that, we think we can accomplish it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is describing the challenges and complexities involved in reserve calculations, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 179.
 MR. FISCHER. The other thing is, you can’t get rid of the anticipatory effects.  In any case, if people start expecting rates to go up, you’re going to get those things happening in whatever system you’ve got.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, Mr. Fischer is presenting a statement that seems to be a general observation. He states that anticipatory effects cannot be eliminated and that if people start expecting rates to go up, certain consequences will occur regardless of the system in place. There is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 180.
 MR. CLOUSE. That’s right, but I think this would help because, on each day under this scheme, a bank, if it wants to hold an extra dollar of reserves, wouldn’t be considering the ratethat would be in effect at the end of the period or the average rate over the period.  It would be considering the IOER rate that had been set for that day, and that seems like the right concept that you want to have when you’re controlling the federal funds rate on a daily basis.  So that’s the direction in which the staff is leaning right now, but we have some work to do before we can pull that off. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Clouse, states his opinion and suggests a possible solution to a problem. Chair Yellen, in response, does not express disagreement or contention but acknowledges his point of view.


Passage number 181.
 MS. BRAINARD.  I had a quick question of clarification on this.  I think you mentioned in passing that, in 2008, you solved the reverse problem by just doing the minimum over the time period.  Why did you choose to go to the end of the period as one of your options here, rather than just doing the maximum.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a question about a specific choice made by the speaker and seeking clarification on the reasoning behind that choice.


Passage number 182.
 MR. CLOUSE.  Well, in effect, it’s the same thing.  I thought the end of the maintenance period, actually, was a clever idea.  Then you don’t have to specify it as the maximum or the minimum—it’s just the one at the end.  But the idea there is that, during normalization, most of the rate changes would be increases, so the pressure you would see would be primarily in the first week of the maintenance period for any of these cases in which the FOMC meeting was in the middle of the period. But then, after the FOMC meeting happened, we’d have the full power of the IOER rate-change supporting the level of the federal funds rate.  That was one of the things we discussed in the memo, and it is sort of the symmetric treatment of the way we handled things in 2008.  But I think this third option actually may be a bit better. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of one person expressing their thoughts and ideas.


Passage number 183.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Jim, is the staff’s preference now the third option.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 184.
 MR. CLOUSE.  That’s where we’re leaning at the moment. We have to do some more analysis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their current decision and mentioning that more analysis needs to be done.


Passage number 185.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. When I read the memo, it sounded as though you were favoring the interest rate paid at the end of the reserve maintenance period.  That has the problem that it’s going to cause pressure on expectations that could create a lot of noise, especially as you’re going into liftoff, and it seems as though that’s not such an attractive option.  But you haven’t posed in the questions what kind of feedback you want from us on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing an interpretation of a memo and posing questions for clarification.


Passage number 186.
 MR. CLOUSE. At this stage, we would intend to do some more spade work ourselves and then report back to you, either in the form of a memo or perhaps at a future meeting.  We knew there was going to be a heavy lift to do the reprogramming.  We had thought about this for a while, but we’ve done some more pushing, and we think we could actually get it done by June if everything goes right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the intentions and plans of Mr. Clouse and his team to do some additional work and provide a report in the future. There is no conflicting perspective or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 187.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Okay. My own personal preference is, I don’t like the end of the reserve maintenance period, because I think it’s going to just create noise.  We’re doing all of these things to try to prevent noise.  So it seems to me as though this is another area in which you want to try to reduce the level of noise. CHAIR YELLEN.  This requires a big effort.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal preference and suggesting a potential solution to reduce noise. Chair Yellen's response is not mentioned.


Passage number 188.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I know.  So I encourage you.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence "I know. So I encourage you. [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN. President Lacker" does not show any explicit disagreement or contention.


Passage number 189.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I commend you for exploring this third option.  When I read the memo, that was the logical way to do it, and I was wondering why it was absent.  So I’m glad you guys have dug in and have found that a little more feasible. I would just point out that, in the period from 2004 to 2006, when we were raising rates—and I know this was a different world—we had a series of meetings at which it was almost certain, just a lock in markets, that we were going to raise rates a quarter point at the next  meeting.  Then we got upward pressure on the funds rate within the maintenance period a week ahead.  Again, it wasn’t viewed as highly problematic for our conduct of monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is expressing agreement and support for exploring a third option and commending the authors for their findings. He then goes on to share a personal experience related to the topic being discussed.


Passage number 190.
 MR. CLOUSE. That’s in the spirit of our recommendations for the maximum or the end-of-period options.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement made by Mr. Clouse about the spirit of their recommendations for maximum or end-of-period options.


Passage number 191.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  You’d get the same pressure ahead of time, but now it’s just part of market expectations because of the ability to arbitrage within the maintenance period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no direct contention or disagreement expressed in the passage. The speaker is simply describing a situation and stating a fact.


Passage number 192.
 MR. CLOUSE. One of the things that started to give us pause, though, was the possibility that the Committee might choose to raise rates a bit more than 25 basis points— 50 basis points or 75 basis points.  Then, when you roll into that maintenance period, you could really see quite substantive pressures on the funds rate in advance of that meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the possibility of the Committee choosing to raise rates more than 25 basis points, which could result in substantive pressures on the funds rate. There is no conflicting viewpoint or disagreement being presented.


Passage number 193.
 MR. LACKER. But you’d be seeing pressure all along the curve at any rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply stating a fact.


Passage number 194.
 MR. POTTER. One difference is, we had a point target, and there was some variation in that point target.  Right now, it looks as though we’re going to have a range.  That’s what the normalization principles say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a difference in targets and mentioning the normalization principles.


Passage number 195.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I know.  But this is about IOER, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply acknowledging that they understand the topic of discussion is about IOER (Interest on Excess Reserves).


Passage number 196.
 MR. POTTER.  I’m talking about the federal funds rate.  The pressure could be reflected in the federal funds market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states a fact about the potential reflection of pressure in the federal funds market. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 197.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting or opposing statements. It simply states Mr. Lacker's response without any indication of disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 198.
 MR. POTTER. If the federal funds rate goes above 25 basis points, the directive says that the Desk has to take actions once that point is reached to try to push the federal funds rate back.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In the passage, MR. POTTER states that if the federal funds rate goes above 25 basis points, the directive requires the Desk to take actions to push the rate back. This implies that there is a disagreement or contention about whether or not the Desk should take action at that point.


Passage number 199.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, but the same thing was true back then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Lacker agrees with the statement mentioned previously.


Passage number 200.
MR. POTTER.  I agree, but that was a point target.  Even though we’re pretty good at hitting it each day, we’re allowed some variation.  The spectacle of going outside the target range is a little bit different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement and understanding, acknowledging that hitting the target consistently is difficult and allows for some variation.


Passage number 201.
 MR. LACKER.  You don’t think we’d think the same way about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 202.
 MR. POTTER.  I don’t know how you’d feel if it was trading at 35 basis points.  Would you be okay if was trading at 35.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement followed by a question regarding someone's feelings about a specific trading point.


Passage number 203.
 MR. LACKER. Well, yes—if it’s for the same reasons and of the same magnitude as we got in 2005. It makes perfect sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 204.
 MR. POTTER. And the Committee has told us that you’re going to raise rates—that’s why we’re not doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there is contention or disagreement as the Committee believes that the rates will be raised, while Mr. Potter is expressing the reason why they are not being raised.


Passage number 205.
 MR. LACKER.  If it’s the first half of the maintenance period, before an FOMC meeting at which we’re widely expected to increase the IOER by 25 basis points, and the funds rate trades 5 or 10 basis points above range, personally, for me, I’ll pledge to forgive you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Lacker is discussing his personal commitment to forgive someone if certain conditions are met.


Passage number 206.
  [Laughter] MR. POTTER.  All right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It merely states that someone named Mr. Potter said "All right" after some laughter.


Passage number 207.
 MR. LACKER. Just as I did in 2005.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement made by Mr. Lacker.


Passage number 208.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. President Lacker, it puts the Desk in a difficult position, because they don’t yet know the outcome of the meeting.  The funds rate is trading firm relative to the target, and the Desk is supposed to keep it in the range.  They don’t know what the meeting decision is going to be.  Just because it’s priced in to some degree doesn’t mean that the Committee is actually going to do it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is providing information and stating that the Desk is in a difficult position because they do not know the outcome of the meeting.


Passage number 209.
 MR. LACKER. We faced the same problem in 2005—it was fine.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is stating a fact without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 210.
 MR. POTTER. We did.  But we’re saying it could be larger this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter states that "we did" and then adds that "it could be larger this time." This statement is simply adding more information or possibilities to the conversation, without any indication of disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 211.
  MR. FISHER. So then you define your tolerance levels.  I’ll come back to this, Madam Chair, in my comments. CHAIR YELLEN. Okay.  Any further comments.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It consists of a conversation between Mr. Fisher, Chair Yellen, and President Kocherlakota, where they are discussing tolerance levels.


Passage number 212.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thanks, Madam Chair.  This is an idea I have not thought through carefully, and I offer it with that caveat. As I listened to some of the comments that President Plosser made and as I heard you express your own desire, Madam Chair, to have, quite naturally, a great deal of confidence about interest rate control, especially at the time of liftoff, I bring up the following possibility:  The timing of the decision by the Committee may not necessarily be the same as the timing of the first move in interest rates. For example, in June, there’s a decision by the Committee that they want to raise interest rates.  But, at the time that’s announced, the statement reads “as of July 2”—I’m making this up—after quarter-end, basically.  “As of July 2” is when the move in the federal funds rate will take place. This would pass you through the quarter-end.  You could time it to deal with all of the maintenance-period stuff that Jim has talked through.  So you could pick your day.  As opposed to timing an interest rate increase on the Wednesday after the meeting, you instead announce in your statement, “Here’s the day it’s going to be coming,” and you’ve chosen it so that you get around all of these problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 213.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The problem, I think, with doing that is, it raises all of these questions about, “Why are you doing it that way.  Is there some problem that you have that you can’t do it the normal way.”  I agree you could do it that way, but it would raise a lot of questions. CHAIR YELLEN. Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the previous statement and emphasizes their agreement by using the word "absolutely".


Passage number 214.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. The answer to those questions is that we don’t want to conflate the issues of quarter-end pressures with our interest rate increase.  Anyway, if that’s the only issue, I think that can be talked through.  I was more concerned about technical issues that the staff would be much more in a position to address.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and concerns, but there is no indication of any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 215.
 MR. POTTER.  But there are many central banks that operate that way. The Swiss announced the change in their policy rates about six weeks in advance of actually executing them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: This passage does not show any form of contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the Swiss central bank's policy announcement.


Passage number 216.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Well, not all of their policy changes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that not all of their policy changes were made.


Passage number 217.
  [Laughter] MR. POTTER.  I was going to use that as an example of how sometimes that’s not the best environment to be in.  The Swiss had a very large effect on global financial markets.  The Federal Reserve can have an effect on global financial markets much larger than that.  Trying to explain this to international investors in a simple-to-communicate version of why we’re doing that would be difficult, because it would suggest we might be a little bit scared that we can’t actually raise rates before the quarter-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses difficulty in explaining why they are trying to communicate the reasons for their actions to international investors.


Passage number 218.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No—that’s fine. CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions. [No response]  Okay.  My suggestion is that we take a lunch break.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage indicates that there is no contention or disagreement as there are no questions or responses from anyone.


Passage number 219.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: Based on the provided information alone, there is no indication of contention or disagreement. The word "yes" could simply be a response to a question or statement.


Passage number 220.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is not enough information provided in the passage to indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 221.
 WILLIAMS.  A breakfast break for me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a statement of someone taking a breakfast break.


Passage number 222.
 MS. BRAINARD. We can all second that. CHAIR YELLEN.  And then we will start the go-round on liftoff tools. [Lunch recess]  CHAIR YELLEN.  We have a lot to do this afternoon.  Right now we’re going to have a full go-round on liftoff tools and possible liftoff options.  And to start us off, President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individuals mentioned seem to be in agreement and there is no indication of conflicting opinions.


Passage number 223.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I prefer option 1 in the memo on illustrative approaches.  I agree with you, Madam Chair, that when the time comes to raise rates, it’s important that we maintain as much monetary control as possible with regard to market rates. The test conducted so far suggests that the ON RRP facility is effective in providing a floor for market rates.  The temporary increase in the aggregate cap would strengthen that floor and give market participants some headroom.  I also support continued testing, as the Desk has proposed.  I guess we still have that on the agenda to deal with.  I’m not as concerned about the financial stability implications of such an action as I was in our earlier discussions. I had some more comments, but in the interest of time, I’m going to try to keep this short.  If needed, we can bring the term operations into play after liftoff, but the relative operational and interest cost complexity of the term tools make them better suited for the second line of defense. We should continue to test the term tools as part of an effective risk-management program, but at this time I don’t see the need to deploy them before liftoff.  That said, I’m open to option 2 if the consensus prefers that route.  The alternatives that make small adjustments to the administered rates can also be used if needed, but the proposed changes by themselves might not be sufficient to pull market rates up. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses their preference for option 1, agrees with the Chair's opinion on maintaining monetary control, supports the testing of the ON RRP facility, and states they are open to option 2 if that is the consensus. There is no indication of disagreement or conflict.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 224.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think we should be confident that increasing the IOER is going to result in a sufficiently smooth rise in short-term market rates when we raise the target range for the funds rate.  That’s my reading of the wide evidence we’ve gotten from the Desk operations and everything we’ve done so far.  I think we should stick withour plan to use the overnight RRP program as insurance only against the possibility that there’s more slack, perhaps, in the relationship between IOER and market rates than we’ve seen at any time over the past six years. Using it as a backstop means a relatively wide spread to IOER, so I support the staff’s proposed spread of 25 basis points.  It’s wider than anything we’ve tested so far and, apart from quarter-ends, take-up has not exceeded $300 billion.  With a 25 basis point spread, I’d expect significantly smaller take-up.  But in any event, I’d be comfortable with a large cap at a 25 basis point spread.  So, $600 billion is the size suggested in option 1.  I wouldn’t be against $800 billion or $1 trillion, just to be sure.  With such a large cap and a 25 basis point spread, I think we could be very confident that rates will be in that corridor.  I think we should just make the cap temporarily as large as it needs to be for us to be comfortable that we’re going to be in that corridor.  I think that’s the way to solve our problems. We’re going to have volatility.  We could well have volatility on quarter-ends.  We always have had volatility on quarter-ends, and there probably always will.  The Desk has historically taken measures over quarter-end, back when we were in the old regime, to try to anticipate the shift in demand for reserves and to counteract that, but everyone recognized that that was a much more uncertain endeavor than off quarter-ends.  So markets realized that volatility—sort of the forecast error of the funds rate—was going to be exceptionally large over quarter-ends and recognized that it didn’t pose a fundamental problem for monetary policy effectiveness.  And I think that’s going to be the case now, even though quarter-end comes a week after one potential prominent liftoff date. On the strictly macroeconomic side of thinking about liftoff, I agree with others who made the argument that the path for the policy rate we take over time is going to be moreimportant than a particular date at which start raising rates.  For interest rate volatility, I think the behavior that interest rates display over the course of the month after liftoff is going to be much more consequential than what happens on the last day of June, if that’s when we choose to lift off.  So I don’t think one day’s movement a couple of days after our liftoff should concern you. I think simplicity is a virtue, and, as I said, it is clear we can implement monetary policy without a term RRP program.  I think a term program might be tricky to introduce before a liftoff meeting without tipping our hand or signaling.  I think that’s a delicate problem, but I suppose we could probably figure out a way to do that.  I don’t think the alternative of making the program available now on a continuous basis is attractive because it would further encourage markets to believe that our whole RRP machinery, overnight and term, is more of a permanent feature of the financial landscape than I think we’re intending. And as I said earlier, we face this tension between expectations getting out of control and wanting to learn some things, and I think we’ve learned what we need to learn. It’s pretty clear that the pressure on rates going into quarter-end is related to the probability that the overnight facility caps out at quarter-end and rates get driven down.  With a large enough cap, that concern should be minimal, and we’re not likely to get any of the downward pressure leading into quarter-end that motivated the term RRP; the staff recognized this before we did the tests over the year-end.  So in the arguments made—why not use the tool just in case, kind of a belt-and-suspenders approach—I think we see and have seen that our rolling out of facilities like this on a sustained basis builds a constituency.  Building a constituency for a program makes it difficult or costly for us to contemplate pulling back, and I think we’ve seen that in the primary dealer survey data that I talked about. So I would favor option 1, and I’d be opposed to any further testing of term RRPs now.  I think we know enough about how they work.  I think rolling them out, if it seems warranted, in the weeks after we raise rates is the way to keep that extra capability in reserve.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, is expressing his support for sticking with the plan to use the overnight RRP program as insurance, while also suggesting larger cap options for the program. He also expresses opposition to further testing of term RRPs. This goes against any potential argument for not using the program or for further testing.


Passage number 225.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Raising rates as announced at the time of liftoff is essential for maintaining our credibility.  In particular, quickly moving the federal funds rate into the range we announce should be our primary operational goal at liftoff. To enforce the range we set, we need to guarantee a floor.  If we are using the reverse repo facility to set the floor price, we need to be flexible on the quantity of reverse repos.  Hence, setting the floor may require the forceful use of our tools at the time of liftoff.  It is likely that the more vigorous use of the reverse repo facility will be temporary, so we should be able to quickly reduce it as we better understand the factors that influence the spread between the IOER and the reverse repo rates. To avoid disruption to financial markets, we should announce our intention to use the reverse repo facility as a temporary measure to ensure a smooth liftoff.  Assuming that we announce a target range of 25 to 50 basis points at liftoff, I would set the IOER at a level where we can expect to achieve at least the 25 basis point floor with our usual reverse repo cap.  However, I would announce no reverse repo cap at first in order to allow the overnight reverse repo to enforce the floor, should our estimates prove wrong.  We have a lot to learn about managing the federal funds rate using a method that we have not used before.  We could then make a technical correction of the IOER, if needed, to maintain the federal funds rate within the 25 to 50 basis point range without needing to rely so heavily on overnight reverse repos. Removing the reverse repo cap during the time of liftoff would convincingly convey our commitment to raise rates, possibly requiring less use of reverse repos. Two financial-stability concerns about the reverse repo facility have been raised.  The first is that use of the facility could alter the structure of the money markets.  Announcing the temporary nature of the program should lower this risk.  By keeping the window short when we lift off and making appropriate adjustments without delay, it should be clear through our actions that our thinking on permanence has not changed.  The other financial stability concern is the possible flight to the facility during times of severe stress.  However, if there is a significant negative shock that results in a substantial flight of funds to the reverse repo program, the appropriate response would be to postpone liftoff until the effects of the negative shock were better understood. Allowing for a significant temporary increase in the overnight reverse repo facility would be advisable.  I would go one step further and announce no path at the time of liftoff.  In terms of part b of that question, if the Committee is willing to have no reverse repo cap at liftoff, term reverse repos would not be necessary.  The lower the cap, the more we need to use term repos. I would note that I do not see a financial-stability preference for term reverse repos over overnight reverse repos.  Term reverse repos would also likely be transacted primarily with money market funds.  They do expand our footprint, and they lock us into longer periods than may be advisable. They will also be more expensive than overnight reverse repos.  The memos seem to imply that caps supplemented with term reverse repos will result in a lower risk of financial stability than a program with only overnight reverse repos.  I’d like to understand this argument better.  Finally, the strategy of using term reverse repos prior to liftoff as a way of smoothing the withdrawal of reserves seems like an unusual strategy, because the higher rate announced on term reverse repos would, in effect, be the action of lifting off. In terms of part c of the question, if the Committee is willing to proceed without a cap at the outset, then there is not much advantage to making other adjustments.  In contrast, if we are going to cap the reverse repo at liftoff, we will need to make flexible use of term reverse repos. However, because I do not find the financial-stability concerns significantly reduced by lengthening the maturity of reverse repos, and because they are more costly, using term reverse repos to enable arbitrarily limiting the cap on overnight reverse repos seems suboptimal.  I do not see much benefit in narrowing the IOER–reverse repo spread or using term deposits, at least until we have obtained a better sense of the effectiveness of our initial move to liftoff. One final point.  There has not been much discussion of how international flows would affect our liftoff.  With bank reserves in many countries receiving a negative interest rate, announcing an increase in our overnight risk-free rates may make reverse repos very attractive to foreign capital.  Better understanding that dynamic would be useful.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker is presenting their own views and opinions on the use of the reverse repo facility and other strategies for managing the federal funds rate, but there is no direct disagreement with any other perspectives.


Passage number 226.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I am prepared to support the use, at liftoff, of an expanded reverse repo program to add some insurance.  I expect later today to vote to authorize quarter-end reverse repo testing, indicating—and I’m generally supportive of continuing to investigate the potential of this tool for use during and after liftoff, and that would include staff development of proposals for design and implementation of continuing term repo operations. When we first discussed the overnight reverse repo proposal at the July meeting, I had more confidence than some others in the power of the interest on excess reserves as a tool ofmonetary control, much like President Lacker’s sentiments. The consensus of the Committee has gravitated to the view that a smooth liftoff is paramount, and I accept that and I consider that to be the starting point for discussion of the questions presented for this round.  All things considered, for planning purposes, I think smooth-liftoff considerations trump more speculative concerns about financial stability at the point of implementation of the liftoff decision and the near-term aftermath.  As a practical matter, financial stability concerns are not likely to be center stage at the time we would choose to lift off.  Today I am reacting to the questions posed to this go-round in general terms without stating definite preferences regarding configuration details.  I want to hear the discussion, but there is a context in my mind for detailed decisions that needs to be fleshed out.  Specifically, I would appreciate hearing more about an exit plan for the reverse repo tool.  This would address both the need for reverse repo programs as normalization proceeds and the potential methods of phasing out the programs.  At the back of my mind is the concern that once liftoff has been accomplished with a facility larger, say, than the current $300 billion, it will be difficult to argue that continuing with a large program is not required for exactly the reasons we are considering a larger program now, and that is uncertainty about monetary control with a smaller program. On the question of other possible adjustments, again, I’d like to hear more discussion, and I could get more comfortable, but at this point I’m disinclined to favor using spread tightening and relative range adjustments unless clearly needed to correct a situation of demonstrated inadequate control.  I also think this type of tactical option has to be looked at in light of exit ease or difficulty.So if I had my druthers, I would use the March meeting to refine and come to closure on the detailed implementation plan and the guidelines for the use of tools informed by more thinking on how reverse repo programs would ultimately be phased out.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their support for certain actions and expressing their preferences and concerns in a thoughtful manner.


Passage number 227.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think it’s very important that at liftoff we demonstrate that we have the necessary tools to move short-term interest rates up and into our target range. Unlike some of the speakers so far, I have a slight preference for using the term RRPs in conjunction with the overnight RRPs rather than raising the size of the overnight facility too high.  At the margin, I prefer a smaller facility to help limit risk to financial stability, and I guess I see the term RRPs as having slightly less risk in that respect.  The memo lays out some caveats about term RRPs, but I think additional tests at the end of March should help alleviate concerns that they are more complicated to implement.  I would have some misgivings about extending testing too far into the quarter, though, because I think there is going to be an interaction between our testing schedule and inferences about liftoff.  But other than that, I think testing will help. Despite my slight preference for option 2, if the Committee, on the advice of the Desk, thought it better to rely more heavily on overnight RRPs, option 1 in the memo, I would support it.  In this case, it would be important to be clear that the increase in size was not expected to be permanent and that its purpose was to help ensure a smooth liftoff.  Our communications should remain consistent with our normalization principles, which say we intend to phase out the facility, so that market participants don’t establish longer-term business strategies that rely on the facility. The testing to date has provided some good information suggesting that a $600 billion combined capacity of term and overnight RRPs may give us enough control of interest rates.  But I think we need to remember that what works in a testing environment may not work as well in production.  We need to be prepared to make necessary adjustments along the way and be open to using different combinations of our tools.  We might decide we prefer heavier use of term RRPs rather than an even larger overnight facility. We are going to gain information as we begin liftoff.  I wouldn’t rule out dynamic caps on overnight RRPs, narrowing the spread between the IOER and the overnight RRP rate, or using term deposits, although I don’t see a need to start there. No matter what approach we take, the communication explaining what we’re doing and why we’re doing it is going to be, perhaps, nearly as important as the actual approach.  We should give the markets and the public an outline of the approach we’re using, but be clear that some things are unknowable in advance and that aspects may very well need to be adjusted as we go. We said this in our normalization principles, and it is probably worth reiterating at liftoff. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MS. MESTER is expressing her personal preference for using term RRPs and smaller facilities, but she also states that she would support the Committee's decision if they choose to rely more heavily on overnight RRPs. She also emphasizes the importance of communication and being open to making adjustments as necessary.


Passage number 228.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  A smooth liftoff is desirable for establishing confidence in the ability of the FOMC to normalize the conduct of monetary policy.  I think we all agree with that.  By smooth, I mean a liftoff in which the funds rate trades somewhere between IOER and the ON RRP rate on a fairly consistent basis.  That does not mean every moment of every day.  Whether those trades are near the midpoint or not of the range is also not important, as far as I’m concerned, and we should not suggest that that’s part of our objective.  In this regard, I would be comfortable starting off with a somewhat generous cap and a spread of  basis points between the IOER rate and the ON RRP. However, I also would be comfortable with a smaller cap and a larger spread or range. This is a tradeoff along these dimensions of program design that really exists, but it depends on the Committee’s tolerance for volatility of the effective funds rate. I probably have a greater tolerance for that volatility than some in this regard, but I think it’s a discussion worth continuing to have. Regarding cap size, research done by my staff indicates that the $400 billion cap would probably be sufficient.  As rates rise, the federal funds market should be able to absorb a substantial portion of any increase in the supply of funds.  I would also note that in our experiments to date, even at the quarter-ends, the $400 billion cap has been pretty close to being sufficient, and those are pretty good experiments.  But I also wouldn’t mind a $600 billion cap.  However, accompanying the announcement of whatever the size of our cap is, I believe it is crucial for us to reemphasize that the ON RRP facility is intended to be temporary and that we will reduce its size if circumstances allow.  Indeed, perhaps by starting with the somewhat larger cap, say the $600 billion, like in option 1, we could get through quarter-end in June, and maybe for a few weeks, and then actually announce that it’s going to be smaller because it doesn’t need to be.  And so that first directional change in the size of the cap might be useful and important to get us started and to signal to the market that we really do intend to shrink this facility. I also agree with the Chair that we should keep things as simple as possible.  In particular, operating with two instruments, the IOER and the ON RRP, should be sufficient for normalization.  I’m leery of the complexity of other policy tools, particularly the term RRPs. Term RRPs have more moving parts; we are less certain of their effectiveness and the substitutability they have with the overnight RRPs.  I do not favor us getting into the business of complicated financial engineering.  Too many policy tools that operate along too many different   margins are liable to confuse us as well as the markets, with relatively little benefit.  Dealing with more margins also opens the door for a wide range of unintended consequences when it comes to the longer-term ramifications for market structure, something this Committee has expressed concern about. While I could imagine a term RRP facility that would primarily serve to help smooth window-dressing-induced funds volatility at the end of quarters, I’m dubious of this benefit and would be inclined to oppose it.  In other words, doing something separate at the end of quarters seems to me to draw attention to it rather than just making the cap on overnight RRPs large enough to accommodate at least in the first instance.  This type of year-end or quarter-end volatility is self-induced by reporting practices and the efforts of firms to report balance sheets that may not truly be representative of their average positions.  I see no reason for us to care or to be complicit in subsidizing this behavior.  Let the firms pay the price for this practice if they are inclined to do so.  It is unlikely to have any material effect on macroeconomic performance or our goals and objectives.  It is just too transitory.  It would serve us well at the outset to be explicit about this perspective up front to avoid having market participants expect us to intervene on these occasions.  And once we set up separate term RRPs just for the quarter-end—once we do that once—the expectation is going to be set and it’s going to be hard to unwind from that.  More generally, I’m simply not concerned about infrequent or occasional volatility that leads the funds rate to trade above or below our target range. We were asked about what things could help during this normalization.  I would remind us that we are facing these operational issues surrounding liftoff because we have a very large balance sheet. In view of the uncertainty we face going forward during normalization, I think it would be helpful if we would begin reducing the size of the balance sheet and, thus, the quantity   of excess reserves that we have to deal with in these circumstances.  We could easily begin by immediately ceasing to reinvest maturing principal payments.  And as we saw in the Desk report, the prospects for ever-larger purchases of MBS just to solve our reinvestment problem is going to get bigger rather than smaller over time.  So I see now might be a good time to stop that, so that we don’t have to intervene even more.  I see very little cost or risk in taking such a step.  The sooner we start, the sooner we’ll arrive at a situation in which we can start reducing the size of the ON RRP facility and return to business as usual.  Only then will we achieve full normalization.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, expresses his opinions and preferences regarding the design and implementation of monetary policy tools, but there is no explicit disagreement with other participants in the discussion.


Passage number 229.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have three remarks and a general conclusion.  The general conclusion is that I support the use of a temporarily larger cap on the overnight reverse repo program at the time of liftoff, along the lines of option 1.  I also support the use of term repos in sizes viewed as helpful during this period.  My three remarks concern the following areas.  One, the likely timing and source of possible market volatility impinging on federal funds rate control.  Two, the risk of financial instability associated with a larger overnight reverse repo program than presently contemplated.  And, three, the size of the Federal Reserve footprint in financial markets. Considering the first area, the likely timing and source of possible market volatility, the memoranda for this meeting touching on this subject seemed to suggest that the date of liftoff is special with respect to the possible implications for market volatility, and, therefore, for control of the federal funds rate. It is possible, however, that market volatility may not be especially high at liftoff versus other times. This may be especially true if we telegraph our date of liftoff fairly accurately, as we seem destined to do.  The memo on initialization of normalization cycles   in foreign countries suggested that the liftoff itself was often not a moment of confusion and volatility in financial markets, but that when such moments occurred they were often at some other critical juncture in the normalization process. Indeed, financial market volatility is more likely to be caused by a violent reconciliation of a mismatch between financial market expectations of monetary policy and Committee intentions. We have a grand example of such a reconciliation in the so-called taper tantrum during the summer of 2013.  That episode did not involve raising rates, nor did it even involve any actual change in the pace of excess purchases.  We do have considerable mismatch today, arguably, based on differences in the Committee intentions as suggested by the SEP versus market expectations as suggested by futures markets trading, as outlined in the staff memo relating to this subject. When and how this mismatch will be resolved remains an open question at this point, but potentially any reconciliation could involve substantial market volatility and could occur at a point in the normalization cycle other than the liftoff date itself. These considerations suggest that use of a higher cap or other method to mitigate any risk should not be confined only to the time period around liftoff.  For this reason, I would advocate expanding the notion of “temporary” to include most of the normalization period and not just the time around liftoff. The second area I wish to address is the nexus between the size of the overnight reverse repo program and the risks of financial instability.  In discussions with my staff, I have concluded that I simply do not think we have a credible and compelling story concerning the nature of this risk sufficient to suggest that a $600 billion program is more risky than a $300 billion program in a meaningful way.  For this reason, I lean toward a larger program and the tangible benefits that that may bring with respect to our normalization policy. The third area I wanted to comment on concerns the Federal Reserve’s footprint in financial markets, which some wish to keep to a minimum.   Normally, I would find this a reasonable goal, but in the current situation I think we are already such a large player in financial markets that we may be better advised to manage our risk carefully rather than to try to keep our interventions to a minimum.  For this reason, I again come down on the side of using available tools to our advantage in securing a successful liftoff.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.

Passage number 230.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As I weigh these issues, I view a lack of control over short-term rates at liftoff as an unlikely but a very costly event and one to be avoided.  So I, too, favor option 1, as outlined by the staff.  The testing experience of the overnight RRP and our communication of policy normalization principles and plans give me confidence that the overnight RRP, on a temporary basis, can be an effective way to support rates at liftoff, if necessary, but also to temper the financial stability issues associated with its use. If needed, I would also support the use of term RRPs after liftoff to ensure the funds rate trades in our targeted range. In terms of the other possible adjustments that were outlined in the memo, I support maintaining a wide spread between IOER and the ON RRP rate, along with a sufficiently large cap that rarely binds, as well as using term deposits.  I’d prefer keeping the option of adjusting the IOER and the ON RRP band or narrowing the spread between these two rates.  This approach is to be used only after liftoff and only in the event that the federal funds rate fails to trade within our targeted range.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. George expresses support for option 1 and the use of various tools to control short-term rates. She also expresses willingness to adjust certain rates if necessary after liftoff. President Williams does not respond in the passage, so there is no indication of disagreement.

Explanation: The passage is not expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 232.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  To best achieve our mandated goals, it is crucial that we’re able to maintain effective monetary control at the time of liftoff and throughout the normalization process.  Equally important, we must leave no doubt in the public’s mind that we have effective control over interest rates during this period when all eyes will be on the Federal Reserve.  I’ve been taking notes to see if I’ve got the whole list right, but basically my remaining comments echo very much those of Presidents Evans, Lacker, Rosengren, and Bullard, which is for sure the first time I’ve ever said that.  [Laughter] And President George, too, actually. Our communications regarding policy normalization or testing of different facilities have helped prepare market participants.  We’ve consistently assured the public that we have the tools to raise rates when needed.  We’ve explained the broad outlines of how we will use these tools.  In looking ahead, we really need to minimize the risk of any missteps coming out of the gate that could raise concerns about the effectiveness of our tools to keep the funds rate in its target range.  Indeed, demonstrating monetary control when we start normalization will increase market confidence in our ability to steer the economy, reduce market volatility, and facilitate the pursuit of our objectives.  And I view the approach described in option 1 as most likely to achieve this outcome. I want to remind everyone that we made clear in our policy principles and plans back in September that we will primarily use the IOER rate to move the federal funds rate into the relative target range, and the overnight reverse repo facility supplements it as needed to increase monetary control.  Importantly, we also indicated that the reverse repo facility will be phased out when it’s no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.  So we’ve already told everybody that this will be temporary and will only be used as needed.  I therefore view option 1  as entirely consistent with the strategy that we’ve laid out.  It keeps the approach as clear and simple as possible. And one issue, of course, is the size of the cap on the repo facility, and I, like many of the others, have difficulty in saying, you know, it’s $400, $600, $800, $1 trillion. What are the costs in terms of financial stability and the benefits there. I think it’s really impossible to judge ex ante the optimal size of the facility and the tradeoffs between financial stability, footprint issues, and effectiveness.  Now, I do think that the analysis that’s been done so far suggests that what is really important is that we have sufficient headroom for this to be effective, and in my own view it would be prudent to set a cap that’s significantly high.  I thought the $600 billion would be viewed by this group as already pretty high, but clearly people have suggested even higher might be optimal. And I’m going to make kind of a nuanced point.  I don’t see this as raising the cap—and this actually gets back to President Lacker’s point earlier.  When we did the testing of $300 billion, that was clearly stated not to be our policy decision of how big the overnight reverse repo facility was going to be.  This is not raising it from $300 billion to $600 billion.  This is just setting what it will be initially, whatever that number is.  So I would prefer not to communicate this as saying that we’re raising this in some way. We’re setting the cap at the level that is the most appropriate to achieve monetary control, and, of course, as time goes on and we learn more, we can reduce the cap as appropriate.  And, again, I don’t see the risk to financial stability or regarding footprint issues to be that significant.  This is a temporary program.  We’ve indicated that, and we will reduce it and phase it out as appropriate. I’m confident that, under option 1, we have the necessary tools to maintain monetary control during the normalization period.  I really think that this is an appropriate option when   viewed in terms of our basic strategy.  It’s simple, and I think it follows the plans and principles we laid out. On the other issues, in terms of spreads, I agree, like others, that with a wide spread initially, as we discussed, I would only see adjusting the spread of the IOER and the overnight reverse repo rates as something you would only do if it was necessary, if the other tools that we were using weren’t working.  I see the TDF as always a backup facility—again, there to support if needed. In terms of testing the term reverse repo facility, I am in favor of continuing the test for March. I think that there is an open question about the value of further testing of a daily or a regular term reverse repo facility as, again, another backstop.  So we’re now talking about belts and suspenders, more belts, more suspenders.  I do think if you were to test it too extensively, it would lead people to think this is something we were going to use, and something to think about, although I don’t see any problems with the testing around the quarter-end because I think that, to me, would be limited.  I do think I’m not opposed to the further testing of the term reverse repo, but again, I think it just creates some additional communication challenges for us.  I think IOER is our first line of defense.  Overnight reverse repo with a sizable cap is the support, and then we have these other tools behind.  It is already pretty complicated. We don’t want to make it too complicated.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Williams, agrees with the approach described in option 1 and believes it is consistent with the strategy that has been laid out. They also express their preference for setting a high cap on the reverse repo facility and do not see significant risks to financial stability or footprint issues. They are confident that option 1 provides the necessary tools for maintaining monetary control during the normalization period.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 233.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m happy to go along with the consensus of the room on the questions being posed by the staff.  It sounded to me like the consensus is building in support of option 1, with possibly even a higher cap, if needed.  I’m comfortable going along with that.  I wanted to highlight some of the comments that I heard around the table as being ones that I felt particularly resonated with me.  I thought President Rosengren’s question about international cash flows is one that I had not thought about and would be useful for the Committee to explore further. I thought President Mester’s comment about emphasizing the temporary nature of what we’re doing is really critical.  President Williams is right to highlight that we’ve already made reference to the fact that we intend this facility to be temporary.  On the other hand, that September 2014 communication replaced a June 2011 communication.  So I think it would be useful for us to cement what we said in September in an ongoing fashion, especially if we go larger, because there might be a temptation to think that’s going to mean we’re going to go longer as well.  I think we just have to be clear in our communications, on an ongoing basis, that we intend this to be a temporary facility. A tension I heard along those lines is President Bullard’s comment about timing: is liftoff really going to be special in some of the considerations we heard. Are we not always going to be concerned about, well, we’ve got to get the interest rate in the range. And that led me to be very sympathetic to President Lockhart’s question or suggestion that we explore and communicate clearly what we have in mind about an exit plan from this facility.  I think that would help bring clarity to our commitment to having this be a temporary facility. Overall, as I said, I’m willing to be supportive of whatever consensus emerges from our discussion.  I guess the one point I’ll close with, Madam Chair, is that in my own thinking, this conversation is premature.  The time is simply not right for liftoff.  As I’ll explain in later go-rounds, the evolution of the data in the past six months means we should be discussing how to solidify the credibility of our inflation target.  We’ve heard a lot of conversations about credibility already today.  I’ll be talking about credibility as well, about the credibility of that   percent goal, and that means providing more accommodation, not less. So our topic, I think, should be turning more to how we can use tools to ease financial market conditions and bolster the credibility of that inflation target and less about how we plan to tighten in the near term.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kocherlakota, expresses disagreement with the consensus of the room on the timing of liftoff and instead suggests that more accommodation should be provided to ease financial market conditions and bolster the credibility of the inflation target.


Passage number 234.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, assuming that we will tighten at one point and we will have liftoff at some point, Madam Chair, I want to make a few comments here.  Obviously, we all want to maximize the odds that liftoff will be smooth.  Governor Brainard underscored the precious nature of the current circumstance.  Simon pointed out we haven’t done this before.  I think the markets understand, to a degree, that we’re feeling our way.  For me, provided that yields on securities that have maturities of a few weeks and longer respond appropriately, some initial temporary departure of overnight rates from the intended target range at liftoff would be inconsequential.  I think President Lacker has made that point.  I agree.  I don’t think they have a material effect on the real economy.  It’s important, of course, that we do, however, have fallback plans.  One thing I didn’t see in the papers—I may not have read them thoroughly— were I the New York Desk and explaining this to the Committee, I’d want to see some alternative scenario planning, some decision tree analysis, and some definition of our tolerance limits.  That would make sense to me. So it’s a respectful suggestion.  I think that’s the way I would approach it.  We have, as many have pointed out, promised that the ON RRP would be temporary and used only as necessary to maintain control of monetary policy during normalization.  That promise was made for good reasons.  We shouldn’t take lightly actions that might lead the public and financial institutions to doubt our intention to honor it.  I believe under the previous Chairman I actually  quoted my mother—who I think stole it from Kierkegaard or maybe Santayana, and certainly not from the Kardashians—on the following:  “Skepticism is the chastity of the intellect, and it needs to be carefully guarded before it’s surrendered.”  [Laughter]  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I won’t tell you what she said after that, but—okay, after that she said, “And then have a lot of fun,” but that’s a separate thing. I do think there is some skepticism in the marketplace about the temporary nature of this facility, and here’s why I mention this.  We can throw out numbers like $1 trillion or $600 billion. However, I think we have to be very careful about whatever number we choose and not be indiscriminate with a large number because it might undermine the confidence that this is a temporary facility and, again, indicate that we’re not so chaste in the use of this facility. I would be very, very careful about throwing out numbers.  My second point is—I think President Lockhart makes an excellent suggestion—I don’t know how we do it, but we should at least have in our own mind what the exit strategy should be for using the program. In summary, I would prefer to start with an ON RRP program, maybe $600 billion but no larger.  I’d supplement with term RRPs at quarter-ends, perhaps term deposits, and only move to a more aggressive use of RRPs if it’s critical to maintain the floor.  And I’d be very careful in using it in any way that would undermine the confidence of the markets that this is a temporary facility. With regard to term RRPs, I understand from our discussion today that there are pros and cons, but they could be close substitutes, and we have established a precedent of engaging in term RRP operations at times when there is predictable temporary increase in demand for safe short-term assets. If liftoff occurs near the quarter-end, as seems likely, it would be perfectly natural for us to auction term RRPs coincident with liftoff and spanning the quarter-end. If the  maturity dates on term RRPs are staggered, we’ll have a chance to see how overnight rates respond as the term RRPs roll off, and we can decide, depending on that response, whether the current cap on ON RRP operations are too small, additional RRPs need to be auctioned, or term deposits should be offered at a premium over the IOER rate. One of the things that caught my eye in the memo was a suggestion of a 5 basis point increase in the ON RRP rate relative to the lower end of the target range for the federal funds rate. I was discussing this with Governor Brainard.  I understand that might be a short-term tactic, but I feel pretty strongly that we should maintain the 25 basis point spread between ON RRP and the IOER rates—and we should be careful that, as we go through time, I would suggest we perhaps use that spread as a way to limit demand for RRP.  So I can see widening it.  I don’t like the idea of temporarily shortening it, because I think it may undermine our commitment to widening it over time.  I may be wrong. And then last, with regard to term RRPs, again, I mentioned that I think it would be a useful tool at quarter-end.  There was a number of $200 billion somewhere.  Why not do $300 billion.  In other words, why not keep an extra $100 billion on hand in case we need to have it. And then finally, I would be in favor in terms of the question that was in red in the presentation of testing RRP apart from quarter-end dates.  Why not.  I think we should.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman Dudley.

Passage number 235.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair. For me, just like everybody else, having a smooth liftoff is my top priority.  That’s more important than the size of the facility or the potential financial stability concerns. First of all, over a very short period of time, when our credibility with respect to liftoff will either be won or lost, the financial-stability risks  are pretty small.  Also, I think we can address the issue of footprint by making it clear that this overnight RRP facility will be used only to the extent needed to maintain monetary policy control, and when it’s not needed, it will be phased out.  It’s temporary, not permanent. With respect to the options in the memo, I think it’s essential that we have sufficient headroom, and I think there’s a lot of ways to generate sufficient headroom.  You can have a very large overnight RRP facility or you can have a somewhat smaller overnight RRP facility supplemented by term RRP.  As long as there’s sufficient headroom and this expectation is realized, then I think the facilities are likely to be effective in putting a floor under short-term rates.  We have been talking about a lot of details over the past couple of hours, but I think we should get some confidence from the tests that we’ve done.  I mean, the tests do seem to suggest that these facilities actually do work in terms of putting a floor under short-term rates. In terms of the split between overnight RRP and term RRP, I think the simplest solution is just to go with option 1 and have a high cap initially on the overnight RRP facility or no cap at all.  The advantage of having a high cap, a cap that they are not going to reach, is to signal that this is not unlimited, and it allows you then to move the cap down as you see that you have a lot of extra headroom.  You can then move that cap down in order to reinforce the message that this thing is going to go away over time. If you decided that you wanted to have term RRPs, I think the way I would do it is I would have term RRPs that just address quarter-end, and I would have a testing program for term RRPs in place for the June quarter and the September quarter.  So if you lifted off in June or you lifted off in September, you wouldn’t even really have to announce the term RRPs.  They are to be tested.  The tested RRPs would just turn into the actual term RRPs.  In looking at the increase in demand over quarter-end, what you see is about a $200 billion increase in demand overquarter-end.  So that would suggest that if you had a term RRP program of $200 billion, you could have that tested in June, September, et cetera.  You could just roll right into it if you actually happened to lift off in the quarter, and if you didn’t lift off in the quarter, you’re just doing another test.  That, to me, has the advantage of it all being announced ex ante.  There’s no surprises to the market in terms of what you’re going to do.  If you roll it out after the fact, you’re just inserting more noise into the market that you’re going to have to communicate about. In terms of other steps to ensure a smooth liftoff, I think that we all agree that good communication is important.  I think what I would hope that we could do is reach a consensus in March about how this is all going to work and then have the Chair communicate that to the markets or communicate that in speeches or the minutes.  I think there is broad enough consensus here that I think we could get to something in March where we could sort of tell the markets what we’re doing prior to liftoff. Regarding term RRP testing away from quarter-end, I’m fine with it if we’re actually going to do it.  But if the sense of the Committee is that we’re not going to do term RRP away from quarter-end, then I sort of ask myself the question, why are we testing it.  I think we just have to ask ourselves.  I don’t think we should test things that we’re not going to do because I think that just confuses markets and starts to influence their expectations. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses their opinions and preferences, but there is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 236.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think it’s totally agreed that we have to do this successfully to retain our credibility as people who can control the interest rate, which we’d better be able to do.  And almost everything I have to say has been said already, so I’ll say it quickly.  Overnight RRP at somewhere around $600 billion seems right.  I like Vice Chairman Dudley’s statement that we should have a term RRP in place when we plan on doing this. The tradeoff between having the term RRPs and not is that you can make the overnight RRP facility smaller as a signal of not wanting to have a big footprint.  I had thought, listening to discussion in three or four previous Federal Open Market Committee meetings, that it was a big factor in everyone’s mind, but it seems to have shrunk a little bit now, and the $600 billion is probably more convenient in the hope that you might not need the term RRP.  The reason I say that is because I don’t know whether this is just reacting to words, but I’m not sure we should be encouraging firms to window-dress by making it cheaper for them to window-dress, and that’s what the term RRP does. I’m interested in when we are going to become independent of the ON RRP, and I think we’re very optimistic if we think we can describe the scenarios under which we are going to exit. It is going to take a while until we get the balance sheet down to $1 trillion, at which point I guess we’ll start possibly becoming able to see an end to this program, unless there is something we’re missing about President Lacker’s position—namely, that we could do it all by IOER.  And maybe there is something that says: that’s not true at $4 trillion, but it is true at $3½ trillion. If so, then we can stage an early exit.  But I very much doubt that we can do that.  We need to think about how we’re going to exit, but that shouldn’t be high on our list.  It would be nice if it was high on our list of priorities, but I don’t think it will be. The last point, again, is just to support the need for explaining what we’re going to do— preparing answers to frequently asked questions, et cetera—so that even people who are not engaged in buying and selling these things know what it is that we’re going to do.  There are probably tens of millions of American citizens who learned about open market operations in theireconomics textbooks and have trouble figuring out what on earth all this is about.  Why don’t you just do it in a good, old-fashioned way.  I think we have to worry about explaining ourselves even more than usual.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing their thoughts and opinions on various topics, such as the overnight RRP facility and the need for transparency and explanation to the public. There is no explicit disagreement or argument present in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 237.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I began this exercise, whenever we started talking about it months ago, with a strong set of financial stability concerns, which, unlike many of you, have not abated during the course of these discussions.  But it has become apparent to me over time—and I think part of today’s discussion was a reaffirmation of this point—that the financial-stability difference between just ON RRP and a mix of ON RRP and term RRP is probably not that great relative to my source of concerns.  And I think President Lockhart and President Kocherlakota have put their finger on the source of my concerns, which is, as President Lockhart put it, an exit plan.  And I guess I disagree with Governor Fischer.  I think we’d better think about an exit plan for a reason I’ll explain in a minute. There are two ways that things could go here.  One, with a large-ish ON RRP, we begin liftoff at some point in the future, and it turns out that things go pretty smoothly, and the take-up is nowhere near the cap—if there is a cap—that we’ve put in place.  And as President Plosser suggested, at the next meeting we can reduce the cap without any concerns about what happens.  A powerful message will be sent to the money market fund industry and, indeed, to everybody else. The other scenario is one in which it turns out that there is substantial take-up.  And in subsequent meetings, there is still concern that—as Narayana was suggesting—in the absence of the continued use of a very large ON RRP, there may be some difficulty in getting within the target range, or at least in having confidence that we’ll be within the target range.  It seems to me   that this is the scenario to worry about.  I don’t know what the probabilities are regarding that scenario.  I don’t know that anybody could say with any great assurance even the order of magnitude for what the probabilities are, but I think they’re nontrivial. And here is where the question of, as Dennis put it, the exit plan comes into play, because I think what we confront is a variant of a time-consistency problem: That is, at any given meeting, it always seems like the best thing is to make sure you hit the range with confidence with a big ON RRP facility, and any financial stability issue is speculative.  It’s not around right now, of course, and is probably for tomorrow’s Committee, not even the members who are on the Committee right now.  This is precisely why, in general, policymakers pay more attention to short-term issues and why long-term problems often don’t get addressed—because of the decision pressures that we all face. So I think, under those circumstances, there are two ways to deal with those longer-range contingencies.  One, which I’m going to come back to in a second, is some variant on a commitment device—that is, sort of an ex ante approach.  The second is having more options as you go forward, a kind of ex post approach. Several people have already stated why, notwithstanding their preference for option 1, they think it might be a good idea to continue to investigate, through testing and otherwise, other tools that may be available, and I would agree with them.  So my instinct would be to let the Desk test anything it thinks might be useful at some point to give us as an option. With respect to the first way—that is, the commitment device—the only thing I have heard, and I have heard it from almost everybody who has spoken to this point, “Well, we said it’s temporary.”  Well, you know, this is what a time-consistency problem is defined by.  You have a stated policy, which of course is the preference.  But when you come to the point of making the decision, it turns out that that gets trumped by the shorter-term considerations, and that at some point other actors begin to figure out that that’s the circumstance you’re in. So stating that something is temporary, I don’t think, in and of itself, can be hugely reassuring, even though it helps, and there is no question that it is better to say it and to say it repeatedly than not to say it. But I do think that other kinds of commitment devices should at least be thought about:  for example, whether there is some way to tie the maximum size of an ON RRP over time, even to the balance sheet, which may not change for quite some time, so that at least there would be a clear ending point.  I don’t know what other ideas there are, and I think Governor Fischer is right in suggesting it’s going to be hard to come up with them.  But I’m left quite uncomfortable just relying on our saying, “Well, it’s temporary.” And I heard many people say, “As appropriate, we would bring it down,” or “As possible, we would bring it down.” Well, what if that decision still seems a hard one. It then becomes hard to bring it down. The problem with a commitment device is that, of course, it puts a constraint on discretion.  That’s the definition of a commitment device.  But you’ve got to do it.  If you don’t do it, and you’re not willing to do it ex ante to some degree, then it suggests to me that we’re not putting any value on financial stability considerations, which I think is different from saying we put dominant value on the precision of the monetary policy execution but are still placing some value on financial stability considerations. As I say, I can’t value it, but it does seem to me that we don’t want to have our children or somebody looking back at some point and saying, “You know, the Fed just slipped into this.  At every point, it was easier to make that decision.  They allowed this industry to get started, and then what happened. There was a major run circumstance in which everybody ran to the Fed, and their successors were sitting there saying, ‘We’d better increase the ON RRP. Otherwise,there’s financial instability.’”  So that’s why, whether you call it a decision tree as President Fisher suggests, or President Lockhart’s exit plan, or just gaming it through—I think which was what Narayana was suggesting—I do hope that we can think more about this between now and March and see whether we can get beyond mere words with something ex ante, then allow Simon and Lorie to test a bunch of stuff that may help us develop some ex post options as needed later on. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.

Passage number 239.
 WILLIAMS.  I had a two-hander.  I actually feel that you left out of your comments many of the things that were said that would actually deal with this very issue.  I think the points you made are excellent.  But I view adjusting the IOER to be above the range as exactly the kind of tool that we could use so that we didn’t have to rely on the overnight reverse repo so much.  Let me go through that scenario.  That’s what I meant when I said we have these other backstop policies—like TDF, changing the spread, or raising the overnight IOER, and things like that.  And I think term reverse repo also is like that.  That’s what I meant when I said we should keep these in reserve so that if we find that to hit our range or, say, to keep the federal funds rate in the range, we need to have a $1 trillion overnight reverse repo and we don’t want to keep it there, we can use the other tools to avoid that. I think that, actually, I agree with the points you’re making, but I do think that that’s what I and maybe others mean when we said, “Well, you should use these other steps as backup.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 240.
” MR. TARULLO.  I hope that’s right, John.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Tarullo's response suggests agreement or approval.


Passage number 241.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage mentioned, "MR" does not provide enough information to determine if there is any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 242.
 WILLIAMS.  That’s what I meant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage as only one speaker, Williams, expresses their opinion.


Passage number 243.
 MR. TARULLO.  I hope that’s right, and I think the things you suggested would fall into the category of ex post other options, which I identified.  But I also heard you say that it wasalready pretty complicated, and I’ve heard a number of other people talk about the virtue of simplicity in execution.  So I don’t discount the possibility that when, at some future meeting, rates are already—I can’t even remember what our ranges are now.  You can’t say 75 basis points anymore.  You have to think, 12½ less than, 12½ more—up somewhat and we have this discussion and people say, “Oh, gee, it would make it complicated to try to introduce a different IOER spread or term RRPs.”  Again, if it’s thought through a bit beforehand, and it’s communicated, including to the public, you then begin to alter the lay of the land, and maybe you are creating a soft commitment device.  But that’s really what I’m calling for, not just relying on the fact that at some point in the future we’ll think better of it. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Tarullo is expressing his thoughts and considerations, and Chair Yellen is responding without contradicting him.


Passage number 244.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. My conception is very similar to that of President Williams in terms of having these other tools.  And if you don’t like the tradeoff that you find after liftoff, you can adjust these other tools in a way to achieve a better tradeoff.  I think in terms of the simplicity/complexity argument, simplicity at liftoff is particularly important.  And after liftoff, I think you can introduce more complexity if you want to set the tradeoffs at a different place than you do in liftoff.  So I would distinguish liftoff, in terms of the need for simplicity at liftoff, from later, when I think you could have different tradeoffs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement with President Williams's conception and is offering their own perspective on the importance of simplicity at liftoff and the ability to adjust and introduce complexity after liftoff.


Passage number 245.
 MR. TARULLO.  I know everybody has done that, Vice Chairman Dudley, but I don’t quite understand why that’s so—why I should believe or why any of us should believe that we are really going to feel that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage consists of a statement made by Mr. Tarullo followed by his question seeking clarification. While there may be room for potential disagreement in the response to his question, the passage itself does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 246.
  I mean, maybe we will, but— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  If we truly don’t like the tradeoffs, why wouldn’t we pick some other parameters to adjust to get to a better place.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It is simply posing a question and suggesting the possibility of exploring other options for improvement.


Passage number 247.
MR. TARULLO. What I was suggesting is the calculus of a tradeoff at any given moment will weigh heavily toward as precise an execution of one’s monetary policy objectives as one can achieve.  And, thus, other norms, just as now I think they are being pushed—not obliterated, and nobody denies them—but I think they are being downplayed now.  I think the same dynamic, psychological and otherwise, takes effect at any given point along the way.  And there is a very rational, logical reason why you should be right, which is to say that credibility having been established initially, we would all be more comfortable with more softness.  But I don’t know that that’s the way everyone, or even the majority, of the Committee, or some future Chair will feel about it. So that’s why I think talking it through first and communicating upfront the way we’re thinking about it does, as I say, serve as a form of soft commitment device—not as hard of one as I would like, but at least a soft commitment device—as opposed to just telling ourselves, if we don’t like the tradeoff later, we can do it differently, but not getting beyond that.  I don’t think there is any disagreement conceptually with what the options are.  I’m just thinking in terms of institutional dynamics. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It is a discussion about the tradeoffs and dynamics involved in monetary policy decision-making.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 248.
 MR. FISHER.  I want to come back to a point I made before, and I think Governor Tarullo was endorsing it—that old quip, “Trust in Allah, but tie your camel.”  I just want to make sure we have simplicity of liftoff, but that in our back pocket, we have done the studies.  And if it doesn’t work the way we want it to work, we pull out these different tools, and that’s what I call decision tree management. That was one point I was trying to make.  I think you agreed, Dan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher and Governor Tarullo have differing opinions on the approach to take. Mr. Fisher wants to have a simple plan but also have backup tools, while Governor Tarullo's endorsement of the "Trust in Allah, but tie your camel" quip suggests a different perspective.


Passage number 249.
 MR. POTTER.  That the main thing we can do is sell assets, and we know how to sell the Treasuries pretty easily.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Potter, seems to be stating a fact or an agreed-upon course of action without any opposition or contradiction.


Passage number 250.
MR. FISHER.  So, again, I won’t be here, but I hope you develop these alternatives, and explain at least to the Committee some of the thinking.  I’m not sure we should explain it to the public.  I’m not saying that.  I mean, we do have to have something in our pocket, and we have to tie our camel.  That’s the point I was making. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. Mr. Fisher is suggesting that the committee comes up with alternatives and explains the thinking behind them, while also mentioning the need to have a backup plan. Chair Yellen's response does not indicate any disagreement or contradiction.


Passage number 251.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  President Fisher is proving, with his colorful metaphors, why he’ll be missed so much.  [Laughter]  But in a serious vein, I think Governor Tarullo has hit the nail on the head here—that at any given moment in time, there is a tendency to focus on the short-term needs and the short-term actions and the short-term dynamics.  And I think it will be useful to provide underpinnings to the public regarding what we mean by “temporary,” and why we feel comfortable with it being temporary, not only in terms of having a plan in our heads, but also having a plan that we communicate to the public that will make it clear that we know how we’re going to be temporary about this. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is agreeing with Governor Tarullo's point of view.


Passage number 252.
 MR. POWELL.  It has been a very interesting discussion. I was tempted to two-hand myself there.  [Laughter]  I’m not sure if that’s a legal move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Mr. Powell is meant to be humorous, as evident from the laughter that follows.


Passage number 253.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 254.
 WILLIAMS. We’ll take care of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any disagreement or contention. It simply states that "we" will handle the specified matter.


Passage number 255.
 MR. POWELL.  Anyway, I’m going to start in the short term and then come back to the excellent questions that Governor Tarullo and others have discussed here.  I think we have, for the purposes of the short term, established that we want the reverse repo facilities to be temporary in time and as limited in size as they can be, consistent with an appropriate degree of control over monetary policy.  I think with that established, we can, should, and must use our tools aggressively to achieve that level of control.  And based on what market participants aretelling us and what the tests seem to show, if the market perceives that the cap is unlikely to be binding, then RRP will provide a good floor for our target range and rates will be close to the middle of the range. I think that’s a great place to start. So my prior is:  At liftoff, we should have not overwhelming force but overwhelming headroom.  And, looking at the options, I guess I’m somewhere around “option 1½.” By that I mean where I would be is, $400 billion or $500 billion overnight repo and term.  I would do term at quarter-end, every quarter-end for a while, at around $200 billion.  That’s the way I would do it. I would say, in terms of the control point, it’s one thing if rates plunge below the overnight rate in June 2017, and it’s another thing if they do that right after liftoff.  I think it’s one thing if the Fed chooses to allow, and is seen to choose to allow, rates to go out of our range. It’s another for people to see that the Federal Reserve doesn’t have the tools or doesn’t use its tools well enough to keep rates in the range.  So I think that it really is important to do what we’re all suggesting, which is to have a pretty substantial degree of control at the beginning. As far as the other tools are concerned, I start with the idea that the IOER rate ought to be at the top of the range and the ON RRP rate ought to be at the bottom of the range.  I think moving them both around at the same time is confusing.  I think my first tool off the bench, if you will, if we need it, would be to move the ON RRP rate up 5 basis points.  That seemed to do the trick.  That moved up the federal funds rate almost basis point for basis point.  So that could be a tool, but I would hold that in abeyance.  That does go to the point of using not so much the size. Coming back to the medium-term and longer-term issues, these are great points.  I think President Lockhart’s idea of an exit plan or at least further consideration of the conditions under   which we would exit is well worth exploring, and if there are other commitment technologies out there, they would be worth exploring as well to deal with the time-consistency problem. It seems to me we’ve learned a great deal in the testing, and testing has in a way performed just as we hoped it would.  And the possibility of sending negative signals really hasn’t happened except, I think, with the segregated balance accounts.  That takes me to considering the point: “Let’s not test something that we’re probably not going to use, because if we test it, people are really going to expect us to use it.  So let’s not do that.” I would certainly be comfortable with testing term RRP over the March quarter-end.  I guess I wouldn’t test off quarter-ends if we’re not going to use it, and it doesn’t seem like to me we’re going to use it.  On TDF, it seems to be kind of a peripheral tool, but I guess the chances are that we may well use it. So I’d be okay with further testing. Generally speaking, I would default in the direction of more testing except where I think it’s sending a signal that we’re testing a tool that we’re not going to use.  We should look like, if you will, an army that’s doing a lot of drilling and practicing and marching and committed to using our tools well and achieving a good level of control.  I think that’s exactly what we’re starting to look like, and, again, aside from that one negative signal, I don’t see that the possibility of other negative signals has materialized.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Powell, is discussing his thoughts on the use of the reverse repo facilities and other tools in monetary policy. He does not mention any disagreements or opposing views.


Passage number 256.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  We are in quite unique circumstances. Monetary policy has now been at the lower bound for about six years, and we have excess reserves at a level that we have never dealt with before.  So at this very unique moment, it’s of paramount importance to demonstrate decisively that we can maintain the federal funds ratewithin the range that we target.  I think the failure to do so could potentially have long-term corrosive effects on the efficacy of our monetary policy. Any initial inability to move the rate within its desired range, particularly if it persists for any period of time, would call into question that we have the tools or the will.  And the risk is amplified by the slight awkwardness of the timing.  The likeliest meetings for liftoff, which are those that coincide with a press conference, all happen to take place very close to quarter-end.  And they raise a specter of the liftoff announcement being followed immediately by a downward drift and a possible breach in the new floor. Fortunately, we have already seen that we can have pretty strong confidence that we have the necessary tools well within our authority.  The use of the IOER in tandem with the reverse repo facility should provide the requisite monetary control if we set the cap on the reverse repo at a sufficient level to have high confidence in achieving that target.  Our experience so far with using that facility to impose a soft floor has been limited to periods in which the federal funds rate has been close to zero and, therefore, likely receiving some support from that threshold.  As rates move away from the zero bound, we should be prepared for the possibility that the amount of reverse repos that are needed to support that floor initially might increase temporarily.  We should also be prepared, as was suggested in the memo, to temporarily narrow the spread between the IOER and the RRP rates at the outset with a view that it will increase over time. I agree with those who have said that they are less worried about the exact size of the increment in the cap.  The cap itself is less important as a safeguard against risks from the ON RRP to financial stability and changes to market structure than the perceived impermanence of this facility.  In terms of making sure that we don’t lead to a permanent change in market structure or introduce some risk of a flight to this market during periods of elevated stress, it is very important that we firmly commit that this facility will be temporary and used only for the extent and duration necessary.  I think apart from stating that very clearly at the outset, there are a number of ways that we talked about doing that around the table.  We will not be in these unique circumstances for very long, and we should see over time that the IOER rate starts to exert more of a pull on the federal funds rate and that it trades closer to IOER rate.  At that juncture, we’ll have the option to widen the spread and make the RRP rate much less attractive.  So there’s a natural potential exit path that I think we have talked about using, and I hope we will, in fact, use that along with some of the other tools. So with those strong reservations about making sure that we are clear that this not a permanent addition to the structure of the short-term money market, I very much support option 1. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think we’ve had a great round of discussion, and we agreed earlier that we would come back to the testing resolutions after we had this discussion. What I’d like to suggest is that we do that first thing in the morning.  The staff can give us some proposals for testing in light of the discussion, and we would take it up, if that’s acceptable, before we go into policy discussions tomorrow morning.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is an expression of the speaker's opinions and support for a particular option, but it does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 257.
 MR. CLOUSE.  There was one outstanding question of whether you would like to see two proposals, one for just quarter-end testing or another one for the limited testing that Simon has already talked about. CHAIR YELLEN. Why don’t we try to get a sense of that. I mean, most people have addressed that, and a variety of views were expressed.  In terms of the quarter-end testing, although there was a diversity of views, what I heard was that most people were supportive ofquarter-end testing.  Could I see a show of hands on how many people would be supportive of quarter-end testing of the term RRPs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The participants are discussing their views on quarter-end testing and Chair Yellen asks for a show of hands to gauge support for this testing.


Passage number 258.
 MR. FISCHER.  You mean extra. CHAIR YELLEN.  No, just the testing at quarter-end, not outside quarter-end.  I’ll take that separately.  [Show of hands]  Okay.  And who would be opposed to the quarter-end testing. [Show of hands]  Okay.  Although we don’t have unanimity, I think coming back to us with that proposal is appropriate.  Now let’s take, I think, the more controversial piece, which would be testing of term RRPs over the next month or two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The Chair asks for a show of hands to see who is opposed to quarter-end testing, and after seeing some hands, she states that coming back with a proposal is appropriate. There is no further mention of disagreement or opposition in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 259.
 MR. POTTER. We could do some testing from late February to early March. CHAIR YELLEN.  Right.  So making it a relatively small scale, not at quarter-end, and I think a number of people felt this shouldn’t be part of our liftoff toolkit. In fact, I heard pretty broad support for the view that we shouldn’t use that tool at liftoff. Nevertheless, I did hear a number of you say that, ultimately, as we may want to reduce the cap over time on the overnight RRP facility, this is something that we might potentially want to use.  It’s not clear we would use it, but if we did, it might be useful to test it to see. Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Chair Yellen mentions that she heard broad support for not using a certain tool at liftoff, but also mentions that some people mentioned potentially using it in the future. This suggests differing opinions on whether or not to use the tool.


Passage number 260.
 MR. FISCHER.  I thought we should ask for that to be done because there was a lot of interest in the morning about the extent to which the term RRPs are a substitute for overnight RRPs.  We didn’t get an answer yet, and doing it away from the quarter-end would give us some information about that.  So it would be useful, I think. CHAIR YELLEN. Let me ask for just a general show of hands, as I think we heard considerable support for something along the lines of option 1 as a way to go into liftoff.  Nevertheless, there remain some reasons that we might want to understand more about thesubstitutability of non-quarter-end term RRPs for overnight.  How many people would be in favor of, I think we’re talking about a modest testing program.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are discussing the possibility of conducting a testing program to understand the substitutability of non-quarter-end term RRPs for overnight.


Passage number 261.
 MR. POTTER.  It would be small. CHAIR YELLEN.  A small testing program that maybe would end at the beginning of March.  How many people would be interested in seeing a proposal along those lines. [Show of hands]  Okay.  And how many people would feel really opposed to doing that.  [Show of hands] Okay.  I think my suggestion, seeing that, would be that maybe you come back tomorrow morning with two proposals.  People, of course, can sleep on it, and we’re not forced to go ahead with both things, but I think I see enough support for the testing of non-quarter-end term, especially a small-scale test, that maybe we should see a proposal. President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 262.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I’d like to suggest that the staff give some thought to this—and maybe this is just terminology.  You know, the Desk brings us a proposal for, say, the next round of testing, and I’m continually asking about, all right, what’s on the horizon after that.  On the horizon after that is the next quarter-end, which could be the consequential one.  Now, a couple of people around the table spoke of quarter-end term RRPs as something they want to initiate and just carry right through to liftoff, right.  So they want to have it in place and keep going.  Well, that suggests we’re not really testing.  I mean, no one spoke about how compelling these research questions in the memo were.  Basically, people were thinking about whether they want term RRP to be in place from now until we lift off.  So this should raise in our minds the question of, when is it not testing and when is it a program. When is it official that it’s not a test.  We may want to just hold in our minds that, all right, it’s official, but we’re going to call it testing until we lift off. I don’t know, but I think it would be worthwhile for us to think about that before June, when it’s upon us, or April, when we have to think about June testing.  CHAIR YELLEN.  I think that’s correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is expressing his concern that the term RRPs are being treated as a program rather than a test, while Chair Yellen agrees with Mr. Lacker's point.


Passage number 263.
 MR. FISHER.  Madam Chair, may I ask a question just to help answer this tomorrow. When you say “a small amount,” what do we mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a request for clarification.


Passage number 264.
 MR. POTTER.  I think up to $50 billion would be the amount we would ask for.  Whether or not we would get to that in any single operation, I’m not sure.  This is one on which you would start very small because we’re not doing this over quarter-end, and you don’t want to do anything in a test that could have adverse consequences.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 265.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing gratitude towards someone, indicating agreement or harmony rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 266.
 MR. POTTER. There the issue for us is that at quarter-end we have a very good feeling for the quantity that might be demanded.  Because we haven’t used this tool away from quarter-end, we don’t have that kind of knowledge.  So if you agree to do something like this, it would be very small at first, and we’d have to interact back with the Chair after the first one to understand whether we wanted to go any bigger than that.  And it does have some issues related to how we describe it, as Governor Powell suggested, that there is some risk that people will take more signal from doing a test like this than we’d like.  That also suggests keeping it quite small.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the potential implementation of a tool and considering the potential risks and limitations.


Passage number 267.
 MR. FISHER.  Madam Chair, I just want to clarify my hand-raising here.  I’m not against testing things, because I want to have the best toolkit that we can possibly have, as long as it doesn’t send the wrong signal. CHAIR YELLEN.  Right, and that’s exactly what Simon is concerned with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fisher expresses his support for testing things, but also mentions the importance of avoiding sending the wrong signal. Chair Yellen agrees with his point.


Passage number 268.
 MR. POTTER.  We have had an experience recently with that, which wasn’t very pleasant.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply expresses a negative experience without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 269.
 MR. FISHER.  Yes.  Thank you very much. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  If you think you would be able to provide a concrete proposal tomorrow, I think we can do that first thing.  Okay.  Thank you.  I think we’ve had a very thorough and very useful discussion of these operational issues. The Board meeting is now concluded.  So let us now proceed to the economic and financial situation.  I’m going to first turn things over to Steve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The individuals in the conversation are expressing gratitude and indicating that they are concluding one topic and moving on to another.


Passage number 270.
 MR. FISHER.  The only little point I’d like to make on financial stability is that I would suggest that we keep our eye on subprime auto loans.  Auto loans now are approaching $1 trillion.  We talk a lot about student debt loans, but if you look at what has happened in terms of used cars this past year, at least according to Morgan, it strikes me that it’s a vulnerable area. I did note on January 20 the lead fellow for Honda at the auto show said that auto lenders are doing “stupid things.  We’ve seen this movie before.  We know how it ends, and it’s not pretty.” I had the staff look into that a little bit. They found that used cars accounted for 73 percent of subprime auto ABS last year, with terms out to eight years.  It’s just a small fact in the overall credit picture, but you might just want to keep your eye on it.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement about the speaker's concern regarding subprime auto loans and their potential impact on financial stability.


Passage number 271.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes, thanks.  I’d like to ask both David Wilcox and Michael Kiley a question.  David, you showed us PCE, and I was wondering whether anything is happening to real wages in your forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. MR. Fischer asks a question to both David Wilcox and Michael Kiley about real wages in the forecast.


Passage number 272.
 MR. WILCOX.  We have real compensation picking up over the course of the next couple of years to, in real terms, about 1½ percent by 2017.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 273.
 MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context about whether there is contention or disagreement. It simply expresses gratitude.


Passage number 274.
 MR. WASCHER.  In Q4, it’s plus 2¼ percent, which reflects the sharp decline in oil prices in the near term. And it’s then plus 7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter.  But, again, that’s mainly due to the big decline in consumer energy prices.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "that's mainly due to the big decline in consumer energy prices" is explaining the reason for the 7 percent increase in the first quarter, rather than conflicting with anything mentioned before.


Passage number 275.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The answer is yes. The presence of the word "Yes" implies that there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 276.
 MR. WILCOX. Nominal compensation gains have been running in the neighborhood of around 2 percent, so if you smooth through the employment and PCE prices, real compensation gains have been quite meager.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any disagreement or contention. It simply states the fact that nominal compensation gains have been around 2 percent and, when adjusted for employment and PCE prices, real compensation gains have been small.


Passage number 277.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks.  Michael, I’m just trying to figure out, even with this higher leverage and higher debt and all that, I take it that interest burdens may well be significantly down.  You can see that in the top-left chart in exhibit 2, as an example.  I don’t know how general that is, but I assume it’s pretty general.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Fischer, is making a statement and seeking confirmation or clarification from Michael.


Passage number 278.
 MR. KILEY. As you can see on the right, for the business sector as a whole, debt growth really hasn’t looked like that in the speculative-grade portion.  So it is the case that the trend you’ve seen on the upper left is steeper for leverage than it would be for the overall business sector. That’s reflective of the fact that it has been an area in which there has been a lot of growth—more than 10 percent each year for three years. It certainly is the case that the interest expense ratio is depressed by the low level of interest rates today, so one might have concerns that that would reverse when the interest rate rises.  Certainly we would expect that to happen somewhat.  While leveraged loans tend to be floating rate, it is the case that even speculative-grade firms also issue high-yield bonds.  Wehave seen a lengthening in the maturity of their debt obligations, and they have the ability to hedge some of their interest rate exposure in various ways.  I wouldn’t take as much solace in the low interest rate expense ratio as might be seen by the quite low recent reading of the red line.  Nonetheless, we do think that the debt burden is not as high as would be expected by the high leverage ratio, because interest rates are expected to stay low and the term has been lengthened these liabilities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing information and analysis about the debt growth and leverage in the business sector, as well as the potential impact of interest rates on the interest expense ratio.


Passage number 279.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage consists of polite expressions of thanks and greetings between Mr. Fischer and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 280.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a couple of questions for Steve.  In exhibit 2, you display the behavior of PCE price inflation in this alternative scenario.  I first had a question about core price inflation.  And my other question tries to tie this back to the scenario in Tealbook A, which had a faster recovery with higher inflation.  That scenario seemed to rely on a steeper Phillips curve than is usually used in the Tealbook, and I was wondering what assumption was being used about the slope of the Phillips curve in exhibit 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement, but rather a request for clarification and further information.


Passage number 281.
 MR. KAMIN. On exhibit 2, that’s total PCE prices.  And for core, the effect would definitely be much more muted, because there is an awful lot of kick in the total happening from the rise in oil prices. The total increment here to headline inflation is about 1 percentage point, and it’s more like ½ or ¼ percentage point for the core prices. And your other question, I think, is referring to the alternative scenario that pertains to the domestic economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information and data without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 282.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  No, I’m sorry.  I complicated things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they have "complicated things," indicating a personal mistake or confusion without any conflicting views being expressed.


Passage number 283.
 MR. KAMIN. This one uses our standard SIGMA model, for which we have not altered the Phillips-curve assumptions that we used in previous runs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact about the model they are using and its assumptions.


Passage number 284.
  MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 285.
 MR. WILCOX. Just to be clear, think of a two-by-two matrix in which the columns are different models and the rows are different assumptions about the Phillips curve.  Steve’s presentation is in some diagonal that’s different from the one that generated the alternative simulation in Tealbook A. What we used was the FRB/US model with a juiced-up Phillips curve.  What he used was SIGMA with SIGMA’s standard Phillips curve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is explaining different models and assumptions about the Phillips curve. There is no contention or disagreement evident in the passage.


Passage number 286.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And SIGMA’s standard Phillips curve is juiced up or not juiced up relative to FRB/US.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply presents a question about the comparison between two models, recognizing that one may be "juiced up" or not compared to the other.


Passage number 287.
 MR. WILCOX.  I would answer, definitely juiced up.  It’s much more price-responsive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wilcox states his opinion that something is "definitely juiced up" and more "price-responsive," but there is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 288.
 MR. EVANS.  Well, that’s its normal state.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that "Well, that’s its normal state," without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 289.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That’s its normal state, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement of a fact.


Passage number 290.
 MR. KAMIN.  That’s probably truest in the dynamics, right.  You know, the “impact effects” of shocks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is making a statement about the impact effects of shocks, suggesting that they are most evident in dynamics.


Passage number 291.
 MR. WILCOX.  That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "That's right" simply confirms agreement with a previous statement.


Passage number 292.
 MR. KAMIN.  Partly, I think, the assumption of perfect foresight and partly other aspects of the model definitely juice it up.  What I would do is, I would take a look at panel 3, if you’re interested, to get the message that the fall in the dollar and the rise in oil prices would certainly lead to a faster rebound in inflation, but not necessarily take the actual magnitude to the bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is offering their perspective on the assumptions and aspects of a model, suggesting that they would look at a specific panel to gain a better understanding of the situation.


Passage number 293.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Steve. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The two individuals are mentioned by name but there is no indication of them disagreeing or having a conflicting opinion.


Passage number 294.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: In the given passage, Mr. Evans is expressing gratitude to the chairperson, showing a polite and respectful tone. There is no contention or disagreement present in this statement.


Passage number 295.
  I was a little distracted, because President Williams just reminded me that it has been 20 years since he developed— MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states that the speaker was distracted by President Williams' reminder about a development that occurred 20 years ago. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 296.
 WILLIAMS.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The passage provided does not include any content to assess the presence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 297.
  I helped work on—MR. EVANS. —helped work on the FRB/US model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that the speaker assisted in working on the FRB/US model.


Passage number 298.
  It’s quite an old— [Laughter] Back when he was— MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Six years old.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply mentions that something is old and then there is laughter.


Passage number 299.
  [Laughter] MR FISHER. And Al Gore was running the Internet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is a statement that includes a humorous remark about Al Gore's involvement with the internet. There is no apparent contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 300.
 MR. EVANS.  More seriously, I’d like to ask David if he could make a few comments on a couple of the alternative scenarios.  Picking up on Governor Fischer’s question about wages, I couldn’t help but notice the “Weaker Wage Growth” simulations and how, when wage increases are assumed to stay at their current low of 2 percent rate instead of picking up to that 3½ percent rate, total PCE inflation just goes to 0.9 percent in 2018.  What’s really interesting, of course, is that the federal funds rate over this period is lifting off and going up to 3 percent.  During that period, the economy is doing quite well, but there is a disengagement between economic activity and inflation.  So a few comments on that would be good.  Also, against that, there is the “Faster Recovery with Higher Inflation” scenario.  I confess I didn’t read that very carefully, but I did notice that the numbers are quite different.  The funds rate is much higher at the end point, and inflation only is at 2½ percent at the end of the simulation period. It looks to me like this analysis is another piece of evidence that shows it’s a lot easier to deal with rising inflationary pressures because we can increase the funds rate, but we have trouble with these disinflationary periods in which—well, in this case, the funds rate is going up, so I’m not quite sure as to what is going on—it’s more difficult to get inflation up to target. If you could comment along those lines, that would be helpful.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply asking for comments on different scenarios and expressing curiosity about the relationship between wage growth, inflation, and the federal funds rate. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 301.
 MR. WASCHER. In the “Weaker Wage Growth” one, the weaker nominal wage growth flows through into lower inflation, and, as you noted, real activity isn’t really affected very much.  In a way—when we run these simulations, we basically turn on the inertial version of the Taylor rule at liftoff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating a fact and providing additional information.


Passage number 302.
 MR. EVANS. It doesn’t seem to be very effective, does it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "It doesn't seem to be very effective, does it" is a statement of personal observation rather than a statement that suggests contention or disagreement.


Passage number 303.
 MR. WASCHER.  And it is the inertial part of it.  In general, it lifts off, but it’s not very effective at bringing inflation up.  The responsiveness of inflation in the model to activity isn’t very big, and I think that’s what you’re seeing there.  We did run an alternative scenario in which we implemented the policy rule with an inflation floor included, and that’s noted in a footnote in the text.  That one still lifts off at the same time, but the increase in the funds rate is much more gradual in that version of the policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining the results of running an alternative scenario and discussing the differences in the results.


Passage number 304.
 MR. EVANS. That seems in keeping with my thinking that, when inflation is at these relatively low levels because of something that is difficult to deal with, it requires a more extraordinary use of accommodation—in this case, a “flatter” Taylor rule.  That’s what the inflation floor is doing, relative to what we would normally think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Evans, is simply expressing his opinion and explaining his thinking. There is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 305.
 MR. WILCOX. There is a lot of model uncertainty surrounding this question, apropos of the comment earlier about the SIGMA model.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not express any disagreement or contention. It mentions model uncertainty, but there is no indication of any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 306.
 MR. EVANS.  But I’m just trying to get at the characteristics of the analysis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Evans is simply stating that he is trying to understand the characteristics of the analysis.


Passage number 307.
 MR. WILCOX.  Monetary policy is much more powerful in the SIGMA model in boosting inflation than it is in the FRB/US model.  So monetary policy in FRB/US has a really hard time getting inflation up to the 2 percent objective. We do some apples and oranges in presenting to you some scenarios in this section of the Tealbook, some that are generated using the FRB/US model, others that are generated using the SIGMA model.  We think that’s a virtue, to demonstrate for you the fact that one can develop  different results using different models.  I think it’s a useful reminder that this is an area where there is a lot of uncertainty and some pretty heated debate about what the right response is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining that different models can produce different results and that there is uncertainty and debate in this area.


Passage number 308.
 MR. EVANS. That’s fine.  The more damaging response that I was hoping I wouldn’t get back from you, which I didn’t yet, is that, except for the 2018 time frame, that inflation rate is actually still going up.  I would have guessed that it’s the inertia in inflation, so it’s actually much worse.  I’m pointing to this and thinking, “That faster inflation, it’s really not that bad of an outcome, because inflation is at 2½ percent.” But if you told me that that was on its way to 3 percent, then I would say, “Okay, that’s more of a ‘symmetry of distaste’ across these simulations.”  But your comment about uncertainty as to the mechanisms here also suggests we’re in a different situation.  We’re in a situation right now in which inflation is below our target, so something that lifts up inflation just isn’t that bad at the moment, because we need it to go up anyway.  That’s how I come out from that.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen seem to be in agreement that inflation is currently below their target and they would like it to increase.


Passage number 309.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have two questions on the financial stability report.  One is on the capital ratios that you show on page 2.  How much different does the leverage ratio look when you use GAAP and net derivatives versus if you use international accounting.  Is it a significant difference on that leverage ratio measurement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 310.
 MR. KILEY. For the U.S. banks, I’m not actually sure of the answer to that.  I know that’s a large issue when we make international comparisons.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kiley, simply states that he is unsure of the answer regarding the issue of U.S. banks in international comparisons. There is no opposition or conflicting viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 311.
 MS. GEORGE.  I assume it would be less, though, under those.  My other question is on the conclusions that the report draws.  The measures of cyclical vulnerabilities look fairly reassuring. But it’s not as clear to me how I should think about the state of structural vulnerabilities and how you evaluate those relative to those conclusions in there.  And in the  report, it talks about that as being an important limitation of your ability to quantitatively measure risk to the financial system.  So my question is, really, how do you incorporate those here. In view of all of the reforms and changes that may be under way, where do you gauge structural vulnerability, or how should I think about it in relation to the conclusions that you’ve drawn here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker expresses confusion and uncertainty about how to think about and evaluate structural vulnerabilities in relation to the conclusions of the report.


Passage number 312.
 MR. KILEY. Just to provide a little more context for your question, because your question did reference our additional chapter in our assessment in which we did a purely quantitative approach to developing the dashboard that’s shown on your left page, that more or less basically compares a set of numbers with their historical perspective and uses historical ranges as the benchmark.  That is purely a cyclical perspective.  So, for example, if something historically looks very low right now, but very low is still a terrible position, our quantitative folks would say, “Oh, that’s fine, but structurally there may be a problem.” That supplemental report looks at many of the same factors that we looked at here.  Our judgmental report looks at many others, but it faces the same set of challenges.  We try to say, “How do conditions look today relative to history.”  And that’s easy, because in the case of those indicators for which we have some history, we can say, “Well, things are high or low, and high is good or low is bad,” and put together an assessment.  The more difficult challenge is that, historically, there may be indicators—for example, like the historical amount of leverage of banking organizations—for which our assessment now is that it always was too low.  And so, of course, it’s high now, but the question is:  Is it high enough. If you look at the quantitative indicators, various categories are not green or yellow as they are in our judgmental assessment, but are ice-blue cold.  So, for example, if you look at the picture for capitalization in the bank sector, all of the numbers are much higher than before,   much higher than at any other time for the data that we have. Our judgmental assessment is, indeed, capital positions of banking organizations are much improved, that we’ve put in place new requirements.  The banks have transitioned to them.  Indeed, they have in most cases already exceeded things like the leverage ratio under the proposed U.S. G-SIB surcharge.  Our assessment there would be that if things are actually much improved, they may be green or something.  I don’t know about ice-blue cold, like in the pure quantitative approach. And then if we were to look elsewhere, there really haven’t been changes.  So that’s why we have a green for financial-sector leverage and not a blue. For example, on maturity transformation, if you look at the chart I showed you, net short-term funding is much reduced from a cyclical perspective. In other charts that are in our report, high-quality liquid assets are up within the banking sector.  So there seems to be a reduction in maturity transformation and in liquidity risk in the banking sector.  Nonetheless, if we think of leverage or maturity transformation outside the banking sector through securitization or other vehicles, those are much reduced, but some of that reflects more cyclical positions, and there haven’t been as many structural reforms on the shadow banking side.  There we would still note that we have yet to see what the effects of money market reform will be. Those proposals are only coming into effect next year.  We note increased liquidity transformation in mutual funds.  I highlighted bond and loan funds, but there may be other cases as well. I think we do see the structural vulnerability as still being important, and that’s why we have a much more yellow assessment than the sort of blue thing.  I mean, the cyclical position looks weaker than what our judgmental assessment would be, and that reflects the structural factors. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thomas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing additional context and discussing different approaches and assessments.


Passage number 313.
 MR. LAUBACH.  My apologies, Madam Chair.  I just want to quickly add one little bit to David’s and Steve’s responses to President Evans’s earlier question. I think for the “Weaker Wage Growth” scenario, one thing to keep in mind is that, from the perspective of not the inertial Taylor rule but the Taylor (1999) rule, right now the funds rate is surprisingly depressed, as you may remember from Tealbook B.  Taylor (1999) would say it already would be at 2 percent now.  And I think one thing that’s going away in that simulation is, effectively, this factor that is keeping the funds rate depressed.  So even though inflation is running so low, it’s appropriate under that rule that policymakers gradually bring the funds rate back up.  I think the peculiar thing is in that scenario, even though inflation is so low from a real-activity perspective, the economy looks reasonably healthy because the unemployment rate is running relatively low.  So the rule looks at it as though the economy is actually strong.  Now, this is how the scenario is being constructed, and you might, of course, ask yourself, if you find yourself in such a situation, whether you then might want to reassess what, for example, the level of the natural rate is, but that is outside the scope of this scenario.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is an explanation of a scenario and how a specific rule would apply to it.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 314.
 MR. EVANS. Right.  Thank you.  I think that’s an example of why these simple rules can often keep us well away from our goals because we’re holding to a rule like that, when all of a sudden there’s something else going on that’s unusual historically.  We ought to offer some additional accommodation; or that’s my interpretation of that.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. In this passage, Mr. Evans expresses his belief that adhering strictly to simple rules can prevent us from reaching our goals. However, Chair Yellen's response is not provided, so it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement between them.


Passage number 315.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have two questions for David Wilcox and one for Steve Kamin.  I’m looking at the forecast summary, panel 5, PCE prices. When you’re talking about output gap estimates, and we’ve talked about this issue before, you say, “Well, there’s a lot of model uncertainty as well and other types of uncertainty,” so the shaded region is really understating the amount of uncertainty associated with this estimate.  Then I go look at the PCE prices, let’s say, for the fourth quarter of 2015, and I wonder if something similar applies so that this confidence region is actually much wider than it appears. And what always gets me in looking at these pictures is, it looks to me like half the probability is above 2 percent and half the probability is below 2 percent.  So, really, insofar as we can learn something informative from this model about inflation in the fourth quarter of 2015, it is that it’s a coin flip whether headline inflation will be above or below 2 percent at that point. Is that a fair assessment or is that an overstatement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 316.
 MR. WILCOX. Well, let me clarify first.  My comments about the confidence interval being understated pertained to panel 4, which comes out of the state-based model.  Now, with regard to panel 5, I think it’s less obvious that the confidence interval there understates the true uncertainty.  For one thing, while we use FRB/US-based stochastic simulations to generate the confidence intervals in this panel, we also benchmark those against the actual track record of the staff in real-time forecasting, and we get confidence intervals that are a little narrower for the FRB/US model than for the staff real-time track record.  But the two are broadly consistent. That said, I think there are some important aspects of those confidence intervals that we’ve been digging into deeper lately, pertaining to issues like the ones that you raised about symmetry, for example.  And my expectation is that, over the course of the next six months or so, we’re going to be trying out some new products in the Tealbook that attempt to address those kinds of issues.  For now, I take these confidence intervals as helpful, indicative, but even we don’t confuse them with the gospel truth or anything like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their thoughts on confidence intervals and discussing the possibility of addressing certain issues with new products in the future.


Passage number 317.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Let me turn to panel 6, then, which is core inflation.  Because it’s President Fisher’s final meeting, I’ll ask you whether it would be possible to do some of theanalysis in the future based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s trimmed mean of PCE price index as possibly a more rigorous way to think about a smooth measure of inflation instead of core inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question about the possibility of using a different measure of inflation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 318.
 MR. WILCOX.  Well, I hate to send President Fisher out on a disappointing note, but I’m a little skeptical about our ability to do that.  That would be a pretty thoroughgoing exercise because we’d have to recalibrate our models.  This would not be a simple undertaking. The implications of that, I think, would run fairly deep through the structure of the model.  I don’t want to be encouraging about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage shows disagreement or contention because Mr. Wilcox expresses skepticism about the ability to recalibrate their models and mentions that it would not be a simple undertaking.


Passage number 319.
 MR. BULLARD.  You’re saying you’re going to use an inferior measure permanently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that someone plans to use an inferior measure permanently.


Passage number 320.
  [Laughter] MR. WILCOX. We’re going to use the measure that the Committee had indicated that it is focusing on as their objective for monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges the committee's indicated measure and states that they will use it as the objective for monetary policy.


Passage number 321.
 MR. BULLARD.  No, headline inflation is the objective.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that headline inflation is the objective, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 322.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes, and the one that is most closely related to that.  Also, I’m making a cost-benefit judgment that, in terms of the priority of some of our modeling projects that we have in the pipeline—as helpful as that one might be—I can’t really process in real time what that would be.  Some of the other projects that we have in mind for analytical development, I think, will pay very big dividends.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is discussing their own priorities and judgments regarding modeling projects, without any mention of conflicting viewpoints or disagreement.


Passage number 323.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  I’m going to interpret that to mean you think it wouldn’t make that much difference relative to the time cost that would be involved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply restating the other person's opinion or perspective.


Passage number 324.
 MR. WILCOX. Correct, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any context or specific information to determine if there is contention or disagreement. The statement is a simple acknowledgement or agreement.


Passage number 325.
 MR. BULLARD. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only presents a statement from Mr. Bullard without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 326.
 MR. FISHER.   Madam Chair, let it be recorded, I appreciate being fought over.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses appreciation for being "fought over," implying that different parties or individuals may have shown interest or advocated for his position or involvement. This statement indicates a positive sentiment toward being valued or sought after, rather than any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 327.
  [Laughter] MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Let me turn to the presentation “The Foreign Outlook,” exhibit 1, panel 1, “Foreign GDP.” I’m interpreting what you said was, you turned something in to the Tealbook, but then the ECB surprised you to the positive side.  You upgraded the forecast, which is in panel 2, and now it looks like you’re really not changing your world GDP outlook appreciably, according to my reading of panel 1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply a conversation where one person is interpreting and summarizing information from a presentation.


Passage number 328.
 MR. KAMIN.  That’s essentially correct, although the unexpected part of the increment to euro-area GDP growth that we have built in, in response to the announcement, was in the neighborhood of ¼ percentage point per year for all of the next few years.  With the euro area in general having a weight in our foreign aggregate that’s less than 20 percent, or in that neighborhood, it didn’t end up changing the foreign GDP line that much.  So before the announcement, our current forecast, that black solid color line, was just a teeny bit below where it is now.  I think the story both before and after the announcement was pretty much the same, which is that our outlook was broadly unchanged.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining that the increment to euro-area GDP growth following the announcement had a minimal effect on the overall foreign GDP line, and that the outlook remained broadly unchanged before and after the announcement.


Passage number 329.
 MR. BULLARD. Well, I think one of the things that the Committee is going to debate is uncertainty surrounding that outlook.  According to you all, has uncertainty associated with that outlook changed, or is it about the same.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is simply stating that the committee will be discussing the uncertainty surrounding the outlook and is asking if that uncertainty has changed.


Passage number 330.
 MR. KAMIN.  Well, okay.  So it’s good to focus on the difference between the change in the modal outlook and the increment to the confidence interval.  There are plenty of uncertainties in the outlook, both on the upside and the downside, and arguably some of those have gotten wider over the past few months.  But I think you could argue that the ECB announcement, representing this forceful action by the ECB, might have diminished the downside risks for the euro area in addition to boosting the modal outlook for the euro area a bit, because all the additional asset purchases probably provide some cushion against financial downside risks, particularly those, for example, that might emanate from Greece.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation and discussing different factors and possibilities.


Passage number 331.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange of gratitude and acknowledgment between Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 332.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.  I wanted to follow up on President Bullard’s conversation with David about chart 5 on the forecast summary.  Are these numbers quarterly or are they 12-month averages.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 337.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Okay.  That’s helpful to know when I look at Tealbook A. On page 72 there’s a report on probability of inflation events, and the probability of inflation being below 1 percent over the course of 2015 is reported to be 74 percent. The probability of being below 2 percent is pretty high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating information from a report.

Passage number 340.
 MR. BULLARD.  Sure, okay. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So next we have an opportunity to make comments on financial stability, and I have, I believe, three people who have asked to be recognized.  I’ll start with President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are having a conversation and there is no indication of disagreement or tension between them.


Passage number 341.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I’ll be pretty quick.  I just want to follow up on President George’s comment.  She used the word “reassuring,” and, I guess, when I look at the global context for financial stability, “reassuring” would probably not be how I would characterize it, and it gets to her comment on structural vulnerabilities.  So while the overall forecast for Europe seems like it’s improved with the policy change, the risk of a pretty bad outcome, that tail risk, probably has gone up with the Greek election and other things going on with Russia and Ukraine. And when I think about whether the domestic characterization of asset valuation, leverage, and maturity would pick up the global financial shocks, I’m not sure.  We’ve kind of structured our monitoring, which I think is very useful, to a domestic shock that occurred last time.  And if I think about importing a financial shock from abroad, that might be a different transmission mechanism.  The report highlights, for example, the money market funds’ holdings of European securities. But during the fall of 2011, it seemed like the broker-dealers were actually one of the major transmission mechanisms, in two respects.  One is, our monoline broker-dealers got very elevated credit default swap rates, which started to create financial vulnerabilities potentially in the United States, and we started to get worried about some of the monoline investment banks.  And going the other way, European banks are still very large in terms of their very large broker-dealers in the United States.  So a serious problem in Europe on transmission mechanisms would be through the broker-dealers. It’s just a comment about maybe thinking about financial stability shocks that are not domestically oriented. Emerging markets and Europe right now would strike me as two areas.  We talk about the exchange rate and net exports, the financial transmission mechanism separate from those two might be an area to think about at future times.  So that’s just an observation that follows up on President George’s. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 342.
 MS. GEORGE.  I’m not going to make any further comments.  I think Michael answered my question on structural issues. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  And, last, I have President Fisher’s name, with a question mark.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Both Ms. George and Chair Yellen are in agreement that they will not make any further comments, and they acknowledge that Michael answered Ms. George's question on structural issues. The mention of President Fisher's name with a question mark does not indicate disagreement or contention; it simply suggests that there is uncertainty about his presence or participation.


Passage number 343.
 MR. FISHER.  No, ma’am. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  And is there anybody else who would like to comment. Vice Chair.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 344.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. One thing I worry about, and I guess I’d encourage the staff to look at, is that, in Germany and Japan right now, we have 10-year interest rates that are extraordinarily low.  And if central banks actually do achieve their objective of getting back to 2 percent inflation, it would seem that those bond yields are going to move pretty substantially.  And I think it would be useful to understand what the consequences of that type of bond market revaluation might be, because it could be several hundred basis points in a fairly short period of time if they actually are successful in what they are trying to engineer.  I just think that would be worth taking a look at.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Others.  Nellie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing concern and suggesting further analysis.


Passage number 345.
 MS. LIANG.  Madam Chair, may I respond to one comment by President Rosengren. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, of course.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Liang simply asks for permission to respond to a comment made by President Rosengren, and Chair Yellen grants her request.


Passage number 346.
  MS. LIANG.  We have in the past year looked at transmission channels to the United States from both the EMEs and China through—besides oil and the economy—financial-institution channels.  And that would include, first and foremost, through the large banks, including broker-dealers and the trading books and the loan exposures, et cetera.  So we have tried to trace that, and in the end, at least over the past year or so, we feel that most of the transmission will be through the economy, through real activity, and that the financial sectors themselves don’t have the direct exposures.  That’s not to say there can’t be a lot of indirect exposures, because some of the European banks could have large exposures to the EMEs.  Almost certainly they have bigger exposures than banks do in the United States.  But, first order, we have been looking at it.  I think we’ve gotten a little bit of comfort.  I don’t know if “reassuring” is the right word.  I don’t think we used “reassuring,” but we’ve gotten some comfort from the fact that institutions recognize these channels and have been taking steps to reduce their exposures, especially to Europe, in the past couple of years. So it’s a trend. We did, I think, evaluate shocks from the EMEs and from China recently, in the past six months or year.  We’ve looked at them closely.  We’d be happy to send that to you if you haven’t seen it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing their assessment of the transmission channels from EMEs and China to the United States and the steps taken by financial institutions to reduce their exposures. There is no conflicting viewpoint or contradiction in the passage.


Passage number 347.
 MR. KAMIN.  And I would add that in the case of our deep dives in the QS report, both on China’s financial system and on emerging market turbulence, we looked very carefully not just at the possibility of these instabilities abroad, but also the channels by which they might affect the U.S. financial system.  And our plans are to work more on this to formalize our analysis of the financial-stability issues abroad and bring them into the overall picture of U.S. financial stability. CHAIR YELLEN. Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Kamin and Chair Yellen are in agreement about the need to consider the potential instabilities abroad and how they could affect the US financial system.


Passage number 348.
   MS. BRAINARD.  On the international front, obviously, the things that we have been most focused on are risks in Europe, Japan, and China.  But as we think about the combination of continued dollar strengthening and a potential interest rate change, there is going to be a different set of countries and financial markets and corporate sectors that have some exposures there.  And we’re probably not that exposed in concentrated ways, but we should certainly be monitoring that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing potential risks and exposures in different countries and financial markets, highlighting the need for monitoring the situation.


Passage number 349.
 MR. KAMIN. We are, certainly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Kamin, is discussing a topic or issue without expressing any disagreement or debate.


Passage number 350.
 MS. LIANG. We are, absolutely.  We think we will have that in two meetings from now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Liang is expressing agreement with an unspecified topic or statement, stating that "we are" agreeing, and that they expect to have something in two meetings. However, without further context, it is unclear what they are in agreement about or what they expect to have.


Passage number 351.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any further comment. All right.  After looking very carefully, I see none.  So what I’m going to suggest is that we begin our economic go-round and maybe go for 20 or 25 minutes, and then have a coffee break.  And to start us off, President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Brainard, is thanking someone and there is a suggestion made by Chair Yellen without any objections.


Passage number 352.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In recent weeks, our anecdotal reports have become noticeably more optimistic on balance.  For example, a bank CEO from South Carolina said “Fear has subsided,” and that loan demand and credit quality are now better than at any time since 2007.  He also added that an increase in the funds rate would be no event, in his view, because borrowing costs would still be quite low.  Our other bankers are reporting good growth in pipelines as well and are using excess liquidity to support new lending.  Both our composite manufacturing index and our services revenue index, released just this morning, indicated continuing broad expansion in our District in January, and expectations for six months ahead are remarkably high in both surveys as well. I will add that our retail services sector index rebounded significantly after dropping from November to December.  In housing, the continuing themes and reports in the Fifth District are strength in multifamilies and sluggishness in single-family housing.  A comment from one of our directors, the CEO of a bank with an activemortgage servicing business, was typical of what we are hearing.  He said that he doubts that first-time homeowners are coming back anytime soon. With regard to national conditions, the key element in the Tealbook forecast is the trajectory of consumer spending.  The spending data we’ve received in the past few months of 2014 were quite strong on the whole, and the Tealbook has revised its projections of consumer spending growth markedly higher.  The staff now expects consumption growth at about 4 percent this year and 3½ percent for next year.  Compared with the 2¼ percent consumption growth we saw for most of this expansion, this represents a noteworthy pickup, and I’m now convinced that this is likely to persist. Falling gasoline prices have no doubt provided a significant boost to real income and real spending, but this is a one-time level effect, and the growth effect is likely to dissipate in a couple of quarters.  The strength in consumer spending has also been driven, I think, by improving labor markets and higher net worth.  My sense is that these will leave a more lasting imprint on consumer spending growth after the one-time level effect of the decline in oil prices has played out.  So I think consumer spending growth this year is likely to start out strong but tail off perhaps a little earlier than in the Tealbook. I also concur with several other elements of the Tealbook forecast.  Nonresidential investment looks positive, with an improved outlook for equipment and tangibles offsetting weakness in oil and gas exploration.  Government spending will be flat, and net exports are likely to be a drag on economic growth, because of the strength in the dollar.  On housing I’m not nearly as optimistic as the Tealbook, though, because I think the shift in housing preferences that we’ve seen is likely to be more persistent.  The bottom line is, my GDP forecast would be somewhat below Tealbook for this year and next but still stronger than it was in recent meetings. Turning to inflation, I’d like to thank the staff for their extensive and very timely analysis of inflation expectations.  The TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation have been grinding lower over the past several months, and it’s natural to worry about whether that reflects an erosion in credibility of our commitment to 2 percent inflation. It’s striking that, as documented in the Tealbook and the accompanying memo, an array of approaches using different methods and different data all indicate that longer-run inflation expectations—as opposed to compensation—have been quite stable, even as headline and core inflation have fallen in recent months. If oil prices were to decline further, it would put further downward pressure on headline inflation and might yet pose a risk to inflation expectations.  However, if oil prices have reached bottom for this cycle, as it appears may be the case, then the stability thus far of measures of expected inflation would make me fairly confident that we will emerge with inflation expectations well anchored near our target, and that core inflation will move back to 2 percent. Barring further shocks, I would expect that to occur somewhat more rapidly than at the glacial pace shown in the Tealbook. The striking divergence between inflation compensation and inflation expectations over the past few months highlights the importance of the distinction between the two.  At times it’s easy to treat compensation and expectations as synonymous, but I’m afraid that we are not always careful enough about this difference in our external communications.  We have been careful with the literal wording of our statement.  The last sentence in the first paragraph says, “Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.”  That’s the sentence in the first paragraph.  But this may place too much emphasis on measures that we know areflawed as indicators of expected inflation. It leaves out the fact that market-based measures of inflation expectations have also remained stable.  I think we should be quite mindful, as we go forward, of that distinction between inflation expectations and compensation, and in future communications I think we should try to find a way to deemphasize inflation compensation and draw more attention to market-based measures of expected inflation. One final thought:  The economic outlook has improved significantly in the past six months.  I think the inflation outlook could also change significantly over a short period as well.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.

Passage number 354.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The economy is showing solid momentum, with positive news from nearly every sector.  Given continued exceptional job growth and steady declines in unemployment and other measures of slack, I expect our full employment goal will be reached by the end of this year, if not sooner.  The improving labor market along with the plunge in energy prices have also brightened prospects for households.  Consumer sentiment and consumer expectations of future income growth have jumped sharply. While our economic recovery from the Great Recession is nearing completion, the opposite is true abroad, where progress has been halting.  The strong global cross-currents that are present in the outlook require special attention, and in this regard the recent announcement of further quantitative easing by the ECB is very welcome news for economic growth prospects.  The various global factors, including the plunge in oil prices, the stronger dollar, and the bond rally, appear largely offsetting, and these developments seem to be a modest boost for U.S. growth this year and a modest negative in 2016. Specifically, since our previous meeting, like the Tealbook, I have edged up my forecast for U.S. real GDP growth this year to nearly   percent, and based on the maximum employment mandate alone, we should be in the process of normalizing policy already. Of course, the big question mark is the outlook for inflation.  Actually, for a brief moment there were some disturbing developments in the intermeeting period.  You know, being at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, we look at a lot of high-tech measures of economic and financial conditions and use Google Trends, and we noticed a lot of discussion of deflation.  But then, of course, we found it was another one of these New England Patriots activities.

Passage number 358.
 WILLIAMS.  I do know that the defense in Seattle are buying many air pumps so they’ll make sure that the balls are properly inflated for the Super Bowl. In terms of the underlying trend in inflation, we’re only about ½ percentage point below our objective, but our continued progress toward that objective remains a forecast.  And like any forecast, it is subject to uncertainty and risks.  Of course, the drop in energy prices has pushed down headline year-over-year inflation numbers to zero and even into negative territory.  Even for core inflation, I expect the downward price pressures from a stronger dollar and the path to a lower energy price will offset for a time the upward pressure arising from reduced slack. Based on the experience of the past two decades, these transitory influences should not have persistently depressing effects on inflation, and I continue to expect a gradual move back of inflation toward our 2 percent objective over the next two years.  I find some support for this view when I look at disaggregated PCE price data.  First, and I actually have this written down, the trimmed mean PCE price index—which I do refer to quite often here and in the public,   because I do find it a useful measure of underlying inflation—shows little sign of deceleration.  Second, my staff finds that, at least so far, the disinflationary pressures seen in overall PCE prices are driven by a relatively narrow set of items. That is, the current downward price movements are not nearly as broad based as they were, for example, during the 2009 to 2010 episode, when expenditure-weighted diffusion indexes showed the price declines distributed across a wide swath of categories. A key driver of my expectation that inflation will gradually return to our objective is the reduction in economic slack, but there is some uncertainty about the strength of this linkage, and a Phillips curve, broadly interpreted, can be formulated in many different ways.  In this regard, I too appreciated the Tealbook’s special “Alternative View” box that examined a nonlinear version of the Phillips curve as a substitute for the Tealbook’s baseline specification. More generally, I think such alternative perspectives are really valuable and helpful, and I applaud each and every one of them for helping us avoid the trap of groupthink and really helping us think through some of these important issues. Now, theoretical support for a nonlinear Phillips curve can be found in the downward rigidity of nominal wages.  As the Tealbook showed, the problem faced by standard Phillips curve models is that, despite the substantial fall in unemployment over the past several years, nominal compensation growth has remained tepid.  As I described last April, my staff has found that this pattern of weak nominal wage growth during the early and middle parts of the economic recovery is not unique to this episode.  In fact, in the recoveries of the early 1990s and the early 2000s, we saw a very similar pattern in which wage gains lagged the cycle.  In each episode, unemployment gaps narrowed significantly before nominal wage growth picked up from low levels. To explain this lag in wage acceleration, my staff focused on difficulties in cutting nominal wages.  The constraint on wage cuts was particularly binding after the Great Recession, due to the severity of economic shocks along with the low inflation rate.  As a result, a very high share of workers reported that they earned the same wage as they had a year earlier. Now, in a flexible market, many of these workers would receive wage cuts during the recession.  So wage growth fell, in fact, by less during the recession than it would have otherwise.  As a result, once the economy starts to recover, there is a stock of past-deferred wage cuts that need to be slowly overcome as inflation and productivity growth bring real wages back into the balance before nominal wage growth can return to normal.  Additional recent work by my staff finds further support for this mechanism by looking at cross-industry comparisons.  They show that this stock of pent-up wage cuts that needs to be worked off is bigger in those industries for which the downward nominal wage rigidity appears to be most prevalent.  These are the industries in which nominal wage growth has been slow relative to declines in unemployment.  In industries for which rigidities are less widespread, nominal wage growth has returned to levels more consistent with the current labor market conditions. The key takeaway from all of this work is that the recent tepid wage growth is, in fact, entirely consistent with an improving labor market in a low-inflation environment.  As we close in on full employment over the next year, the return to more normal patterns of wage growth should reemerge.  Indeed, we are seeing incipient signs of this normalization already with the share of workers experiencing zero wage adjustments starting to come down.  Now, all told, this process should help inflation move back to target.  Thank you.

Passage number 373.
 MR. LACKER.  If I could just offer a brief and friendly rejoinder to my friend from Minneapolis.  The first thing to say is that I don’t feel that the inflation-expectations measure is any more magical than things like underutilization of labor or maximum employment or the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  But on a more serious note, I commend the Minneapolis Fed for putting in print a very clear explanation for both a broad audience and a technical audience of the relationship between inflation compensation and inflation expectations. I thought it was a great contribution. It makes clear that inflation expectations are a simple weighted average where the weights are probabilities of future possible inflation rates.  Inflation compensation is the same thing, one in which the weights combine both the probability and the margin of utility or a version of the states of the world in which particular inflation rates take place.I’m very sympathetic to the notion that deriving our behavior from the fundamentals of individuals’ welfare would lead us to take very seriously those margin utilities. On the other hand, I view our consensus statement as basically making a statement about expected inflation, about what inflation itself is supposed to average, not the combination of inflation and a marginal utility. I think it’s a little easier to picture, a little easier for people to imagine, easier for people to think about.  And to use an analogy I’ve used several times before, it’s easier to put into your retirement-planning software than it is to put in inflation compensation.  That motivates my focus on this.  But I just wanted to acknowledge, first of all, the contribution of the exposition and, in addition, the worthy point that the preferences of the people that make up our economy are important to take into account.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a friendly response acknowledging and appreciating the contribution of the Minneapolis Fed and discussing different perspectives on inflation expectations.


Passage number 374.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I will forgo the opportunity of offering a further rejoinder to the rejoinder.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 375.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Deflation has been in the headlines of the leading New England papers all week, although rather than focusing on the general price level, they have focused on 12 footballs used in the Patriots game. [Laughter]  So I didn’t ignore President Williams’s observation.  Interestingly, taking credit for deflation seems no more popular for football players than it is for central bankers.  My own view of recent data is that we should be particularly humble about future inflation trends and be sure that we learn from the mistakes of our Japanese and European colleagues to ensure that we do not allow inflation to drift significantly below our inflation goal. Reconciling the message from the real economy with readings on inflation is a bit complicated at this point.  There has been a clear improvement in labor markets, reflected by the 5.6 percent U-3 measure of unemployment.  However, the ultimate success of policy should not be judged by how much improvement has occurred from a truly horrific outcome, but how long it will take to achieve our dual goals.  For unemployment, that is complicated by the lack of precision in measuring full employment.  In light of the absence of wage and price pressures in aggregate or disaggregated data, and the fact that since 2007 the workforce has become more educated and older, I’ve reduced my estimate of the full-employment unemployment rate to 5 percent, and it’s quite possible that evidence over the next year may convince me to move it even lower. However, unlike our unemployment goal, our inflation goal is absolutely precise.  We have a 2 percent PCE inflation goal.  In the presence of the oil shock, focus on core inflation seems justified.  In fact, for this very reason, I would have preferred to focus on core inflation as our target when we chose the target. My forecast for core inflation for 2015 is below the Tealbook forecast and much below our 2 percent target.  My low inflation forecast is unfortunately consistent with the growing evidence in financial market prices of the loss in confidence that we will attain our inflation goal any time soon.  The 10-year Treasury rate is below 2 percent, and a variety of forward spreads that embed inflation expectations are at lows last seen during the financial crisis. These financial signals are concerning and should make us less confident that we will reach our inflation goal within a reasonable time. While we can parse the data to downplay its importance, in view of the forceful monetary actions being taken in Europe and Japan to reverse their historically low inflation rates, we should be quite sure we are not repeating their mistakes.  In both Europe and Japan, large inflation misses have proved to be quite difficult to reverse. I take little comfort in stable survey measures. In Japan, longer-run survey-based inflation expectations were surprisingly stable even after the data had made it quite clear that Japan had a deflation problem.  Nor do I take comfort in inflation equations that have been adjusted over the years to reflect a “well-anchored” assumption, because most of these models are used to replace inflation models that failed to reflect changes in expectation settings since the mid-1980s.  We may once again be missing how expectations are formed at a time when central banks in developed countries globally are having difficulty reaching their inflation goals. Finally, the risks to even our good news on the real side of the economy seem skewed to the downside.  Actions by Russian dissidents in Ukraine and the potential for Greek political upheaval are both troubling.  The likelihood of significant negative shocks is too high, in view of our inability to offset their effects completely.  I am a patient person. I hope patience is sufficient.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.

Passage number 376.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The anecdotal reports we received in the cycle of District contracts ending last week broadly line up with the incoming data.  We heard positive and optimistic characterizations of demand and hiring needs side by side with decidedly cool descriptions of business expectations for input cost inflation, wage pressures, and pricing power.  Oil and gas exploration spending is being curtailed, and some layoffs in that sector are occurring.  Otherwise our contacts generally confirm a continuing, rather robust pace of business activity.  Labor demand is reasonably strong and consistent with sustained payroll jobs growth,   similar to that which we’ve seen in recent months.  The wages picture really hasn’t changed substantively.  Firms report an intent to give raises of 2 to 3 percent on average. There seems to be growing anticipation of wage pressure, but this hasn’t yet translated into broad compensation pressure and action in response. Finally, the improving tenor of business sentiment seems to be generating greater appetite for business investment.  Capital expenditures for expansion are being mentioned across a broad swath of industries, most notably in the transportation sector. My outlook is little changed from the December meeting and pretty much in line with the Tealbook.  With the strength evident in the second half of 2014, I’m assuming a GDP growth run rate of around 3 percent.  Both the recent incoming data and anecdotal reports have increased my confidence in that view.  Associated with this optimism about economic growth, I expect continuing payroll job strength and declining headline unemployment.  I continue to project the U-3 unemployment rate to reach 5.3 percent by year-end, consistent with the December SEP central tendency, and I would not be surprised if a U-3 reading at this level came earlier. My outlook for prices has year-over-year headline PCE near zero at midyear.  I’m not expecting much of a pass-through of lower crude oil prices and declining gasoline and refined product prices on core inflation numbers.  But at the same time, I expect no real firming of core inflation readings over the coming months, and I am increasingly apprehensive about dismissing the behavior of market-based inflation expectations measures. It’s evident to me that the discussion of the timing of liftoff in the go-round following this one reflects some sentiment in the Committee favoring June liftoff.  A projected June liftoff could imply the signaling of that potentiality in March.  I’m not very comfortable with that prospect given the Committee’s repeated promulgation of data dependency as our guiding light.  Between now and our March FOMC meeting, we will get really only one incremental monthly   retail price report, the January CPI and PCE reports.  I’m not hopeful that this January data will clarify matters and bolster confidence that the inflation trend is soon to turn in the direction of our target. So any forecast-based signals sent in March that start a two-meeting countdown to liftoff will rely on rather light evidence, in my view.  I think there is a good chance that it will feel more like a leap of faith than a data-informed forecast. Let me end on what, for me, is a discomfiting thought.  I’m finding it difficult to reconcile the data on growth in employment with the data on wages and prices. To say this differently, I see a puzzling and confusing disconnect between the strong real economy performance represented by top-line GDP growth and labor market data, on the one hand, and wage and price trends on the other.  I don’t think we can entirely rule out the possibility that an unusual and persistent state of the world is developing.  This is a legitimate question.  It’s not going to be resolved in any serious way by the next meeting.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an overview of various aspects of the economy and giving their own analysis and outlook. They mention both positive and negative factors, but there is no indication of disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 377.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Third District economy continues to grow modestly and is improving in all three of our states, and our coincident indexes are showing growth in line with the nation.  Notable progress is occurring in the areas of commercial construction, and the value of contracts is now stronger than any time since 2001.  Job growth has been rather robust, with the overall District unemployment rate falling by 0.7 percentage point over the three months ending in December to 5.4 percent.  Pennsylvania’s unemployment rate is now down to 4.8 percent, and initial claims in the region are at their lowest level since 2001. Bank lending on C&I loans was particularly robust in December, increasing 22 percent, and is up 10 percent year over year.  Credit card usage was also higher in December than a year ago, reflecting a holiday season that was better than last year’s.Our manufacturing sector, however, seems to have experienced some loss of momentum similar to that experienced in the nation as a whole.  Because of some abnormal seasonal behavior, it’s probably best to average through December and January’s general activity indexes. That average yields a value of 15.3, a number that’s consistent with continued moderate growth, but is off the peaks we saw earlier in the fall.  Also, the unemployment index nudged into negative territory in the most recent survey.  However, the respondents still appear optimistic.  The future activity index came in at 50.9, and the future employment index remains at a high level.  Thus, it appears that our manufacturers are regarding the current lull as largely transitory. The pace of activity in our nonmanufacturing business index also witnessed a noticeable decline, and our housing sector continues to be weak with little signs of strong renewal. However, I think we have to recall that in the second and third quarters of this past year, we witnessed real GDP growth of 4.6 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively.  It should not be surprising that the fourth quarter has not kept up such a torrid pace.  That’s consistent with the weakening numbers, and it suggests growth, but at a somewhat slower pace.  Even with the softer fourth quarter, we are likely to observe the last three quarters of 2014 as showing above 4 percent GDP growth. Regarding the national outlook, I’m still fairly confident that the economy will grow above trend in 2014 at about 3 percent.  A good deal of my optimism revolves around continued increasing strength in the labor market that’s reflected in almost all of the labor market data we have seen. The strength in the labor markets, along with improved household access to credit and falling prices at the pump, imply that consumer spending will support somewhat above-trend growth.  There are, of course, some risks.  The likely suspects are weakening conditions in Europe and China and the effects of a stronger dollar.  Yet overall lower oil prices are also apositive for Japan, China, India, and Europe.  And while the stronger dollar may weaken exports, the overall magnitude of such trade channel effects within the U.S. economy remains modest. While headline inflation, as expected, has been pushed down by falling oil prices, we should look through such relative price movements in this regard as we’ve done in the past.  I’m comforted by the fact that alternative metrics of underlying inflation, which have already been mentioned—such as medians, trimmed means, and other statistics—have remained remarkably stable over this period.  That should be encouraging to us about what the future may hold.  And as has been pointed out by President Lacker, the decline in oil prices may be near the low point for this cycle and, therefore, inflation should begin to strengthen and perhaps may strengthen much faster than the Tealbook anticipates.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any indication of contention or disagreement. The speaker provides information and analysis about the economic conditions in the Third District and the national outlook without presenting opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 378.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The 10th District economy continues to expand at a moderate pace.  The effects of the decline in oil prices have, on net, been favorable, with nearly 50 percent of firms in our manufacturing and services surveys reporting a positive effect on their business, while around 20 percent report a negative effect.  Of course, District states that are most dependent on energy production—Wyoming, Oklahoma, and New Mexico— face a somewhat less favorable outlook. Oil rig counts have started to decline rapidly, and capital spending is expected to be down considerably in 2015.  Based on our quarterly energy survey, nearly half of respondents expect more than a 20 percent reduction in capital spending this year.  Significant layoffs are already being announced at some District energy firms, and more are expected.  Analysis of hedging and debt positions shows that firms headquartered in the 10th District, which account for about one-third of all large independents, are comparable to other U.S. shale oil firms but with sizable differences across those firms.  In general, the smaller firms are more highly leveraged, but also better hedged, than the large firms.  Although most states now rely considerably less on the oil   and gas extraction sector than 30 years ago, it is possible that energy-dependent states like Oklahoma could experience double-digit percentage declines in energy sector jobs, and perhaps slight declines in overall employment. For the nation as a whole, my outlook for economic activity is little changed from the previous meeting.  Weaker foreign economic growth and a stronger dollar may weigh on GDP, but lower energy prices, on net, should provide a boost.  As a result, I continue to anticipate moderate growth of around 3 percent this year.  Consumer spending was strong in the second half of last year, and consumers’ assessments of current economic and labor market conditions have brightened.  I expect low oil prices and further labor market improvements to provide ongoing support to household spending. The labor market has maintained its momentum, and my outlook for further improvement is optimistic based on the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City’s labor market conditions indicators, which showed that the level of activity improved again in December, and its momentum rose to its highest level over the past two decades.  Of particular note, among the 24 labor market variables that are used to construct this index, the five strongest contributors to improvement over the past six months are predominantly leading indicators—a rise in the quits rate, a decline in those working part time for economic reasons, improved job flows from unemployment to employment, an increase in the percent of firms planning to increase employment, and a shift downward in the Blue Chip unemployment rate forecast. In an environment of above-trend economic growth and falling unemployment, of course, inflation remains low. Clearly, lower oil prices and the stronger dollar will exert some downward pressure in the near term, but these are relative-price movements that should prove temporary and not affect the longer-term inflation outlook.  For this reason, the recent decline in   market-based measures looks puzzling, as others have discussed, and I agree that this is a development that we will need to watch. While inflation is running below our stated quantitative objective, it is less clear to me at this point that the goal of price stability over the longer run is at risk.  Furthermore, I do not think we can judge the cost of low inflation in isolation from other economic developments.  Inflation below target in an environment of above-trend economic growth and falling unemployment seems less of a concern to me than low inflation combined with slowing economic growth and rising unemployment.  As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, my forecast implies that inflation will move upward, and spare capacity and tightening of labor markets will gradually lift inflation back toward target.  So unless signs emerge that the economy’s performance is faltering, I see no need to delay normalization for the purpose of accelerating a return to 2 percent.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker mentions both positive and negative effects of the decline in oil prices, indicating some disagreement or conflicting viewpoints. Additionally, the speaker discusses the puzzling decline in market-based measures of inflation and expresses different concerns about low inflation in different economic circumstances.


Passage number 379.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’ll be saying a lot of what has been said before, but I guess we’re taking a consensus.  It won’t be entirely in the consensus, though. What has been happening to activity is very impressive.  Economic growth forecasts of most people around the table are around 3 percent.  The Tealbook has 2.8 percent, essentially, for 2015 and 2016.  And, of course, the unemployment rate is now very close to our estimates of the natural rate. We have consumer sentiment doing very well.  We have low oil prices, which almost everyone sees as positive for the economy.  This, includes President Fisher, who sees the negative side of low oil prices as well, but he came out in favor of a net positive effect.  It will have an effect on investment, but housing is beginning to show some signs of growth—it’s nice having a sector that you expected to grow and doesn’t grow, because you know one day it will grow, and then it will contribute to economic growth. I want to say a word about our estimates of the natural rate of unemployment.  I’m going to say something I’ve said here before, and I apologize, but I think it happens to be true, so I’ll keep saying it.  If you look at what economists say the natural rate of unemployment is and run aregression on it—and when I say “economists,” I’m usually talking about Bob Gordon, who at some stage used to produce an estimate of the natural rate of unemployment with sufficient frequency that you could run regressions on it—what you find is that the stated natural rate is 4.5 percent plus half the gap between the actual unemployment rate and 4.5 percent. So poor Vice Chairman Dudley worked very hard to come to roughly—[laughter]—that estimate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 380.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Could have saved a lot of work.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage states a hypothetical situation where something could have saved a lot of work. There is no indication of contention or disagreement between different parties or ideas.


Passage number 381.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Governor Fischer, I want to follow up on what you’ve said, just to understand better.  So the costs of our current policy of remaining accommodative, maybe for a longer time than is envisioned in the Tealbook, for example, are that interest rates would remain unnaturally low, artificially low, and that unemployment would fall below U*. Is that an accurate summary of what you were saying.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Governor Fischer is being asked to confirm if the summary accurately represents his previous statements.


Passage number 382.
 MR. FISCHER.  That’s part of what I was saying, yes.  That’s not the whole story.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Fischer is acknowledging that what he said earlier is only a part of the whole story, indicating agreement rather than disagreement.


Passage number 383.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  And that there’s a de minimis loss associated with having inflation run at 1.8 percent as opposed to 2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there is a small loss associated with having inflation at 1.8 percent instead of 2 percent.


Passage number 384.
 MR. FISCHER.  A de minimis loss for two reasons.  Number one, those utility functions have very little cost to being 0.1 percentage point or 0.2 percentage point away from target.  So just by the nature of what we assume about the tradeoffs, of course, they are not very large.  And, second, I think there is substantial uncertainty about this.  I promise you—and I have the data to prove it—that I wouldn’t worry about 2.4 percent inflation either, and I didn’t.  We were allowed between 1 and 3 percent, and being between 1 and 3 percent meant that when you got to 2.6 percent, you started saying, “Shucks, if we get above 3, we’re going to be in trouble.” So then you’d start doing things.  But there’s a lot of bumping around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage, as the speaker is expressing their own opinion and experiences.


Passage number 385.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  As I think about what you’ve said, the observations about inflation are helpful, but they are not necessarily a guidepost in and of themselves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing his thoughts on the topic and acknowledging that the observations about inflation are useful but not the sole determining factor.


Passage number 386.
MR. FISCHER.  No, they’re not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer states that the subject in question is not something, without any conflicting opinions being presented.


Passage number 387.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Simply saying 1.8 percent is close to 2 percent, well, 2.2 percent could also be close to 2 percent.  We could wait until we get to 2.2 percent.  The cost side is very helpful for me in understanding your perspectives.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing different percentages and expressing a desire for more information.


Passage number 388.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  Okay. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are acknowledging each other's comments and showing agreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 389.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This will be fairly easy for me, because a number of people have already said most of what I wanted to say.  I’ll just make a few points. One, I obviously agree with everybody that general improvement has continued since the previous meeting.  I’d just observe in passing that it was a very damaged economy that needed a lot of improvement.  And because, with the exception of a couple of quarters, the pace of that improvement has never been all that rapid, I, again, don’t think it proves too much to say we’re continuing to improve. Second, and I did check with President Kocherlakota over the weekend to make sure he was going to address inflation so that I’d be able to piggyback on his comments, but happily I can now piggyback on what Presidents Rosengren and Evans said as well.  I guess I’m probably slightly different—although maybe not too different from where President Evans is—in saying I regard this as a downside risk rather than as a modal expectation.  But it’s a very troubling one, if it were to be realized.  And, again, as a noncentral banker and a nonmacroeconomist by training in most of my professional life, I continue to be bemused by the concept of anchored inflation expectations.  I mean, it does seem to me that an awful lot depends on anchored inflation expectations.  I notice in the current Tealbook, for example, that the staff models downplay the decline in TIPS compensation precisely because the surveys suggest that expectations remain  anchored, therefore it all must be okay.  An awful lot of work is being required of a factor that, so far as I can tell, is still not particularly well understood—that is, where it comes from and how it actually functions. That just makes me slightly nervous, but it doesn’t seem to make most of you nervous.  So I don’t know what to make of that. And then, finally, on labor markets, I want to pick up on something a couple of people alluded to, and then Bill elaborated and actually began to try to quantify some, which is the possibility that the natural rate is lower than the estimates most of us, including the Tealbook, have.  And this is obviously really important, because, as I understand it, any significant difference in the natural rate plugged into any one of the various models that are used results in a quite different timing of liftoff and differences in what you do with regard to monetary policy thereafter. I’m not about to argue something that I necessarily believe to be the case, but I just want to supplement some of the things Bill mentioned as potential points that may argue for the possibility that the natural rate is lower.  To some degree, the possibility that the natural rate is lower is the flip side of the low labor force participation rate relative to what we would have expected with demographic trends, which is to say, lower, but not as low as it has been.  That is, people who are currently categorized as unemployed may be more attached to the workforce and more skilled than the norm for unemployed workers historically.  In addition, a lot of people who would have formerly been listed as unemployed, but who are actually less tied to or qualified for work, may now be listed as out of the labor force.  And, by the way, there are a bunch of younger people who have parked themselves in school somewhere, waiting for things to improve.  Now, that’s an intuition to some degree, or a theoretical possibility, but it is buttressed by the fact that, contrary to expectations, the exit rate from unemployment to out of the labor force has actually   fallen relative to what it was pre-crisis, and entry into the labor force—again, taking demographics into account—has been low.  So all of that would at least suggest, though not prove, that the quality, if you will, of those currently listed as unemployed is higher than the group historically included in that category of unemployment, and, therefore—no pun intended—naturally, there would be a lower natural rate.  Maybe that’s not true, but here, as with so many things with respect to labor markets I’ve been noticing for the past several years, every argument on one side, like on the issue of whether wages are about to rise, almost always has an equally good argument on the other. The NFIB thing is my latest example.  The NFIB survey predicts wages are going to rise.  It has been doing so for the past two years.  Someday it’s going to be right.  But it hasn’t been to date, and so to me it doesn’t actually mean all that much.  Again, things like the quits rate—yes, the quits rate has improved, but (a) it improved really only modestly, (b) it is still not where it was pre-crisis, and (c) it actually dipped back down a little bit during Q4.  So, again, let’s not make too much out of things until we actually see something a bit more tangible, which I would come back to and say would be wages again.  And I’m not going to discuss the implications of this, Madam Chair, because I think that’s what the next go-round is about.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  I believe you’re right.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. One example of this is when Mr. Tarullo disagrees with the concept of anchored inflation expectations and expresses his nervousness about it. He also mentions that he is not nervous about the possibility of a lower natural rate of unemployment, while acknowledging that most others may be.


Passage number 390.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This seems like a good opportunity to be succinct, so I will try to take advantage of that.  On the real economy, as we all know, we have been through what are two pretty strong years, and I would also say that there has been apparently quite a meaningful gain in momentum in the second half of last year.  And we are seeing numbers that seemed out of reach for many years after the crisis.  The Tealbook forecast is that we will continue on that path and continue to eliminate slack at a rapid pace, fully   admitting that we don’t know the value of the natural rate.  And I’m comfortable with that forecast.  In particular, the Tealbook points out that PDFP has been even stronger than GDP against a background of strong job growth, lower energy prices, and higher consumer confidence.  That dynamic seems to me very likely to continue, and I think there is every reason to expect the real economy to continue on that path. The big issue that we’ve been over and over is the risk of weakness abroad.  It’s worth pointing out that those effects are already incorporated in the Tealbook to a significant extent through the strong dollar.  Of course, the dollar can still go higher.  There can be bad geopolitical events.  On the other hand, we have perhaps some hope in Europe as a result of lower oil prices and much better financial conditions with a lower euro and other effects of QE.  So I wouldn’t say those risks are at all currently balanced, but I would say they are coming closer to being balanced. And that leaves you with what President Lockhart referred to as the “big disconnect” between the real economy and wages and prices, and interest rates as well, and how to think about that.  And it’s very discomfiting, and we’re just not going to know with any confidence for a while.  But what I would expect is that the effects of both the oil shock and the increase in the dollar—assuming the dollar flattens out in trade-weighted terms—will pass, and, indeed, we will see much more comfortable readings on both headline and core inflation rates in the second half of next year.  But we won’t know that, I think, for a while. On market readings on inflation compensation, I talked about it at the previous meeting at some length, and I won’t go over it again, but I do continue to think that much of that is not really expectations.  On the other hand, I profess no certainty on that, and I think President Evans made a great point that if it’s not representative of expectations, then at some point it should be transient. With every meeting it loses its status as temporary or transient and becomes more concerning. Like Governor Tarullo, I will wait until the next go-round.  I think those issues do raise significant issues for policy, and I will address them in upcoming rounds—possibly, Madam Chair, round 14 on day 6 of this meeting.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of the speaker giving their thoughts and opinions on various economic factors and potential risks.


Passage number 391.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I’ll express my own perspective that I think it would be preferable to defer it, just so that people are fresh to take on this important new topic. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Is that the general view. We will begin tomorrow, then, at 9:00 a.m., and we will discuss policy options concerning the timing of liftoff and the pace of tightening. [Meeting recessed] January 28 Session CHAIR YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  We are going to start things off this morning by coming back to the testing proposals, and I’m going to turn things over to Josh Frost.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about the timing and agenda of a meeting.


Passage number 392.
 MR. FROST.8  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In yesterday’s discussion, the Committee expressed interest in having the staff put forward two proposals for testing term RRPs—one that includes further testing of term RRPs over the March quarter-end only and one that includes the March quarter-end tests and a series of small-term RRP tests in February and early March. The first option—further testing of term RRPs over the March quarter-end— would include the four operational refinements that Lorie mentioned yesterday.  These refinements are based on lessons learned from the tests over year-end and are outlined in the top panel of exhibit 1.  To reiterate, the four refinements are:  one, reduce the amount of term RRP offered to $200 billion to improve our understanding of the effect of decreased capacity; two, have the term RRPs mature across multiple days in early April to avoid operational risks associated with having all of the operations mature on the same day; three, make modest changes to the frequency and tenor of term RRP operations, resulting in fewer operations and shorter maturities; and four, express the maximum bid rate as a spread above the ON RRP rate on the day of the operation to better allow for the possibility of a change in the target for the federal funds rate following the announcement of the term RRP offerings but before the actual operations commence. The second option includes a series of small tests of term RRPs in February and early March, in addition to the March quarter-end tests that I just discussed.  A possible structure of these non-quarter-end tests is outlined in the bottom panel of exhibit 1.  If the Committee wanted to pursue these tests, it could authorize the Desk to offer a series of relatively short-term RRPs in modest sizes to learn more about the degree of substitutability between overnight and term RRPs, and to get more insight into the rate the market requires on term RRPs to induce such substitution. To best balance the desire to learn about these issues with an inclination to keep the size of such tests relatively small, the Committee might want to instruct the staff to conduct a series of term RRP operations in February and March with a size limit of $50 billion outstanding at any one time.  As is the case with the quarter-end term RRP testing, this limit would be in addition to the $300 billion daily limit on the overnight RRP. These operations could be conducted beginning on Thursday, February 12, and all mature by Thursday, March 12.  These dates would ensure that these operations do not conflict with the March quarter-end term RRP testing, and all of these operations would all mature prior to the Committee’s March meeting. The operations could also 8 The materials used by Mr. Frost are appended to this transcript (appendix 8).be subject to a maximum bid rate of the prevailing ON RRP rate plus 5 basis points, and be awarded via a single-price auction.  While the exact terms of these tests would be determined in the coming days, it is likely that we would plan to start relatively small at around $10 billion and utilize a maximum bid rate of the prevailing ON RRP rate plus 5 basis points, and conduct a series of four one-week operations every Thursday from February 12 through March 5.  In the coming days, Simon Potter would inform the Committee of the detailed terms of the first of the planned operations after obtaining the Chair’s approval. Depending on which option the Committee chooses, the Desk could release a statement following this meeting, with more operational details announced through a future Desk statement.  Draft resolutions authorizing each type of term RRP testing are provided in your handout as exhibit 2.  We will have copies of the Desk statement associated with each of the options in case you would like to review.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Are there questions for Josh.  President Williams.

 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but without the specific passage or context provided, I cannot determine if there is contention or disagreement. Please provide the necessary information for me to assist you.


Passage number 394.
 WILLIAMS.  I just have a question about option 1.  Looking forward, what would be our plan about the June quarter-end, abstracting from what monetary policy will or will not do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a question about making a plan for the future, without any indication of conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 395.
 MR. POTTER. As Vice Chairman Dudley discussed, I think we will recommend testing over the June quarter-end if we go ahead with this test over Q1.  I think the appropriate way to do that as a test would be to have a Desk statement come out at the April meeting, or it’s possible we could do that at the March meeting.  But it’s important that we have some interval in order to show it is testing and it’s not an indication of any change in the policy statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing a potential test and the appropriate timing for announcing it, without expressing any conflicting views or opinions.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement from Williams, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 398.
 MR. POTTER. The main option you have is the directive to the Desk, and you could put this into the directive that you vote on at each meeting.  If, for example, at the June meeting you voted to increase the federal funds rate target range, you could take the testing that we’re doing and you could increase the limit on it, if you wanted more comfort.  We would probably recommend to go with the $200 billion, so there is no signal.  If at that meeting you decided that you wanted to raise rates, you could then direct the Desk to have more capacity than that $200 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply presenting various options and recommendations to the audience without expressing any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 399.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any opposing ideas or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 400.
 WILLIAMS.  But would we be announcing that for the foreseeable future we plan to do quarter-end.  That’s what I was asking about.  I mean, we would be out of the testing stage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple question and response with no conflicting opinions.


Passage number 401.
 MR. POTTER.  At the moment it’s in the directive, it will be out of the testing stage. But the directive is just for the period through the next meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that once a certain directive is in place, it will no longer be in the testing stage.


Passage number 402.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. It is not clear what "MR" refers to, so it is impossible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 403.
 WILLIAMS. It would just be a statement about the period through the next meeting, and we would repeat that as long as we were using term RRPs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact about using term RRPs.


Passage number 404.
 MR. POTTER.  Yes.  But there might be some more communication to help the market understand the regime that we would be operating in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Potter is suggesting that further communication could be beneficial to help the market understand the proposed regime.


Passage number 405.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage as "MR" does not provide any relevant context for determining the presence of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 406.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individuals are simply expressing their gratitude and acknowledgment.


Passage number 407.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Josh, on option 2, about the testing small operations in February and March, I want to understand more about the value you folks see in this.  I believe I heard you say that it would be informative about the rate at which term substitutes for overnight.  A general expectation is that it would be higher than the rate on overnight, but now I’m trying to think about what difference it would make to me as a Committee member to know what that rate is.  Do you have a sense of what value it would be to the Committee.  Or do you have some other purpose in mind for this test.  If it’s 8 or 10 or 15, what difference is it going to make to the Committee to know what that rate is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker simply asks for clarification and further explanation about the value of the testing small operations in February and March.


Passage number 408.
 MR. FISHER.  Madam Chair, may I augment that question, please. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fisher asks to add to a question and Chair Yellen agrees.


Passage number 409.
 MR. FISHER.  I’d like to also know in answer to the question, from the Desk’s standpoint, would these smaller tests be a useful exercise just in terms of getting better muscle tone.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their desire to know if smaller tests would be beneficial in improving muscle tone.


Passage number 410.
 MR. FROST.  I think in terms of what you would learn from the rate information, just suppose for argument’s sake that the first few operations clear at a rate of 6 basis points, so 1 above.  That might suggest that there is relatively little premium that would need to be offered to have people move from overnight into term.  Instead, suppose it was 10, 15.  I would think that it would be useful for the Committee to have some understanding of just how much of a premium would need to be paid in order to induce switching between the two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing different scenarios and their potential implications.


Passage number 411.
 MR. LACKER.  I really can’t see why, though.  I mean, we set overnight rates, and we’ve done this for decades.  The term structure of interest rates—the one-month, the three-month commercial paper rate—is what it is. Why would it matter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their perspective and questioning why something would matter.


Passage number 412.
 MS. LOGAN.  From the discussion yesterday, if we decided to lift the overnight RRP cap to a larger size, you wouldn’t necessarily need that substitution.  But there was also a discussion to the effect that you would want that cap to be temporarily increased, and afterward you may decide you want to bring that down and move some of that overnight into term.  It may be useful to know what premium you would need to pay for that substitution.  If it was very low, that might affect the exit strategy that Governor Tarullo discussed yesterday, and I think we would come back with other exit strategies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is summarizing a previous discussion and presenting different options for consideration.


Passage number 413.
 MR. LACKER. Is it a matter of our budgetary cost for this that might affect our choice here.  That seems second order for monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This passage is a statement made by Mr. Lacker, and there is no indication of any conflicting opinions or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 414.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  President Lacker, I think my sense of it is that if you thought that term RRPs had a somewhat lower financial-stability risk than that associated withovernight RRPs—so let’s posit that—then you’d want to know how much that benefit cost you in terms of paying a higher premium.  Now, if you don’t accept the premise that term RRPs have a lower financial-stability cost than overnight RRPs, then that sort of argument is moot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: no


Passage number 415.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, I would question that.  But even if you grant that, it seems hard to swallow that the difference in monetary cost between a few basis points is going to be material to the Committee in that situation, given what we’re thinking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply questioning a statement and expressing his opinion, but there is no explicit disagreement or argument present.


Passage number 416.
 MR. POTTER.  President Lacker, maybe we can flip it a little bit. If we can get a lot of substitution at or just a little bit above the overnight RRP rate, then we’re not really disturbing the term rates that you’re talking about.  If, to get that substitution, we really have to jack it up over the overnight RRP rate, then we are affecting other term markets indirectly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Potter is simply presenting a different perspective to President Lacker and exploring different scenarios without expressing disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 417.
 MR. LACKER.  But how do you know that.  That depends on what those other term markets are, not where the one-week is relative to the overnight.  That depends on how other term rates move, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker questions the certainty of the speaker's statement and suggests that the movement of other term rates will determine the validity of the speaker's statement.


Passage number 418.
 MR. POTTER.  It does, and we would expect in the configuration rates that we have that they would be quite a bit above the overnight RRP rate, because we are setting that at the bottom of the range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating an expected outcome based on a given configuration.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 419.
 MR. LACKER.  That’s unpersuasive. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

There is contention or disagreement in the passage because Mr. Lacker finds the argument presented by Chair Yellen unpersuasive.


Passage number 420.
 MR. FISHER.  I don’t want to belabor this point, but, again, just thinking as a practitioner, and given the fact that we want to have as many “bullets in our holster” as possible, if this helps inform the Desk and helps them, as I said earlier, “get their muscle tone,” these are small exercises.  I don’t see why we would not—it’s really a question of, is this a useful exercise from the standpoint of a practitioner. We don’t want to muck this thing up.  You can debate this from that standpoint, President Lacker, I’m sympathetic, but it’s really giving them the tools that they need to execute the policy this Committee instructs them to do. That’s the way I would look at it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and perspective on the matter at hand.


Passage number 421.
 MR. LACKER.  Now, if I could, Madam Chair, I respectfully disagree.  They have testing platforms.  They can run their own auctions internally; they can run their own simulated auctions.  I’ve seen them do this.  I’ve participated in things like this.  They’ve got plenty of muscle tone.  They are a well-exercised crew, a very professional crew.  They do an excellent job of executing on these things.  They know what they’re doing.  I’m highly confident they don’t need more market practice. The broad concern here, I think, ought to be that we have seen that the more testing we do, the more market participants think these are going to be permanent features of the financial landscape. As well as we try to communicate that these are only tests, for some reason market expectations run ahead of the Committee’s intended communication that these are just temporary tests of a facility. The financial-stability concern has always struck me as baffling.  The idea is that there are runs out there that are being prevented now only because of a lack of an overnight RRP facility that people would be attracted to putting their money into.  We would have had more runs in 2008 if we had an overnight RRP facility available for people to run to.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No - There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their disagreement with the idea that the Federal Reserve needs more market practice, and they are also expressing their confusion about the concern for financial stability.


Passage number 422.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don’t think that’s the argument.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and indicating that they do not believe in a certain argument. There is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 423.
 MR. LACKER.  Well, then, explain it to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Lacker is simply asking for an explanation.


Passage number 424.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think the argument is more that if you have a facility that is an elastic facility, it can cause private-sector rates to go up by more.  In the old regime, you had a fixed supply of the safe asset.  When the demand for that asset increased, that caused the rate on that asset to fall dramatically.  If you have an elastic facility, the price doesn’t fall,  and that pushes up private-sector yields by more.  So I think there is a fundamental difference in terms of having an elastic facility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply explaining their interpretation of the argument.


Passage number 425.
 MR. POTTER.  I think it’s not the probability of the run.  It’s if a run starts, if you have something like this imperfectly elastic supply, it can make the effect of that run on the real economy worse.  That’s why we really were trying to be careful in considering the cap and other issues.  But there are certain events that could happen in which you do get a run, and the existence of the overnight RRP facility would make the outcome worse for the real economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their opinion and explaining their rationale without contradicting or disagreeing with anyone else.


Passage number 426.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It’s not the probability of the run that’s changing, it’s the consequence of the run.  In terms of financial market conditions, that’s the difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states a fact about the difference between probability and consequence in financial market conditions.


Passage number 427.
 MR. LACKER. We’re talking about the interval of time between such a run and the time that the Federal Open Market Committee, using modern communications, is able to convene and execute an offsetting change in interest rate policy, which we generally do.  That seems, to me, like a fairly minor consideration.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and does not mention any opposing viewpoints or engage in a debate.


Passage number 428.
 MR. FISHER.  I think you’ve heard point and counterpoint, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. We did have a show of hands on this yesterday, and the takeaway for me was that most people actually favor both kinds of testing.  Of course, there is no commitment at this point, President Lacker, to use term RRPs outside quarter-end as part of our program.  That’s certainly not something we have decided at all.  We are just looking to test it. We need votes on both of these.  I suggest we start with a vote on option 1, to test term RRPs over March quarter-end.  All in favor, say “Aye.”  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 429.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes, I’m opposed. CHAIR YELLEN. For the March quarter-end.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. Mr. Lacker expresses opposition to something, which suggests disagreement or contention with Chair Yellen.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 430.
 MR. LACKER.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is indicated by the word "Yes" spoken by Mr. Lacker, suggesting that he is disagreeing or opposing something that was probably discussed prior to this response.


Passage number 431.
   MR. FISHER.  This is versus option 2. CHAIR YELLEN.  We’re going to take both separately.  We just voted on option 1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The participants are simply discussing the order in which they will take separate votes.


Passage number 432.
 MR. FISHER.  I add my vote to option 1.  I apologize. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. Let’s go to option 2 now, which is to test the term RRPs in small operations in February and March.  All in favor.  [Show of hands] Any opposed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are simply stating their votes and there is no opposing or conflicting viewpoint.


Passage number 433.
 MR. LACKER.  I’m opposed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: This passage does not contain any indication of contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Lacker is opposed to something without any conflicting opinions or arguments presented.


Passage number 434.
 MR. FISHER.  I’m opposed. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I think the Desk has authorization.  I guess what you call option 2 includes both of these things, and we’ve approved both of them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage includes a statement of opposition, but it does not indicate any disagreement or contention between the speakers.


Passage number 435.
 MR. LUECKE. Just to be clear, among voters it would be nine-to-one in favor of both.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any specific disagreement or contention among voters. It simply states that the majority of voters are in favor of both options being discussed.


Passage number 436.
 MR. POTTER.  We’ll have copies of the Desk’s statement available if you want to look at it. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. Now we have got a lot of business to do this morning.  Our next topic is timing of liftoff and pace of tightening, and I do think we’ll be talking really about the policy decisions we face in this round.  You remember we will also have to discuss our actual statement, but my guess and hope is that that discussion can be reasonably short because we’ll cover quite a bit of policy-related comments in this go-round.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply describes the agenda for a meeting and the Chair's expectation for the discussion.


Passage number 437.
 MR. EVANS.  If I can just ask a procedural question, in terms of how the minutes get constructed, in the past it’s been based on the discussion that takes place with regard to the alternatives.  Is it possible that the policy discussion for the minutes would also be based on the liftoff discussion, and we wouldn’t have to repeat the same arguments. CHAIR YELLEN.  I think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker, Mr. Evans, is simply asking a procedural question, and Chair Yellen agrees with his suggestion.


Passage number 438.
   MR. LAUBACH. The plan is that, as has been the case on occasion in prior meetings, that there would be a separate summary of this coming go-round perhaps under a heading like “Policy Planning,” and that will, of course, summarize comments from participants.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states that there will be a separate summary of the upcoming meeting, which is a plan that has been done before. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 439.
 MR. EVANS.  Yes, but in the paragraph that talks about how the Committee discussed the policy options in the past, as I understand the rules of the game, unless you actually made the argument during that commentary, it doesn’t necessarily get captured in the count.  You couldn’t simply say, “As I alluded to in the other discussion, there’s no need for me to repeat that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement explaining a rule of discussion and how it may affect the count of arguments made.


Passage number 440.
” MR. ENGLISH.  We’re doctrinaire, but we’re not that doctrinaire.  [Laughter] If you say something for this go-round, we will include that in the summary of the policy discussion, as appropriate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 441.
 MR. EVANS.  Excellent.  I can see great economies being achieved by that. CHAIR YELLEN.  Good question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen respond positively to the question, indicating agreement or approval.


Passage number 442.
 MR. EVANS.  I heard former Vice Chairman Don Kohn one time mention, “Well, one reason why I mention this laundry list here is because you have to say it.” CHAIR YELLEN.  I’d like to call on Ed Nelson to get us started off—to introduce this topic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 443.
 MR. E. NELSON.9  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for Briefing on the Timing of Liftoff and the Pace of Tightening.” Earlier this month, the staff distributed a packet of five memos that detailed how considerations related to monetary policy strategy might figure into policymakers’ decisions about the timing and pace of policy firming.  My remarks will distill some key messages from this material. The first memo, by Mike Kiley, Dave Reifschneider, and myself, discusses various considerations that could influence your decisions regarding the timing and pace of adjustments to the policy stance in the period ahead.  As you know from Tealbook B, many simple interest rate rules, as well as optimal-control policy, call for an immediate policy firming.  However, research suggests that the overall trajectory 9 The materials used by Mr. E. Nelson are appended to this transcript (appendix 9).  of the federal funds rate expected by market participants is much more important for the behavior of real activity and inflation than is the precise choice of date at which to commence policy firming.  As the memo noted, alternative benchmark policies that incorporate inertia, such as the inertial Taylor (1999) rule and the optimal-control policy, imply a smaller initial tightening and a more gradual subsequent pace of tightening than do the noninertial Taylor (1993 and 1999) rules.  In simulations of the FRB/US model conditioned on the staff forecast, this gradual pace facilitates a more rapid return of inflation toward the 2 percent objective, in part because the policy allows the unemployment rate to run below the natural rate of unemployment for a time. Another point highlighted in the memo is that your December SEP paths for the federal funds rate differ appreciably from the path implied by the noninertial Taylor (1999) rule.  These deviations, which diminish notably over the projection period, may suggest that you have a preference for interest rate smoothing.  Alternatively, they may indicate that your views concerning appropriate policy are influenced by factors that incline you to take a cautious approach to normalizing the stance of monetary policy.  For example, some of you may worry that the economy remains somewhat fragile, on the grounds that the pickup in economic growth is so recent, or you may fear that an adverse shock could prompt serious retrenchments in spending and hiring, with attendant financial instability.  Containing these risks might be a particular concern for the Committee because the effective lower bound on policy rates and the already-elevated size of the balance sheet could limit the Federal Reserve’s flexibility in responding to negative shocks.  In addition, some of you may see potential advantages to allowing the unemployment rate to undershoot estimates of the natural rate for a time; these advantages might include speeding the return to 2 percent inflation, or the opportunity to explore whether some portion of the recent supply-side damage can be reversed.  As the memo also notes, however, adopting a cautious approach to tightening could be costly if taken too far, because it could generate an undesirably large increase in inflation or undermine financial stability. Another memo to the Committee, from de Groot, Gagnon, and Tetlow, considers evidence from stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model of two alternative policy strategies:  an “earlier and gradual” firming strategy and a “later and steep” strategy. The authors find that—provided that the data-dependent nature of Federal Reserve policy is well understood by the private sector—the choice between the two strategies is not of crucial importance, as measured by a policymaker loss function, under most scenarios.  Each strategy is associated with prospective costs: An earlier-and-gradual strategy entails a higher probability of returning to the effective lower bound, while a later-and-steep strategy raises the probability that policymakers might have to raise the federal funds rate very rapidly. Two staff memos discuss what can be learned from prior tightening episodes. One of these memos, by Meade, Nozawa, Petrasek, and Zickler, discusses FOMC deliberations that occurred around the initial tightening of monetary policy in 1994, 1999, and 2004.  It shows that, in all cases, the decisions to tighten monetary policy were data dependent and forward looking.  Expansion of the Federal Reserve’s  communications tools likely left financial markets better prepared for policy firming in 1999 and 2004 than they were in 1994, when the market reaction to the initial tightening was sizable.  The second of these memos, by De Michelis, De Pooter, and Wood, reviews the international experience with raising policy rates from the effective lower bound.  Central banks differed in the precise manner in which they signaled their intention to transition from the effective-lower-bound policy; however, a common feature was that they provided broad guidance about the time frame or economic conditions in which policy firming would commence.  In all cases, regardless of communications strategy, policy firming did not prove disruptive to financial markets.  In addition, no case was found in which policy firming was too late or otherwise insufficient.  Among the episodes considered, Japan in 2000 and Sweden in 2010 provide possible instances in which the tightening was premature or excessive, perhaps because policymakers gave undue weight to factors other than inflation and economic activity when making their decisions to raise rates.  In both of these instances, policy firming was subsequently reversed and the policy rate returned to the effective lower bound.  Canada, in contrast, had a more orderly experience when it tightened policy starting in 2010, perhaps because the firming was gradual and was closely keyed to macroeconomic conditions. Focusing specifically on communications, the memo by English, Laubach, and Reeve offers language—reproduced on the third and fourth pages of your handout— that the Committee might consider employing in policy statements as it approaches and reaches the time at which policy firming is commenced.  In addition, the final section of my memo with Kiley and Reifschneider noted two points that the Committee might wish to highlight in speeches, testimony, and other forums: One:  Once firming commences, the federal funds rate will not follow a predetermined trajectory; instead, all adjustments will be data dependent. Two:  Real activity could turn out to be stronger and inflation higher than expected, implying that policy would need to tighten more rapidly than envisioned in the SEP paths.  Conversely, conditions could turn out to be weaker, making it appropriate to tighten more slowly or even to reverse course. Furthermore, policymakers might come to a consensus that special considerations—for example, a desire to lower the likelihood that the Committee would need to return to the effective lower bound—were playing an important role in its deliberations.  If so, the Committee might wish to describe these considerations in its policy communications. Along with the memos, the staff distributed a few questions that you may wish to address in your comments during today’s go-round.  For your convenience, these questions are repeated on the last page of your handout.  Thank you, and I would be happy to take any questions you might have. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there questions.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 444.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  These memos are excellent, and I enjoyed reading them and found them very interesting.  One of the things that I think is important about the set of the memos is it begins to talk about monetary policy as a path, and that’s the way it affects the economy.  I applaud that. One of the things that we do in our current statement is to repeat over and over again the fact that we believe that our large balance sheet continues to provide accommodation to the economy in one form or another, and that, in particular, it’s presumably keeping financial conditions or interest rates at the longer term lower than they might otherwise be.  If I think about accommodation and I think about calibrating the stance of policy going forward, how do I take into account, or how should the Committee think about, the existence of a large balance sheet and the way it perhaps—may or may not, depending on the staff’s views—influences how we calibrate the pace of tightening or the level of tightening at any point in time.  How do these two things interact, and how should we think about them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 445.
 MR. E. NELSON. Well, the elevated balance sheet, by providing stimulus, makes conditions more favorable for economic expansion and for inflation to return to 2 percent than otherwise, and in that sense it’s a conditioning factor in the decisions concerning the target range for the federal funds rate.  That’s one way of thinking about how that separate monetary policy instrument fits into the overall strategy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is explaining how the elevated balance sheet can have a positive impact on economic expansion and inflation, and how it is considered when making decisions about the federal funds rate.


Passage number 446.
 MR. PLOSSER. That means we should think about a policy path that looks higher or lower or unchanged, depending on the size of the balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Plosser is simply suggesting that the policy path should be determined based on the size of the balance sheet.


Passage number 447.
 MR. WILCOX.  If I may, for just a second, one way that we tried to reflect that in the baseline projection is that we built in an assessment of the influence of the portfolio on the term premium of longer-term interest rates.  Eric Engstrom and his colleagues attempt to calibrate theeffect of the size of the portfolio on the time profile of longer-term interest rates, and that’s providing a separate influence on financial conditions aside from the funds rate.  In the baseline projection, we treat the funds rate as the active tool of monetary policy that’s governed by the monetary policy rule, but in the background, under the set of conditions that are specified in Tealbook B, the size of the portfolio is evolving, is melting away, and with that the downward pressure on term premiums is diminishing as well.  That may go part way toward providing some help on the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining a method used to reflect the influence of a portfolio on interest rates.


Passage number 448.
 MR. PLOSSER.  But if I, as a policymaker, were trying to think about how do I set the right level of the interest rate path—steeper, higher, lower—I’m a little bit confused about how I think about the effect of the balance sheet.  Unless I’m just going to follow a rule and we’re going be done with it, we’re going to make some arguments about why we think the path ought to be lower or higher than it otherwise might choose to be.  I’m trying to figure out how I think about that as a policymaker to determine whether I like one path versus another.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply discussing the confusion and uncertainty about how to consider the effect of the balance sheet when setting the interest rate path. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 449.
 MR. WILCOX.  I can’t answer that because I don’t know your preferences, but the way in which we tried to lay it out for you is to give you a prospective view of how we think resource utilization is going to evolve and how inflation will evolve conditioned on both dimensions of monetary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that Mr. Wilcox is unable to answer the question due to a lack of information about the speaker's preferences. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 450.
 MR. PLOSSER.  You say the balance sheet is given.  Its effect on the economy is given, predetermined in your baseline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is simply stating that the balance sheet and its effect on the economy are predetermined in the baseline.


Passage number 451.
 MR. WILCOX.  Sure, it’s given in the same sense that the funds rate trajectory is given. We’re trying to give you something that’s internally consistent in a sort of general-equilibrium sense, in which the economy, the portfolio, and the funds rate path all go together, and you  ultimately need to make the judgment about whether you prefer a more accommodative stance relative to that benchmark that we try to give.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their intention to provide an internally consistent and balanced view, and acknowledges that the ultimate judgment lies with the listener.


Passage number 452.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Could I choose something different that said maybe the balance sheet goes down faster.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Plosser is suggesting an alternative possibility (the balance sheet goes down faster) but there is no conflicting or opposing point being made.


Passage number 453.
 MR. WILCOX.  Sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contentious or disagreeing statements. The word "Sure" in this context is understood to be an affirmation or agreement, rather than creating conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 454.
 MR. PLOSSER. My choice of the funds rate in that equilibrium would go up less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that "My choice of the funds rate in that equilibrium would go up less," without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 455.
 MR. WILCOX.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The word "absolutely" conveys strong agreement and certainty, indicating that there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 456.
 MR. PLOSSER.  But we don’t really know, at the margin, how much difference that would make.  I guess that’s kind of where I was coming from. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are expressing uncertainty and lack of knowledge about a certain matter.


Passage number 457.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I apologize to President Plosser, but I felt that over the years he’s made his positions on policy quite clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that President Plosser has been consistent in expressing his positions on policy.


Passage number 458.
  [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  I didn’t realize that David was confused by that, but that’s okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker's response indicates that they are not bothered or upset by David's confusion.


Passage number 459.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I’m going to pick up on the same line of questioning as President Plosser.  I find that I understand the treatment of asset purchases, as David Wilcox and Ed Nelson have explained, in the optimal-control exercises. I find it more difficult to understand in the Taylor rule formulations.  It would seem to me that the rule is supposed to be dictating where the level of policy is relative to some kind of steady-state normal, and that should include asset purchases as being part of that abnormal provision of stimulus.  When I read the memos and was remarking on, “Boy, we’re more accommodative than noninertial Taylor (1999) rule,” I thought, well, we’re actually a lot more accommodative because we’ve got all these asset purchases in there as well providing stimulus.  I didn’t find the framing of the policy decisions of   the Committee in terms of noninertial Taylor (1999) rule as compelling because I just think that we’re much more accommodative because of the inclusion of asset purchases. I think Thomas has something he wants to say, but, first, I have one small point on the financial-stability issue. I think it’s right to be thinking about how accommodative policy can lead to the risk of financial instability, and I encourage us to be doing that.  It is also important, though, to keep in mind, as the memos point out, that tightening too early can also lead to financial instability, and there are the risks associated with that as well. The memos are very clear on that.  I think it’s important for us as a Committee to keep that in mind.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 460.
 MR. LAUBACH.  May I quickly respond to President Kocherlakota. I’m a little afraid that what you laid out might sound a little bit like double counting.  The way that monetary policy transmission largely works both in the staff projection and in the FRB/US model is through longer-term interest rates. Now, that’s how the term-premium effects that we are still assuming, and that are shown toward the end of Tealbook B, figure in.  For any given path for the federal funds rate, current and future, longer-term interest rates do reflect these term premiums.  Insofar as the rule mechanically responds to current conditions, these current conditions will be stronger simply because longer-term interest rates are lower than they would be for the same path of the short-term rate if the balance sheet didn’t continue to exert downward pressure on term premiums.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Laubach, raises concerns about President Kocherlakota's statement potentially seeming like double counting. Mr. Laubach argues that the transmission of monetary policy largely works through longer-term interest rates, which are affected by term premiums. He implies that President Kocherlakota's statement does not take this into account.


Passage number 461.
 MR. E. NELSON.  One way of putting it is, the right-hand side of the Taylor rule includes variables that respond to the LSAPs because of the endogeneity of output and inflation.  In a sense, it’s allowing for the presence of an elevated balance sheet.  This is an issue that was covered at great length in staff memos a few years ago in response to your input.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing an explanation and background information about the Taylor rule and the inclusion of variables that respond to LSAPs (Large Scale Asset Purchases). There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 462.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I feel we are retracing ground that we covered at that time.  I am not sure we will make much progress in convincing each other of our views.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Kocherlakota and Chair Yellen express their opinions and acknowledge that they may not be able to convince each other. They are simply stating their perspectives without directly engaging in a debate or argument.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 463.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On this topic, there’s a completely different way to characterize accommodative policy.  You can do it with regard to whether we’re achieving our goals in an environment in which the unemployment rate is still higher than the natural rate and inflation over the forecast is underrunning our goal.  You could say it’s not really accommodative enough. But at any rate, I have a question about the proposed statement on page 2. The proposed paragraph 3 includes the phrase:  “Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that economic conditions,” et cetera, et cetera.  My question basically is whether this an unusual usage of this phrase because it’s singular, as if there’s only one assessment of the Committee.  It strikes me that that’s not unusual at a point when we are making a decision to change policy, like taking an action to change the funds rate.  But when we’re contemplating a future action in a couple of meetings and we say “the Committee’s assessment,” I’m wondering, how narrow this is.  If you don’t quite agree with that assessment, then you’re going to get into discussions about the appropriate conditionality. But it strikes me that, because of the future aspect of this, it would be better to somehow try to characterize the likelihood of that assessment or to use something slightly more probabilistic, the central tendency of that. I guess my question is, doesn’t this sound a little unusual in its current usage. It led me to add a different modifier in my own formulation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker is questioning the usage of the phrase "the Committee's assessment" and suggesting that it may be too narrow or singular in its interpretation. They propose using a more probabilistic or modifier approach. This indicates a disagreement or difference in opinion about the appropriate way to phrase the statement.


Passage number 464.
 MR. LAUBACH.  I think the probabilistic aspect of this judgment of a couple of meetings or possibly more ahead is intended to be conveyed through the “may” or “couldpotentially.”  But I will make no bones about the fact that we struggled long and hard to convey just the right sense of the probabilistic nature of the assessment.  Obviously, it would be great to have a better way of doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It is discussing the difficulty in conveying a sense of probability in a judgment and expressing a desire for a better method. However, it does not involve any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 465.
 MR. EVANS.  I know it’s wordy, but if you were to say “median assessment” or “central forecast of the Committee,” or something that indicates there’s some element of a range, however narrow that may be.  It seems to me that would augment the ability to achieve a stronger consensus at an early stage of our planning. CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s very useful.  Thanks. Governor Fischer, did you have a comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a conversation between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen where Mr. Evans suggests a wording change to improve consensus in planning. Chair Yellen acknowledges the suggestion as useful.


Passage number 466.
 MR. FISCHER.  Yes, just two small points.  I think that the Swedes raised the interest rate in 2010 primarily for financial-stability reasons—they were scared about what was happening to housing prices—and they had to backtrack from that later. I don’t know if there’s a lesson there, because we don’t have a large sample. David, a question.  If the place in which we reflect the size of the balance sheet, which is an issue we’re going to talk about at great length during the next couple of years, is all reflected in the term premium, can’t you do simulations with the premium effect and without the premium effect and with a smaller premium effect and tell us what the effect of reducing the size of the balance sheet would be at given policy interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply consists of someone expressing their thoughts and asking a question.


Passage number 467.
 MR. WILCOX.  I can’t think of a reason why not, off the top of my head. We ought to be able to do that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing agreement and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 468.
 MR. LAUBACH. It’s very closely related to the studies concerning the efficacy of asset purchases that we’ve done in the past because, in effective, those memos also contemplated the macroeconomic effects of varying the size of the balance sheet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is highlighting the relationship between two studies and how they are both related to the macroeconomic effects of varying the size of the balance sheet. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 469.
MR. WILCOX.  I don’t think that’s a controversial proposition, and I guess I’d like to just be absolutely clear that I think what Thomas was saying was entirely consistent. I don’t know whether you meant to be making a different point than I did.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wilcox is expressing his agreement and understanding of Thomas's point.


Passage number 470.
 MR. LAUBACH. No, no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The excerpt does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 471.
 MR. WILCOX.  I think Thomas’s views and mine, as just articulated, are exactly in alignment about the role that the SOMA portfolio plays, through the size of the term premium effect, and how that wears away in the projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating that their views align with Thomas's views regarding the role of the SOMA portfolio.


Passage number 472.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It consists of one person thanking another person, and the second person responding.


Passage number 473.
 MR. LACKER.  Two things related to Governor Fischer’s comments.  First, if you do that and if you devote any effort to measures of uncertainty surrounding those projections, I’d urge you to take seriously uncertainty about the marginal effect of our balance sheet on the term premium.  I think in the current circumstances, for the issues President Plosser and Governor Fischer discussed, if we’re thinking about the effect of the balance sheet, it strikes me that the uncertainty about that is far larger than our uncertainty about other aspects of your policy framework on the effect of short-term interest rates on the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker, expressing his belief about the uncertainty surrounding the effect of the balance sheet on the term premium. There is no contradiction or opposition being presented.


Passage number 474.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  Let me venture a hypothesis, which is a bit risky.  One limit on our ability to perform this kind of analysis is that our structure is maybe not literally linear, but is pretty close to linear, and, for example, in optimal control, the preferences are literally quadratic. The size of the portfolio and the funds rate—and I’m going to look around the room hoping for some confirmation or contradiction—are going to act as if they’re policy substitutes in your portfolio.  Because of this way in which we put the projection together, you could get roughly—I don’t know whether this would be literally true down to the basis point—the same economic outcome by having a smaller portfolio and a more accommodative trajectory for the funds rate path in a way that would be designed to generate, roughly speaking, the same trajectory for longer-term interest rates. Now, that won’t be literally true, because I suspect there are some corners of the projection in which short-term interest rates matter separately, but those two instruments are going to be substitutes for policy tools.  So it’s been our view that, just for simplicity, we’d reduce a two-dimensional situation down to one and give you the choice laid out on the funds-rate dimension alone, given an approach that we thought featured a relatively passive stance with respect to the way that the portfolio would be run off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is the speaker presenting their hypothesis and view on the relationship between portfolio size, funds rate, and policy substitutes. There is no indication of conflicting opinions or debate.


Passage number 475.
 MR. LACKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without having access to the passage itself.


Passage number 476.
 Would the terms of trade in that substitution— MR. WILCOX.  Would be linear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a straightforward response to a question.


Passage number 477.
 MR. LACKER.  But it would depend critically on the marginal effect of a given balance sheet on the term premium, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is simply presenting a question and requesting clarification.


Passage number 478.
 MR. WILCOX.  Correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states a fact (Mr. Wilcox is correct), without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 479.
 MR. LACKER. If that was like an order of magnitude smaller than sort of your standard workforce estimate, that could change the terms of trade fairly dramatically.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement made by Mr. Lacker about the potential effects of a smaller workforce estimate on the terms of trade.


Passage number 480.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: This answer is not sufficient as it only provides a one-word response without any explanation for it.


Passage number 481.
 MR. LACKER.  I would suspect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. 

Explanation: The passage simply states, "Mr. Lacker. I would suspect." This does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is just a statement of what Mr. Lacker suspects.


Passage number 482.
 MR. WILCOX.  I would suspect so, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: This statement does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses agreement with a previous statement.


Passage number 483.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.  I’m saying if you undertake any efforts to provide estimates of uncertainty surrounding your estimates of the effect of policy on different simulations, include this source of uncertainty because it strikes me as consequential.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 484.
 MR. WILCOX.  Dave Reifschneider, I don’t know if you want to add something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wilcox is simply addressing Dave Reifschneider and asking if he wants to contribute something.


Passage number 485.
  MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. Thomas is gesturing to me.  I’m not quite sure what he wants me to say here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is simply a statement made by Mr. Reifschneider about Thomas gesturing to him and his uncertainty about what Thomas wants him to say.


Passage number 486.
  [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  A plea for help.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage shows that there is a plea for help, but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 487.
 MR. EVANS.  Something supportive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It suggests that Mr. Evans is expressing something supportive.


Passage number 488.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I would say two things.  First of all, the assumptions on the term-premium effects and, more generally, what will be done to the portfolio in the future are based on your actions.  You released guidance about what you intend to do with the portfolio, and basically the forecast of its effects on term premiums is just taken from that statement from the Committee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that the assumptions and forecast of term-premium effects are based on the actions and guidance provided by the Committee.


Passage number 489.
 MR. LACKER. Wait, wait.  Did we make a statement about the effects on term premiums.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Lacker is simply interrupting to ask a question or clarify a point.


Passage number 490.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  No. You made a statement about what the plan was for the portfolio.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement. The speaker simply acknowledges and clarifies the plan for the portfolio.


Passage number 491.
 MR. LACKER.  Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement that suggests contention or disagreement. It simply states "MR. LACKER." without any context to determine if there is contention or disagreement involved.


Passage number 492.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The analysis of the term premium effects that the staff has done is printed in the back of Tealbook B.  As David said, that basically predetermined path of the effect on term premiums on the portfolio is rolled through the forecasting apparatus and treated as what I’ll call it a passive policy lever to get the forecast. Now, if, as Governor Fischer was suggesting, the Committee wants to explore alternative paths, you can apply different term premiums to the portfolio, and then we would run the forecasting machinery again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the analysis and methodology used for evaluating term premiums, and then suggesting a possible alternative approach.


Passage number 493.
  In addition to that, which I think maybe is why Thomas was gesturing at me, there’s a paper that he and I recently coauthored— MR. LACKER. Why didn’t he talk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that there is a paper that the speaker and Thomas recently coauthored. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 494.
  MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  I don’t know.  [Laughter]  —with Eric Engen, in which we looked at the effectiveness of the Committee’s forward guidance and the asset purchases taken together.  One of the things we did in that paper was to explore a range of possibilities for the effectiveness of the policies, and it ranges from having moderate effects—that’s our baseline estimate—to having more substantial effects and to having quite small effects.  If the Committee wants, we could do different assumptions that show how much uncertainty they could have on the outlook.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply describes a study that explores different possibilities and offers to provide different assumptions for the committee.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 495.
 MR. LACKER.  Great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. It appears that there is a statement or opinion from Mr. Lacker but the passage does not provide any context or further information to determine the exact nature of the contention or disagreement.


Passage number 496.
 MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  But I should say that we did the analysis looking back.  To go ahead and do it in terms of what these alternative assumptions would mean for future conditions is starting the exercise up again, and it would not be a simple undertaking.  To do what we did in the paper, we would need to decide what signal the market takes from your changes in the portfolio for your overall stance of policy, including the funds rate, as you go forward, and that decision would have a major effect on what the potential macroeconomic implications would be.  In our study, we were able to use Blue Chip survey data and other things like that to get an estimate of what the market reaction actually was. With regard to future actions, assessing what the market reaction would be pure speculation—well, maybe not pure; I mean, the Desk would have opinions about how it might go.  But we wouldn’t know with any certainty whatsoever what those market expectations would be.  Having to talk about what it might be in the future, as opposed to analyzing what it appears to have been over the past six years, makes it a much, much more difficult project.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mainly discussing the complexities and challenges associated with analyzing future market conditions.


Passage number 497.
 MR. LACKER.  Got it.  The second thing, very briefly, about Sweden.  I took the juxtaposition of what you described about Canada and Sweden to mean that the criticism youraised about Sweden is that they continued to raise rates after they lifted off, not that they lifted off at all. Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. Mr. Lacker is seeking clarification on a point made by the speaker, rather than expressing disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 498.
 MR. KAMIN.  Yes, that’s right.  If you take a look at various considerations that were present in Sweden around the time of their liftoff in 2010, GDP growth was picking up, and inflation was near the measure that they looked at.  The Taylor rule was starting to move up.  Reasonable people could differ, but it seemed like it wasn’t a terrible time to lift off.  I think the issue was that they kept on boosting the rate even as the euro crisis started to get worse and core inflation started to fall. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating different considerations and perspectives on the timing of lifting off in Sweden.


Passage number 499.
 MS. BRAINARD.  This is just an obvious “connect the dots,” but it would be useful to see an analysis of the extent to which we think we actually do have two separate instruments, especially in view this potential conundrum that we might see out there in which we’re talking about raising short-term rates but we’re not seeing corresponding moves in the long end of the yield curve. I don’t know where it would lead us, and I say this with some trepidation, but I think it’s worth having some analysis of this question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. The speaker is suggesting that it would be useful to analyze the extent to which they have two separate instruments and expressing some uncertainty about the potential outcome of the analysis. There is no clear disagreement or contention.


Passage number 500.
 MR. WILCOX. We’ll take a look at that. I fear that, due to the limits of our knowledge, we’re not going to be able to give you an interesting answer because, for example, coming back to Jeff’s question, if the size of the portfolio has a smaller effect on the term premium, and the policymaker recognizes that, the policymaker is going to say, “Gee, with a stronger portfolio effect, I need to run a more accommodative funds rate policy in order to get the kind of real economic outcomes and inflation outcomes that I have in mind.”  That’s the sense in which we treat these two policy instruments as linearly substitutable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply explains a potential limitation in the knowledge and how it may affect decision-making in policy.


Passage number 501.
   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But, David, it might be interesting to look at how a different shape of the yield curve affects the economy, because you could have the same stance with regard to financial-market conditions but with different yield curves under the two regimes.  It would just be interesting to know what it would mean to have a lower funds rate and a steeper yield curve versus a higher funds rate a flatter yield curve.  I think that would just be sort of interesting to look at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing curiosity about the potential impact of different yield curve shapes on the economy.


Passage number 502.
 MR. LACKER. If the marginal effect is much smaller, one must reinterpret history. You appreciate that, I’m sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It seems to be an expression of understanding and agreement.


Passage number 503.
 MR. LAUBACH. Perhaps just one small point on this.  As David highlighted, from the perspective of our models, these tools are very close substitutes.  But you might look at, for example, the taper tantrum as an episode in which actually market participants may have not understood them to be that way, but in which they thought that they were complements to the extent that they thought that the communications about asset purchases actually also conveyed information about the path for the short-term interest rates.  That’s hard for us to do.  I mean, we can make ad hoc illustrative assumptions, but that’s basically all we can do. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Let’s begin the go-round.  We have quite a bit of time pressure, so I think we should get started.  Let me call on President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are discussing different perspectives and difficulties in modeling and understanding the relationship between various tools and their effects on the market.


Passage number 504.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I expect conditions will make liftoff in 2015 appropriate.  But, in that context, I have a strong preference for erring on the side of waiting a little longer rather than taking the risks of moving prematurely.  I am assuming that the sequence of actions will be a signaling decision two, possibly one, meeting ahead of liftoff involving a change of statement language, an intervening meeting statement in the case of two meetings ahead that reinforces the high likelihood of a liftoff decision at the next meeting, and  then the decision.  I’m comfortable with this approach.  I do not have great confidence that the Committee can preserve a lot of flexibility once the signaling decision has been made and communicated, unless there is a development that is obvious justification for pushing the pause button.  I view liftoff as close to a fait accompli once the signal is given. Therefore, from a timing standpoint, I think the right question is how to weigh the risks of signaling liftoff prematurely versus the risks of waiting.  I think an earlier signal would entail significant risks if the context of that decision is one of little or no evidence of inflation moving back to target, accompanied by a mixed data picture and higher-than-normal uncertainty. I would also adjust the second question to, what developments do I need to see in the data in order to be willing to signal that a liftoff decision is coming in, say, 90 days.  I am prepared to take the first liftoff step in the absence of clearly affirmative evidence on inflation, as long as there is not a troubling accumulation of contrary evidence.  While that is a minimalist take on data dependency, I am comfortable with this approach, in light of the current apparent strength of the real economy.  But I can imagine a framework of affirmative evidence—call this my ideal framework.  Ideally, I’d like to see core inflation readings moving above 1½ percent.  I don’t think a “run rate” of core inflation below 1½ percent is confidence-inspiring.  Ideally, I’d like to see nominal wage growth increasing according to most measures of labor compensation.  And, ideally, I’d like to see clearly anchored inflation expectations.  I would characterize those criteria as affirmative evidence. As I said, I won’t hold out for that degree of data dependency.  At a minimum, I’d like to see evidence that the transitory effect of energy-related prices is dissipating.  I’m concerned that it would be bad “optics” to signal rate increases in the midst of a string of headline inflation reports that are moving away from our longer-term objective. I’d like to see evidence of a reversal of the recent disinflation trend seen in core inflation and less ambiguous   readings on inflation expectations.  Now, I can imagine real-economy developments that might substantially mitigate my concerns about incoming inflation data.  Data that indicate significant overshoot of my baseline expectations for GDP and jobs growth would bolster my confidence that inflation is very likely to move in the desired direction.  But I emphasize the word “significant” in that qualification. As regards the evolution of statement language, I support the general approach suggested in the staff memo.  However, I view the phrase “couple of meetings” as a bit clunky, because it’s open to loose or strict interpretation when it’s first used. Even if in casual usage the expression can mean an indefinite small number, I think it will be taken to mean two meetings. I think the bar for not following through once we make the language change should, and will, be very high.  If we want the signaling statement to preserve flexibility and remain true to data dependence, I’d prefer something like “economic conditions might” or “could soon warrant” or “may” or “could warrant an increase in one of the coming meetings.”  If that’s too coy, and the Committee wants to signal the next meeting or the following, I’d prefer saying, “Economic conditions are likely to warrant a target change at one of the next couple of meetings.”  In that case, keeping “couple of meetings” I would view is okay. Finally, I do not favor dropping the “balanced approach” language in our statements.  Concerns about the combination of high unemployment and high inflation have diminished, but that concern has been replaced, in my thinking, with a significant concern about a combination of unemployment below its full-employment rate and inflation well below target. I think it’s quite possible we will still face some tension in our dual mandate, so I would keep the “balanced approach” language.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.

Passage number 505.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My comments are quite consistent with President Lockhart’s.  I’m going to answer each of the three questions that was posed to us. For question 1, the risks at liftoff remain asymmetric.  We have the ability to raise short-term rates more quickly, but we do not have the ability to reduce short-term rates below the zero bound. Thus, as long as we are limited in our ability to offset negative shocks, and given my view that the risks of negative shocks from abroad are elevated, I would rather wait longer and, if needed, tighten faster should we have underestimated how quickly we would reach both elements of our dual mandate.  The global disinflation in developed economies adds further to the risks of significantly undershooting our inflation goal—the one goal for which we set an explicit target. In terms of question 2, I agree with the Chair’s assessment that, before we lift off, we need to be reasonably confident that inflation will be moving up over time.  Being reasonably confident would require that we have tangible evidence that wages and/or prices are moving in a way to ensure reaching our 2 percent goal for inflation within a reasonable horizon.  Thus, I would be careful not to rely too much on forecasts based on models that have been consistently overly optimistic about our return to our inflation goal, nor am I comforted that inflation surveys are not falling when a wide variety of market indicators are signaling disinflationary concerns and have been doing so since October despite tightening labor markets.  I would be uncomfortable removing accommodation before we see core inflation rising rather than falling, or strong evidence in disaggregated wage and price data that tighter labor markets are starting to move wages and prices in a way consistent with reaching our inflation goal within a two-year time frame.   In terms of question 3, given the uncertainty about both global markets and the uncertainty surrounding our inflation forecast, I would not constrain the Committee to provide a two-meeting warning prior to our liftoff.  We have already telegraphed that liftoff is quite possible this year.  My preference would be to drop the “patient” language the meeting before we expect to liftoff, and to say, “An increase in the federal funds target will likely be warranted soon, if economic conditions continue to improve.”  I agree with President Lockhart that we should not try to overcalibrate our communication strategy. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with President Lockhart on all three questions that were posed, and is providing their own perspective and recommendations.


Passage number 506.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you.  I guess, as Monty Python would say, “And now for something completely different.”  [Laughter]  I’m going to address each of the questions posed to the Committee.  Regarding how the FOMC should weigh the risk of lifting off too soon versus the risk of waiting too long, with economic growth strengthening, full employment approaching, inflation expected to move gradually back to target, and our policy rate at zero, I believe we may be underestimating the costs of moving too slowly.  The analysis in one of the staff memos that uses the FRB/US model indicates that there are similar macroeconomic outcomes associated with following either an early gradual policy path or a later steep path.  I’m a firm proponent of using models to inform our policy decisions.  But while our typical models may give us a reasonably accurate sense of the costs of lifting off too soon, they may not accurately reflect all the costs of waiting too long. If we lift off too soon, we’ll encounter employment and inflation costs that standard models reasonably capture.  Although the zero lower bound may exacerbate these costs, our models are sophisticated enough to provide some help in judging these costs.  If we wait too long to lift off, there may be benefits from avoiding future episodes of the zero lower bound—benefits that the model captures. But there are other potential costs, including the risks to financial stability of holding rates at zero for a long time.  Our models aren’t sophisticated enough to allow us to calibrate those costs and risks, yet we know from the crisis that the costs can be severe. In addition, there may be value in initially moving rates up gradually.  Although we believe we have the tools, we have not yet raised rates from the zero lower bound with a large balance sheet.  I would like to gain some experience when we are in a position to raise rates gradually rather than when we feel compelled to move rates up quickly. Although the Committee has been appropriately cautious up to now, I’m less concerned, in view of the strength of the economy, that the start of liftoff will negatively affect the expansion.  Monetary policy will still be highly accommodative after the first rate increase. That’s not to say that after we start raising rates we will necessarily continue on a predetermined path up.  The future is always uncertain; negative shocks can hit the economy at any time.  If incoming economic information materially changes our outlook, we would change our policy.  We may want to slow down the path of rate increases; we may want to reverse course.  But that’s what a data-dependent central banker is supposed to do.  I don’t see that as a problem. Regarding what developments I would need to see to be more or less confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent over time, first, economic research shows that it is very difficult to forecast inflation.  Even in normal times, our inflation forecasts aren’t very precise. The confidence bands around the forecast are wide.  Under today’s unusual circumstances, I don’t think it’s appropriate to require a higher-than-normal degree of precision regarding the forecast. I am reasonably comfortable with the forecast that inflation will gradually move back up to 2 percent.  Continued strong economic growth, and gains in the labor market, and longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable will buoy confidence in that forecast.  Historically, economic recoveries have been associated with gradual increases in underlying inflation.  Should economic growth falter or survey measures of inflation expectations begin to trend downward, I’d be less confident in the forecast. I want to note that I do not need to see wages accelerate to convince me that inflation will rise. Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff analysis that examined several measures of wages and broader labor compensation found that the lead-lag relationship between nominal wage growth and price inflation is tenuous.  The strongest correlations are contemporaneous ones, especially since the mid-1980s, and my staff found no evidence that wages and labor compensation help to predict price inflation out of sample. Finally, regarding statement language, I do think the suggestions in the staff memo for how the language might evolve in advance of liftoff provide a useful approach.  However, as I indicated in the memo I circulated to the FOMC last week, I believe we could take the opportunity to simplify the statement’s organization in an effective way. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Plosser.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 508.
MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Though the discussion about moving sooner or later is about balancing risk, I see it as somewhat neglecting that we have already built risk-management considerations into our decision about liftoff.  As the Board memos discuss, nearly all of the standard rules we use to evaluate policy have already called for liftoff.  In addition, the real federal funds rate has been below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* for about a year.  Analysis by my staff also assesses to what extent the period in which policy was constrained from being sufficiently accommodative due to the zero lower bound has been offset during the recent period when the funds rate has been held below prescriptions from an estimated policy rule.  They find the cumulative shortfall of accommodation earlier in the recovery has been more than offset by the subsequent cumulative excess accommodation. These factors suggest to me that the Committee has effectively already made a decision to move later and assume the associated risk rather than move in line with prescribed policy rules. In terms of the specific questions, I see liftoff in the middle of this year, which is in line with current expectations, and at a gradual pace consistent with a data-dependent approach and one that balances risks.  Waiting for liftoff until we reach full employment and inflation of 2 percent does not seem appropriate, particularly with an elevated balance sheet that continues to provide accommodation.  The temptation to see one more data point will always be present. History shows this can lead central banks to move too late.  Because of the lags we face in monetary policy, we likely will need to move before full attainment of our objectives. Alternatively, the risk of moving even later than in the middle of the year is that we may fall behind the curve and would need to move rates up more quickly. Of course, a rapid increase in rates could surprise financial markets and pose risks to financial stability.  Along these lines, I found the Board staff memo assessing the likelihood ofthese various events useful, though as the memo itself points out, the scenarios do not take into account reputation risk or financial-stability concerns.  Still, the combined likelihood of one of the adverse scenarios occurring was higher in the later and steep scenario than under the early and gradual scenario.  Also according to the simulations, the early and gradual approach effectively takes off the table a scenario in which we would have to raise rates aggressively. In terms of what developments I’d like to see, I’m a bit hesitant about drawing any bright lines regarding conditions that I’d have to see before liftoff, and I thought the Chair’s set of criteria from the December press conference was reasonable in that regard.  Further progress in labor market conditions along with confidence that inflation would be moving back to target are sufficient in my mind to consider liftoff.  I’m also willing to look through some soft readings on near-term inflation rates.  Of course, I’ll also be listening to anecdotes received from business contacts to confirm or contradict issues of wage and price pressures and stability in the price of oil.  Appreciation of the dollar and five-year, five-year-ahead inflation breakevens will also be important to that confidence. Regarding statement language, I’m generally comfortable with the suggested language in the Board staff memo.  It highlights that March is going to be an important decision point, and if I look at my current outlook, removing “patient” would be appropriate in March.  Given the emphasis on data dependence, we will clearly calibrate those first paragraphs of the statement to reflect any change in the outlook.  If the data soften, these paragraphs can convey a shift in the outlook, which will presumably cause expectations to adjust, but overall I see removing “patient” as giving us flexibility around the timing of liftoff.  Alternatively, if we keep it in this March statement it will most like push expectations back and limit our flexibility. Finally, I support President Mester’s proposal for recalibrating our statement, and, as others have noted, would welcome further discussion of that. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage contains contention or disagreement between Ms. George and some of her colleagues on the timing of liftoff and the associated risks. Ms. George suggests that the Committee has already made a decision to move later and assume the associated risks, while also arguing against waiting for full employment and inflation of 2 percent before liftoff. She also expresses caution about the temptation to wait for one more data point and states that moving too late can lead to risks and falling behind the curve. Additionally, Ms. George notes the limitations of the Board staff memo's scenarios, particularly in not considering reputation risk or financial-stability concerns. Finally, she expresses support for President Mester's proposal for recalibrating the statement and welcomes further discussion on the matter.


Passage number 509.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I view the first question—how the Committee should weigh the risks of lifting off prematurely versus the risks of waiting too long—as an instance of the universal risk of monetary conditions being too accommodative or too restrictive.  The former keeps the real rate below what the evolving needs of the economy would require and would generate excessively accommodative monetary conditions, and the opposite, too-restrictive policy, generates too little inflation and real activity.  My sense is that a substantial increase in real economic growth is occurring now, and together with the continued   tightening of labor markets suggests rising nominal interest rates are warranted.  The public generally expects us to wait until June or so, and inflation expectations remain stable—they aren’t elevating.  Those two facts suggest to me, although they don’t guarantee this, that lifting off in June would not be too late or too early. Regarding the second question, given the data we have on hand now, I am already reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.  I’m not certain, but I’m reasonably confident.  I base that on the stability of virtually every indicator of inflation expectations we have and the fact that the decline in oil prices that seems to have been the major recent threat to the stability of inflation expectations appears to have bottomed out.  If they resume falling, they could pose a threat to our credibility, but until then I think we should remain on track for a June liftoff. When we lift off I would need to see continued stability in a broad range of measures of inflation expectations, as opposed to breakevens, in order to remain reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent.  I’d also like to see core inflation stable and then rising at that point. Regarding the statement language, I like the idea of dropping the word “patient” in March.  President Rosengren argued that we wait until one meeting before liftoff to drop the word “patient.”  I actually advocated that approach in December when I said that the word “patient” should mean just the next meeting.  You took that off the table. Waiting until one meeting before and then moving—I don’t way to say it would make you a liar—would undermine our communications—let’s put it that way.  Now a corollary to making “patient” mean the next two meetings is that we have to decide in March about June, but I think we need to be very clear about what we’re deciding in March.  I don’t think we’re deciding to raise rates if we take “patient” out in March. What we’re deciding in March if we take “patient” out is toleave June on the table. In terms of crafting language, that’s important to me.  The way I feel about policy and raising rates, I’m attracted to President Mester’s language, which says “Based on its current assessment, the Committee anticipates that an increase in the target range will be appropriate in a couple of meetings.”  Now, I understand that’s strong relative to the proposal that’s on the table here, which is “could potentially warrant” or “may warrant” or “could cause us to think about,” or whatever.  I mean, it kind of strikes me as on the wishy-washy side. But, I don’t think it’s a choice in March.  Let me emphasize this.  We’re not choosing between starting a countdown and not starting a countdown because that raises the bar too high.  I think we should be finding language that’s suitably contingent and suitably open-ended, if that’s important to getting the Committee on board for dropping “patient” in March.  I’m flexible enough to be able to endorse such more elastic language.  But I’ll tell you that if the data evolve the way it looks like it will evolve, my sentiments would be more closely aligned with President Mester’s language. I like other suggestions President Mester made.  I like moving “reinvestments” to the beginning of the policy passage, because it’s a key component of our policy stance.  I like “realized and expected progress” better than “deviations,” because the latter, as President Plosser points out, connotes excessive precision about our estimate of the maximum employment objective.  I also prefer her version of conditionality.  It strikes me as more direct and straightforward. I think the choice in these simulations, “early and gradual” versus “late and steep,” is really not a realistic set of options available to us.  If we delayed an expected liftoff at a time when people were expecting us to lift off, I’m trying to think of what statement we would write that would preserve the average expected path of the funds rate. In the case in which we delay  liftoff, it’s hard for me to think of something that doesn’t at the same time cause market participants to lower their expected path of the funds rate.  I just don’t see how we can do that.  I don’t think it’s a real choice available to us.  I agree, in that regard, with Presidents Bullard and Fisher that counting on being able to make up for delay with a faster pace of tightening is really unrealistic. I’d also say I’m not favorably disposed to a laundry list of economic indicators in our statement along the lines President Evans suggests.  There’s something inevitably clunky and inevitably distracting about that, and I think we should keep our statement at a high level.  Those are my remarks, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. It is a statement expressing the speaker's views and preferences on monetary policy and the wording of the statement.


Passage number 510.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I would like to congratulate the staff on the quality of the memos we received, including some circulated in September that were also relevant to the discussions we’re having today.  They’re very useful. In the language we’re using now, as Vice Chairman Dudley has just said, March would be our last opportunity to send a message that we might move in June.  So if we don’t send that message, I think we’re saying we’re going to not move before September, and I’ll come back to that. What would we want to see.  Well, we’d obviously like to see continuing increases in employment and declines in unemployment.  We’d like to see some signs of a return of either inflation or nominal wage growth or both, and the question is, what inflation.  Well, we tend to say “core,” because core leaves things out.  But what core inflation doesn’t leave out are the secondary effects of oil that operate through the prices of other goods.  We also have commodity price declines affecting inflation. I don’t think that looking through the effect of oil and looking   at core inflation are the same thing.  We are likely to see a decline in core inflation, a decline that is likely to go away as the oil price stabilizes, wherever it stabilizes, and which could turn around rather quickly if, as some people think, we might see the oil price back in the range of $70 per barrel or so later in the year. The question that I’d like to ask is if we relate to core inflation, when do we think we’ll move.  It’s very unlikely we’re going to see very much by September, unless the price of oil turns around, which seems to mean that we’d move in December if we’re waiting to see core inflation, say, getting up to 1½ percent.  We need to think about whether that’s what we’d like to do or whether we want to craft language that will give us some possibility of changing our mind on having to have core inflation, let’s say, above 1.4 percent.  Now, there’s a range of views about whether 1.5 percent is enough.  I, deep down, believe that the Phillips curve exists and has a negative slope.  I’m not certain that I believe that it’s vertical in the long run, but I believe that it’s a lot more vertical than it has been at rates of unemployment that, until recently, were high and inflation very low. I think we’ll need to weigh what happens to our credibility if we have to wait longer than we now think, and you can say a lot of things about that, but we have to remember that there are two sides to that issue.  You remember that, in 1994, the FOMC waited.  It added to its credibility because it turned out to be right, or at least the former Chairman turned out to be right. It’s a question of whether we’re going to be confident that what we do is correct, and I think there will be some questions about that. I’d like to add a few comments on two issues about the question of early and gradual versus late and steep.  The staff’s stochastic simulations show outcomes are very similar.  Well, I’m not absolutely sure of the reasons, but if we are looking at a fully rational set of expectations, the similarity must come from the fact that they’re looking to future interest rates and future interest rate paths because, within two years, the two paths of interest rates converge.  Future interest rate paths will look very alike.  I suppose that’s one factor.  The other factor, which is very important, I think relates to something President Lacker said or somebody down there said.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It mainly consists of the speaker expressing their thoughts and opinions on various topics related to inflation and interest rates.


Passage number 511.
 MR. LACKER.  I’ll take credit if it’s a good thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is simply expressing their willingness to take credit if the outcome is positive. There is no contention or disagreement present in this statement.


Passage number 512.
  [Laughter] MR. FISCHER.  Somebody implied that the shocks are different in the two cases.  But the shocks are the same.  They run it in such a way that the two policies face the same set of shocks, and so that, as well as the fact that the expectations are the same, gives a certain similarity to the policies. I don’t know which is more important.  I suspect that the role of the shocks is, and what that means, and it’s something that I think we need to bear in mind, is that we really can’t confidently say “gradual.”  We are going to be driven by future shocks, as much as anything.  The shocks in the stochastic simulations are not chosen to be particularly large; they’re drawn from the history of past shocks.  And I think—and I’ve heard it said by several people, and I think I’ve heard the Chair say it on some occasions—the argument that we need to try and get a bit away from forward guidance during this period, which was just made by somebody up there [laughter]—by President Williams—is particularly valid because we are going into a stochastic world and that means that forward guidance is going to be a problem, and we should forget about it. Now, just building on that, with regard to the statements, I particularly value in the statement that it goes in the direction of making it clear that we will react to events as they happen and that we might—and there’s an explicit statement to this effect—change direction at times if the data come in that way. I think that’s very important because it is striking that, looking at the sequences of interest rate paths since 1994, there really is a tendency to keep going   for a long time in one direction and there are very few reversals.  Maybe that reflects how deeply the business cycle is the driving force in this economy and that it’s obvious to everybody.  I suspect that we have a very high weight on not wanting to change direction, and we need to think about that as we move ahead from the decision that we make.  I’m sure that my recommendation will be—I’m not allowed to talk about that, right. CHAIR YELLEN.  You can.

There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer expresses his personal feelings of being discouraged, and Chair Yellen acknowledges his statement without offering any disagreement.


Passage number 515.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On “too soon” versus “too late,” I continue to think that the risks of going a meeting too soon are greater than the risks of going a meeting too late.  I think as we get closer to the event—and we are really talking, for the most part, about differences of a meeting or two—that consideration weighs less and less for me.  My simple model of this situation is as follows.  First, the real economy is eliminating slack at a gallop, and on that path some slack remains, but essentially all of it will be gone by the end of this year, roughly speaking.  Inflation and inflation expectations and interest rates, at a minimum, haven’t gotten the memo on that—and it may in fact be that they are sending signals of possibilities of bad outcomes.  Policy is in a position to be patient, to see whether these bad outcomes materialize, to see whether we start to see a shrinking deviation from our inflation goal rather than a growing one.  But policy can’t be indefinitely patient in this situation, in which slack is being eliminated so quickly.  For me, what that means, ultimately, is that it will be appropriate to lift off in June or September. Now, as others have remarked, putting June on the table would mean taking the “patient” language out of the statement at the March meeting, which is seven weeks away. It is, I would say, not more than 50 percent likely, and probably significantly less than 50 percent likely, that we will get incoming data that would provide confidence to do that in seven weeks.  In fact, it is   probably equally likely that we will get data that suggests we are still moving further away on some measures, either in inflation expectations or in core inflation. The other problem here is that making that language change in March could potentially trigger liftoff, because the opposite of “unlikely to lift off for at least two meetings” is “likely to lift off in the next two meetings”—specifically, two meetings out.  I’ll come back to that language change in a second.  I actually think, if the January and February employment reports are really strong and global conditions settle down and that kind of thing, I could well be standing at the June meeting thinking it would be good to lift off now.  I think it’s a lot less likely that I would be in a position of feeling so confident as to do that at the time of the March meeting.  As I said, fortunately, conditions are such that the Committee can be patient, and I would add to those, frankly, at least domestically and importantly, financial conditions.  I have been concerned that there would be bubble conditions and things like that, which would suggest that we should move faster rather than sooner.  I don’t see that at all.  Again, I come down on June or September. Now, let me talk for a minute about what I would need to see on inflation.  For me, the strength of economic growth and employment is an important indicator, potentially, in giving confidence that inflation will indeed trend back toward our goal.  I can’t really answer the question about inflation in the abstract.  I would say, as a general matter, I’m concerned about low inflation, but perhaps less so than some, for two reasons.  First, we’ve got transitory shocks in oil and with regard to the dollar that I don’t see as a threat to the longer-term anchoring of expectations.  I wouldn’t personally be alarmed by small fluctuations in the Michigan survey during this unusual period.  Of course, those things may or may not be transient, if the dollar and oil keep moving.  Second, it would be one thing if these readings were coming in at a time when  the economy were weakening, instead of at a time when slack is disappearing very quickly.  I feel differently about them because of that factor. On wages, I would not make that a requirement.  I don’t think we know enough about the relationship between wages and price inflation to effectively make that a threshold. On core inflation, I would distinguish between what I’d like to see and what I would need to see.  Of course, I’d like to see real evidence of it moving back up.  Honestly, I think I’d need to see that the transitory lows that we’ve seen in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year are in fact transitory.  We need to have good reasons to think that those are transitory, and you certainly would need not to see it moving further away from the goal.  In September, I would say that as time passes, the bar gets lower for what I would want to see, or need to see, on inflation.  In other words, as slack disappears, that has to be increasing my confidence that inflation will, in fact, come up. Turning quickly to the statement language:  I think that folks have now put their finger on the issue, which is it would be great to have a technology for changing “patient” in a way that gives us a range of meetings—four or five meetings, a few meetings—rather than just the next couple of meetings.  If we’re lifting off in June, the time to do that would be at the March meeting.  Unfortunately, that makes it even more difficult to lift off in June.  If we don’t lift off in June, I think we can work on language that would make it easier to do that in September.  I’ll save any other comments on the statement.  I think the statement language that we have is quite good, and I think that this point is more important than the other small points I’ll make later. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.

 MR. BULLARD.  I think it’s just thwarting decisionmaking around the Committee.  Why are we doing this.  We say it’s data dependent. CHAIR YELLEN.  I am very willing to reconsider the issue of timing of press conferences.  I think we need to take a serious look at it. There are not only pros, there are also some cons in terms of how that could affect the operation of the Committee and Committee dynamics.  I would like to be careful and thoughtful, but I am open to doing it.  I think it is something that we need to seriously discuss.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. Mr. Bullard expresses his opinion on the issue of decision-making, while Chair Yellen acknowledges his point and expresses willingness to reconsider the matter. However, there is no explicit disagreement or conflict in their statements.


Passage number 521.
 MR. POWELL.  Madam Chair, before I do give up the floor, I would just add that, in my view, it is unlikely that seven weeks is going to make a big difference in terms of the right time to lift off or whether, in hindsight, we would look back and say, “Wow, I really wish we had lifted off seven weeks earlier or later.”  I don’t think there is that much in question. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Powell and Chair Yellen seem to agree that seven weeks is not likely to make a significant difference in the timing of a decision to lift off.


Passage number 522.
MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair.  There is actually, in a sense, six months at stake, because in March, if you take June off the table by leaving “patient” in, it means—unless we have a press conference in August—waiting six months until September.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement made by Mr. Lacker regarding a potential six-month delay in taking action on a certain matter. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 523.
 MR. POWELL. Sorry, Jeff, but liftoff would either be in June or September.  It’s three months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Powell is simply stating that liftoff would occur either in June or September, giving a timeframe of three months.


Passage number 524.
 MR. LACKER.  Right, right.  But if you decide in March you’re not comfortable and you want to leave “patient” in, you take June off the table, and it means you’re confident that you won’t want to move before September.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no explicit contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing a hypothetical scenario and the actions or decisions that would be taken.


Passage number 525.
 MR. FISCHER.  I think we are overlooking expectations in all this.  When we send a sharp signal that we’re going to do something, rates are going to move.  We’ll be seeing the effect of our decision spread over several months.  It’s not quite six months; it’s spread out a bit more over the period. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a conversation between Mr. Fischer and Chair Yellen discussing the expected effects of a decision on interest rates.


Passage number 526.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I thought I’d say something now that I planned to say in the policy round, because it has been brought up by President Bullard, and then you responded.  I just was going to suggest that you and the Committee consider a temporary policy of press conferences spanning a period conceivably starting March or April through September, with the statement that at that time we would review the need for that frequency of press conferences.  But I continue to think that something has to be done about, effectively, the problem that Governor Powell has put on the table.  I think, in this period, we want every combination of one or two meetings to be possible.  That’s what I was going to say in the policy round, so I’ll say it now.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  I agree. We will think about that very carefully.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 527.
 MR. FISCHER.  Thanks, Madam Chair.  In light of the concerns that people have had about the bracketed statement in paragraph 2, which may be driven by the fact that in many senses the foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more certain, rather than uncertain, in recent months, there is an alternative which seems less likely to be objected to.  Let me just say that I think we have to refer to foreign developments somewhere in here.  We did talk about them a great deal yesterday, and so it’s just a fact that that’s what we’ve been looking at.  The suggestion is to insert “financial and international developments” in paragraph 3, line 8, which starts, “and readings on financial developments,” and to erase the bracketed material about the foreign economic outlook in paragraph 2.  It’s after “financial” on line 8 of paragraph 3 to add the words “and international.”  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a suggestion being made by Mr. Fischer to modify the text by adding "financial and international developments" and removing the bracketed material about the foreign economic outlook. There is no indication of disagreement or opposition to this suggestion in the passage.


Passage number 528.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can I ask a clarifying question.  Would you continue to have the modifier “domestic economic activity” in paragraph 2 or not. CHAIR YELLEN.  I personally think that could go.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification on whether the modifier "domestic economic activity" should still be included in paragraph 2. They express their personal opinion that it could be removed.


Passage number 529.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, putting it in is saying something, because it’s not in now.  Stan, do you view taking “domestic” out as part of the package.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 530.
 MR. FISCHER.  I didn’t view it as a package.  But now that you’ve raised the question, I think it could just as well leave it out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is not contention or disagreement in the passage. The person is simply stating their opinion without contradicting or arguing with anyone else.


Passage number 531.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Okay. CHAIR YELLEN. Did everybody understand what the alternative proposal is.  Okay.  Then, let’s begin our go-round with President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a statement about starting a discussion with President Williams.


Passage number 532.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage is not provided.


Passage number 533.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, and I am going to comment briefly on the language regarding international developments in a moment.  The expansion is on a solid track, job growth has been especially rapid, and I now expect the unemployment rate to reach my estimate of the natural rate of 5.2 percent shortly after the middle of this year.  Indeed, in view of the momentum in the economy, and the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, I see a very real possibility, or probability, that we will significantly overshoot full employment next year, even beyond what is already built into the Tealbook baseline. Overall, I view the risk to the outlook as balanced, and so in that regard I am one of the people who is concerned about the introduction of the new language in the FOMC statement saying that the foreign economic outlook has become somewhat more uncertain.  Since that draft was initially circulated, the ECB has announced a very aggressive asset purchase program that, if anything, reduces uncertainty about the European growth outlook.  To my mind, it was a worry that the ECB would not take such a dramatic action that was one of the greatest risks to the foreign outlook.  To me, it would be ill-timed for us to introduce new language highlighting uncertainty about foreign developments on the heels of the ECB’s announcement.  Some might  misconstrue this statement as implicitly criticizing the ECB’s actions.  Therefore, I do favor deleting the bracketed terms, both “domestic” and the “although” phrase, and I’m fully in support of Governor Fischer’s suggestion to put in “and international” between “financial” and “developments” in paragraph 3.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses their support for alternative B and briefly comments on the language regarding international developments. They provide reasons for their concern and suggest changes to the language, but there is no direct disagreement or conflict with any other speaker or viewpoint in the passage.


Passage number 534.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  The real policy discussion of this meeting is whether we should drop the “patient” language in March in preparation for a June liftoff.  Though I cannot rule out that wage and price data could support such a move in March, it seems rather unlikely from this vantage point. We certainly have not seen the data to date that would make me comfortable with that decision. I am not at all confident that data on wages and prices are yet moving in a way that is consistent with attaining our 2 percent goal within two years. Just related to some previous conversation, I would also say that I am not confident that what we say is what the markets hear, and I do expect that when we drop the word “patient,” markets will be impatient and the tightening will have occurred.  I don’t think we should fool  ourselves that by changing the language we’re going to avoid a financial tightening at the time when the word “patient” is taken away. In terms of the language related to the foreign economic outlook, I think we have to keep in mind why the ECB felt like they had to engage in quantitative easing.  They didn’t do it early.  They didn’t do it with alacrity.  They did it late, and they did it because conditions forced them to do so.  I think we should keep that in mind, as well as that we’ve had a Greek election.  That Greek election is likely to create a lot of instability over the next month and a half.  I think it’s going to come to the fore exactly when this meeting’s minutes come out.  In the context of oil prices low, inflation low, and a possible Greek exit, I think it is actually appropriate to say that there’s a great deal of foreign uncertainty at this time.  I would leave the language as written. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren, could you support the alternative if others prefer that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker supports alternative B and the passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention with this position.


Passage number 535.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  I would actually prefer what we have here. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Rosengren and Chair Yellen are expressing their preferences.


Passage number 536.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the policy decision in alternative B.  I also support removing the bracketed language in paragraph 2 and inserting “international” per Governor Fischer’s suggestion in paragraph 3.  Otherwise I support the statement as written.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Lockhart expresses his support for alternative B and suggests making a change based on Governor Fischer's suggestion. There is no clear disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 537.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B today.  If the economy evolves as I anticipate, I believe it will be appropriate for us to life off relatively soon. The language in alternative B is fine for today.  I appreciate the changes that were made to the first   draft.  I, personally, would prefer not to make reference to the foreign economic outlook in paragraph 2 as it may be read as a comment on recent foreign central bank policy actions.  I’m not actually sure how adding “international” to paragraph 3 will be read.  That gives me some pause, too.  Will it be read as a response to criticism of how U.S. policy affects emerging market economies.  I don’t know.  My preference would have been to add something about foreign economic developments to paragraph 1 as a statement of fact, but that’s just my personal preference. The staff memo provided a workable approach for how a statement could evolve as we approach and reach liftoff.  The memo I circulated tried to simplify the statement organization within the context of the staff’s suggested approach.  It did not presuppose when that language might be appropriate. I do think the Committee is going to face a communications challenge whenever it decides it’s appropriate to leave the zero lower bound in the current environment of strong output growth and labor market momentum, but near-term measured inflation below goal.  But once we determine liftoff is appropriate, the challenge should not deter us.  As many have said, policy must be forward looking.  We will need to point to the forecast, explain why the forecast is reasonable, and explain why, conditional on the forecast, it’s appropriate to begin to reduce the extraordinary level of policy accommodation.  That said, that gives another reason that you may want to do this in a meeting for which you have SEPs, which is a press conference meeting as opposed to another meeting.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.  President Plosser.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. Ms. Mester is expressing her personal preferences and considerations, but there is no disagreement with any specific viewpoint or statement.


Passage number 538.
 MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Before I give my remarks on policy, I just want to indicate what a tremendous privilege it has been to be a part of this group and to serve on this Committee.  The seriousness and openness and high degree of professionalism exhibited by everyone that I’ve served with over the past eight and a half years has been both rewarding and enlightening.  I view this service as the highlight of my professional career, and I will forever value both the experience and the friendships that I’ve made in the process.  Thank you. Let me turn now to my policy observations.  I’d like to reiterate my belief that in view of the strength of economic activity, policy is overly accommodative at present and likely to remain so going forward.  I think that accommodation will probably require a fairly aggressive policy rate path in the future, although I draw some comfort from the staff’s memo indicating the results of that kind of tightening are not expected to be severe.  But, as I indicated in my earlier comments, such a policy is not without some significant risks, and I weigh those risks as being somewhat more significant than some do. Although I remain concerned about the stance of policy, I find the apparent misinterpretation of our statement language by markets that some people referred to a couple of times today as very highly problematic and fraught with potential risks of heightened volatility, and perhaps destructive consequences.  Communications problems seemed especially true in our previous statement.  Our own interpretation and the market’s interpretation of that statement appear to be different.  On the basis of comments in our go-round at previous meetings, I interpreted various members as viewing the change in language of our December statement as inconsequential or status quo, and even some who thought it might be a bit more hawkish stressed the fact that there was no change in the message. Market participants, as reflected in the futures path, moved out their expectations of liftoff from June toward September.  That is, the forward curve flattened. In light of the way language has evolved in our statement, the market’s interpretation appears to have been a reasonable one, but inconsistent with our SEP.  President Mester has pointed out that the statement has taken on the attributes of Hotel California, where words check in, but they have a very hard time checking out.  And I think that’s a very accurate description. As market participants read our December statement as ruling out a first-quarter move and, in effect, ruling out any action before June, this, in effect, increased the probability that liftoff could easily be delayed even further to September or beyond. To have our intentions misread in this way, I think, should concern us all, and we should think more critically and carefully about rewriting our statement in a more systematic and data-dependent way.  I’ve argued this for some time. President Williams, President Kocherlakota, and I, back in 2012, went through an exercise in which we proposed a different way of structuring and writing our statements, and we went so far as over a period of three meetings, I think, to actually rewrite the statement ex post to try to convey that.  Our timing and circumstances turned out not to be very conducive to that exercise, but I think—with liftoff approaching—we have an opportunity to start afresh, and I would urge the Committee to seize that occasion to revamp the statement.  That is, it’s time to check out of Hotel California. Now, given the continued consistent strength in labor markets as well as broad-based growth of the economy, alternative C aligns better with my assessment of appropriate policy.  Alternative B appears to indicate that June is the earliest possible date at which normalization would start, but I see it highly likely that the shift in the forward curve after our statement will be to push liftoff even further out.  More weight on September and less weight on June is likely to be the outcome of this statement. Finally, in the spirit of Hotel California, and in agreement with President Mester, I would caution us about adding the words “international concerns.”  I actually agree with her that if you  put something about international activity, putting it in in paragraph 1, in which we’re just stating facts about the state of the economy, rather than in paragraphs that refer to policy developments would be more appropriate.  After all, international developments are not always uniform, and once we put “international” in, we’re going to have a hard time getting it out.  I would caution us in that regard.  Those are my comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Plosser, is expressing gratitude for his time on the committee and his belief that policy is overly accommodative. He also expresses concern about the misinterpretation of the committee's statement by markets and suggests that the statement should be rewritten. He concludes by cautioning against adding the words "international concerns" to the statement. There is no explicit disagreement or contention in his remarks.


Passage number 539.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support the alternative B for today.  I think we should be prepared to remove “patient” in March if necessary or in April if not in March.  I don’t think right now we have much of a strategy for the April case.  I think this quarterly system that we’re on is putting heavy pressure on, say, the March meeting, the June meeting.  I think all “factions” on the Committee want to get something done at that meeting.  They feel like if they can’t get it done they can’t trade it off against the next meeting.  I think that inhibits normal decisionmaking on the part of the Committee. What we normally would do is trade off and say, “Well, we’re not going to do it today, but we’ll consider it more significantly next time when we have more data.” So I think that’s distorting decisionmaking, and I’d be a champion of any efforts to get out of that dynamic. I do not think we should include the bracketed phrases referring to overseas conditions in the wake of a largely successful launch of ECB quantitative easing and sovereign debt.  I think this is generally good news for the international economy.  I do not wish the Committee to cast doubt on that. I also do not think that we should put in this “international developments” in paragraph 3. Because that’s the policy paragraph, I think it might be interpreted as a reference to the dollar. Historically, we have not wanted to do that.  I know we’re operating on the fly here, but I would just recommend that for today we probably shouldn’t do that.   I agree with Presidents Plosser and Mester.  I’m happy in future statements to put something in paragraph 1 that’s of a factual nature.  The thing about the dollar is we wanted to defer to Treasury policy, and it gets very sticky.  I’m just not sure about that.  I would recommend against it for this meeting.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It includes the speaker's opinions and recommendations, but there is no explicit argument or disagreement with others.


Passage number 540.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support alternative B today.  I agree with those that would like to drop the language in paragraph 2 around the foreign economic outlook, and I am indifferent, at this point, about the consequence of adding “international.” I’ll leave that to others to decide.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker agrees with dropping the language in paragraph 2 and expresses indifference about adding "international." However, there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 541.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As I discussed earlier, I believe that continued patience is called for.  We should continue to monitor developments, inflation developments, core inflation, wages, and market measures of inflation compensation.  I share President Kocherlakota’s concerns about financial market prices regarding inflation compensation.  Because alternative B continues the level of monetary accommodation while we monitor developments like these, I can support alternative B. I’m quite sympathetic to the suggested change in the bracketed language that Governor Fischer suggested.  I kind of think the sentence in paragraph 3 in which we’ve chosen to place it is a “holding pattern” sentence.  I take the point that it’s hard to get those things out, but that sentence is going to change radically once we finally start to move.  That one doesn’t worry me as much as President Bullard’s comment about the dollar.  It does seem that, in this context, it’s talking about inflation pressures and financial developments, and then we insert “international developments.”  Gosh, that does sound like it might be inferred as meaning the dollar.  I just raise that as a cautionary note in line with President Bullard. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Evans expresses his support for alternative B and discusses some concerns and suggestions, but none of these statements directly challenge or contradict the views of others in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 542.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My views on the most likely path of appropriate policy over coming meetings have not changed much since 11:00 a.m.  I had December in there in my original draft.  I think April might not be too soon for liftoff in the sense that if I had to put a probability on appropriate liftoff, it wouldn’t be zero for April, but I understand the argument of many that the difference between April and June isn’t as important as the path after liftoff.  As much as I’d enjoy seeing you conduct an additional press conference, Madam Chair, and I do support President Bullard’s suggestion, I don’t see one meeting as a reason to dissent.  I can support removing “patient” from the statement right now. But, absent convincing evidence that inflation expectations have become dislodged or that the real growth outlook is at heightened risk of deteriorating, I doubt very much that in March I’ll see any reason for assigning a zero probability to an appropriate liftoff in June.  I doubt I’ll find it appropriate not to drop “patient” in March.  Data could come in differently, but that’s how I feel.  It would constitute essentially pushing everything back until September, and I wouldn’t see a rationale for that unless data are very surprising. Regarding foreign economic outlook, I agree with Presidents Williams, Mester, Plosser, and Bullard, and I don’t support adding it to paragraph 2.  Paragraph 3 is the wrong place for it for reasons that others have said.  It’s about our policy assessment.  I’d support adding it somehow in paragraph 1, but given the hour, I’d suggest we defer it. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Lacker, expresses his disagreement with the argument that the difference between a liftoff in April and June isn't important. He also disagrees with adding discussion of the foreign economic outlook to paragraph 2, suggesting it should be added to paragraph 1 instead.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 543.
   MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the statement as written, except for moving the reference to international developments to paragraph 3.  I’ve given a lecture on what we do about foreign developments, and I’ve told everybody we actually follow them closely and take them into account as they affect the domestic economy—always emphasized—and as relevant to our mandate.  I think it’s kind of ridiculous not to put it in on the grounds that the Treasury makes decisions on the exchange rate.  Well, good for them, but we look at what they do, and that’s all that this says.  I don’t see what the problem is in putting it in here. The problem with putting it in paragraph 1, which is where I also tried, is we make a judgment on everything in paragraph 1.  We say it’s either good or bad, it’s developing this way, it’s developing that way, and what would we have said on Europe.  Taking note of recent decisions in Europe, we take heart from the situation.  Well, we don’t comment on what other central banks do, and so that was what the problem was with putting it in paragraph 1. We can’t make a purely factual statement in paragraph 1. At least I couldn’t find one, and I’m sure a lot of other people tried.  We couldn’t find one that would be purely factual and didn’t seem to be making a judgment—it would be a favorable judgment, but once you start making judgments, you’re going to end up making judgments in the future.  I didn’t find a way of doing it, and I think it’s very difficult to do it. With this change, I support alternative B.  I will not fall on my sword if we lose, but I think it belongs in there and I think it’s relevant.  As I listen to the morning news, the dollar and its effect on the United States is getting a lot of attention.  I opened a newspaper that I happened to read, and it’s all over the front page.  We were the people, apparently, who didn’t notice any of this, because we don’t comment on these things.  Well, I don’t think that makes a lot of sense. I think we’ve got to put it in somewhere.   Let me make one point of interest.  I find it ironic that the dual-mandate central bank finds the most useful description of its current behavior, which many people appear to want, to be that of an inflation targeter.  If you look at those simulations that people like, they’re ones which put all the weight on inflation in the utility function.  It’s interesting that it turns out to be that way today just because we always thought of inflation targeting as coming from the top and not from the bottom.  Anyway, I support alternative B, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN. Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Fischer, disagrees with the placement of the reference to international developments and argues that it should be included in paragraph 1. He believes that not including this information is ridiculous and that it is relevant to their decision-making process.


Passage number 544.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as well.  With respect to the language, I supported putting in something on foreign economic conditions a couple of meetings ago.  I think it would have been a good idea then.  I don’t think it’s a good idea now, for the reasons that John and Loretta have identified.  There’s too high a risk that it’s going to be read as a commentary on what the ECB did.  I think they also make a good point about the insertion of “international” in paragraph 3.  I don’t feel nearly as strongly about that as the paragraph 2 language.  I affirmatively support removing the paragraph 2 language.  I’m indifferent as to whether “international” should be inserted into paragraph 3.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Tarullo, is explaining his support for alternative B and his reasons for not wanting to include language on foreign economic conditions. He expresses agreement with John and Loretta's concerns and supports removing paragraph 2 language. There is no apparent disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 545.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  On the international language, I would just point out that this sentence in paragraph 3 says that we “will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions,” which are real economy, and therefore, I think international developments fits in there without being obvious to me that there’s a link to the dollar there at all.  I do think it kind of fits there and doesn’t do any harm, and it does add something.  I would be happy to support it.  In terms of March, there is some probability, for me, that we will choose to go ahead in March and withdraw “patient.”  If we don’t, then I think there are two things worth doing.  The first is we should consider this idea of having regular press conferences—temporarily and on a nondiscretionary basis.  I think the idea of calling a discretionary press conference at the last minute just doesn’t work, so I think that’s worth talking about.  I think there’s less in that for me than for others because I do think it would be ideal to link it to an SEP publication.  And it’s unlikely that the difference in timing is going to make much difference in the end. The second thing I would say is, if we don’t lift off in March, in the next couple of meetings we ought to be thinking of ways to change, in the market’s mind, to something that gives the Committee more optionality over a period of time and, therefore, converts a certainty of liftoff in June into something far less than a certainty.  That would be a great contribution to our path, again assuming we don’t lift off in March.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily the opinion of Mr. Powell and there is no mention or response from other individuals to argue or counter his points.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 546.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  I think it is appropriate to acknowledge that the recent data on real activity have been favorable, and so I think it’s appropriate to see the stronger description of the labor market and real activity.  I think the language on inflation compensation is very important, so I’m glad to see that it’s in there. On this question of how to capture developments in the global economy, I think we have been following a very puzzling pattern of not talking about it in the statement and having the minutes do all the work.  I think that’s the wrong approach to be taking.  If you look at the forecasts, the amount of dollar appreciation and weakening of foreign economic growth that we have already seen have materially influenced our forecasts, both through core import prices and through net export channels.  It’s substantial, it’s material, it’s persistent, and that’s even afterthis adjustment was made to reduce the multiplier.  I think, as Governor Fischer said, it does affect our assessment of conditions in the U.S. economy.  I think we should try to capture it from that perspective.  I also agree that we don’t want to suggest that uncertainty has increased somehow.  I think we could find a way of doing it in paragraph 2.  Let me make a suggestion.  We could say, “While recognizing continued headwinds from the global economy.” That doesn’t say anything about the ECB’s action.  It just recognizes the reality that we are facing continued headwinds from the global economy. I also think the Governor Fischer’s suggestion of a modification to the subsequent paragraph is appropriate.  Again, I think it does affect our monetary policy deliberations, and I think I have as high sensitivities as anyone in this room as to how we work on international diplomacy surrounding exchange rates.  I think both modifications are very appropriately cautious and do not directly address the exchange rate, as I think we should not do.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. MS. BRAINARD supports alternative B, while also expressing disagreement with the pattern of not addressing developments in the global economy in the statement. She suggests including language to acknowledge continued headwinds from the global economy in the statement.


Passage number 547.
 MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  People know where I stand on policy, and I’m not going to comment very much except for say that I, probably longer than anybody at this table, have been advocating that we take into account the effects of globalization on monetary policy.  In fact, we established, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, the Globalization and Monetary Policy Institute.  Ben Bernanke announced it at a speech at Stanford University.  Unfortunately, he got the wording wrong.  Called it Globalization Institute on Monetary Policy, which gives us the acronym GIMPY, which I really don’t like. I’m quite sympathetic to Governor Fischer’s point.  I would not have the bracketed language in paragraph 2.  I would consider, or ask you to consider, his recommendation for paragraph 3, if it’s qualified by global circumstances as they affect the domestic economy. Yet,   having said that, I think injecting it now might lead to some of the concerns that were raised by President Williams and others. I would just suggest you consider it.  I don’t think it fits into paragraph 1.  The only place in which to put it is paragraph 3, if you put it there at all.  That’s my comment on alternative B. I want to say that I got here early today.  I sat in this room by myself.  This is my last meeting.  I took a selfie.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, Mr. Fisher is expressing his support for Governor Fischer's point and suggesting that the bracketed language in paragraph 2 be removed.

Passage number 548.
  [Laughter] MR. TARULLO.  On a Fed BlackBerry.

 MR. FISHER.  Yes, on a Fed—well, these are the carrier pigeons of the modern age.  But they can take pictures, so I took a selfie.

 MR. FISHER.  No.  I did share it with my children, however.  I sent it to my children just simply to say what a great privilege it has been for a decade to sit at this table in this room with some of the most brilliant, earnest, devoted, articulate people I have had the pleasure of serving with in Washington.  I have served in two Administrations before this.  This is the most civil and dignified forum in this city.  I just wanted to thank you all.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of gratitude and appreciation.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 552.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  With inflation running well below our objective and the outlook abroad still very uncertain, it’s not time to signal that liftoff is likely at one of the next two meetings.  In terms of timing, I’m still inclined toward June rather than later, but my probabilities attached to June have slipped a bit, as the declines in both actual inflation and market-based measures of inflation compensation have become more significant.In our public comments, though, I still would very much like to keep June on the table, because the gap between our own views and what is priced into markets is already quite large, and I don’t want that gap to grow any larger.  I’m worried, basically, that there’s this very large gap and we’ll say, “Oh, we can’t move because the markets will react very, very violently.”  That’s not a good situation to be in—one in which monetary policy is constrained because of our fears that financial market conditions will react too violently to what we do.  I think we very much want to keep June on the table in terms of market expectations.  In terms of the language, I’m happy to accept the suggested changes to paragraphs 2 and 3 on the international side. Finally, let me just, as the Vice Chairman, say a few things about Richard Fisher and Charlie Plosser’s contributions to this Committee.  I think it’s fair to say, speaking for myself, we didn’t always agree on everything.  But when we agreed, you were very worthy allies.  When we disagreed, you were very worthy opponents.  I very much appreciate your contributions, as everyone else around this table does, to the Federal Reserve and your commitment to public service.  I think that your willingness to test and challenge the conventional wisdom was very valuable, and I think it shows the value—this is something that Chairman Bernanke used to talk about a lot—of having a monetary policy set by a Committee, with individuals of diverse backgrounds and views.  I know that even when I didn’t agree with you at times, what you had to say made me think much harder, and very much contributed greatly to the quality and debate of this Committee. Thank you both for your service. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I think the issue we need to decide is how to deal with “international,” and we have two suggestions on the table.  I’ll start with Governor Brainard’s; she suggests replacing the bracketed “although” with “while recognizing continued headwinds from the global economy.” Let me ask if there is any support for that change as opposed to   adding “international.” Okay.  I’m not seeing a broad range of support.  I know it’s late in the day to be doing this. Okay.  Then, I think I’ve heard widespread support to get rid of the bracketed language in paragraph 2—so I propose doing that—and a diversity of views on whether to add “international” in paragraph 3.  I think my own view on this is that foreign developments are playing a major role in our assessment of the economy.  It will be noticed.  I’m not quite sure how it will be interpreted, but adding that word doesn’t involve taking a view on whether things are more or less uncertain.  There are a range of things we’re taking account of—oil prices, the dollar, the global economic outlook in different parts of the world, geopolitical developments.  It’s in a sentence that says our assessment of our progress takes into account a lot of different things.  To me, it’s relatively innocent and could stay there for a long time.  It’s not the kind of addition that puts us in a position of asking, “What do we do next time we have to modify it in some way.”  At least to my own mind, Governor Fischer’s suggestion is well within the acceptable range, but I certainly did hear concerns about adding anything at this point that would focus on international developments or be a change that we would be forced to live with.  I guess what I’m going to do is ask for a show of hands. Who would be in favor of adding “international”.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. Some members support adding "international" in paragraph 3, while others have concerns about adding anything related to international developments.


Passage number 553.
 MR. TARULLO.  Madam Chair, you are in favor of it. CHAIR YELLEN.  I certainly would be supportive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 554.
 MR. TARULLO.  Okay.  Then, I will.

 MR. TARULLO.  Yes. I feel the same way. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Can I see who would be opposed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Both speakers express agreement with each other.


Passage number 557.
   MR. LACKER.  I wouldn’t dissent on it.  In case you’re wondering.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you for that.

Passage number 558.
 MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks for clarifying.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN. Let me propose, then, that we vote on alternative B with the bracketed language in paragraph 2 removed, and in 3, the words “and international” inserted before “developments.”  It would be “and readings on financial and international developments.” Matt.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The laughter in the passage suggests a light-hearted atmosphere, indicating a lack of tension or disagreement. Both Mr. Kocherlakota and Chair Yellen seem to be in agreement about the proposed amendments to the text.


Passage number 559.
 MR. LUECKE.  All right. This vote will be on alternative B, which is on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas’s handout, with the changes indicated by the Chair:  the addition in paragraph 3, and without the language in brackets in paragraph 2.  It would also be on the directive for alternative B, as depicted on page 11 of Thomas’s briefing. Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes Governor Fischer Yes President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I guess all I need to tell you at this point is that we will meet next on Tuesday and Wednesday, March 17 and 18.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in the passage. It is simply a list of individuals voting and their responses.
