{"1980FOMC19800109meeting.txt": ["MR. PARTEE. Well, just a comment. I think I understood thedirection of your adjustments, Steve, as you went through this. But Icertainly don't understand it from this table on the second page. Ican't make out the magnitude of the adjustments. The arithmetic justdoesn't work very well, at least as I was trying to follow what yousaid, although I understand the direction of change. The otherquestion I have is on the very last comment you made, which was thateven after these adjustments you fell short of the desired adjustedreserve path because you just couldn't supply the nonborrowedreserves. Would you explain why it is that you couldn't get in thenonborrowed reserves", "MR. PARTEE. Well, one of the things that is disturbing me--about the whole period really but particularly the last month or so--is that we don't seem to be getting any market impact. We have tohave feed-through if this process is going to work. And yet,regardless of the shortfall in reserves and the shortfall in money andthe fact that borrowings were coming down, we held the funds rate atabout 14 percent all the way through. It looks as if somebody else isdetermining the funds rate. My question is: Under thosecircumstances, since we weren't anywhere close to the bottom level ofthe funds rate range that was specified, why didn't you put in morenonborrowed reserves in order to try to get this process of adjustmentin the market going more strongly than it did", "MR. STERNLIGHT. If I can interject, these last few days seemdifficult to explain; the rather low level of borrowing is just not1/8-9/80what one would associate with a funds rate of around 2 percent overthe discount rate. And, as Steve mentioned, because of that we madean interim adjustment in what we were aiming for in nonborrowedreserves, feeling that to try to press nonborrowed reserves down tothe path level in this current week would have meant going into themarket and extracting reserves when the funds rate was around 13-3/4or 14 percent. That obviously didn't make sense; and in effect we'vebeen running this week with an assumption that an adjustment of about$500 to $600 million should be added to the nonborrowed or taken awayfrom the [borrowed] reserves", "MR. PARTEE. I know it's awfully early, but what bothers meabout this whole experiment so far, Paul, is that I don't get anysense of dynamics working. That is, we had a very nice outcome takingthe quarter as a whole. I think everybody around the table wouldagree that the money number calmed down and the markets have beenbetter and all that. But that all could have been an adjustment tothe one-time change in conditions that occurred early in October, withmuch higher rates and the availability constraint and that kind ofthing. Since then I haven't had much sense of dynamics in the processthat would lead to, say, restoration of a higher growth rate in moneyif it were lower than what we wanted. And it has tended to be lowerthan we wanted. Perhaps it's just too early, but I don't see it.That's what bothers me", "MR. AXILROD. [Yes], in looking at the uses of totalreserves. But if you really make it tough for yourself and analyzethis by looking at the sources of total reserves, as I think oneshould--if you think you're on a total reserve target, which theCommittee has not clearly said it's on, having said it's much more ona nonborrowed target--you would say that we fell short on the totalreserves in this three-week period simply because we didn't put inenough nonborrowed reserves to push up the total reserves to target.Of course, if we had put in nonborrowed reserves--given the requiredreserves, which aren't going to change that fast--borrowings wouldhave dropped, one for one. Then eventually we would have had to addto the excess reserves, which were running [about] $400 or $500million, and we would have ended up with $700 million or so in excessreserves--that would have been the mechanism--and very close to zeroborrowing to attain this. The funds rate very likely would havedropped well below the bottom of the range. I would say--and I don't-5-1/8-9/80know if Mr. Sternlight would put it in the same way--that if youthought we were on a total reserve target, the reason we fell shortwas that we didn't push out the nonborrowed reserves aggressivelyenough and push up excess reserves--which is all we can push aroundwith required reserves fixed--sufficiently to get the total reserves.And what would have stopped us would have been the bottom of the fundsrate range. We'd clearly have gone below that.What in practice stopped us, I think, was that the pattern wesaw developing was not out of keeping with what in effect had beenplanned at the time of the Committee meeting and, judging from theCommittee's discussion, what the Committee would have foundacceptable. That is, at the time of the Committee meeting we had aNovember rate of growth in M1 of 1.9 percent, and for December--it wasjust after the meeting when we had the revisions--Ml growth of 7.9percent. Midway through the period we were looking at growth inNovember of 1 percent and in December of 3.8 percent. That was aroundmid-December. Then [our estimates changed] as we got to the end ofDecember, and now we are looking at [M1 growth in] November of 1percent and in December of 5.7 percent. So it began to look to usthat growth was moving up. That's what I was explaining to GovernorPartee. Required reserves were coming up and as the period went on--in the last two or three weeks--our shortfall against total reserveswas becoming less; it appeared that we were moving in the properdirection. And since we were right on the nonborrowed adjusted path,which was already $150 million above what was originally set, itdidn't seem reasonable in that context to take a more aggressiveaction to chase the total reserves in this very short period. I don'tknow whether I'm being extremely clear, but I think that's the trueanswer", "MR. WALLICH. The mechanism described just now must have somesimilarity with what went on during the '30s when [the FOMC] foundthat it could not generate the money supply it wanted. Well, I don't1/8-9/80know what [the FOMC at the time] wanted, but at any rate most of theexpansion they did engage in, mostly through gold purchases notsecurity purchases, went into excess reserves. But this is a veryfaint effect here, which would not worry me a great deal. What doesworry me is that I now encounter, not only here but abroad, acriticism of our procedures that in effect says we're back to theprocedures of the 1920s when borrowing was regarded as contractionary;the more borrowed reserves you had, the more contractionary effect youwere setting up. Banks were trying to get out of debt, so to push thebanks into debt was the way to tighten credit; that is sometimesassociated with Riefler's name. As I say, I have heard this commentthat our procedures now are very similar to that. We push the banksinto rediscount, by operating on nonborrowed reserves; the lessnonborrowed reserves we supply, the more they have to borrow; andthat, we say, lowers monetary expansion. It does so presumably bydriving up the funds rate and driving up other rates, and that reducesthe demand for money. Now, I wouldn't say that this is a badmechanism. And I wouldn't say that borrowing is expansionary as someof our critics say in the sense that more reserves, of course, is moreexpansionary than less reserves. I would say that we aim at a givenvolume of reserves and that the composition of that volume of reservesmakes a difference. If they're all nonborrowed, it's moreexpansionary than if a higher percentage of them is borrowed. Thatseems to me a reasonable approach.In support of a rejection of this criticism I would arguethat some of the things we experienced here all do point in somewhatthe same direction. We got low borrowing at a given interest rate.That would suggest that there is greater reluctance to be in debt nowthan there was in the past and that there is a true reluctance to bein debt that causes banks to restrain their [credit] expansion.Second, we get high excess reserves. Well, that seems to be the samephenomenon of caution on the part of the banks. They don't want toget into debt; they'd rather have excess reserves. And, finally, thefunds rate remains high and doesn't go down as one would expect.Well, again, they're bidding for funds in order to have liquidity, inorder to be safe. I could visualize that this is simply happeningbecause we're in a transition period and they are learning the ropes.And after a while the willingness [to hold] excess reserves will wearoff and the reluctance to borrow may wear off. But for the timebeing, it seems to me that this criticism that I hear--and as I say Iwas surprised to hear it in Switzerland--is not justified. I'd liketo hear what Peter and Steve have to say about this", "MS. TEETERS. But why would they change in mid-course. Youseemed to be right on track in the first four-week period and thensomething changed and they became more reluctant [to borrow] in thepast three weeks", "MR. TIMLEN. Mr. Chairman, I must say that as a formerdiscount officer I find my views very sympathetic to those of GovernorWallich. I'm reminded of the fall of either 1966 or 1969, when therewas a good deal of discussion as to why the funds rate was so low. Inmy mind the explanation that fall was that under some program of easyaccess to the discount window related to business loan restraint,was borrowing $1 billion for about three or fourstraight weeks. And the funds rate slipped, much to the consternationof the people at the Desk. But [the reason] was rather simple: Therewas an additional supply there against a rather constant demand", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's right. We haven't done it in anydirect way. I'm not sure how many people are convinced they know justwhere the federal funds rate should be now. Anyway, we avoid thatexplicitly. On the other hand, I would remind you that nothing thathas happened--or that I've observed recently--makes the money/GNPrelationship any clearer or more stable than before. Having gonethrough all these redefinition problems, one recognizes how arbitrary-13-1/8-9/80some of this is. It depends upon how you define [money]. And thetechnique does, I think, make it a little more difficult in some ways,to say the least, to reconcile some conflicting short-run objectiveswe have regarding the domestic or international [economy] or moneysupply against interest rates, or whatever. There may be a time whenwe really want to see interest rates lower or higher and they may notbe behaving that way, and they may continue not to do so for weeks andweeks and months on end with this technique. So, there are argumentson both sides. I just want to see whether we have a consensus that wewill continue on this until further notice anyway. We need to makethat explicit judgment", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now, I don't know whether we want to dealwith Phil's particular question. It's a matter of judgment as towhether or not a big enough adjustment is being made that it should bebrought back to the Committee. I wouldn't anticipate adjustments asbig as you're suggesting. If we're going to meet as frequently aswe've been meeting, because the Committee is [conversant] with theprecise techniques we've been using, we can express some judgment whenwe're meeting. I suppose it's theoretically possible--and I don'tknow whether you have any answer other than to leave it to my judgmentessentially--to say that when the confusion gets great enough we wouldwant a Committee meeting", "MR. COLDWELL. Similar to the international", " That's the confusing--MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, we've gone three months and onlyhad problems in the last month. Like Governor Partee, I have no ideawhat the limit should be. I suggest we go another month, to the nextFOMC meeting, see what we encounter and get some idea of how much thevariation is going to be.SPEAKER(.). Yes, I'd do that too, but we still don't knowwhat the limits are. I don't think we know the magnitude of theproblems yet and at what point the problems become a policy decisionrather than a technical adjustment", "MR. WILLES. Well, we don't control it because of the waythings are apparently set up. We can change things and set it up sowe can control it", " Well, it's operational factors plusclosing the window that make reserves--MR. COLDWELL. Yes, but it makes a whole lot of difference interms of where we come out, not just in the period between [meetingsof] the Open Market Committee but beyond, how much nonborrowed isthrown into that package. And if the staff, or you, or whoever elseis guiding this operation is throwing an extra billion dollars in thepath, the Committee is faced with a fait accompli at the next meeting.That's all I'm saying. If the Committee wishes to concede that to youand the staff, it ought to do so; otherwise it's wide open", "MR. PARTEE. I don't mean to disagree with you, Phil; I thinkit's something that has to be looked into. I would disagree with you,Ernie, in that I think we are concerned about nonborrowed as well astotal because we have preconditions [bearing on how the operationsaffect] the circumstances for the next meeting. But that all has tobe worked out", "MR. AXILROD. I guess there are always divergent views amongthe staff; I would have given a somewhat different answer to be frankabout it. We discuss these things all the time. And [my] answerwould be that if the Committee were willing to see the funds rate dropas much as that, I woud have been tempted to put in even morenonborrowed reserves. On the other hand, once I saw that the requiredreserves were rising against that, I don't think I would have made anyfurther adjustments, because I realize the Committee wasn't intent onreally forcing money out like mad to get a 3 percent growth rate.Chances are you might get more later. It's that kind of judgment", " Simpson, whois well versed in these measures, is here and is--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You probably were going to say this, butlet me just make one introductory comment. We ended up with the M-1Aand M-1B [measures] to allow for [negotiable order of withdrawal] NOWaccounts and [automatic transfer services] ATS. As it turns out, inthe current estimates there isn't very much difference. But we stillanticipate that there will be substantially more difference ifCongress goes ahead and straightforwardly authorizes NOW accounts.The theory here is that ATS, which has been legal for a year, has kindof run out of steam in terms of making any difference, but NOWaccounts may well not have. So, whatever we decide upon for the long-range targets next month, we probably are going to have to go back andreadjust if Congress does permit nationwide NOW accounts. We'll haveto adjust both M-1A and M-1B, presumably in opposite directions. Wecan do that, I think, consistent with the substance of whatever wedecide. By the time we announce them, Congress probably will haveacted anyway", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Every time we discuss this, I get verynervous about this great targeting. Is this all comprehensible. Dowe have comments or [questions]", "MR. MAYO. --that we're better advised this time around withthese new measures coming out to settle on, say, M-1B and adjust it ifnecessary later on rather than try to straddle an average of M-1B andM2 because we don't know about nationwide NOW accounts. I think itwould be cleaner and easier to explain if we just settled on one[measure], even though we recognize that we might have to make someadjustments to it later on", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I just don't know how worthwhile it is totry to guess whether it's better in a memorandum item or the table.We may have the problem that M-1A will look very low. And would we-25-1/8-9/80want to keep publishing a figure that looks very low without having afigure along side it that looks relatively high. I don't know how wecan outguess all this", "MR. AXILROD. Our econometric evidence, I believe, is quitemixed. The staff is well divided on the subject. With the Boarddivided and the staff divided, the Board came up with a very judiciousdecision", "MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, does the Committee not feel that themarketing or explanatory aspect of this is important. I'm talkingabout the ability to relate to my friendly broker, who busted out ofschool his sophomore year. I'm being facetious, but isn't itimportant to make an effort to be as clear and as simple as possiblein describing this", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think it's an important problem,and one with which we anticipate some real difficulties. I take aliteral exception only to your final point. The effort to be assimple as possible may be misleading. I come back [to my view that]the reality is complex. That is the difficulty we are dealing withduring this transition period. But I think it is a major problem, andwe plan to have press briefings and so forth beforehand so that wegive as good an explanation as possible. Now, as you can see,providing there is no change in the law--if the staff is right and Idon't know whether they are or not--there isn't much differencebetween the two measures, which makes this all look ratherunnecessary. But if they are right and we have nationwide NOWaccounts [authorized by] Congress beginning in March, there's going tobe a significant difference between the two. Therein lies theproblem. We're preparing the way. If the law were going to remainunchanged, I'd say dispense with M-1A or M-1B. We would go one way orthe other and make it simple. But we do anticipate a significantdifference if we have nationwide NOW accounts", "MR. COLDWELL. Wouldn't the real problem occur, Steve, if wegot a surge in M-1B and [the funds] didn't come out of demanddeposits", "MR. BALLES. One more question or suggestion, Mr. Chairman,if I may. I think there's a big difference between what we publishand what we target. I certainly have no problems with what isproposed to be published here, for those both inside and outside theSystem who'd like to experiment with different versions or measures ofmoney. I believe we ought to think pretty hard, though, about whetherwe want to continue to target four intermediate variables. In thepast we've had four targets: Ml, M2, M3, and bank credit pro forma.But in practice [our targets] have turned out to be M1 and M2. Inpractice we haven't really tried to control M3, and we have justobserved what goes on in bank credit. The Bluebook again sets forthin the various alternatives four different intermediate targets. Ihave a strong feeling that that's about two too many. I wish somehowwe could find a way of narrowing that down to about two that we reallyuse in practice, no fooling, as far as decisions of this Committee areconcerned", " I was hoping to have a little discussionthis afternoon on that subject--not necessarily on that aspect but--MR. BALLES. Well, if I had to do it right now, I'd pick M2for one of those versions. I think having two variables asintermediate targets is really about all that is needed and all we canmeaningfully handle", "MR. EASTBURN. I'd like to respond in three points: One,we've been talking for three years or so now about our basic strategybeing one of gradually reducing the [growth of the] aggregates. Ithink your points about the business situation and inflationaryexpectations and the image are exactly right. In view of that, itseems to me that our strategy should be one of gradually reducing the[growth of the] aggregates. Rather than alternative one or two, Ilike the formulation on page 11 of the Bluebook, which has the fourstrategies. And of those four, I like number four best because Ithink we probably are going to get a tax cut and should plan a gradualreduction [in the growth] of the aggregates in light of a likely taxcut", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just say a word here and I'll shutup about it. When I look at these different strategies, all of whichcome off the econometric equation from the base forecast, I must saythat I have great doubts about these adjustments in the econometricequations. I guess you're driven to strategy four because it looks[good] on all the numbers", "MR. EASTBURN. I'm not arguing the numbers at all, Paul. I'marguing the basic philosophy of proceeding [with] a gradual reduction.All right, that's the first point. The second point is that I feelstrongly that we should not announce that strategy and specificallythat we should not announce numbers. I think we have a credibilityproblem and I believe expectations hinge basically on policyperformance and not what we say, because nobody will believe what wesay until we perform. So, I think we should have this as ourphilosophy but should not announce any specific numbers. We can talkabout this being our intent.Third, we should reserve flexibility for change in case wewant to change our strategy as circumstances develop. I was struck,for example, at the precision that's incorporated later in theBluebook in the forecast of interest rates, assuming variousalternatives and combinations and permutations. That may be aninteresting exercise but I think its accuracy is greatly in question.What we should do is remain flexible enough so that we can change anddepart from this strategy if and when circumstances require it. Butthat should be the basic idea unless we see reason to change", "MS. TEETERS. I would support what Dave was saying.Announcing 3-year targets is an invitation to losing all ourcredibility. We have enough problems projecting out 1 year let alone3 years. To box ourselves in by saying we're going to come down tocertain levels by 1982 is an unnecessary restraint and an unnecessarydanger. We may have that intention, but there's enough variability inthis economy that we shouldn't go out on that limb; we should continueto do it by performance. I'm not sure I even want to talk too muchabout what we're going to do in the future--other than [to say wewant] to continue to restrain [money growth]--so that we have theopportunity to change our mind as time goes on. I've probably donemore 5-year projections than anybody else at this table and I speakfrom experience: They're all wrong. You don't come out where yousay you're going to if you go down that line. I strongly oppose anypublication or any commitment to a specific number for future years.I wouldn't narrow the ranges. We have a difficult year ahead of usand I think we will need all the space we can get. For thealternatives, a midpoint somewhere around 5 to 5-1/2 percent isprobably the appropriate way to go.I would like to bring up one thing that bothers me a little.A year ago we were in much the same position. We had the money supplydown--in fact, going negative--and I'm not sure any of us reallyunderstands why the money supply did that between September and March", "MS. TEETERS. Well, that would be fine, Fred, if we were thesole source of the inflation. But it's like playing poker with theother players always pulling all the wild cards. We're playing withOPEC, and we really have no control over oil prices. To say thatwe're consistently going to reduce inflation in a situation where wedon't have control over inflation is, to me, going out on a limb.There may be a time, if this so-called recession turns very deep, whenwe might want to reverse our policies completely. And the risks onthis recession, it seems to me, are basically on the down side. So, Ijust find it very difficult to commit myself to any sort of long-termposition", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're saying you wouldn't give numbers", "MR. WALLICH. Well, I start with the experience we've had ofhitting our target on M1 and getting as a result a severe accelerationof inflation plus a much stronger economy. We've been waiting forthis recession now for a year. It was predicted for the early part of'79. So, this leads me to think that there is something about ournumbers that just does not reflect the true concept of money. [Idon't know] whether we're going to capture that by our revisions. Ithink we'll make improvements but not really capture everything thatis happening in the way of rising liquidity, and that makes me leantoward low numbers. I also see that there are very ominous changesgoing on in people's habits and expectations. In the last surge ofinflation, 1974-75, there was a worldwide tendency for saving rates toincrease. That was almost the same in all major countries. I haven'tchecked out what happened in this period, but we see now what happensto us. People have a different attitude. They are less afraid thatthey'll lose their jobs, but they're more convinced that inflationwill go on. That is what the decline in the saving rate seems to meto say.Now, as to action, I share the view that we shouldn't make anumerical commitment because the meaning of that commitment isn'tclear enough, particularly if we had to start with a commitment thatsays 6 to 5 to 4 percent or 5 to 4 to 3 percent. I very much doubtthat we'd hit that because circumstances could force us into a pro-cyclical pattern. We're not going to have the desire or ability tocut off a strong economic expansion, and we'll find ourselves beingpro-cyclical. Therefore, I think we have to start with a low rate ofmoney growth right away. I would say that 3 to 6 percent is a goodstarting point. If we went much higher than that, we'd be inimmediate danger of getting into negative real interest rates withwhat they do to allocation of credit and inflation and the dollar. Onthe other aggregates, I'd like to see more clearly how they are likelyto behave. But I think a fairly narrow [Ml] range like 3 to 6percent, aiming at the midpoint of 4.5 percent and expecting that thatreally is a symbol for much more liquidity than it seems to give us,is the way to start", "MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, I guess for different reasons Iwould opt for not going to longer projections. Frankly, there are somany uncertainties that there are enough difficulties with 1980. Andeven there, I would hope that we could relate our longer-run look at1980 to the actual targets that were in place for 1979 and not ourresults or our experience for 1979. I would not be too much forchanging these during the year, even with the chances of recession orOPEC influences. I think [any] changes we are going to make [in theranges] are going to have a rather minimum influence, and I'd beinclined to stick to our longer-run targets. In doing that I have apreference for looking at those associated with alternative 2.Contrary to what some of the others have suggested, I'd be inclined tonarrow the target ranges, maybe still with 4-1/2 to 5 percent as themidpoint, but certainly not wider than 4 to 6 percent if M-1B is whatwe are going to be talking about", "MR. MAYO. Mr. Chairman, I find myself philosophicallyinterested in the idea of reducing the ranges, but I don't think thisis the time to do it. I think we need all of the flexibility we canhave here. I find myself at least at the moment utterly opposed togoing above 6 percent on the upper end of our range for whatever wecall [narrow money]--Ml, M-1A, M-lB--for psychological reasons. Itwould give a wrong impression abroad regardless of how much we triedto explain it, and to some extent that would be true at home as well.So I come back to the 3 to 6 percent range that we had, not justbecause we had it this [past] year but because I think we haveestablished some modicum of credibility in keeping [actual growth]within the 3 to 6 percent. We're certainly very close to the upperedge, but we still have established a credibility which I have theimpression at least was not achieved even by some of our more austerepartners, Germany included. I feel that this a restrictive policy.Like Willis, I feel that the variability of the outlook iseven greater now than it has been, certainly in my memory as a memberof this Committee. That's one of the reasons I wouldn't narrow therange. I would also urge that we keep our powder dry until we see howthings are moving along six months from now. As to whether we want tochange that range, I certainly wouldn't make [our intent] public, andI certainly wouldn't stick to 3 to 6 percent through, shall we say,hell or high water. I feel very strongly that to use a [number] ofany kind beyond 1980 is foolish. I feel, much as Ernie does, that ifwe state our intention in the present environment as defined by thePresident's messages and so forth and so on, our own analysis andrelated intention to reduce the expansion of money supply further as-42-1/8-9/80long as the inflationary forces rage as strongly as they do is as faras we can go in talking about '81 and '82. I join Nancy [in her viewabout long-term projections]. I'm not going to question whether she'smade even more 5-year projections than I have, but we made the firstone on the budget in the 1971 Economic Report. It was a fine paperexercise, and the way to start is to start. But I would hate to goback and review that now, even with all the adjustments, and realizehow shaky it was at the time", "MR. WILLES. My wife made me promise that I would be moreagreeable in the new year, so I would like to say that I agree witheverything that has been said. I'd like to say it, but the fact isthat I don't agree. But since the hour is late I will be very briefin stating my disagreement. We all agree that the outlook isuncertain. Where we disagree is whether that makes any difference ornot. If we really think that if we knew what the outlook was we couldaffect it in a systematic way, then we end in one side of the[corner]. But some of us have the view that even if we think we knowwhat is going to happen, there is no systematic, predictable,effective way that we can have an impact on it. Because of that, onecan end up with quite different policy implications. I feel perfectlycomfortable in the abstract in saying that, yes, the outlook isuncertain but that policy ought not to be uncertain. Policy ought tobe a given, and by making policy a given we can in fact reduce some ofthe uncertainty of the outlook. The implication of that is that weshould not only decide but should specify in great detail what ourtargets are for the next five years. Unfortunately, we have one minorproblem with that, which is that a change in technology is going on inthe financial markets that makes all the numbers, if not irrelevant,at least highly uncertain. So, since you have given us an extramonth, I would like to wait another month and then be able to comeback and tell you what I think those numbers ought to be. It's clearthat we can't in the current environment spell out any M for the nextthree years because the technology is bound to change in such a waythat it would make any number we specify obsolete. It may be that weare going to have to move to some kind of reserve target and spellthat out for three years. But whatever we do, we need to find a wayto reduce the uncertainty of the outlook that is associated withpolicy. We can't reduce the other uncertainties, but we can reducethat uncertainty. I think that would be a substantial accomplishmentindeed", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm torn here between the hour andhaving only three more names left. I'd rather like to get through thethree names if we can do it with great dispatch. Mr. Rice", "MS. TEETERS. I move to ratify", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Did I see someplace that nonunion wagesare now rising faster than union wages", "MR. COLDWELL. In effect, Jim, what you've done by therevisions this time is to push the recession into 1980; 1979 is nolonger a recession year. What are the chances of [a recession] beingdeferred another six months", "MS. TEETERS. Don't forget the $18 billion so-called tax cutis just not a tax increase. It's a funny tax cut", "MR. KICHLINE. $30 billion. The Administration, weunderstand, is trying to hold the number in its budget message toaround $15 billion. But we have a different economic situation. Ithink that's right that [the deficit] is an upward constraint because-52-1/8-9/80if we have a tax cut [this year], it seems to me that in fiscal year1981 the deficit could easily be in the $60 to $70 billion range", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I think the emphasis on the consumer iscertainly appropriate here. I would point out, Phil, that in nominal-53-1/8-9/80terms goods expenditures rise every quarter, which I think makes thepoint that consumers are being pressed not only by taxes but also byinflation, particularly the inflation in oil prices which doesn'treally have a personal income counterpart in it. The saving ratebehavior is extraordinarily interesting. I calculate that in '78 andthe first half of '79 the personal saving rate averaged a bit above 5percent, fluctuating up and down but never getting much below 5percent and being above it in some quarters. That was a period ofrapid increases in installment debt, which reduces the saving rate ofcourse from what it would otherwise be since it's a reduction fromgross savings. Then in the third quarter of '79 it dropped to 4.3percent with a lesser rise in installment debt; and in the fourthquarter it apparently dropped below 4 percent to maybe 3-1/2 percentor something like that with a still further decline in the rise ininstallment debt. So the question is: In terms of components, whatis moving that saving rate so strongly downward. I suppose one couldargue that if people are moving from cash to goods, the financialsaving is falling off. That would be one indicator. If, on the otherhand, there is a generalized sort of squeeze so that people don't haveenough income to cover [their expenditures] and there's an attritionin saving that results, that's a different kind of story. If it's thefirst case, we could have a continued high level of consumption. Butthat doesn't seem to me consistent with the reduction in installmentcredit. If it's the second case, we would have a very substantialdecline in real consumption. You probably don't have much informationon the components of the saving change, but do you have a view on whatis happening there", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, I have a view that in fact the economyhas not been generating much real disposable personal income. [Itsgrowth] peaked out in December of 1978. In terms of the monthlyfigures, it bounced around but in the second half of last year, forexample, real disposable personal income is estimated to have gone upless than 1/2 of one percent. And yet we are getting expenditures,which we estimate, for example, in the final quarter of the year tohave been at 3 percent. Clearly, in our view, it's a strong attemptby consumers to maintain their spending patterns despite adversefactors in growth of real disposable personal income. So, it is thatsort of issue. It's true that the issue is wrapped up with whether ornot we are getting durable goods purchases [from] savings, and thatwould tend to drive the [saving] rate down in a given quarter", "MR. WALLICH. This change in consumer behavior, as I saidyesterday, strikes me as very significant. If, now, in a period ofaccelerating inflation people don't save more but save less, theremust have been some change in their evaluation of the situation. Themost plausible guess, it seems to me, is that in '74 people weregenuinely scared. They didn't know where the economy was going andwhether they were going to have a job, so they cut back on average.Now with a more moderate recession predicted, there seems to be less-54-1/8-9/80of that fear. On the other hand, there's a more rational attitudethat if they buy now they save 13 percent. They are buying; they didbuy cars, which was perhaps the first wave of that. Now they arebuying something else. You are quite right that [consumer spending]seems to go from one thing to another. But I would argue also inlooking at consumer debt, which has risen relative to income, that theconsumer probably looks at it in relation to future income. So, withfuture nominal income rising, the debt ratio to him appears less thanit is.My main comment is on the nature of our staff's forecast. Itis in a sense a formal exercise because you don't give weight to thepolitical probability of a tax cut. So this [forecast] is what wouldhappen if the things that are already planned and decided were tohappen. The Board staff's forecast is under those of forecasters whoare not bound by that constraint; I think those forecasters generallyaccept and expect a substantial tax cut sometime this year.Therefore, the shape of their recession is different. Their recessionis shorter than ours and its end is different; instead of sauceringout very flat, it comes up more V-shaped. And their inflationexpectations--although I don't know this for a fact, but it seemslogical from these differences in their view of the income pattern--should be higher than ours. Can you say anything about outsideforecasts and the like", "MR. WILLES. That's what I thought. Well, we've been havinga lot of discussion about tax cuts and responding to recession and soon, which is a conversation that is similar to those we've been havingfor the last 10 years. And the only comment I would make is that wedo that based on models that have proved to be off track almost everyyear for the last 10 years. That suggests to me that we havesomething misspecified. Of course, some of us think we know what thatis. And I just think now is a time when we're going to have to bevery cautious about what we think we really can do to try to have animpact in a systematic way on real variables. I think we all agreethat we can have an impact on inflation; but it's not at all clear,based on the Fed's model--or any other model--that we have had torevise virtually every year because it went off track, [that we canhave an impact on real variables]. Our view is that the model hasgone off track because it's misspecified; and it's misspecified insuch a way that it does not make it a reliable tool to use to do thesekinds of exercises. I think we play a very dangerous game if we thinkwe can say with very much precision that we're going to have an impacton these real variables by cutting taxes $30 billion or $50 billion orwhatever it is when the best guess at the moment, as far as I cantell, is that all it will do is have an impact on inflation and havepractically no impact on unemployment or real GNP or any of theseother things that we really would like to get a handle on", "MR. WILLES. It's not a question of variance. It's the factthat the parameters are unstable and will respond, in our view ofcourse, to expectations. Therefore, by failing to factor expectationsin, we've completely misspecified the shape of the economy. Ten yearsago that would have sounded like an absolutely absurd assumption. Ithink now the evidence is rather considerably on that side. I justwant to point out one thing. I think people as they've heard me talkabout it have said: Well, he was a monetarist and this is just onemode of monetarism. The theories that we're talking about wereprimarily developed by Keynesians. In fact, the people around ourplace who have done the most work on it originally came to us to workon optimal control theory and used a model like the Fed model todevelop optimal control techniques. So, it's not as if it's just themonetarists who think they've found a new tool to play with", " I thinkit's a very serious challenge to the bases we've been looking for interms of making the kinds of decisions--MR. SCHULTZ. But don't you think, even though one could viewthis as very imprecise in terms of the numbers we come out with, thatwe can predict the direction. Isn't that really the more crucialquestion", "MR. PARTEE. Then you are saying that we can't affectaggregate activity through government policies", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In turning to this matter, let me justmention a couple of things. As Mr. Roos said yesterday, given the new-61-1/8-9/80technique we are using and all the complications of an annual and ashort-term horizon, the Bluebook was put together admirably in myview. It does take a quarter's time horizon for this particulardecision. That's arbitrary, and we debated as to what the right timeperspective was. If anybody has any comment on that, they could offerit", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In Steve's comments he raised the questionrepeatedly about whether the Committee, in effect, has any preferenceas to how interest rates evolve during this period. You can havedifferent points of view on that: That you don't care or that it's avery important question. I would think comments on that point arerelevant, if you think they're relevant. The only other point--I putthese points down here earlier--is that I think the most certain thingabout the economic forecast is that during this particular 3-monthperiod we are very likely to have a higher consumer price index, forall that means in terms of expectations and problems of various sorts.So with that, we'll proceed. Mr. Roos", "MR. AXILROD. The staff believes, I think--and I can't talkfor everyone--that decisionmaking in the economy is affected by thelevel of interest rates and credit availability. On the other hand,the staff believes, or at least I do, that it's difficult for theCommittee to make a priori decisions about the proper level ofinterest rates. That's why a money supply target is important becausethen those decisions come out of the market to a great extent.However, because we believe that decisionmaking by businessmen takesinto account credit costs and availability, it seems important to tryto suggest what the pattern of interest rates might be in the courseof the year, and that's what I was trying to say. If the Committeeadopted a pattern of money growth in the course of the year because itwas chasing a long-run target and got way ahead of it early in theyear and then wanted to catch up for credibility reasons late in theyear, that might imply a very high interest rate. You may not wantthat, so you may want to give up on your long-run target, which couldbe one credibility problem. If we have very high interest rates, Ibelieve it would have effects on economic activity in 1981. If weentered the year with 15 percent, I think economic activity in 1981would be slower than we've been projecting. I've asked Mr. Kichlinefor verification of that", "MR. COLDWELL. Well, Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that thedirection we're working on here is to lower the [growth in the]monetary aggregates. I would accept alternative C, for which you havegrowth of 4 percent. I'd be willing to accept a range around that,although I'm not sure how this is all working out with single pointsversus ranges in the short run. But I'd be perfectly willing toaccept, say, 3-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent or something like that. Mypresent predilection would be to accept a lower level in the firsthalf and see what the second half brings. Because my primaryobjective is to try to get some impact on the price level, I'm notsure that I totally agree--in fact, I'm fairly sure I don't agree--with what the staff is saying, which is that we can't have some impacton prices here. I doubt very much if this long-range low growthsaucer forecast is really a reasonable one over a long period of time;things will change. A recession is likely in the next year; it'stiming is uncertain. And I'm reasonably sure that something will comeup and destroy that lovely little package over the next 8 quarters.The complex of political as well as economic and foreign factors issuch that I would opt for a lower level in the range, particularlysince we got something in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent area in the fourthquarter, as I recall, Steve, rather than the 4-1/2 percent we were[expecting]", "MR. PARTEE. We would specify it in current terms. I likethe 5 percent of alternative B, partly because that would give us4-1/2 percent for the quarter which, if we get it, will be on themoderate side from the standpoint of the ranges that we choose for theyear. I would be willing to tolerate a little shortfall from that 5percent, say, to 4 percent. But if it comes in significantly weakerthan that, I think we would want to be supplying the reserves and wewould want to be seeing interest rates move. There is something towhat Larry says, although he perhaps overstated it a little, that wehave to be prepared to see interest rates move in response to a need.I would like to see us take the alternative A specifications of 7-1/2and 8 percent for M2 and M3 rather than those in alternative B. Wedon't really know what success that new [floating rate] certificate isgoing to have. It's being advertised very strongly by the thriftinstitutions and I wouldn't want to see us tighten up because ithappened that the thrift institutions had a good inflow from thepromotion of the 2-1/2 year certificate. [On the funds rate,] I thinkwe're a long way from either 11-1/2 or 15-1/2 percent and I don't seehow we could get to 11-1/2 percent without taking action on thediscount rate. So I would leave that range right where it is at11-1/2 to 15-1/2 percent", "MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, I continue to be concerned aboutthe expectations and realities of our price level and about thepossibility of the influence we can have on our exchange ratefrailties at the moment. I'd be very anxious to reaffirm our posture,a posture that would indicate a continuing steady move to a generalreduction of the growth rate [of money]. I recognize that this mightvery well contribute to interest rate changes, but [with] some moreflexibility. But in the real world we simply have to be a littleattentive to the level of [unintelligible]. I think we cannot movequite that abruptly. All of that leads me to feel that I'd be rathercomfortable with the numbers associated with alternative C", "MR. KICHLINE. Yes. The staff forecast is based upon themoney path of alternative 1 on page 15 in the Bluebook, which is 6percent for the year. It's slower in the first half--I think it'saround 5-1/2 percent and then 6-1/2 percent in the second half--butthe short-run path consistent with that is alternative B", "MS. TEETERS. I'm not sure I got a [complete] answer. Myinclination is that if we cut [money growth] below the 6 percentthat's in the forecast for the year, we'll have a more severerecession on our hands as we keep the interest rates up. I have a-69-1/8-9/80great deal of sympathy with Dave Eastburn's point of view that weshould stick to a number and let the interest rates fluctuate. WhereI come out is that I'd like to see a 5-1/2 percent growth rate for theyear as a whole and I'd set a target of approximately 5 percent forthe quarter to give us a little range to meet the needs at the end ofthe year. I don't think, frankly, that we can undertake a policy for3 years of consistently reducing the rate of growth of money supply.I just don't think that's in the cards for us in terms of what's goingto happen in the economy. We've brought the rate of growth downconsistently now for 3 years, but there's a certain minimum to whichwe can get and I don't think it's 3 or 4 percent. We are going to getourselves into a position of setting a target which is so much too lowthat it's either going to have severe impacts on the real growth ofthe economy or we're not going to meet our targets. Realistically,we're going to [have to] come down to a plateau for growth of themoney supply and try to hold it there rather than reduce it apercentage point year after year; and a rate of growth in the moneysupply of about 5-1/2 percent strikes me as about where that minimumis, given the other things that are going on in the economy. So, Ican buy alternative B for the quarter, but I do have a higher targetfor the year as a whole", " I would just say that on Bob Mayo's point, it's notclear to me that a bad decision is better than no decision at all; Ithink we ought to publish all the numbers and let people help us findout--MR. MAYO. I'm not arguing against that, but I think weshould indicate a dominant preference", "-71-1/8-9/80CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You hope to produce a more saucer-shapedthan V-shaped one [and would] increase the money supply more rapidlyin the first part of the year and less rapidly in the second part", "MR. RICE. Mr", "MR. RICE. The consumer price index, yes. I think this is agood quarter to try to keep the rate of growth in money at the low endof the 1980 range. That would give us leeway to allow it to expand ata faster rate later on in the year if that appears desirable, and Ithink it will appear desirable. So for this quarter I would favoralternative C; I would be comfortable with a 4 percent rate of growthfor the next 3 months. Also, I think this is not the time to accept asharp reduction in interest rates, and alternative C will assure thatinterest rates will not fall significantly. So my preference at thistime would be for alternative C", "MR. ROOS. I would like to be listed under the alternative Bteam.

PARTEE. One cosmetic thing. Would it be better to say\"about\" 4 to 5 instead of \"between\" 4 and 5. It sounds very specific,as if we expect it to come between the numbers.

I'm not quite sure that's right, Henry.We are getting into this darn lagged reserve accounting again. But inthe immediate future, which is going to be relevant for judging this,we will know what the level of reserves is. We are just judging thenonborrowed reserve path, saying we are putting the nonborrowedreserve path at $1 billion below what we know reserves will be nextweek. That's for the first week anyway. Now, it depends--and this isthe uncertainty--but that would be tighter than last week in terms ofborrowing when we had the market quite tight with a lower level ofborrowing. We just don't know the significance to attach to that.You might be right, but it's not in accordance with the most recentexperience", "MR. WALLICH. Not the very recent experience", " I think we could eliminate that from our agenda withoutany loss, and probably some gain, before--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you are going to have an argument, Isuspect, with Governor Coldwell. Let me repeat. I think what we aredoing is that we are aiming at a total reserve path and it's 4-1/2percent [Ml growth] under this version. The instrument that we affectis nonborrowed reserves. What we don't quite know how to do is [howto determine] what level of borrowed reserves is consistent with thetotal reserves path that is really the objective. That's engineeringin Mr. Roos' terms, I guess. But I'm telling you what I propose forthat element of engineering", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. From my standpoint, I suppose I'd beperfectly happy with what you suggested, Frank--just leaving it to theengineers, as Larry said--but I'm not sure the Committee as a whole iswilling to leave it entirely to the engineers", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The staff presumably would only reach thatjudgment in the light of their own assessment as to whether it'sconsistent with the total reserve path. They have that constraint.And if they keep being off the total reserve path, presumably we willget a new staff or something because they are making the wrongjudgments. But that is an inevitable matter of judgment inherent inthe discount window that somebody has to make. It's a question ofprocedure as to how much the Committee wants to get into thatjudgment. I tend to agree with you, Frank, that the answer is \"nottoo much", "MR. EASTBURN. I don't want to prolong this either, but Ihave some confusion on a related point and that is the role of thediscount rate. I had been under the impression that the philosophy[at the Board] was that, given lagged reserve accounting, thedifferential between market and discount rates was not an effectivefactor in encouraging or reducing borrowing. However, in the Bluebookthere is a comment in paragraph 18 on page 17 about what will happenif the discount rate isn't changed under certain circumstances and theinfluence of that on borrowing. Has there been further thought [atthe Board] about that", "MR. BLACK. That's implicitly assuming no change in excessreserves, Mr. Chairman. I don't think that's right", "MR. WILLES. Well, I don't want to prolong the discussion,but it makes me very nervous that we would take what in effect is adeterministic, very short-run model and decide the time path forchanges in the discount rate, then market rates. I think that's avery questionable thing to do", " Well, we don't have to wait--MR. COLDWELL. Do you want comments on this compromise orwhat are you going to do. Mr. Chairman, I'd rather have [a range]centered on 4 percent than the 4-1/2 percent you've chosen. The[risks] of 5 percent are too high to me. I think we ought to beaiming for something less than that in this coming quarter to makesure we do not overstimulate at this particular moment, and I'd muchrather we have a 4 percent rate. The range could be 3-1/2 to 4-1/2percent if we want a center point; or for a single point 4 percentwould be my strong preference. With the $1 billion in borrowing Ihave no problem", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I am on the opposite side. Somebody needsto speak. It looks as if the chances are that we will have somethinglike 5 percent [Ml] growth. I don't think we ought to be deliberatelyfollowing a mechanism that pushes rates up in this quarter, which is-82-1/8-9/80probably a declining quarter in the economy. I'm prepared to have 4to 5 percent to accommodate other members, but I certainly wouldn'twant to center [the range] on 4 percent, which I think does bias it infavor of a rise in interest rates", "MR. ALTMANN. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It raises a bit of a question in my mindon whether it is worthwhile polling the Committee on what theireconomic outlook is. We went through that exercise once or twice withMr. Miller. Do people want to be polled on what their economic lookis. Is it a useful exercise"], "1980FOMC19800205meeting.txt": ["MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, lagged reserve accounting, as thePresidents and Board Members know, has been a subject of considerablecontention in the System since it was adopted in 1968", "MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes, I'd like to add a word or two. I feelmuch less convinced than Mr. Axilrod that there would be significantbenefits from a switch to contemporaneous accounting. I can see thetheoretical case that he makes. I'd be among those who feel that inthe longer run even that theoretical case makes very little, if any,difference. I can see some impediments to the Desk's operations undera contemporaneous system in that we don't know required reserves inthe week we're operating in. Perhaps more significant than that, whensome deviation in required reserves stems from a factor other than thebehavior of the monetary aggregates--for example, a bulge in interbankdeposits or something of that nature that essentially we would want toaccommodate rather than resist as part of our reserve targeting--Ithink contemporaneous accounting could send us off in a perversedirection. So, I came out feeling that there is not all that muchadvantage to it. And having the minus on the membership side--I don'tknow how strongly to evaluate it, but I am told that it still doeshave some significance--just made me pretty dubious about thedesirability of a change", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, in deciding whether lagged reservesare good or bad for policy, I think we have to decide whether thelikely errors in hitting the money supply stem from a lack ofresponsiveness to changes in the volume of reserves or whether theystem from unexpected changes in the appetite of the market for moneyof the type that Frank Morris assumed. If it's the first, then onecan make a case that we get a little quicker response under laggedreserve requirements than under the other in the sense that if weinject a given volume of reserves, required reserves don't riseimmediately, so the banks feel a little easier and they kick this offa little faster. In the case of unexpected deviations stemming from ashift in the demand for money, then we do have an automatic brakingthat comes about under contemporaneous reserve requirements that tendsto stop this unexpected change in the demand for money. I think it'sthis latter type that's really the most troublesome for us under ourpresent mode of operation. So that does give a slight edge tocontemporaneous accounting under the present procedures. But I don'tthink we ought to overemphasize that. I come out very close to whereAlan Holmes and Peter Sternlight did. At most, I would think thedelay would be two weeks. And if you accept any of the points that2/4-5/80Irving Auerbach was raising in his debate with Bill Poole in theAmerican Banker, then you may conclude that it may take longer thanmost people assume for these multiple contractions or expansions inbank credit to take place. In the kind of environment in which we aretrying to bring about a steady rate of expansion in money, and givenall these other slippages in the monetary multiplier, it's hard for meto see that it makes a great deal of difference under presentprocedures. But I do think that it is good for us, if we can, toquiet this criticism that has been stemming from the monetarists. Ihave two reasons: (1) It would divert their efforts toward trying tohelp us achieve a monetary target and they would stop assuming thatit's as easy to hit as most of them have assumed; and (2) it wouldremove any excuse that we have for not hitting the targets. And bothof those [results] would be rather salutary, I think.As far as the other side of the coin is concerned, bankrelations, a lot of the academic commentators assume that it's easierfor a bank to adjust under contemporaneous reserve requirementsbecause it does not involve as large a change in excess reserves. Butthey are not talking to the bankers I've talked to. I think most ofthe Reserve Banks now provide each of their banks with a dailystatement on reserves, which shows their required reserves asdetermined from deposits two weeks earlier. They subtract from thatany vault cash they held two weeks earlier, either add to that orsubtract from it the amount of carryover from the previous week, andthen show how much the banks must hold in their reserve balances forthe remainder of the reserve period. In fact, we even show that on adaily average basis. So far as the small banker is concerned, all hehas to worry about is looking at that statement that comes every day,early in the day--it never misses its schedule except when the carrierdoesn't run, which is very seldom--and he knows exactly the reserveshe has to hold on a daily average basis for the balance of thatreserve period. And if he misses it a little, he has the 2 percentcarryover. Most of them, if they watch it very closely, can getpretty darn close to zero excess reserves. But I wouldn't favor theadoption of alternative one--moving to a one-week lag--which I thinkis the best of those Steve outlined, for the reason that John Ballesand Frank Morris and many of the rest of you have stated. It would bea major problem [of implementation]. But as we move ahead, we mightthink about how we could go to contemporaneous reserve accounting andyet solve this bank relations problem. The problem doesn't stementirely from not having all the banks as members. I don't think we'dwant to burden the banks unduly even if they were all [members].So, what appeals to me most would be a month-long period ofcontemporaneous reserve accounting. I think that would havepractically all of the advantages of the [weekly contemporaneousaccounting period]. It would involve less rate volatility becausebanks would have more opportunity to engage in interest arbitragewithin the reserve period. It would also give more time for thisadjustment to the changes in the demand for money--that multiplecontraction or expansion that some of the commentators seem to thinkoccurs almost instantaneously. It would reduce the work of theFederal Reserve and the work of the commercial banks a great deal ifwe didn't have to put this out on a weekly basis. It would reduce theemphasis on the weekly figures that now cause us so much problems.And if we eliminated the carryover in the process--and I think we2/4-5/80probably could get away with eliminating that if we went to a month-long period--it would eliminate a form of slippage. But there aresome disadvantages to a month-long period without the carryover interms of unexpected reserve movements toward the end of the period.And this would not be simply the last day in the case of many banksthat don't know their required reserves until five or six days later.But if we did have an unexpected movement toward the end of theperiod, it would have an effect on only 1/28th to 1/31st of the wholeperiod because of the month-long period as compared with an effect of1/7th as we now have with a seven-day period. We also could notprovide as much help to the banks through giving them statements oftheir required reserves, and that removes one of the inducements forthem to report more promptly to us. Certainly that is important tous. Finally, with a long period of time, in a sense one could arguethat the banks wouldn't have to come to grips with a change in reserveavailability quite as promptly, and we might have some slippage there.But on balance, if we combined these two, that might conceivably bethe best of the two worlds. But I would urge that we not move to thatat this time for reasons others have already stressed", "MR. WALLICH. Well, those were very thoughtful observationsby Bob Black. I just would like to make two points on those before Ibriefly say what I meant to. I am not sure that we'll satisfy themonetarists by this change. I think their reasoning is that they wantto minimize Desk operations. They believe that with contemporaneousaccounting all the adjustment can take place through a change indeposits and none of the reserve needs have to be met by Deskoperations. You pointed out that these adjustments of levels ofdeposits don't take place instantaneously. We need a very largechange for each dollar of reserves, something like a $10 change indemand deposits and a $20 change in time deposits. These changes arereally so large that they can't take place quickly; any reservedeficiency or surplus must still be met very predominantly from Deskoperations. My other reaction is that the one-month procedure soundslike an ingenious possibility and well worth studying, but one can seethe danger of slippage if we expanded this [time period]. Suppose wemade it not one month but one year. One can see that that wouldn't beworkable. So somewhere between a day and a year there is an optimumin terms of less disturbance but also less loss of effectiveness.As far as moving to a contemporaneous basis right away isconcerned, I think the gain we have in terms of the monetarists'analysis wouldn't be very great. The staff memorandum convinces methat the gain in terms of speed might be very considerable. Theeffects of any reserve shortage begin two weeks earlier unless we wantto assume that somehow a reserve shortage or surplus casts its shadowahead and the banks move into very short-term assets as soon as theysee their deposits moving in one direction or another. But that isn'tvery likely because all they see is their own deposits moving; theydon't see the aggregate moving necessarily. So, there does seem to bea significant advantage in terms of speed of adjustment and I thinkthat is important because even though we say that it really doesn'tmatter over a quarter or so whether we deviate from our target, it isalways very hard to get back on track. It doesn't matter if wedeviate if we indeed get back on track. Nothing happens to the real-10-2/4-5/80sector. But getting back on track may be very painful because theforces that pushed us off may still be operative.I have one question on something that I'd like to understandbetter. I have the impression that under the present procedure, thefunds rate still serves as a guide to reserve needs. Peter seemed tosay that if we move to contemporaneous, we would lose that. Atpresent, a movement in the funds rate is an unambiguous indicationthat reserves are either too large or too small and it is clear thatthe Desk must take action unless it wants to have the reserveimbalance met by borrowing or repayment. If we have contemporaneous,then a move in the funds rate may mean indeed that market factors haveproduced a deficiency or excess of reserves. But it also may meanthat the aggregates are moving in a particular direction, creating areserve surplus or deficiency. If the latter is the case, we may notwant to counteract that; we may want to let the change in the fundsrate do its job. Say a decline in deposits leads to a decline in thefunds rate. We would want the decline in the funds rate to help pushdeposits back up. So there seems to be a possibility of using thefunds rate as a guide to operations under lagged [accounting] and lessof a possibility to do that under contemporaneous. Since I amtroubled, frankly, by the use of the funds rate as a guide tooperations because it exposes us to the appearance of still being on afunds rate target, I wonder whether this wouldn't protect us againstthat suspicion that we're trying to control the funds rate rather thannonborrowed reserves and the aggregates. And I wonder whether theDesk wouldn't be able to judge what it needs to do--determine the needto add reserves or the absence of a need--without this indicationcoming from the funds rate", "MR. WINN. Paul, I hear more doubts being raised in moreareas than I ever thought possible. Their suspicion is that we are[not] on a money target [unintelligible] very much a funds target", " Steve tells me we were the only people--MR. PARTEE. I would say you were always in favor ofcontemporaneous accounting and I would say that Bob Black has alwaysbeen against it because he saw the public relations cost or the bankrelations cost. The latter was a major factor involved, I thought, inthe Board's accepting the lagged way in the first place. I amimpressed by Henry's argument. I do think the speed of adjustment issomething that is going to plague us because I personally believe thatsooner or later, but perhaps not right now, Willis, we're either goingto get a big surge or we're going to get a big collapse in theaggregates and then we are not going to be able to do anything about-12-2/4-5/80it because of the lags with which the demand schedule can be affected.And two weeks is a meaningful amount of time in shortening thatprocess, if indeed it does shorten the process. I don't know that itnecessarily would because, after all, the Desk knows that the moneysupply has surged or has fallen out of bed before the reserves have tobe put up to support the higher amount or the lower amount; andpresumably if they don't follow a strictly mechanical formula, theycan begin to make adjustments for it early on in their strategy. Soeven that can be overcome.My biggest problem is that I would lean towardcontemporaneous accounting except that I think the structure is muchtoo complicated to use it. Reported deposits are extremelycomplicated; there is quite a variety of deposits with different kindsof reserves against them. And it seems to me all of that is much moredifficult [to manage] on a contemporaneous basis; it would not be adisadvantage otherwise if we had a very simple structure. Now, italso happens that the membership bills all propose a very much simplerstructure of reserves than we now have. And it seems to me that if[the structure were simpler], that would also tend in some sense, Bob,to do away with the bank relations problem because it is no longer anoptional matter as to whether to follow the specified procedures. Itseems to me that a very much simpler structure and the change in thewhole reserve apparatus that would be associated with a new bill,which probably wouldn't take effect for six months or something likethat, might be a time for introducing a change. But I would tie it tothose kinds of developments; I wouldn't do it now.By the way, I do believe the point made by Frank and othershas some value: With our current way of processing the daily reportof deposits and the programming that exists we probably don't have thecapacity to make the change without risking a collapse of thestructure. That has begun to bother me. So, I wouldn't do anythingnow; but the introduction of a new simplified system on differentterms and conditions might be an occasion for going to it", "MR. TIMLEN. Mr. Chairman, I have heard at least sixeconomists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York opine on the matterof reverting to contemporaneous reserves. Not one of them thinksthere is any major advantage in such a change, so I will be disposedto follow that professional judgment in my Bank. I must say that JohnBalles has given most of my points in terms of the bank relations[effects of] such a change and I would like to stress the importanceof that. It is lead time, not only at the Reserve Banks but at thecommercial banks as well. I would say, too, that I don't think thatFirst VPs are in a position to start changing their priorities in thecomputer support area. We have a number of very key projects goingforward in that area to bring up our new FRCS 80 communicationsnetwork. We are entering the area of resource sharing. And to changeour priorities to accommodate something that is not held out as havinga major advantage is to me very poor planning. I would also say thatwe have had so many changes in the area of reserves--and those changesinvolve a cost to our member banks--that this would just add to thedifficulties of shaping things in an orderly way", "MR. COLDWELL. I have only two comments, Mr. Chairman.First, I would agree with the Account Manager that this is likely to-14-2/4-5/80have [only] minor advantages. But secondly, I would caution theCommittee that this is another interruption in the overall picture of[the policy] the Committee is trying to follow. If we add that on topof our redefined aggregates as well as possible daylight overdraftsand additions from the membership bill, we're likely to complicate thefigures [further] and they are going to be difficult for people tofollow, even our very good staff", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I guess everybody has talked who wants totalk. Is there anybody else who urgently wants to talk. Mr. Kimbrel.When I put the adverb in front of it, you're in trouble", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, those cautions seem to be ratherunanimously felt. I must say the other side of it is--I don't knowhow important it is substantively--that when we work with a two-weeklag in the context of what we're trying to do now, one has a greatsense of artificiality. We are working to affect a reserve figurethat we always know we cannot affect because it always depends uponsomething that happened two weeks earlier. It leaves me at least witha very uncomfortable feeling over a period of time. But I think ithas been useful to get all these considerations on the table. I don'tknow whether we have to look carefully at the reverse lag situationand so forth or not", "MR. BAUGHMAN. Are you telling us that the procedure has apossibility of lightening our mark debt", "MR. BAUGHMAN. Are you projecting a reduction in our markdebt", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have a press conference scheduled forThursday, I think, to attempt to explain these new figures, and thatquestion is sure to arise. I don't look forward with a great sense ofanticipation to trying to explain either the substantial actualcomplications or the fact that the numbers look higher", "MR. COLDWELL. Isn't that what you're asking", "MR. KICHLINE. The consensus of price forecasts or what", "MR. WILLES. You're exactly right. It depends on the speedof the projector and the speed with which the wheel is moving. Now,let's suppose that decisions are made in continuous time and you takeeconometric snapshots on a monthly or quarterly basis. It could be amatter of pot luck that the speed of the decisionmaking framework andthe speed of the projector are the same. If they're not, you canactually take a picture that gives you just the opposite view ofwhat's going on. We happen to think that in many cases that's exactlywhat happens. We have all these nice pictures that are actuallygiving us pictures exactly the opposite, in terms of policyimplications, of what is going on in the \"real world\" and how it'sfunctioning. I simply say that to indicate that I think we need to beparticularly [cautious] at this time, given not only the uncertaintiesin the world but the uncertainties about the tools that we're workingwith, about what we think we can even say in terms of the time pathfor the economy over the next eight quarters", "MR. WILLES. I think a tax cut would be a disaster", "MR. COLDWELL. No, I am not going to chance that. I agreethat there's a high degree of uncertainty, but our track record andour past performance clearly indicate that we've underestimated therate of inflation and I expect we will continue to do so. I thinkthere's going to be a rapid defense build-up, but impacting largelyupon expectations in the first part of this year. If that is thecase, we may see a moderation from what the staff was [projecting] inthe rate of decline in the first half. I think fiscal policy is goingto be easier than portrayed by the Administration's budget. Fiscalpolicy is likely to be stimulative instead of restraining and Isuspect we will probably underestimate the aggregate data that we areusing. As for the data you've requested we comment on, Mr. Chairman,I would put real GNP in a zero to plus 1/2 percent mode, the CPI atthe end of the year in the neighborhood of 14 percent, and theunemployment rate at about 7 percent. And I have already indicatedthat I think fiscal policy is going to be easier", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So you're not in favor of a tax cut, Itake it", "MR. COLDWELL. I am certainly not in favor of a personalincome tax cut. I think there is a case to be made to improve therate of business capital stimulation in the area of improving jobexpectations, but I would question whether this is the right time todo that. There's a fundamental fact of high inflation, which we needto continue to keep our eye on; unless that is damped, thepossibilities of a rising rate of inflation are very good. I justdon't find myself in agreement with the idea of gradualism in economicpolicy. It's a lovely theory but a practical monstrosity. Creditavailability in the economy is high in my view right now. And withexpectations of high inflation, the interest rate restraint isminimal. Banker attitudes reflect no feeling of quantitativerestraint; to the contrary, they are seeing business as usual. Iadmit the majority of the bannking profession seems to say that theonly thing that would satisfy them would be a major depression. But Istill think we have not obtained control over this and I suspect thatthe recent trends in the international financial side are going to-30-2/4-5/80create some dollar problems for us for the coming year. As youstruggle through these, I wish you well", "-31-2/4-5/80MR. PARTEE. Well, I have been concerned about defensespending as a question mark in the outlook. I must say that the chartthe staff has provided us, showing an alternative with $10 billionmore defense spending this year and $20 billion more in 1981 and in1982 on top of the 6 percent real growth that's already in there fornonpersonnel costs, strikes me as a good liberal estimate of the extradefense spending that might occur or that is possible in the shortrun. And I would point out to you that it doesn't change the numbersall that much. I believe they did this with the model, so it includesorders effects and that kind of thing--that is, effects that occurbefore the actual defense spending. So, both that and the fact thatit seems to me to look a little less [tenuous] than it was a month agomake me feel that it isn't such a big possible plus in the economy inthe immediate future as it might have been. Also, the saving rate isjust very difficult [to forecast]. New York has a continuation of avery low saving rate throughout 1980 and one could argue that therehas been a permanent shift in the saving rate. I don't think so. Ithink it's going to come back up. I agree with the staff on that.There is no evidence of a permanent move from money to goods of thekind that would be indicated by that. So, I come down to anexpectation that real GNP will fall some this year, though probablyless than the staff has [in its forecast]--maybe 1 to 2 percent. Theemployment rate I am quite sure will rise significantly because I justdon't think it is possible that services and trade will continue toadd to the employment rolls without output, without a commensuratevalue added, much longer. So a 7-1/2 percent fourth-quarterunemployment rate is probably a reasonable forecast. I'd haveinflation a little higher than the staff has--at 9 to 10 percent, say,for the deflator and 10 to 12 percent for the CPI in the year ahead.As for fiscal policy, I think there will be a tax cut but probably notuntil next year. That's not as early as the alternative staffprojection has it, which is the middle of this year. It probably willoccur in early 1981, sometime in the spring, and it will improve 1981results a little from what the staff has projected. But I would pointout to you that I think an absolutely binding assumption on therecovery of the economy is the monetary assumption which, of course,we have the ability to control. Did I get everything on this [list]", "MR. BALLES. No, that's from fourth quarter-to-fourthquarter. Our figures show in the fourth quarter of this year a rateof 9.7 percent. That is our staff view; I am not that optimistic.That is where our two staffs differ: The Board's staff sees acontinued rise in the inflation rate through part of this year; ourstaff has a more optimistic assumption that we're at or near the peakright now", "MR. BALLES. Right, but I was thinking of their trend line onthe GNP deflator, which is going up for a while. Our unemploymentrate by the fourth quarter of this year is almost the same as theirs;ours is 7.6 and they're showing 7.7 percent. The difference in ourviews is that our staff is more optimistic with respect to a fairlystrong bounceback in calendar year 1981, which I hope is right, up togrowth of 4 percent plus, whereas the Board's staff is looking for1981 real growth of only 2.6 percent. I am giving the staff views ofour Bank. My own personal instincts are that we're probably going tohave more inflation and less decline in real output than the researchstaff at our Bank expects. That's based on pure hunch or instincts asto what is going on in the way of a semi-wartime economy here. And mypessimism on the inflation rate--my view being worse than either staffis forecasting--comes among other things from what has been going onin long-term bond markets in this past month, which I find extremelydiscouraging. People are putting their money where their mouth isreally in anticipation. To me that is a very dangerous signal of arejuvenation of inflationary expectations. And it is discouragingespecially in view of our demonstrated good track record since October6th in getting a genuine, observable, real deceleration in the moneysupply, which I had assumed would impact favorably on inflationexpectations and hence on long-term bond rates. Yet despite what wehave done, we have seen a move in the long-term bond yield, which Iview as a good index of inflation expectations, back up to a new high.So I'm very concerned that we adopt a posture that is a strong signalof continued deceleration of monetary growth because that is the onlytool we have to combat these recently renewed rising inflationexpectations", "MR. ROOS. I base my projections almost entirely on a rate ofbasic money growth, and the figures I will suggest are predicated on arate of growth of M-1A and M-1B of roughly 5 percent. If there is a 5percent basic money growth rate, I would see real GNP declining bymaybe 1 percentage point fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. I wouldsee the GNP deflator, which is what we look at really, at about a 10-37-2/4-5/80percent rate during the fourth quarter of next year, or maybe 9-1/2percent--obviously, these percentages can vary by 1/2 point--and Iwould see an unemployment rate of roughly 7 percent. However, I feelvery strongly that what we do will have a very direct bearing on theoutcome of these figures, and if we were to set growth ranges for M-1Aand M-1B at 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent and if growth came in at close to3-1/2 percent, that would have a significant weakening effect on thesethree figures that I suggested, as we see it. In other words, GNPwould be significantly lower and unemployment significantly higher.And if growth came in close to the top end of that band, at let's say6-1/2 percent, I think we'd see a much more serious acceleration inthe deflator, a significantly stronger GNP result, and a significantlylower unemployment rate. What I am driving at is that I think we havethe key to this in our hands and that all three of these factors willdepend on what we decide to do and how carefully and with whatdetermination we stick with whatever we decide to do. I wouldpersonally be very much opposed to a tax cut. I would perhaps be muchmore tolerant of a tax cut that was an across-the-board, consumer-directed tax cut if later in the year or next year the governmentdecided to give some tax relief directed to stimulating capitalformation. I think that might be desirable but I do not favor a taxcut, not that it makes much difference in that regard what I think.But in what we do, we can make a big difference on the money growth", "MR. WINN. It's probably down the road; I don't say it isimmediate. But, again, as one [looks at] various scenarios with somedifferent inputs, there are different results, obviously. Whilehousing is down, I too am amazed at the amount of money that is evenshowing up for housing at the moment. So, as I look at the level ofrates, I go back to looking at availability; and I get nervous as towhat [level of] interest rates it will take to have a damping effecton some of these [sectors].In my scenario, I come out with a dip in the first half ofthis year because I think it's already under way. But I can see somerevival in the second half, so that I get a 1 percent decline for theyear but it's quite a different shape. The price [situation] reallyscares me. Go back and look at 1973 and 1974; maybe we're going tomultiply that distortion created by prices. And if the worldsituation changes, some of the pressure for relief could come nextyear--I think it's already under way for this year--and carry throughfor a while. But we may be [unintelligible] upswing continuingthrough part of 1981 and then real price distortion problems hittingus by the end of the year. I see price problems in the 15 percent[CPI] rate; that is going to give rise to increased wage demands andre-opening of contracts and all kinds of pressures and we don't knowhow that is going to factor through to the balance of the year. Andthat's not in your scenarios, in terms of the wage assumptions thatyou put in. One gets different price results with some of thesedifferent assumptions. So I am even more concerned about inflationdevelopments and what they mean not only for 1980 but perhaps for 1981and thereafter. And that has implications for the international sideand a whole host of things, which change the [scenario]. I think thepressure for a tax cut is going to come both with the election problemand the first half year results. That will further complicate theproblem and I would be opposed to it. This would be in my scenario,Paul", "MR. WINN. I get an [average] unemployment rate from thefourth quarter to the fourth quarter of maybe 7 percent, but I thinkit will probably go higher before it comes down unless we get a draftand some other things that would change my numbers. I don't know whatis going to happen, but you get a different picture if you change yourassumptions", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, we ought to be recorded asgenerally supporting the Board staff's projection and its numbers.However, unlike most of the others, if the forecast is in error, Ithink it will be because the recession could be substantially moresevere than they are projecting. We had a miss in our forecast in thelast half of 1979 because consumer behavior was much stronger than wewere forecasting on the basis of income growth and so on. This hasled New York and Kansas City and perhaps some of the rest of you tolook upon a 3 percent saving rate as a norm for the future. I thinkit is also possible that when the unemployment rate starts rising theconsumer will turn defensive and we will see the saving rate risehigher than the Board staff has projected and a bigger recession willresult. Also, the housing sector could be weaker than the staff hasprojected. We don't really yet have a good fix on how the currenthousing rate structure is impacting demand. But the Board staff hasthe weakest quarter at 1.4 million starts. It seems to me that wecould see at least one quarter substantially below that. So, I thinkwe have a risk of a much sharper recession in 1980 than the Boardstaff is projecting. It's a risk, but I can't attach theprobabilities to it.As far as defense spending is concerned, we've talked to themajor defense contractors in the Boston area like Raytheon and others,and they say that for the kind of hardware the Defense Department istalking about most of the money will be going into long lead timeitems. And while we may get a big effect on expectations in 1980,they don't see a big effect on employment until 1981, even if theprogram were to get geared up fairly soon. So, it seems to me that wecould see a different pattern: a very sharp recession followed by atax cut, an increase in the defense budget, and a big jump in 1981.That's another hypothesis that hasn't been stated around this table", "MR. WALLICH. It seems to me that the odds have clearly movedin the direction of less recession and more inflation than they weresome time ago. I think the degree of uncertainty is very high becausethe saving rate is abnormal and, therefore, potentially unstable. Andif we move to higher rates of inflation, people could react veryunpredictably. But the thing that most impresses me about thebehavior of people is that in the last surge of inflation, in 1974,the saving rate went up--and it did so not only in this country butall over the world--while this time people have reacted differently.They pulled the saving rate down. That seems to be a message. Theyseem to be saying: \"We're no longer so scared of losing our job thatwe're stopping our spending. We're now out to beat the game.\" Andthat suggests to me that we may be in a new ball game unless the moveto higher inflation rates throws a new scare into people.Well, I had anticipated a somewhat more severe recession thanthe staff, but recent events have taken me off that. I could see asmall dip in 1980 of maybe 1 percent, but [my forecast has] a verywide variance. I see inflation now at very high rates, with thedeflator at 12 percent for the year, that is year-to-year. And theCPI could be close to 15 percent. These [increases mean that] real-40-2/4-5/80interest rates are no longer positive. I know that some of us don'tbelieve that real interest rates mean very much. But we're only 19people and there are 220 million out there who believe differently orat least act as if they believe differently. So I share what PhilColdwell said on that score. I don't see quantitative monetaryrestraint being in effect--that is, availability restraint. And Idon't think that these interest rates, particularly when one considersthem after taxes, really bite. So we have to consider now that we arein a group of high inflation countries with Italy and the UnitedKingdom. Then comes a tier of moderate inflation countries and thencome the low inflation countries. We've moved very far. That is whyI don't really expect a tax cut this year. I think these forces willgive people pause unless there is a significant deterioration in theclimate. Eventually, I think there will be a tax cut simply becausewe are getting more fiscal drag than we can accommodate over time. Icertainly would oppose a tax cut, and I would lean toward firmmonetary restraint. I don't know [how] one can have that confidencein the nominal aggregates that M-1A and M-1B convey. All we know isthat these [measures] are extremely uncertain. I don't think the newdefinitions capture all that's going on, especially in the Euromarket.We capture only a small part of that. So I believe money is reallyexpanding faster than we think, and I would want to take that intoaccount in thinking that we can have 15 percent inflation. Onunemployment, I have no difference with the staff; 7-1/2 percent bythe end of 1980 seems a possibility", "-41-2/4-5/80MR. MAYO. My other question on the charts relates to defensespending. Frank stole my headline on that by his mention of long leadtimes on defense contracts. I find the assumptions both in the budgetand in your table on real defense spending unreal. I don't think itis possible unless there is an awful lot of shelf items involved--morethan I can imagine--to add 6 percent to real defense spending in theremaining six months of the fiscal year. And that's all there is leftin this fiscal year. We have a history over the last 30 or 40 yearsof projecting increases in defense spending prematurely, and I thinkthis is happening again in the budget figures and in the staffforecast. Instead of being up 7 percent and up 8 percent or whateveris shown on this chart, I would say it's more likely to be up 2percent and up 12 percent. So, that would affect the attitude towardthese figures in 1980. On the other hand, I would support the totalthat you have in your staff forecast because I think it's more likelyto burst out on the nondefense side in light of other factors betweennow and the beginning of the new fiscal year. Now, that doesn't meanthere isn't an attitudinal and expectational response. But I think itstems mostly from the evaluation of the inflation and the real GNPoutlook a year ahead, rather than manifesting itself in defensespending in the fiscal year of 1980.Having said that, I won't repeat Mark's caveats, but in termsof point estimates I really don't have much quarrel with the staffforecast on real GNP. As for the probabilities, I would say theprobability is that there will be less growth--in other words a biggerdecline, net, than the [minus] two percent the staff has--maybe a[minus] 3 percent for the year. I am not quite as pessimistic asHenry, but I will take shelter under his umbrella on the price index.I don't think there is more than one chance in ten that we can getdown to 10 percent on either the CPI or the fixed weighted deflator bythe fourth quarter of this year. The chances are very good--I hate touse the word \"good\" that way--that it will still be above 10 percent.On unemployment, despite my question on the labor hoarding problem,the chances are unfortunately also very good that unemployment will beabove 8 percent because the inflation rate is so sticky and so builtinto consumer expectations that I think this is the way it's going tocrank out. No tax cut, please", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, as everybody around here is aware, I havehad a high degree of uncertainty about what was going to happen. Ihave a little less right now, so far as my feelings about the nearterm are concerned. I see three areas of weakness. First, I thinkthe economy is a little weaker than the numbers will show in Januarybecause the weather in January was so remarkably good all over, and Ithink that had a considerable effect. I am seeing some areas ofrestraint that are secondary kinds of reactions to the October 6th[action]. In the area of consumer credit, more and more banks arecutting back on the availability of consumer credit and are increasingthe price and other factors. We're also seeing that with [creditextended by] retail establishments; Sears and Penneys and others haverecently made those kinds of announcements. So, I think we are seeingsome restraint that hasn't been there before and the pressure isincreasing in that area. I do not think that we have seen the low inhousing. I agree with Frank Morris that it's going to go lower; itcould go considerably lower. We saw that chart on the commitmentrate, and my understanding is that the situation may be even worsethan that chart looks. And that's bound to begin to spill over intohousing durables pretty quickly. It hasn't done that much yet. Asfar as autos are concerned, I don't see anything that is going tobring them back very fast. Things may have to get worse in that area,partly as a result of the [tighter] consumer credit and partly becausegasoline prices are going to continue to go up. We see that there ismore conservation than we really thought. People are more concernedabout [gasoline prices], and I think it's going to have a big effecton their purchases of automobiles. So, I don't look for any strengththere in the near term.On the other hand, longer term I see some areas of strengththat may be stronger than the staff assumptions. I disagree with BobMayo on the defense side. The reason I do is that we're looking atall of the news reports that say this involves sophisticated weaponsand there's a very long lead time. We are not looking at theoperations and maintenance side. My understanding is--I have justseen some recent figures--that the Pentagon is estimating that forammunition alone they need more than $20 billion. Now, ammunition issomething that can be produced pretty quickly. So I think we may seesome faster impact on the defense side. The other area is the taxside. It is an election year. I do not favor a tax cut this year; Iwould, I think, next year. But we may get it this year. If you lookat the staff's chart \"fiscal alternative-tax cut\" and see what apolitician would see--that with a cut in payroll taxes he can have thebest of both worlds, better growth in GNP and lower inflation, whichis what that chart shows--that's very attractive to a politician. AndI just think that we may get enough weakness in this first half tomake a tax cut much more likely this summer. So, my figures are alittle stronger than the staff's: GNP down 1 to 2 percent;-43-2/4-5/80unemployment 7 to 7-1/2 percent; and the CPI in the fourth quarter alittle worse than the staff's, at 10 to 11 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I have missed one personal objectiveof speeding up the coffee hour appreciably. But since we're short of11 a.m., let me make a couple of observations. I do have the feelingin listening to some of the different economic forecasts and commentsthat our staff, which is sometimes accused of being Keynesian, feelsmore constrained by the money supply assumptions than more monetarist-oriented people. And that accounts for some of the differences inview. Assuming that we're all intelligent people around the table,[given the] differences in outlook that have been recited, I don't seehow anyone can come to any opinion other than that there is a greatdeal of uncertainty in this forecasting business.In terms of what we have accomplished or have notaccomplished in monetary policy in recent months, particularly asreflected in expectations as best one can judge them, we have toconclude that we've been [set] back very substantially and havesuffered a grievous blow from everything that has been going oninternationally--whether you're talking about oil prices, or Iran, orAfghanistan and concern about defense spending. There's nothing muchwe can do about that, but I think in some sense we're back to squareone or worse in terms of the public's concern about inflation. So Itend to agree with those who see a risk of an inflationary breakout,in modified terms, on the up side as a real danger. I also agree withEmmett Rice and a couple of others who said that we could get a longerreaction in the economy on the down side if that happened. I don'tknow what we can do about that. We can't deal with both situations atthe same time. In fact, I don't think we can deal with the risk of adownturn and ignore the inflationary side, because they're part of thesame parcel in some sense.I feel rather strongly that it would be a great mistake toput much money on any particular forecast at this point. I come backto what Mark Willes said at the beginning, and I think the saving ratequestion is a perfect illustration. I can hear persuasive argumentsaround this table as to why it is going to go up and I can hearpersuasive arguments as to why it is going to stay down; and I don'tknow of any criteria by which I can choose between those two choicesat the moment. In a direct statistical sense that will be the mostimportant influence on the economic outlook in the near term. Thereare a couple of other things that might be mentioned that haven't beentouched upon. We have some uncertainty about tax refunds in the nearterm, with some expectation that they may be very high relative topast experience--I am talking about [the time period] between now andApril or beyond--and what that will do to the near-term timing ofconsumer spending. What it will do to the near-term timing of thekind of forecast the staff has I think is an unknown. If one assumessome lag in defense spending but also assumes that the option of highdefense spending is going to come along [later], we could get apattern of big refunds for a while, in a sense artificially holdingthings up, followed by a defense impetus coming late in the year andtaking over after the refunds subside. It only adds to my feeling ofcaution about any forecast.So far as the bond market and the banking system and theavailability of credit are concerned, I'd just make two observations.-44-2/4-5/80I think the bond market people, who from the way they are behavingapparently are quite discouraged about the inflationary outlook, haveconcluded that money is freely available. I see one side of it. Butalso, in talking to some bankers, I think there is something to whatFred Schultz just said about a cumulative impact of restriction.That's beginning to be felt by some bankers, who have talked to me,anyway, not only in consumer lending but in mortgage lending and insmall business lending and other types of lending. I think it is truethat the last ones to feel that are probably the big companies thathave access to the bond market and to the banks, too. I don't thinkthe picture is all one way. There has been great confusion about--Iguess it was John Balles who said it--whether the money supply isgenuinely [or only] statistically under control. I think it isstatistically under control. I am not sure the market thinks it isgenuinely under control. And it comes down in part to some confusionover our own operations. I meant to mention earlier--and I don't knowwhether the presidents have seen it--that we put out an elaboratetechnical explanation of what we're doing, which Mr. Axilrod authored.It has gotten no attention in the press thus far, but it was anattempt in considerable part to meet the questions that have beenarising about why reserves are going up 10 percent or 12 percent or 8percent, depending upon which number you're looking at, while themoney supply is going up 3 or 4 percent. I don't know whether we willconvince anybody as that seeps into consciousness. But there has beengreat confusion engendered by the differences in growth rates amongall these measures, including right now the various reserve measuresgoing off in widely different directions. I will leave you with that.Let's have the coffee break and when we return get back onthese long-term and short-term targets", "MR. PARTEE. Well, Mr. Chairman, last time I indicated somepreliminary specifications that would have been consistent withalternative II. I want to argue this morning for alternative I.That's a difficult thing to do and I have always found myselfunsuccessful in such arguments in the past. But let me try it oncemore. The staff projection for nominal GNP, fourth quarter-to-fourthquarter, is for a 7 percent increase. The direction of thinking as wewent around the table was to convert that to a somewhat higher nominalGNP increase because almost everyone thought inflation would be a bithigher than the staff has projected, and quite a few people thoughtthat the decline might be a bit shallower than the staff hasprojected. So I would say that the Committee view, as opposed to thestaff view, is that nominal GNP will increase at least 8 percent. AndI believe the Administration, Jim, has a 9 percent increase in nominalGNP fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. In drawing these long-termranges, the relationship between money growth and the nominal GNP isof central importance because it really indicates the amount oftension there's likely to be in markets as the year goes on. And even7 percent [for nominal GNP growth] with a 5 percent midpoint on M-1Aand 5-1/2 percent on M-1B, which is alternative II, does imply anincrease in velocity of a couple of points. If, in fact, we thinknominal GNP [growth] is going to be a little higher than that--let'ssay 8 percent instead of 7 percent--it seems to me that as a matter of-47-2/4-5/80practicality and credibility in achieving the targets we set, we oughtto recognize that a bit in the specifications we pick. Going fromalternative II, which had been my former choice, to alternative I adds1/2 point to the midpoint. It makes the midpoint for M-1A 5-1/2percent and that for M-1B 6 percent, compared with, say, an 8 percentnominal GNP, and I think it does suggest a very considerable tensionon markets throughout the year. And it's [a target] that we might beable to achieve.I would point out one more thing: Every private forecastthat I have looked at, and I just reviewed them yesterday, suggests afederal funds rate at the end of this year of 10 percent or below.The only exception might be Salomon Brothers, but they don't specifythe funds rate in their projection. We are suggesting somethingaround 13 percent. The difference, I think, is in the impliedincrease in money in the private projections, which is stronger thanwe have. Now, if we go through a recession and hold the interest rateup throughout the recession--hold it pretty close to where it is now--start a recovery, say, a year hence or thereabouts with a rising trendof rates and high unemployment, we will have done really quite a lotto restrain the economy [through] monetary policy compared with anypast cycle that I can recall. And I think that also argues for beingjust a bit more liberal so that we'll have something we can achieve.I understand fully what Bob says about narrowing the ranges, and I doagree that there is quite a difference between, say, 4 percent and 7percent in M-1A, [which are the limits] in alternative I. But in theinterest of again being able to achieve growth this year within theranges we specify, which we managed to do for the first time in ourhistory in 1979, I think we need to hold the width of 3 points that wehave had but try to [achieve] the midpoint of the range. So, I wouldcome out with alternative I for the reasons that I have explained, andI would stay with the 3-point range", " Wouldn't M-1B--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They both will. The problem is that if weget the law change, M-1B will rise both because it's taking [funds]out of M-1A and out of M2", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, it will only rise because it's takingfunds out of M2. M-1A will go down. [M-1B] will rise because it'staking out of M2; and M-1A will decline because [funds will be taken]out of that aggregate", "MR. BALLES. Well, in short, I would like to make a pitch fortargeting M-1B and M2 as opposed to targeting M-1A and M-1B, [assuggested] in the draft directive language. Our own experience in thepast has led us to place somewhat more confidence, in terms of the olddefinitions, in M2 as a predictor of inflation and real GNP. Ofcourse, it remains to be seen whether that is going to hold for thenew M2. But based on some of the statistical tests that we've done,M-1A is certainly the least reliable predictor of real GNP of the fouraggregates mentioned. The differences are quite significant, andthat's why I am somewhat disillusioned about M-1A. We've tested itretrospectively and view it as a considerably poor forecaster offuture real GNP. That is the main reason I would like to drop it.Those are my recommendations, Mr. Chairman", "MR. WILLES. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just couldn'tdisagree more with some of the comments I have heard and I agreeentirely with some others. Chuck and I have this running discussionabout how we finance nominal GNP. He has his view. My view is that-50-2/4-5/80if you try to do [it his way], you just chase your tail. If in factthere is a relationship between money and inflation, by persistentlytrying to finance nominal GNP we end up generating more inflation--even at an accelerating rate--which therefore we have to finance andso on. So I would hope we would not take that [route]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There's a [trickiness] of these figures.I think it's fair to say that M-1A was artificially high last yearbecause we did get some transition [flows] into NOW and ATS accounts,part of which came out of M2. Mr. Kimbrell", "MR. KIMBREL. Mr. Chairman, one specific thing I would liketo see is that the 1980 targets be related to the 1979 targets and notthe 1979 results. We are all [talking about] the uncertainties. Ofcourse, there does not seem to be much uncertainty about [the risks ofa] recession and all of us are accepting that there are going to beinflationary tendencies and expectations. And I feel that our actionsshould attempt not to provide any unnecessary opportunities for strongmoney growth. I would hope that we indeed will begin to lower thesemonetary goals gradually. For that reason I also accept the thesis of-51-2/4-5/80narrower ranges, not more than 2 percentage points, and frankly with astrong determination to achieve them and control [money growth]. So Iwould [narrow] the alternative III ranges and I end up with 3-1/2 to5-1/2 percent on M-1A, 4 to 6 percent on M-1B, and 6 to 8 percent forM2", "MR. MAYO. Mr. Chairman, unlike the humility of Mr. Schultzand Mr. Willes about being somewhat simple-minded, I must be humble insaying that my mind finds things very complicated. I have tried hardto move toward being simple-minded on some of these things. We havedifferent approaches to some of these problems. However, I find thatthe factors are so complicated and have such a margin of error that Imust stick to the 3-point range. Some people might accuse the Fed ofbeing a bit cowardly because the range is so wide. But the factorsthat we are dealing with are indeed so complicated that we must allowourselves this flexibility. I feel, if anything, even more stronglythan John Balles put it that we are [making this] unduly complicated.Again, I am striving toward being a little simpler. We are making ithard, and even harder for you, Mr. Chairman, when you try to explainto your audience on Thursday why we have decided to use both M-1A andM-1B when both of them will need adjustment when we get NOW accounts.And I agree we will get them nationwide. I think we'd look a lot moresensible to forget M-1A--as I said last time and I'll say it againthis time--and call it Ml, show some change, and not give theimpression by stressing M-1A that the lion has labored and hasproduced a mouse. There's too little change from the old M1 in whatwe are proposing, and I would rather see us stick with M-1B and givethe explanation of the adjustment in NOW accounts in a simple-mindedfashion rather than try to adjust both M-1A and M-1B to NOW accountswhen they come. This is the way in which my attempt to be simple-minded would direct us. I'd prefer alternative II with the 3-pointrange. I'd obviously prefer to concentrate just on M-1B and call itM1, [with a range of] 4 to 7 percent", "MR. COLDWELL. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that we have beentalking here about a series of figures which, quite frankly, I don'tcompletely understand and in which I have a great lack of confidence.-53-2/4-5/80The redefinitions seem to have added about 2 percentage points tothese past figures. We are questioning the function; we arequestioning the seasonals. I think the expectations have shifted onus. And if we are talking about supporting nominal GNP growth, Iwould observe that we had a 6.8 percent growth in M-1A last year and,if I read the correct line on this table, it supported an 11.3 percentincrease in nominal GNP", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we'd have to make an estimate, andthe estimate that is likely to be most different is for M-1B", "MR. WALLICH. I mean the range has to be seen relative to therate of inflation. At 10 percent inflation, 3 percent [growth inmoney] isn't much. At 2 percent [inflation] it would be a great deal", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One could argue about that, I suppose", "MR. SCHULTZ. I would like to have somebody explain theBalles approach to me. I find Steve's comments important here. Whyshouldn't it be alternative III on M-1A and M-1B and alternative II onM2 and M3. That would seem to me more consistent with what actuallyhappens in the economy. Am I looking at it the wrong way", "MR. COLDWELL. You got 3-1/2 votes", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I got more than he did.SPEAKER(.). No, you didn't", "MR. BLACK. It's [as if we] perceive more [differences] thanthere really are", "MR. COLDWELL. We can't possibly get close", "MR. SCHULTZ. Are we not likely, though, to end up with asituation in which we're going to miss on both sides with the Ballesapproach. M2 and M3 may be strong and M-1A and M-1B could be prettyweak", "MR. WILLES. But the problem, Mr. Chairman, is not thequarter point difference on the midpoint. Where people separate is onwhere they think the bottom ought to be or where the top ought to be.And that's why Steve's proposal, I think, will get most of the votes.It's not the quarter point difference; it's where one is willing tolet it go on one side or the other", "MR. PARTEE. We have a tremendous amount riding on ourability to be within these ranges--SEVERAL. Yes", "MR. PARTEE. What I foresee is the possibility of misses ifthe relationships aren't right here. We may be within on M1 and outon M2 and M3", "MS. TEETERS. I have noticed that people worry less when wego under than when we go over", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.SPEAKER(.). You would vote for it", "MS. TEETERS. You realize we're already in trouble in termsof being in conformity with the Administration's forecast. At leastyou have to do the testifying on Humphrey-Hawkins. We're alreadyinconsistent; this is making it worse", "MR. SCHULTZ. I am really much more concerned about M2 and M3than I am M-1A or M-1B because at these interest rates and theseinflation rates I am very unsure of the connection between the two.And I think there is going to be a demand shift this year", " The staffindicates that they can see no indication yet, but--MR. PARTEE. [It can] hardly be bigger than it was last year.We already had a great big demand shift in the recorded figures forlast year. For M-1B, which I think a lot of people would support asthe better redefined money, our midpoint will be 3 points below whatwe realized last year. Three points", "MR. BALLES. What's the purpose of having the range", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [For M-1A] 3-1/2 to 6 percent--acompromise between alternatives II and III on both the Mls", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We lose that visual effect, but it'sgetting argued that the economics are a little against us in terms ofthe uncertainty and it gives wider ranges. I think there's a certainsense in doing that", "MR.

There's a question of procedure we have todecide upon, which is whether to reiterate or change the targets thatwe had for the first quarter. [We can comment on] any tentativefeeling that we have about the second quarter but we don't have to putthe second quarter into the directive, and I think it's probablyinappropriate to put the second quarter in the directive at thispoint. So, if people agree with this, the only thing we have to havein the directive is a number for the first quarter", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is the central tendency, obviously.Last time we worded it 4 to 5 percent on Ml. We could raise thequestion again of whether we want to continue with that wording. Wesaid 4 to 5 percent on M1 and about 7 percent on M2. I suppose whatwe'd be saying here is that the Committee reiterated--if you want to-75-2/4-5/80word it that way--the 4 to 5 percent range on Ml. And on the new M2basis, we'd shave the target a half point", "MR. MAYO. There could be some argument, Paul, that we'refarther along in the quarter and should narrow that range", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Particularly if we keep that same wording,we'd be a little hard pressed to [rationalize] changing it by aquarter percentage point, which one could argue we might want to do onthe basis of the long-term range, all else being equal.

Well, if I could, I'd just raise one more point.In asking my own staff to review what went on during that Februaryperiod, it seemed pretty clear to us that the staff here and in NewYork had done a fine job of guessing what the multiplier was going tobe, what the total reserves should be, and what the nonborrowed pathshould be. There was very fine work on that. Yet the net outcome wasthat total reserves got out of hand on the up side for a while. WhatI am trying to get to the bottom of, with the benefit of hindsight, ishow you and Peter now think that could be headed off in the future", "MR. MORRIS. May I ask Steve a question. The advocates ofcontemporaneous reserve accounting argue that there would be lessvolatility in the funds rate than under lagged accounting. Do yousubscribe to that", "MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix", " Dave, New York's [estimate] is about twice what the--MR. EASTBURN. Yes, there's a very big difference", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we are in general agreement withwhat the staff has [projected]. If we were to shade it a little, we'dshade it along the lines that Frank Morris described because of theunrest we see in financial markets, along with weaker housing and alsoprobably weakness in investment, all of which we think may be morethan the staff is estimating. I would add one other caveat and thatis the feeling on our part that the international situation may beweaker than is generally being assumed. So we would shade theforecast toward a little deeper decline than the staff has indicated.By the same token, we would expect perhaps a more rapid recovery. The-24-3/18/80staff is actually showing no growth in real GNP between the fourthquarter of '80 and the fourth quarter of '81, and we think [GNPgrowth] will probably be positive.On the policy side, it seems to me that the best thing wecould do is to continue the policy we've been following. I think yousaid it all, and very well, yesterday before those bankers when youstressed that the backbone of our policy still remains our efforts tocontrol the aggregates. Not everyone heard you yesterday; there maybe some general doubt that we'll do that and some expectation thatwe'll back away. So, one could make a case for going with alternativeC. But it seems to me that alternative B is strong enough tounderscore our determination. The rates of growth in the aggregatesfor the last part of that six-month period are substantially belowwhat we actually had in the first three months, or think we had in thefirst three months. They are below our targets, so \"B\" seems to us tobe the best of the alternatives.So far as the federal funds range is concerned, I wouldprefer to drop the top and also the bottom of that range. I think weare now to the point where we can do that. I would not want to raisethe lower end, a possible alternative suggested in the Bluebook, sinceI would like us to be in a position to let rates come down prettyfast, if they do tend to do that in the face of a controlled set ofgrowth rates in the aggregates. I am sure that the Committee is notgoing to agree to abandoning that range; against that background,11-1/2 to 18 percent looks about right to us", "[Coffee break]MR. EASTBURN. I have to address myself to conditions beforelast Friday. At that time businessmen in our area were generallyfeeling pretty good about current business, but I suspect that'schanging. My own guess is that we are going to have a recession of atleast the magnitude of the Greenbook projections and perhaps deeper.-27-3/18/80In view of that, my inclination was to go with alternative B. Buthaving listened to Steve about the April bulge, I do have a concernabout that, which tilts me toward \"C.\" Perhaps there is some way ofgoing with \"B\" and watching closely to see what happens and movinglater on in the period or of striking a halfway point between \"B\" and\"C.\" That's about where I would come out at the present time", "MR. PARTEE. If you look at page 7 [of the Bluebook], Dave,which shows the monthly profile: In alternative B, for example, Aprilhas a growth rate of 8.6 percent for M-1A and May has two dashes,which I assume means 0, and June has 2.8 percent growth. Somethingcould be taken out of April and put it into May as far as the path isconcerned", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, generally I go along with thestaff forecast. It seems to me that the new anti-inflationary programwill have the effect of making the coming recession deeper than itmight have been and might even bring it on sooner. If I have anyskepticism at all [about the Greenbook forecast], it's in the area ofthe timing of the recession. The economy appears to be continuingstrong, or relatively so. If I read the Redbook correctly, most ofthe businessmen around the country report remarkable equanimity in theface of the economic situation; they just don't seem to be excessivelyconcerned about--or, in any case, feel confident that they can dealwith--whatever is down the road. It's pretty difficult to findevidence of weakness in the economy aside from housing and autos; onehas to look pretty hard. One has to look behind the industrialproduction figures to see that there would have been a decline inindustrial production had production of autos and parts not risen.Also one has to note that capacity utilization in the primaryprocessing industries and materials-producing industries has declined.And, of course, the average workweek has declined somewhat. These areabout the only signs I see of any emerging weakness.So, I feel that our posture at the present time is aboutright, with the appropriate tautness in financial markets. I don'tthink alternatives B and C leave us much to choose between. Actually,[for M1] the difference between them amounts to about $900 million atthe end of June, and that doesn't strike me as being very much moneyout of the total money supply. So, it doesn't really matter too much-30-3/18/80to me whether we choose alternative B or C. If we choose alternativeB, it appears that we will have a slightly larger volume of moneystarting in April and a less substantial rate of increase in the thirdand fourth quarters. On the other hand, if we choose alternative C,we will have a lower rate of increase in the second quarter and ahigher rate of increase in the third and fourth quarters. Given thecurrent situation, it would seem to me better on balance to leanharder in the second quarter and increase the restraint then; thatwill [show through] in the third quarter and allow for a slightlyhigher rate of increase in those quarters when we expect the recessionto hit. Alternative C would probably be more consistent with thatscenario than alternative B, but I have to repeat that really itdoesn't make a great deal of difference. On the funds rate, for now Iwould favor a ceiling of about 18 percent, but I am prepared to raisethe ceiling if market conditions [warrant]", "MR. WALLICH. It's very difficult to tell what effects ourpolicies are having. These high interest rates may hit some borrowersvery hard but they don't seem to hit others at all, and the net effectone can't predict. I see that Charlie Schultz, after the President'sprogram was announced, predicted a 2-1/2 percent rise in GNP for 1981,so he doesn't seem to think that this has a very powerful impact. Iam particularly concerned about the inflation forecast. I view theforecasts of both our staff and the Administration as wildlyoptimistic. The very slight recession that we are anticipating isvery unlikely to make that kind of dent in the inflation rate. Ofcourse, we have a history of always underestimating the rate ofinflation.I am aware of the repercussions of a firm policy at savingsbanks, small commercial banks, and elsewhere. As these [problems]come toward us, we have to be prepared to meet them, and I think weshould meet them in a liberal way--stretch our powers as far as theycan reasonably be stretched. But we should not be obsessed by theconcern that the recession may last a little longer or even be alittle deeper. As I look back over our record, I am impressed that wenever stopped fighting recession. We moved imperceptibly fromfighting the last recession and its consequences into worrying aboutthe next recession. And that recession concern essentially hasdominated our thinking and has brought us now to 15 percent inflation.It's a situation with very poor options, but I lean toward the firmerones. That is, I lean toward \"C.\" The market has not been impressedby our policy package except abroad. The bond market hasn't respondedvery much. Short-term rates are actually down. I think there is areal danger that if we now give the impression that we are about torelax our general credit restraint behind a shield of selective creditcontrols, we will get the worst of both worlds. We'll get theselective controls not working--I have not been very enthusiasticabout them anyway--but we should do what we can not to disavow themcompletely. That is best done by not throwing any burden on them andby holding to a firm general control. I think it's important at thistime not to convey the impression that the regular discount rate,which wasn't changed, is the discount rate and that essentially wehave taken evasive action in trying to avoid raising the discountrate. We should so operate on nonborrowed reserves that there is a-31-3/18/80good amount of borrowing at the surcharge so that the rate acquiressome credibility.Finally, I share the concern about the April bulge. If wehave taken 15 percent out through the seasonal adjustment, there mustbe a lot of money out there--in reality, people don't draw checks onseasonally adjusted checking accounts--and that may have its effect.So in addition to \"C\" generally, I would like to see a funds range of14 to 20 percent. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "MR. SCHULTZ. I doubt that we can get out of this situationwithout a recession, and I think the unkindest thing we can do is todrag this on. It seems to me that the greatest pain can come if welet it go on and on and our financial institutions really do begin togo under. Small businesses and others can stand a lot of pain forshort periods of time but if this keeps dragging on, they will be indeep trouble. I would worry very much about a big bulge in April. Iam not strongly influenced by alternative B or C; somewhere in thatarea would suit me fine. I would like to see the upper end of thefederal funds range raised to 20 percent. My feeling is that we oughtto be very resistant to a big bulge in April", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't feel terribly strongly aboutthat because we obviously have a very flexible technique for changingthat range if the occasion arises. But in the spirit of what I amsaying, if the Committee wanted to raise it--particularly the upperend--such a decision would reflect the attitude I am talking about. Idon't know whether we'd have to use [the full range] or not, andthere's no implication that we'd go out and use it because it's there.I don't have any particular expectations that the rate would have to[reach that upper limit] or that [raising the limit] carries anyconnotation at all that we will aim at it. I do think that we shouldresolve the doubts on the borrowing number by putting it a littlehigher rather than a little lower. And in that connection, I am notquite sure where we are specifically. I have lost track of thisrecently", " We're having a hardtime interpreting whether demand or technical problems--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the market is confused at themoment, understandably, about what all these recent actions mean. Oneinterpretation is that we would deliberately try to ease pressures onthe money market. [Market participants] are looking for thesubstitute in this voluntary program. There's another interpretationthat says that's not true. The former interpretation would not behelpful at this particular point in time, although in a general sensewhat we're aiming at is partly to avoid the extremes, perhaps, of afurther jack up [in interest rates]. That's a little different fromsaying we're aiming to ease from where we are or [unintelligible] ofeasing from where we are. But I have a concern that if things wentthe wrong way and if people were not over this psychological humpabout inflation--which I don't think they are, although we may bebeginning to shake people a little--and they relapsed and thought we-38-3/18/80were easing, that would involve the greatest chance that we'd get acontinued big loan demand, which would drive up the prime rate andgive us higher rates. I think we're in a perverse situation here. Ifthose commitments are ever drawn upon, the banks are going to bepanicky and they're going to be putting their rates way up to protectthemselves.So you can have something concrete to shoot at--and let mejust say again that the least of my concerns is precisely whether it's\"B\" or \"C\" over a full four-month period--and to capture slightly theflavor of what I am saying, let me suggest the following: For M-1A,use 2-3/4 percent for the February-to-June number; put the funds rangeat 14 to 20 percent, say, which again is no goal to shoot at obviouslyin either direction, but I'm trying to pick up the flavor of what hasbeen said around the table; and aim at $2.7 or $2-3/4 billion orsomething like that in borrowings in the very short run. And for thisimmediate period, and I am talking about a few weeks here, let'sreconcile doubts in the path-building--which are plenty, given theperformance of borrowings recently--on the side of being happier aboutan undershoot of the present projections for March and April than anovershoot", "MR. STERNLIGHT. It's worth keeping in mind that one reasonborrowing has been high was the anticipation of something happening inthe discount rate. Something did happen and there's a much greateruncertainty factor than usual, given the whole surcharge situationnow. I think there is more need for flexibility in whateverunderstanding the Committee reaches on that borrowing level", "MR. AXILROD. I was assuming, Mr. Chairman, that one of theimplications was that the Committee didn't want to be as accommodativein April as we had in [the Bluebook] and that for whatever path theCommittee decides we might lower both March and April and shift alittle of that into May and June", "MS. TEETERS. Mr. Chairman, I object strongly to raising thefloor on the funds range. I have a feeling that when we hit therecession we're going to hit it very suddenly and that we may verywell get into a credit crunch. It seems to me that it would be wiseto keep the wide band and as [much] flexibility as possible. It alsogoes with my long-range feeling that we do want to have a very widerange on the federal funds rate and let the market determine the ratesover time. We have broadened the federal funds range, and I thinkthat was a move in the right direction. I don't mind going to [aceiling of] 20 percent, but I don't particularly want to raise thefloor", "\"-43-3/18/80CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

[The range shown in the directive]would be 11-1/2 to 20 percent, if that's what you mean", "MR. AXILROD. It's about 4-1/2 percent--between \"B\" and \"C\"--for March-April. Now, we only know 5 days in March for sure, so Marchin some sense is an unknown. What I think is consistent with theCommittee's discussion--I want to be sure of this--is that rather thanthe 4-1/2 percent for March-April and about 1 percent for May-June[implied in the Bluebook], I should shift some of that growth intoMay-June. So you would be resisting at a lower rate of growth inMarch-April", "MR. ALTMANN. Five", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

These all strike me as rather unorthodox waysof coping with our problems: Depreciate the dollar, bring downinterest rates, and fight inflation. Now, I don't think you reallymeant this seriously, but it sounded a little ominous because thereare people who do believe that", "MR. AXILROD. Well, the growth rate [of Ml] in April of 1976was 6.6 percent; in 1977, 9.2 percent; in 1978, 12.6 percent; and in1979, 14.7 percent. My memory is that there is genuine weakness inthe unadjusted deposits. If one compared year over year and appliedthe seasonal factor of 1976--that is abstracting from all theadjustments we've made--the increase would be something like the 6.6percent recorded in 1976. I assume there is some possibility thatwe've over-adjusted because in the process there is a certain amountof coincidence of random factors. It's a conflict of terms, butsomething like that may have happened. And we may see [some rebound]in May and June. I'll have some comments on that in my own briefing.But other than that, we have no special explanation; there are nospecial factors that we could think of, unless income really is beingdestroyed at a very rapid rate here. But we don't have anysubstantial evidence of that yet", "MR. AXILROD. The delay does have an effect. Our estimate isslightly higher than yours through the week of the 16th. We have someslightly counterbalancing upward effect in the week of the 23rd; weassume it will be washed out by the 30th and probably have a trivialeffect on the month on average. But we are assuming that M1 for theweek of the 23rd, the week we're in, rises by something like $3-1/2billion from the week of the 16th, in part because of this delay. Ofcourse, if that doesn't develop, the negative for April will be muchbigger", "MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix", "MR. WINN. I had a question I wanted to raise, which may bemore on the technical side than the general side, Paul. Do you wantto hold that", "MR. AXILROD. That's right. There is pressure; they're notgenerating internal funds to any substantial degree. It's true thatwe have them running down their liquid assets. There is some built-inpressure generated against expanding their spending to a great degree.We don't have a vast expansion in spending; and to the degree thatpressure is on them, it might constrain their spending actually atcurrent rates", "4/22/80CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The only answer I could give you is thatwe would get a mixed reaction. Some people will believe it. Peopleof monetarist persuasion will believe it more than others. Somepeople don't believe the underlying theory, so they have no reason tobelieve it. And there will be people in between. But I don't knowwhether there will be more or less [confusion]. There was certainly alot of confusion in late November, December, and early January for avariety of reasons. People saw the reserve figures going up, whichwas one confusing aspect. The money supply figures weren't going up,particularly, but the reserve figures were; and interest rates weregoing down. We get all different constellations of events. But Ithink you are misled if you think that pure persuasion is going toconvince people. It may have an impact, but we are going to get mixedreactions", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the staff's furtherdownward revisions in the projections for the forthcoming period. Andif I had to guess, I would say that they still haven't got them quitelow enough, because I just don't see any area in the economy thatseems to have significant strength. Housing is headed much lower, I4/22/80think. The consumer is grossly overextended. We are getting grassroots reports of growing personal and business bankruptcies. TheRedbook, and particularly the addendum that the New York Bank sent in,suggests that inventories are not as closely in alignment with needsas we had thought earlier, and that was the main thing we werecounting on to keep this recession relatively moderate. And I wouldguess that there is probably going to be greater-than-expectedweakness abroad, so that this recession might well take on more of aninternational cast than I think most people are assuming at thismoment. If I am right on this, then prices will probably come downsomewhat more rapidly than the staff and most other people areassuming. I have a lot of sympathy for what Henry was saying,primarily because I think we have made errors in the past. By thesame token, when it comes to policy, I think we would be well advisedto stick to the targets that we adopted last time, which inclines metoward \"B.\" The only thing that causes me problems is this estimateof a sharp decline in the aggregates in April. If that [occurs], inorder to stay on this targeted path we have to have growth in May andJune in the principal aggregates of over 9 percent, and I think thatwould scare the devil out of the market and lead people to concludethat we had abandoned our October 6th policy. So, if April does comein that weak, then I would want to hit the midpoints of the rangessometime later--maybe in September or somewhere down the line ratherthan try to get [growth] back to the midpoints by June. What I'mreally saying, I guess, is that we ought to stick to the reservetarget. And I would like to see rates come down, if that's thenatural fallout of this. That should help prevent April from being solow and would permit us, hopefully, to hit the midpoints by June", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think we have the firstbig test of our new operating procedure ahead of us. It may be moresevere than the staff has projected because we feel the second quarteris likely to be weaker than the staff forecast. If at this juncturewe begin to revise our money growth targets, then in effect we areback to managing interest rates again. If we abandon, for allpractical purposes, our money growth targets at the first occasion wefind interest rates that are uncomfortable, then how is the marketgoing to have any confidence that when we require uncomfortableinterest rates on the up side we will not then also abandon our moneygrowth targets. We would be right back to where we have been. Now,to stay on the course, particularly if the economy is weaker than thestaff projects, is going to be uncomfortable. I think we're going tohave to live through a period of weakness in the dollar because of thevery short time horizon of the foreign exchange trigger. And we willget talk--no matter how persuasive our Chairman is--about the FederalReserve letting loose too soon. But we've simply got to ride itthrough. Rather than viewing lower rates as stimulative, as Henrydoes, I would view them as a force for mitigating the severity of therecession, because there is no question that we are in for a verysharp decline. The issue is: Do we want a monetary policy that isgoing to make the recession, if anything, sharper, steeper and longerthan the staff has forecast. So, it seems to me, it is fish or cut4/22/80bait on our new operating procedure in the second quarter--whether itis at this meeting or some other meeting", "MR. PARTEE. I agree that there's a sizable decline inactivity now in process. It was inevitable, I think. But it'sprobably worse because of the policies we've followed over the lastsix months in defense of a principle. The principle was that in theabsence of knowledge about how interest rates should move--because wehave so little knowledge of the rate that people are willing to paybased on expected rates of return and on inflation--we would provideaggregate growth that we thought appropriate to a moderation of theinflationary course. When we get into a decline, it has always seemedto me extremely difficult to forecast how far it might go becausethere are dynamics involved. There have been shocks: Chrysler, amajor bank that has been referred to, silver, and the possible failureof a brokerage firm. There are shocks of that kind that can affectattitudes and deepen, more than anyone anticipated, the reduction inspending that people are willing to undertake. And what we have arethe automatic stabilizers to guard against this becoming cumulativeand self-reinforcing in its downward movement. Now, the automaticstabilizer in the case of fiscal policy, of course, is the fact thatwe get budget swings. And the automatic stabilizer we've introducedin monetary policy is the fact that we'll get interest rate swings aswe hold to particular ranges of growth that we're willing to see inthe monetary aggregates. Not to let that automatic stabilizer workwould risk a self-reinforcing cumulative decline in activity becausewe don't know what is happening, as we didn't on the up side, topeople's willingness to pay rates of interest for the use of money. Ithink, Henry, that one ought to distinguish between the automaticstabilizer principle and the setting that we put it on, which is thelonger-run presumption. We have a setting for M1 growth; I won't sayM-1A or M-1B because I want to say it's approximately 5 percent. Now,if the underlying rate of inflation is 10 percent, which I think itis, or if it's 15 percent, which you think it is, that's a very, verytight setting on monetary growth because it means there isn't much ofanything left for real growth. In fact, it would suggest that unlessthe inflation rate comes down significantly, there won't be any realgrowth in the economy. And that is very much analogous to a settingin the budgetary posture of, say, a full employment budget of $100billion. It's quite similar. It seems to me that we deliberatelychose a tight setting and we ought to stay with a tight setting; butit also seems to that me we ought to let the automatic stabilizer workbecause not to do so would be very much like the actions of this groupin the period from 1929 to 1933. We could get a reinforcing declinein activity that is propelled by monetary contraction. And we can'tstand that kind of risk for our economy or for the world", "MR. WILLES. To some extent, profits have gone down. Alsothey have found reductions in energy utilization being forced by thepolicy and so on. There has also been a cut in real incomes becausewages have not adjusted. They haven't allowed wages to [rise withinflation]", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I certainly would agree that it isimportant that we continue with a course that strengthens ourcredibility. I believe we have made the right moves in going to adifferent kind of procedure. I think it's important that we hold tothat 3-1/2 to 6 percent [Ml] figure for the year. But while I wantinterest rates to go down--I think it's important that they go down--Ireally am concerned about the speed with which they go down. We haveto keep in mind that this is where the action is right now. Thecountry is looking to the Federal Reserve. Like it or not, we are inthe eye of the storm. And people look at interest rates. We've donea lot of things. If there's anything to be said for the whole creditcontrol program--and in my view there's damn little--it's the shockeffect. And it has had a shock effect. It was important. [Changing]inflationary expectations was crucial. Why did the actions we took onOctober 6th not work better. Because people thought [our actions]were just going to be overridden by other things that were happening.So we see interest rates at these awful levels. But people arelooking at those interest rates; and if they see them come down toorapidly, they're going to say the Fed has given up [on inflation].And we're all they have to look to at this point in time. Let's notpanic and do something that will tend to negate the strides we'vemade. We're getting there and we're getting the job done. A fedfunds rate of 15 to 16 percent wouldn't bother me much, but I must saythat if it starts getting down around 13 percent or below, under thesecircumstances, I would get really nervous.As you know, we haven't been that good with our forecasts orprojections. It does look as if this economy is weakening veryrapidly and going off a cliff. But I would remind you that it lookedpretty weak in October. It looked as if we had done the job then.Now, [the evidence] is stronger this time, and I feel pretty wellconvinced; but I don't see the necessity for letting interest ratesjust absolutely also fall off the cliff. I think the implications ofthat are very important. We can do something here which says we willstay within the target ranges, but let's not panic on these interestrates. I'd let them come down slowly. I hope we can hold these fedfunds rates; I think they're important. I like our new operatingprocedure but interest rates, whether we like it or not, are aperception that other people have. And I hope we don't get in toomuch of a hurry and blow this", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, that's the privilege of a newboy. I want to second very strongly what Fred Schultz said. I thinkwe ought to stick with the \"B\" targets and accept the March-to-Junetargets that fall out. I'm perfectly willing to see a decline ininterest rates, but I really would urge you not to permit tooprecipitous a decline. I would like to suggest, in view of the factthat the staff is projecting a 16 to 17 percent funds rate ascompatible with the alternative B targets, that we ought to have a4/22/80phone consultation if it looks as if the funds rate is moving downvery precipitously and significantly penetrating the 16 percent range.The reason I say that is because, like Fred, I feel that people judgeour credibility--at least all the people I speak with in New York--notsimply by a mechanistic adherence to the aggregates. They also judgeour resolve and our credibility, particularly given the fact that theyhave had considerable skepticism about it in the past, by interestrate movements as well. And I believe in your October 6th statement,Paul, you did say that this was not a mechanistic formula and thatjudgment would be used. Interest rates should go down. They will godown. It's not going to do any damage to the economy if the declineis somewhat more gradual. So, I would hope that we would have a phoneconsultation if it looks as if they're going to go significantly belowthe 16 percent level that the staff is presently projecting asconsistent with those \"B\" targets", " Yes, that included [an allowance of] about $500million, when we were [calculating] that--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Actually it included about $500 million of[borrowing by] First Pennsylvania, so one might say the equivalent isa little higher than that to allow for the fact that they areborrowing $600 million at this point. But that's fine-tuning. It's-23-4/22/80not all that far from where we are. There has been a lot of talkabout interest rates. I suppose what people mean when they sayinterest rates is the federal funds rate. We've had quite a declinein market rates, particularly in the long-term rates relative to thenormal fluctuation in long-term rates. They've gone back three-fourths or more of the [amount] they went up in January and February.Some long-term rates may be very close to where they were in January;the CD rates seem to have moved down faster than the federal fundsrate. The Treasury bill rate is down to 12 percent, plus or minus,depending upon which [maturity] you look at. As Peter said earlier,that's down 3 percentage points or more from the peaks. So in termsof the interest rates people are looking at in the market, there'sprobably room here for a decline in the federal funds rate thatwouldn't even be reflected much in these market rates because it hasalready been anticipated in some sense. I don't know whether that'sfair or not. We just don't know how it will hit the marketspsychologically because people may then anticipate the next move inthe federal funds rate.But I do recognize in making the judgment about where we setthe borrowing level, consistent with our techniques and amid all theuncertainties, that there are some implications for interest rates.There is a little danger, particularly in the short run, because wedon't know what all these recent money supply figures mean. Among theunfortunate things that could happen--and there are quite a few ofthem--if we propelled the funds rate to the extreme low end [of the\"B\" range], it could get low enough so that it affects the wholestring of market rates. If we began getting in May and June increases[in the money supply] of 9, 10, 11 percent or generally in the higharea, which is what the econometric relationships would say, in amonth or two months from now we're going to be saying that we have topull back in the other direction. And presumably at that point therecession would have moved somewhat further and I suspect we'd be inan extremely awkward position at that time of not being very eager to[tighten]. Perhaps I've leaned too far toward the risks, whether inthe exchange market or more importantly--and I don't think they'reunrelated--of in some sense having given up and [seeing] inflationaryexpectations rise again, having been [unintelligible] to a degree.And then, as I say, if the aggregates were really running high in arelatively short time period, having been through a rather futileexperience in this difficult business, we will be sitting here facingexactly the opposite dilemma we are in today of saying to ourselves:How much do we really want to tighten--tighten in the sense ofinterest rates or borrowing--at this point.What I am suggesting is that I'm not sure we have to make achange in the basic aggregates decision we made last time. Monetarygrowth is running short of that at the moment, which definitelyimplies some relaxation of money market pressures and the borrowinglevel. We've already gone some distance in that direction; we'd gosomewhat more. We would expect to see the federal funds rate declinefrom its present level. I don't know what that means for marketrates. I'd suspect, if anything, not much change to some furtherdecline. If Steve is right, that means 16 percent plus or minus onthe federal funds rate in the short run. I don't think we can be sureof that, but let's say he's right; I don't know what range to putaround it. But with a 4 percentage point range we can feel our wayahead on that perspective. We meet again in four weeks according to-24-4/22/80our present schedule; that's an unusually short period of time. Bythat time we will know whether we're getting some reaction or whetherthe straightforward projections of the money supply are being borneout. I do not mean that we would not in the normal course of eventsmake some further judgment on the reserve path and the borrowing pathif the money supply continued to be weak in the next four weeks. Theoption is clearly open--I don't know whether I want to pin it downprecisely but we can do so if you want--to consult, if in my judgmentthe degree of decline in the federal funds rate seems to betroublesome in terms of interpretations of our policy, whether thoseinterpretations were manifested domestically or internationally. Wecan always have a consultation, and I certainly would be prepared todo that. But I think we ought to recognize that the probability isthat there will be some decline in the federal funds rate. Again, Idon't know what that means for other interest rates, but the short-term outlook would definitely be for a decline in the federal fundsrate as we see it today. Now, if we suddenly get a burst in the moneysupply figures, maybe that won't amount to much [of a decline]; but ifwe had a great drag in the money supply figures, we would [expect]some decline fairly immediately", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --with the high level of borrowingsearlier this week and some softness in the money market today andpresumably even more tomorrow, it will already have pointed in thatdirection because the level of borrowings currently is too high. It'svery simple in a technical sense, I suppose, [for the funds rate] topersist at a lower level next week. That's what one would expect themarket to do under these conditions. I think that's a fairly clearoutlook for the very immediate future. It probably will be in the 16to 17 percent area by the end of next week anyway, maybe throughoutthe week, just on this kind of decision which is basically analternative B decision. I think that's where I would leave it.One could argue either side of this. You could say that youdon't quite believe Mr. Sternlight--and I would agree that there's alot of uncertainty--and that the business scene is so uncertain youwould push for more money [growth] and take a much lower federal fundsrate in the process. I suggested why I think that may be imprudent inthe very short run. You can take the opposite view and say it's toomuch risk, so let's not have the federal funds rate decline at all. Ithink that would probably be a mistake in this period, too. I'd playit in between, which happens to come out [to alternative B]", "MR. PARTEE. I see. I don't think there's any problem ifSteve is right and we get around 7 percent money growth in May andJune. But what if we got zero money growth in May and June", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Wouldn't it be a little better to seta borrowing level of about $1-1/2 billion plus emergency lending andany special contingencies since, as I understand it, included in that$1-3/4 billion is that uncertain situation and we don't know what elsemay arise", "MR. PARTEE. We're also below [path] on total reserves,aren't we, Steve. That would be another reason for adjusting theborrowing down", " That's the only rule that Ihave and--MR. BALLES. Unfortunately, it hasn't worked that way overextended periods in the past, for example in the summer of 1979 and agood part of '76 and '77. We have a long history of sustainedovershoots and undershoots, and that's what I think we have to guardagainst now", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I feel some discomfortin what I'm about to say in the sense that it may be taken that Idon't have great faith in our new procedures. But maybe it's becauseof uncertainty. I'd feel somewhat more comfortable if we were to movetoward \"C,\" [which has 4 percent growth for M-1A]. [Our directive]now has 4-1/2 percent or somewhat less. I'd also point out that the\"C\" [growth rates] are well within the ranges that we set for the yearas a whole, the 3-1/2 to 6 percent for M-1A, for example. So itwouldn't do great violence but would recognize that we have gotten abit less [money growth thus far] in the first half of the year. Andas a result, I'd feel more comfortable with it. I take some comfortalso from your statement that if the funds rate gets to the 16 percentlevel, whether we adopt \"B\" or \"C\"--and I don't think it makes muchdifference which one we choose in the short run--there will be aconsultation. And the point of that consultation would be to discusswhether or not interest rates should continue to drop very quickly. Ihave a considerable concern that we should not in the next two weeks,or even before the next meeting, be at a 13 percent rate, for example,which is the bottom of the funds range [under \"B\"]. Thus, I wouldprefer to move to \"C,\" with the understanding that the consultationwould indeed take place at about 16 percent and we could discusswhether or not the rate should go below that in such a short period oftime", "MR. SCHULTZ. I'm not uncomfortable with consultation at 15percent. I wouldn't mind seeing it get down in that range, but itwould make me feel--to use Larry Roos' term--a bit antsy below 15percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you're probably overstating thepossible significance of what would be happening in a 2- or 3-week4/22/80period. I think what you say is true if one looked at it in a longenough perspective. But we're dealing with uncertain seasonaladjustment factors, uncertain week-to-week numbers, and an extremelyuncertain relationship between borrowings and the money supply in a2- or 3-week time period. That is all we're talking about", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, these figures all exclude the bigbank borrowings.

My problem with this in part is thatwhatever is nice conceptually, given all the other burdens put on theReserve Banks--or all of us at this point--with the membership and thespecial program and the seasonal borrowing privilege and theoperational problems, this may create [problems] for the banks on topof all the other things they're doing now at our request. We have areal hazard. I think we have to make a pretty persuasive argument,particularly if we're going to do it quickly on top of all these otherthings. I think one can draw the opposite implication: That if it'sa marginally good idea and we want to do it but [our desire is] notoverwhelming, we might want to wait a while just to let the banks getout from under some of these other special things we're imposing onthem now", "MR. BAUGHMAN. In view of the policy action taken today,based on the prospects for the economy and so forth, I'd raise aquestion as to what kind of posture we should be taking now that we'regetting our first reports on our consultations with the big banks andbig holding companies [regarding the voluntary credit restraintprogram and its] 6 to 9 percent [limit on overall credit growth].Just by way of example, for all member banks in the Eleventh Districtthus far total loans have increased at a 12-1/2 percent annual rate.But in March they did not increase at all. Now, these first reportsare going to give indications that [credit growth] will run well inexcess of 9 percent, so we have geared up for some rather hard-nosedconsultations calling for plans, projections, etc. It seems to methat we could rather easily get into a posture here that would lookfoolish, and that's not a very good posture to be in. So I raise aquestion as to whether you have any advice in that respect", "MR. PARTEE. What is it. Is it non-priority loans. Is ittake-over loans. That's another aspect of consultation.SPEAKER(.).

But if you had a bank with 20 percent[loan growth] and it's not in a priority area, I think you have to betougher on that bank than on a bank that's way below and consistentwith the program.

It is not going to help us to say that we haven't changedpolicy and we're following the same targets as before. People wouldperceive the big change in interest rates. And I think substantivelythey would be right; it is a change in policy if we let interest ratesdrop dramatically. So my suggestion would be to try to hold the lineat the [present rate] or a little above it and wait for furtherdevelopments", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I want to insert [that comment] here", "MR. AXILROD. Well, borrowings ought to drop off to almostnothing today and tomorrow. Our estimate is that they might drop offto $600 or $700 million. If we literally followed the nonborrowedpath, they would drop off to very close to zero to achieve this $900million [average].

Whether that is consistent orinconsistent with the money supply would depend in part on banks'response to that level of borrowing. We believe that it is high [inrelation to] this money supply, but we have been wrong before onbanks' attitudes toward borrowing.

If it happened in the pursuit of aconservative path, we're saying it's going to happen. But I assureyou, from my listening to the comments anyway, that more than half themembers of the Committee are not going to be joyous about it and wouldbe much happier if it stayed someplace around 14 percent.

There are [several] points I would like to make.First of all, we have announced that the foundation of our policy isto permit money to grow at 5.5 percent. Secondly, we have announcedthat we have abandoned the policy of attempting to stabilize interestrates. And thirdly, I think we recognize that the most importantobjective of the Federal Reserve today is to restore credibility inour willingness and our ability to stick with a long-range policy andnot change course the minute any short-term phenomenon occurs. So inaddition to what Tony Solomon said [regarding] our objectives, I thinkthe most important objective is consistency and re-establishing ourcredibility. And I know of no way to destroy that credibility morequickly than to start dancing back toward the stabilization ofinterest rates, after you and all the rest of us have said that we'reno longer targeting on the fed funds rate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think there is some question as tohow credibility gets defined in these circumstances, which I supposeis what the argument is about. In my mind, the one thing that bearsupon this a little is that whatever we decide is going to be publishedfairly quickly. I don't know what way that cuts, but it leads me tobe a little more conservative than I would otherwise be. And thatlends some support to the 11 percent number. On the other hand, Idon't like the idea of just going to 11 percent and sitting there on afloor for too long, because I think it might be inconsistent--thoughwe don't know what the money supply figures will be--in getting [moneygrowth] turned around. So I'm left in a bit of dilemma. But we canalways meet again. And if it makes [Committee members] more happy orif we maximize the satisfaction and minimize the risk by taking aninterim step to 11 percent, recognizing that we may have to come backnext week, that's okay with me, too", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

That certainly has been true in manyinstances. But wouldn't you say that the whole episode of the rise ofthe dollar several months back and the [subsequent] decline was aninstance of different rate intentions and different preferences for upor down on the part of the two central banks and that, therefore, wealways had operations in one market but not in the other. On the wayup, the Bundesbank held the dollar down in their market and we didlittle in our own. On the way down, we held the dollar up in ourmarket and the Bundesbank did little to keep it from going down. So,I draw the lesson from this experience that we ought to move towardsomewhat more comprehensive coverage of the markets; each of thecentral banks should be potentially present in both markets at the[same] time. I think that could probably be worked out", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We can explore that more. There aresome disadvantages. It will become known that the Fed is stayingawake and is willing to intervene in the Far East markets. The keypoint is that it will be known that the Fed is willing to intervene inthe Far East markets and is doing 24-hour intervention. A 24-hourmonitoring may make sense, but I don't think we want to accustom theFar Eastern markets [to our] playing too big a role; that view wouldtend to be encouraged if they begin to see more and more Fedintervention in those markets.

Is that right or wrong", "MR. PARDEE. They've done more on the way down in recentweeks as a result of these mutual concerns. They're afraid that thedollar will start declining and [the monetary authorities will] haveto intervene and undercut their monetary policy, and they want tomaintain a certain policy restraint. And we have this other risk thatwe are running with a sharp decline in interest rates and that asudden decline in the dollar will trigger a speculative crisis againstthe dollar", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's an asymmetrical relationship.We don't exactly play the IMF role, but it is true that in the case ofsome countries that are less creditworthy--take Mexico--we would wantto know what their stabilization program was and what the policiesintended to get them out of trouble were going to look like before wewould let them make a [large] drawing on the swap. In the case ofSweden, we can't say that this should be bridge financing [until theycould get funds from] the IMF because they have only, I think, $4billion in external debt; it's not a country that one would push tothe Fund. We have to give them some direction. But there is somedanger, if we don't have some sense of the conditions, that we willhave more difficulty with other countries in applying conditions whenthey are really needed.

But Ifeel that if we don't [do something to] be on target before long, wemay get almost impossible pressures against us to ease later on [bymore than is desirable], at about the time the economy is recovering.And that's the time when we usually make our mistakes. So I come outabout where Governor Partee and Mr. Eastburn did, and I would alignmyself very closely with the remarks they made. I have some specific[recommendations to make] later on regarding the federal funds rateranges, the level and width of the ranges, and also the wording of theoperational paragraph", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, one major problem I have with thefunds range of alternative A is that if we were to vote for a 10percent floor, after having given the Manager a 10-1/2 percent floorin our last telephone conference, I don't think we could honestly orwith a straight face say that we are trying to control bank reserves.Quite clearly, de facto, we would be moving back to controllinginterest rates. Now, if we are faced with a foreign exchange crisis,-18-5/20/80then we ought to be honest and say that we are going to keep thefederal funds rate where it is for the next month, hoping that thefundamentals of our balance of payments will improve and that,therefore, we are temporarily abandoning our policy to control therate of growth of bank reserves. As far as I can see, alternative Ais out for that reason unless we are willing to admit that we aregoing back to controlling interest rates, as we have done before,though the results of that [operating procedure] were not terriblysatisfactory. So I would like alternative B, but I would like a fundsrate range of 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent", "MS. TEETERS. Well, all the news has been consistently bad.Every day brings in another indication of greater depth of the slump.And it seems to me that the risks are all on the down side at thispoint. If we look at the staff forecast, they have made the recessiondeeper but somewhat shorter. And the total recession isn't muchgreater [before] some upturn. Probably it will be both deep and long,the worst of all possible combinations. As a result, I think weshould get back to our targets or we should be providing to theeconomy the sort of support that it needs at this particular point intime. So I would support alternative B, moving back by September, anda lower range on the funds rate. This does raise problems on theinternational side. If we move to where the interest rates aredropping to the 7-1/2 or 8 percent range, we may encounter some heavydrains [of funds to abroad] and heavy pressures on the dollar. Ithink we have to face up to the fact that if we move to accommodateour domestic policies, it will have some international implications.It seems to me that we should openly face the fact that we're probablygoing to have to intervene rather heavily to keep the dollar where wewant it to be in terms of international exchange rates. So thedirective today should not only focus on domestic monetary policy buton how we are going to cope with the pressures, as they develop, inthe international market", "MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I think it is important tounderstand fully the nature of the decision we made on October 6 and5/20/80the potential or lack of potential for accomplishing what we said wewere going to accomplish. As I understood the meaning of what we saidin October, it was that we were going to set fairly long-range targetsfor the growth of money. By law we have to do that. We haveannounced those targets to Congress and we've announced them publiclyas targets for a span of one year. [We said] that in any targeting ofmonetary growth there are inevitably going to be some overshoots andsome shortfalls. That is a part of the process. And if our objectiveis to achieve longer-range targets, when we have a significantshortfall such as we have [now] we will take steps to compensate forthat shortfall by expanding the rate of money growth in order to bringus back into the target range. I've always seen it as similar to theprocess of steering a large ship. If the ship swings off course, youattempt gradually to bring it back onto course. And in my opinion,these overshoots and shortfalls are not totally beyond our control.If they were, then we would be making better use of our time to beback in our various Districts trying to administer the variousprograms of a local nature. We do have the ability at least toinfluence the growth of money in a very significant manner. I thinknot only is the credibility of our October 6 program at stake, but thevery credibility of the Open Market Committee is at stake in terms ofwhether or not we perform what we've said we were going to accomplish.I wish there were an alternative C that could get us back tothe range even before September, but being a realist I guessalternative B is the best we can accomplish. But also being arealist, I would bet a Christmas turkey--although I'm not a bettingman--that there's no way of accomplishing alternative B and getting usback within the range by September with the constraint of a 9 to 14percent federal funds target. I see no reason why, after we'vefinally gotten into better habits than in the past by having a broaderfed funds range, we're all of a sudden [talking about] narrowing itagain. I think we should have a 5 to 15 percent fed funds range onalternative B, and I would certainly prefer alternative B toalternative A.Let me just close by making one further observation: As ourChairman has said repeatedly, as have others among us, accepting areduction in interest rates in times like this should not be construedas an easing of monetary policy. As for concern about the adverseeffect that a further reduction in interest rates would have on theinternational exchange markets, the day that any of us says thatpublicly, [people will say]: \"Look, the Fed is retreating to its oldpractice of concentrating on the stabilization of interest rates.\" Ifthat is said or if that is perceived, I think we'll have a catastrophein terms of the value of the dollar on international exchange marketsthat will far overshadow the effects of seeing interest rates continueto drop gradually, if that is a necessary adjunct to achieving theobjectives that were stated in October. I feel very strongly thatit's a critical time [for us to persist] in what we're doing. I'vefelt a great deal of pride in taking to the hustings with the messagethat we are serious in what we're doing and we're going to stick withit. If we vacillate now, Mr. Chairman, I think the game will be over", "MR. SCHULTZ. I am amazed, and I must admit disturbed, at thefact that I haven't heard the word inflation mentioned around this-23-5/20/80table this morning. My word, it was only two months ago that we werewild about the subject and terribly concerned about it. I admit thatwe're in an unusual period. Things have moved exceptionally fast.But I don't think we can seriously say that we're out of the woods oninflation. And it seems to me that at least we ought to continue tothink about it a little. We do have evidence that things are gettingsomewhat better and are likely to get better in the future, but thatcertainly is not in the bag. And the perception out there isabsolutely crucial. There aren't very many people around the countrywho understand our change from a federal funds operating target to areserves operating target. But a lot of people understand that whatthe Fed does is crucial in the fight against inflation. And there arepeople who still do worry about inflation. If we move too rapidly,that could have some very serious attitudinal effects [on the]psychology of inflationary expectations and could subvert [anyprogress we've made in that area].The other side is that I think the economy is weakening veryrapidly and will turn down very sharply, and I want interest rates tocome down. But if they come down too fast, the result can becounterproductive. If we want mortgage rates to stop coming down [sorapidly] we have to let them back up a little. There is volatility.We gave up some things when we went to this reserves operating targetand one of those things was some stability in interest rates. Thevolatility in interest rates does have an impact on people. They seeinterest rates jumping up and down and they say: \"What is happeningin the country.\" Those interest rate risks get greater and lenderswant to protect themselves against them so they don't bring interestrates down as rapidly. We need to think about the rapidity with whichwe're [lowering the funds rate]. I don't know if we [should] takethese lower targets of alternative A; I do believe we need lower fundsrates targets than we have in that alternative. But if we [implementthem], are we really going to [reduce] the interest rates that have animpact on people any more rapidly than we would if we proceeded alittle more slowly or had a little steadier approach. I think [aslower steadier approach] would avoid a lot of risks. So, I'dcertainly like to argue for alternative A, but I do admit that thefunds rate target would have to be widened some", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. As a relative newcomer to this OpenMarket Committee, I've been struck by the very frequent reference tolosing our credibility if we don't stick to the targets. It seems tome, first of all, that the target is a range and that it's perfectlyappropriate to come in at any part of that range, if we can, ratherthan to zero in always on the midpoint. But the larger issue is thatwe seem to have a misunderstanding of what the Committee's October 6decision was. I thought the Chairman said publicly that there wouldbe somewhat more emphasis on targeting monetary aggregates and less on-25-5/20/80the.fed funds rate and that judgment would be used; there was not amechanistic formula. If that is a correct understanding of what hesaid, and if he was reflecting the decision of the Committee at thattime, then quite clearly some people in this Committee are not on linewith the public articulation of [that decision]", " Secondly,--MR. PARTEE. Following up on April", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. So, these may well be consistentunder that kind of projection of interest rates. But if interestrates in fact turned out to be lower, which is the gut instinct of anumber of people around the table and a gut instinct that I canunderstand, I think we're going to find that M2 and M3 are runningbetter than shown in the projection. We could clearly end up in asituation where M2 and M3 are pretty much, let's say, around themidpoints of their ranges and M1 is running quite soft. I don't knowhow one reconciles that even if our targeting allows for [differing]weights and all we look at is the targets. We have to balance thedesirability of meeting these targets against some sense of what theattitudes are toward what we're doing in the short run and over time.That has been amply discussed by various people already, and we havecome out with somewhat conflicting views about what that means forpolicy.I'm told that you have a revised first-quarter GNP figure,Mr. Kichline, which you might as well throw into the conversation", " That's a--MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, are we as a Committee accepting theconclusion that we really see great dangers in freely rising andfreely falling interest rates. When interest rates went way up, didthat cause disorderly markets", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm just talking about May-June at thispoint. As everybody has indicated, the critical point is going to bethat funds rate constraint. We have the opportunity for consulting onthat as time passes but I want to get some general sense of what seemsappropriate at the moment. We've been operating at 10-1/2 percent;that's being threatened now. Given a balance of all the risks andforces, I think we're talking clearly about something below thepresent constraint. I feel that 10 percent is rather close to thepresent constraint and that we can live with a constraint lower thanthat. Whether we want to go all the way to 9 percent is a question ofhow much we want to consult. I would be concerned at the moment aboutgoing below 9 percent. I'd feel a little more comfortable, at leastfor an interim period, if we could adopt a technique [similar to what]we used at the last meeting by putting in 9 percent or something likethat with some understanding that if it went below the 9-1/2 to 10percent area, let's say, we could have a telephone check to discusswhether, or at least how promptly, we wanted to go to 9 percent. Ninepercent doesn't bother me particularly, and we have six weeks untilthe next meeting. That's a long period of time, and maybe we willwant the funds rate to go below 9 percent before that next meeting.But as a judgment sitting here at the moment, recognizing that we'reat 10-1/2 percent, I think 9 percent would be a pretty big move in themarket's perception. It may not be too big in terms of the objectivesfor the aggregates that we want to reach over a period of time. Thatmay be a reasonable answer: Putting in 9 percent now, recognizingthat it can always be changed with some check in the form of aconsultation when it's [somewhat] above 9 percent. Every time we'vehad these consultations we have withdrawn the funds rate constraint.I would think that is likely at these levels in the future, too, butit may be useful just to have the opportunity to check. We reallyhaven't had any [occasion] since last October where we have let thefederal funds constraint persist for any period of time. But thatdoes not mean that there isn't a certain amount of comfort, I suspect5/20/80to all of us, in taking a look at it when it passes some point that isconsidered significant to some of us or to all of us", "MR.

Well, I don't believe there ever has been one.There has only been a vote when we've lowered or raised the range fromwhat the Committee set at the meeting. Therefore, I would be opposedto setting a range now with a lower limit below 9 percent. And Iwould also like the caveat the Chairman has put forth that there beconsultation at 9-1/2 percent. At this point I feel fairly stronglythat a federal funds rate below 9 percent would not be acceptable", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, there's another question we need todeal with, and that is whether we mention specific short-run numericaltargets in the directive.

On the otherhand, these numbers have been so unbelievably volatile between thefirst estimate and the second estimate that I think this is one ofthose cases where we need to feel our way along. If the numberscontinue to come in weak, then we go through the 9-1/2; if the levelsprojected for June begin to be realized, then we more or less keep[the funds rate] in the 9-1/2 percent area", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I think the substantive problem we havehere is that nobody much cares about what happens to interest rates ifthat didn't affect some other things--like the exchange markets orinflationary sentiment--and cast doubts about our intentions and allthe rest. If I were sitting here alone--it's a little more difficultwhen you're in a committee--I would say this: We've got an 8-1/2percent floor and if we begin approaching that in the midst of greatconcern in the exchange market and the declining dollar, I'd be alittle more cautious under those conditions than if we approached itwithout that. Now, I don't know how to translate that [into preciseoperating instructions]. We don't have to write a directive here, butI'm perfectly willing to be left with a basic decision that 9-1/2percent is not the floor we have in the sense of a floor. We do havean 8-1/2 percent floor in the interpretation that we gave earlier.There is a certain cautious note that a number of people have struckwhich should be reinforced tactically depending upon what was going on[elsewhere], let's say in the exchange market. In other words, if wecan get by with it, I'd go right to 8-1/2 percent--we're talkingpurely about contingencies here--if that's where the path brought us.I might be a little more cautious in precisely when I time myoperations if it were a bad day in the exchange markets or whatever", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

The psychology, Ernie, is that[selling gold] seems to be much more effective if it's a component ofan overall package of forceful measures than if it is done by itself.In the present climate it would look like a major act of weakness.And that might spur some additional dollar selling unless we did it onan enormously massive scale, not just the levels that we have before.On the other hand, if the situation gets to a point where once againwe have to begin thinking carefully of a package, then along with somemonetary policy measures it would be appropriate and add to theeffectiveness--this is my own personal feeling--to do some substantialgold selling. And in that situation I think the Congress wouldunderstand that. We'd have less of a political problem also. So Ithink both factors operate", "MR. BAUGHMAN. There would be some grass roots opposition toit", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me interrupt you just a second for aclarification. It may be that I was up too many hours yesterday, butdid I read the Bluebook wrong. On the first or second page, where thepaths were shown, I thought it said we are marginally above theminimum targeted growth. If I look at the figures, it looks as if weare marginally below. Then there was a footnote on page 3 that saidwe changed the target [for total reserves] and made it a littlehigher; but it said the original target was $43,377 million and thesubsequent target was $43,293 million, which is lower", " So the path is below what was originally--MR. AXILROD. No, the path is above because of M2", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But the footnote seems to be wrong on page3. I'm just gratified that I read this correctly. I found somethingthe matter with it", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You were supposed to absorb reserves [toremain on] the path, right. I thought you absorbed less reserves thanthe path called for", "MR. ROOS. Do you tell them that it doesn't have anysignificance", "MR. MEEK. It's right on the edge on our [staff's] estimates.The Board [staff] has somewhat lower estimates. But it seemed prudentto have adequate room. These estimates are notoriously unreliable", "MR. PARTEE. But you said that was right on the edge", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Without objection, we approve youroperations since the last meeting.[Before] we turn to the economic situation, I might just[raise] another point here so that you are aware of it. You mightalready be aware of it; I believe you have been sent a copy of theresolution that Mr. Proxmire and Senator Garn have introduced aboutFederal Reserve policy. This arose essentially out of the report byArthur Burns' Committee to Fight Inflation, which is made up of an ex-Secretary of the Treasury, an ex-Chairman of the Federal ReserveBoard, and a few distinguished ex-Congressmen. Among other things thereport said that Congress, as Mr. Burns had suggested in a speech lastSeptember, ought to support the long-term thrust of monetary policytoward restraint against inflation and ought to reinforce thatcommitment by a Congressional resolution. That language was in theCommittee's report and apparently Mr. Proxmire read that and thoughtit was a good idea. So he has introduced a resolution, the languageof which I have examined in its present form word by word. It seemsfairly unexceptional but I have a little concern, frankly, about thewhole exercise. It starts off with all these [whereas phrases]--whereas the Congress has the constitutional power, and whereas theFederal Reserve is an agent of the Congress, and whereas the Congresscan tell the Federal Reserve what to do, whereas this and whereasthat--[and then says] we support [the Federal Reserve] in this generallong-range intention [to restrain inflation]. It seems to me the kindof language that could easily be converted in some other circumstancesto say whereas we think interest rates are too high we direct you tolower interest rates. So, it may not be the most desirable precedentin the world, but I'm not sure there is anything we can do about it.I just have a little worry about it. We have not been active insupporting this but we have not been active in working against iteither. My own [instinct] is to let events take their course. Butthere may be an effort--and there's danger in this--to put in somedifferent language in the operative paragraphs that could give us alittle difficulty. We will wait and see, I guess. As it is, I thinkit's unexceptional. I don't know how helpful it really is, but youought to be aware of it. Maybe it is helpful; I don't know", "MR. SCHULTZ. Well, I talked to him the day before yesterday,and he told me that the resolution as originally introduced had beenmuch more specific and that he had Proxmire make it much more generaland so forth", "This is the new introduction--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, if I understand correctly, the targetdoesn't fully allow for what is going on this year", "MR. KICHLINE. Actually, if you flip the page and go back to[the chart labeled] \"Prices I,\" the numbers on the top panel of thatchart show the peak was in the fourth quarter of 1974 when unit laborcosts were up 14.9 percent [from a year earlier]. The fourth quarterof 1975, one year later, was the low point [when the year-to-yearincrease was about] 4 percent. So we had [nearly an 11] percentagepoint swing in unit labor costs in that particular period", "-14-7/9/80MR. KICHLINE. Well, we are pessimistic relative to pastcyclical performance. And I think the productivity assumption is avery tenuous one. There are alternative explanations of whyproductivity declined, and one could very easily suggest that we mayget a bigger rebound. At the same time, on the compensation side wehave a situation where real wages have declined for a substantialperiod of time. In fact, I would view it the other way around on thecompensation side: We think we have a good forecast given theassumptions. But one could very easily think that there will be moreintense upward pressure on wages and that compensation might not slowas much as we have built into our forecast", "-16-7/9/80MR. BALLES. Well, as you know, this calculation is verysensitive to differences in the unemployment rate assumption. A lotof observers, including my staff, think that the non-inflationary fullemployment rate is somewhat higher than 5.1 percent and may be closerto 6 percent. Have you made any alternative calculations. What wouldhappen if you assume 6 percent, for example", "MR. PARTEE. You'd just raise [the non-inflationary fullemployment rate] by 0.9, would you. Is that effectively what youwould do", "MR. BALLES. Well, by how much is the question, Chuck. I'mtrying to get some range of estimates here as to how restrictivefiscal policy is going to be and I doubt that it's going to be asrestrictive, in terms of the level, as what the staff shows. What Iwas trying to find out is what the level would be with a 6 percentassumption", "MR. BALLES. That makes a difference, doesn't it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is this firm", "MR. GRAMLEY. The second question I'd like to direct to Mr.Kichline. In the discussion of the assumptions on the first page,you've noted that M-1A goes up by 4-1/2 percent. But the Bluebooksays something else is involved that I think we need to be aware of,namely that the assumptions about interest rates that are plugged intothe forecast include an assumption that the money demand functiondrops by 3 percentage points both this year and next. So if thedemand function had been unchanged, M-1A growth of 7-1/2 percent wouldbe required to give us the same amount of monetary stimulus. Isn'tthat correct", "MR. MAYO. First, I think the staff forecast is very well puttogether. My staff's forecast is close to that of the Greenbook but Ipersonally feel a little more pessimistic just because I think we'recoming out, I hope, of a very wrenching inflationary experience, whichI believe tends to lessen our ability to rely on econometric models.And I think some of our past sins, so to speak, in not encouragingenough capital formation and productivity in this country are catchingup with us. Maybe I'm just getting older, but this causes me todistrust even more than usual the figure factory, if I may call itthat, on the projections for 1981. So, I'm just a little morepessimistic personally.I have one detail question on the unified budget. You aremore optimistic than the Administration for fiscal '80. Following upon Lyle's point, is this $55 to $60 billion [deficit projected by the-19-7/9/80Administration] fairly set at this point or is the [potential]variation really more than you've indicated here. And why are youmore optimistic. Is this a shift--shall I call it a political shift--of a deficit from one period to another by the Administration", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, our differences with the staffforecast have widened a bit this time. For 1980, we believe that thedrop in real GNP will probably be greater than the staff isprojecting. This concern stems mainly from three factors: thegrowing evidence that the international situation may be weaker thanwe've been assuming, the conditions in the construction industry--andspecifically housing--and retail sales. If you plot housing startsand retail sales in real terms opposite similar periods of otherpostwar downturns, this time they practically drop off the chart; thedrop is far greater than anything we've had before. And we don'tbelieve that that weakness has yet spread to other parts of the-20-7/9/80economy to the extent that it likely will. So, expecting this greaterweakness, we think the unemployment rate will probably be higher bythe fourth quarter than the staff is projecting, though we think therise in the deflator will be less. We have estimated the deflator at8.5 percent versus [the staff's] 9.4 percent for the four quartersending in the final quarter of this year. And in 1981, moredifferences [emerge] because we firmly believe that if we stick to ourtargets on the aggregates, as I think we will, then the outcome willbe much better than the staff is projecting. We are guessing that wemight have an increase in real GNP in the neighborhood of 6 percent ascompared to the 2.5 percent forecast by the Board staff. This wouldmean a good deal less inflation and it also should mean lessunemployment. Our forecast is a guess too, of course, but we feel[the results could be] quite different from what the staff hasprojected", "MR. PARTEE. Is that because compensation goes up a lot lessin your forecast, Bob. How do you have less inflation. That's whatI'm asking", "MR. WALLICH. As far as the forecast is concerned, which Iview as very well done, I find myself much closer to theAdministration's than to the staff's, certainly for 1981. I think wehave to count on a high nominal GNP, quite possibly a good rise inreal GNP, and an even higher deflator than either the Administrationor the staff have. The latter is based on [our past] experience ofalways tending to underestimate inflation. We've had a very patientlabor force. Outside the strongly unionized sectors wage increaseshave been very low, and one must anticipate that at some time therewill be a concerted push to make up for that. We also have to bear inmind that, in a sense, our staff forecast is a formal exercise basedon an assumption of a given rise in money supply. And that isinterpreted optimistically with a 3 percent [demand] shift. We havenever been successful in sticking by our money supply targets and Ifear that the same thing will happen again. That means that we haveno very clear ceiling on the up side and that there's a realpossibility of going to higher rates of inflation and much higherrates of nominal GNP than any of this says.Well, let me just ask one small technical question. Jerry,you were skeptical about business fixed investment spending, partly onthe grounds of low capacity utilization. Isn't there a chance that weare once more overestimating our true capacity, as I think we did thelast time round, and that the pressure begins at lower capacity uselevels. And secondly, given the high increases in wages that firms[already have implemented] and that seem ahead, isn't it possible thatthey may put more emphasis on modernization than expansion", "MS. TEETERS. I'm curious about your projection [for theexternal sector]. I know you said yesterday that the real growth ofour trading partners was strong--and Japan's was quite strong--in thefirst quarter. But [these countries] seem to me to be subject to thesame pressures that we are: high interest rates and rising oilprices. What makes you think that we're not going to export ourrecession and have a worldwide recession, which I assume would weakenyour forecast markedly", "Things could be considerably worse--MR. TRUMAN. Yes, but we may be going through the samephenomena. I've asked the staff about that. We're worried about thatwith a nine-month lag, right. In general, we've been forecasting aslowdown in every [Greenbook] and we haven't seen it yet in thenumbers. After real growth in the first quarter on the order of 3percent, depending on how you cut the numbers--which is a healthyannual rate--we estimate that the G-10 countries will get somethinglike 1 percent growth for the year. That means growth is going tohave be something very close to zero on average [over the final threequarters]", "MR. SCHULTZ. I would have some arguments against doing thatin addition to the problem that it creates for '81. Number one, thecredibility issue of having stated targets and leaving them alone atthis point is worth thinking about. The other is that if we startfooling around with these ranges and try to get them a bit tighter or[the expected outcome] a little more in the middle of the range, it'slikely to get us into trouble. We have to fight Proxmire all the timeanyway because he is always trying to get us to narrow the ranges; andat some point that is going to give us problems. I think we shouldtry to hold out for somewhat broader ranges", "MR. EASTBURN. Well, I think it's very true. In light ofthat, it seems to me that this exercise we go through twice a yeargoes beyond policymaking so far as the aggregates are concerned andgoes to the public impact in terms of creditability and expectations.I would prefer your statement to be fairly simple. I'd say, first ofall, that we are reaffirming the anti-inflation stand that we havebeen maintaining and, consistent with that, that we are going tomaintain the targets we had established for 1980. I'd indicate theuncertainties involved in doing that. We talked at great length hereabout the shifts and the uncertainties involved in the shifts; and ifwe are uncertain about them, [why] talk about that publicly at greatlength. It seems to me that would not enhance our credibility butwould create a great deal of public confusion. And I would notindulge in a lot of fine-tuning among the various averages. That tome would even further compound that problem. So for 1980 I wouldstick with what we have; I'd do any qualitative explanations necessarybut leave the numbers where they are. I would confine comments on1981 to a qualitative statement that we intend to pursue our long-termpolicy of gradually reducing the rate of growth of the money supplywithout being specific about the numbers at this time", "-30-7/9/80MR. ROOS. I am very close to where Dave is on this. I thinkit would be a terrible mistake to adjust these ranges. This probablywill be the first real test from a credibility standpoint of whetherwe are fulfilling what we announced our policy would be last October.To horse around or to adjust the range to accommodate what ishappening rather than what we set out to achieve would be verydetrimental to our credibility. I think consistency is terriblyimportant. I part company [with Dave], if I understood Steve'sremarks about the inflationary consequences of moving back up into therange, in that I think that we should say publicly--I think you shouldtell Congress--that we have fallen below the lower limits of ourannounced ranges for the narrow aggregates and that we are going to dowhat is necessary to get back within the ranges. But no one shouldconstrue that as having inflationary implications other than over avery short period of time. We are going to get back into these rangesbecause we do not want to exacerbate the recession we are in. Wedon't want to make it worse by continuing [to foster] growth of thenarrow aggregates below the ranges. And I think we should make atleast a strong statement--we don't want to be specific--that goinginto 1981 we are going to reduce gradually the rate of growth of thenarrow aggregates. Incidentally, our people did a study of M2 andthey feel that M2 is not an accurate predictor of GNP, so I'd resistmoving to place greater emphasis on our M2 targets. But I think weought to tell Congress what we are going to do--that we are going tocorrect for this [current] undershoot and that next year we are goingto continue our policy of gradually reducing the rate of money growth.We will enforce our credibility by being candid. I don't think weought to play games", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One problem you remind me of--it is moreof a potential problem--is that if we put more emphasis on M2 and alsosay qualitatively that we are going to reduce its range, my impressionis that we may maximize the tension between the economic projectionand the monetary projections", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I don't think there is acompelling case to change the ranges this year, although I wouldn'tobject to revising M-1A down by 1/2 of one percentage point. For nextyear, I disagree with most people who have talked so far. I think weought to give some numbers for next year. If we fail to do so, wecould generate some adverse psychology to the effect that the FederalReserve is not willing to speak except in very vague generalities. On-33-7/9/80the other hand, the problems of setting ranges for M1 numbers for nextyear are really formidable. I disagree with the staff recommendationthat M-1B should be boosted by only 1-1/2 percentage points next year;that's much too low. If in the current situation we are getting aboost of 1-1/4 points to M-1B and then we go to national NOW accounts,[the effect will be greater]. The NOW account is a much moremarketable concept than the ATS account; furthermore the S&Ls, sincethey do not have demand deposits, cannot [offer] ATS accounts. So the1-1/2 points seems much too low. Now, if we go with 2-1/2 points,which is closer to where I think we are going to come out, then wewill get some very strange numbers. For example, for M-1A we will geta range of -2 to +1 percent and for M-1B, 5-1/2 to 8 percent. I justthink our ability to set ranges for M-1A and M-1B next year is solimited that we'd be much better off simply telling Congress that, dueto this new technology change coming next year, we can't do a verygood job at estimating and, therefore, we are only going to set atarget for M2 next year. Now, we could add M3 to that and set targetsfor M2 and M3. And I would say for M2 that we are going to scale downthe range by 1/2 percentage point to 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent. If weare not willing to make any commitment, even a tentative one, on whatwe are going to do in '81--particularly if you are [testifying] at atime when the foreign exchange markets are very turbulent--we arelikely to get adverse psychological feedback. I don't see any realhazard to [my suggestion]. We are going to have to come up with somescaling down of the [ranges] and 1/2 percentage point is about assmall as I can accept", "MR. MORRIS. We ought to scrap wage-price policy. I don'tthink it has contributed anything in 1980, and in an environment suchas we are going to have in the next couple of years I think themarketplace could do a better job than presidential guidelines.Presidential guidelines might end up providing a floor for wageincreases in the kind of soft situation we are contemplating", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do I infer from what you are saying thatyou are much more optimistic about the wage outlook than the forecastsuggests", "MR. MORRIS. Yes, but remember, 80 percent of the Americanlabor force is non-union. It doesn't [work under] any contract. On-34-7/9/80taxes, I would urge the Congress to set that issue aside until theycome back in the next session and treat it as a tax reform issuerather than as a consumption stimulus issue. One could make a goodcase for offsetting the increase in social security taxes for theconsumer and one could certainly make a case for investment stimulus.This, of course, is essentially what is in the package. It seems tome, again psychologically, that it would be better to do this when theeconomy is turning up rather than having the Congress make a panicky,seemingly fine-tuning, effort before it goes out for re-election", " It has been several billion dollars in the lastcouple--MS. TEETERS. Yes. It strikes me as the same kind of animal.[Issuers of commercial paper] have just shifted where they are getting[funds]; and due to the technicalities of the prime rate relative tomarket rates it's a reasonable thing to do. So, we could just explain-37-7/9/80that there has been a shift in the way the market is [behaving] andkeep the same range.For next year, I really am disturbed that everybody wants tolower [the ranges]. Have you not looked at what the federal fundsrate would be if we lower them. The funds rate in the fourth quarterof 1981, if we lower our targets, would be 15 percent. How muchmortgage activity do you expect to have if fed funds are at 15percent. There's a limit to how far we can push down on money growthand not just absolutely strangle this economy. And given theuncertainties of the outlook at this point, I think the safest thingto do is to say that we are going to stay within the same ranges nextyear. We have wide enough ranges to lower the actual outcome, to comein at the low end. But to set out now to push short-term rates up tothe 15 percent area seems to me outrageous, frankly. It would almostcompletely negate any real growth that we are going to get over thisperiod. The housing market certainly won't come back. The thing todo is to say that we will aim to get within the ranges and that wearen't sure we are going to hit the midpoint of every one of them.I'd stick to the bank credit range as modified, and then say at thispoint that we simply plan to continue [those ranges] through next yearrather than that our total task in life is to reduce the rate ofincrease in the money supply year after year. I don't think that'swhat it is", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Are you talking about '80 and '81", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think the First Vice Presidents'position on wage-price policy is related to their dislike of wage-price policies by the Federal Reserve Board", "MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, would you just record me--becauseyou hadn't asked the question on wage and price controls--as beingstrongly opposed to them", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me try to summarize so we canconclude, if feasible, before lunch. On taxes, first of all, let mejust say that I [expect] to be asked to testify formally on taxes, as-46-7/9/80it will be coming up before other committees. In a sense, what I saywould be my personal testimony, but the question is to what extent Ican speak for a wider group if asked. There seems to be a consensus,though not everybody spoke to the point of what we want as opposed towhat we expect, that there is no eagerness for moving on taxesimmediately in a broad-brush way. There may be differing degrees ofsympathy for a tax cut eventually. I think everybody would say itdepends partly on conditions. But the idea of trying to [delay itsenactment] is certainly widely accepted [by this group] as nearly as Ican see [as is the view that] the cuts ought to be gauged as much aspossible in terms of their direct impact on prices and costs andproductivity. There is considerable sentiment--I don't know what Ithink about this frankly--[for reducing] the payroll tax. I recognizethe benefits but I also worry about the future of the social securitydiscipline if payroll taxes are [not imposed] directly. But Irecognize that it is a major avenue to look at in connection with thetax cut program. I could probably speak pretty broadly by saying thatthere is a desire for this to be looked at later and not right now andnot be too definite about the later. The later could conceivably meanat least September but preferably after the election.On the wage-price issue, there's a greater difference ofopinion, obviously. I don't have any set view on this at the momentbut I have a feeling that the pessimism [about the effectiveness ofthe program] that has been expressed by the staff is widely acceptedin our thinking in terms of the difficulty of [making progress on] thewage side of the [equation]. I'm not sure there's anything to belost, frankly, by saying that if you people in the Congress aretalking about a tax cut, a pre-requisite you ought to think aboutamong other things, is a concord between labor, business andgovernment on a guideline that's substantially below the presentguideline. [This has to be done] in the context of all the problemswe have, including the potentially inflationary implications and allthe rest. I don't think it does much good to talk about guidelines inthe present area. But I'm not sure there's anything the matter withstating that as an objective at the moment. And to the extent weraise the issue, it may even slow down the immediate drive for a taxcut until we all see how things develop over the remainder of theyear. Now, that's purely a personal reaction at this stage, but I'mnot sure there's anything to be lost by it. I'd go all the way bysomehow relating it more specifically to wage increases but I don'tknow how to do it. If anybody had a bright idea on that score, itprobably would have been thought of already. Not that your ideawasn't bright, Henry. I don't suppose I could speak more broadlyabout that approach but I have some sympathy for putting it that wayas part of an argument for deferring consideration of the tax cut atthe moment.On monetary policy itself, the consensus is pretty clearly tokeep the ranges unchanged for 1980. I basically agree with that interms of simplicity in presentation. It bothers me a little becausesome things are going on that would justify a change, and in ordinarycircumstances they ought to be recognized. Even on a technical level,on the relationship between M-1A and M-1B--which is a pretty darntechnical matter due to the NOW accounts--ordinarily we would say we[now] have more experience and we ought to adjust that relationship.But I recognize the arguments that were presented pretty fully aroundthe table for taking the simple approach. Most people suggested, and-47-7/9/80I would certainly agree, that consistent with that approach we wouldnot be disturbed if, as is likely, the M1s came in at the low end ofthe ranges. We might also say that it's possible M2 will come in atthe upper end of its range and that M3 will be in the middle or lowerpart of its range. But the ranges are there and we are not changingthem partly because they are ranges. Nevetheless, we don't considerit undesirable or inconsistent with our intentions if we have thatkind of pattern among the ranges. In fact, if we don't say that,we're almost forced to change the ranges because of the apparentinconsistency in the relationships among the different Ms. On bankcredit we may be able to finesse along the lines that have beensuggested. That's a little harder to do than if we hadn't put so muchemphasis on that measure in connection with the credit controlprogram, but let's suggest that bank credit may come in even below thelower end of its range. However, due to the rise in commercial paperand so forth that does not disturb us so greatly that we have to takeit into account.Let me just stop there. Does all that express the consensusfor 1980 clearly enough. We don't change the ranges, but explicitlyin my comments we say that we are satisfied with a low M-1A and alsorecognize that M-1A probably should be low relative to M-1B in termsof the ranges but that this is a technical matter. Thus the M1sgenerally might well come in quite low in their ranges and that wouldnot disturb us. M2 similarly could come in high in its range and thatwould not disturb us, and M3 may be near the middle of its range. Andthat is the basis upon which we are reaffirming the ranges this year", "MR. PARTEE. It's going to have to", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. For '81 I think we are in much moredifficulty, frankly. We have a real dilemma, inconsistency, tension,or whatever you want to call it between the projections and what we'dlike to see happen in the economy. If the staff estimates meananything, in a very straightforward way what they imply for theaggregates--I'm not saying we should accept it--is higher [rates ofgrowth]. On the other hand, we can express the conflict very directlyby looking at this resolution that Mr. Proxmire has prepared, which Iwas urged to accept and I'm prepared to accept. The final clause ofthat resolution says we are going to gradually reduce the rates ofgrowth in monetary and credit aggregates in a firm and stable manner.If we accept that resolution one day, that presumably means we shouldbe reducing the monetary and credit aggregates in a firm and stablemanner, including in 1981. I take it that virtually everybody--therewere one or two contrary opinions--in resolving this dilemma said [weshould express our targets for] 1981 in qualitative terms and in-48-7/9/80effect waffle a bit. I think I agree with that. I will just tell youthat it's easier to say it around this table. When we say that inpublic, people will ask: \"You've been putting more emphasis onnumbers and you've said you were going to reduce the ranges, so why doyou now refuse to say more straightforwardly that you are going toreduce them even by 1/2 or 1 percentage point or something. Youcouldn't possibly have been suggesting that you were going to go moreslowly than that.\" I attach great significance to that [argument] andI think there will be a market reaction, too. The market will attachsome significance to the fact that we are not willing to go up [to theCongressional hearing] and say we are putting forth a lower number.It's not that I really disagree with the fact that we had better bequalitative. But it's not as easy [to carry out] as the commentsaround here suggested; that in itself will have some implications forhow our actions are interpreted. Dave", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think that avoids the problem,but I agree with what you are saying. Whatever else we say about '81we ought to say that there is a lot of uncertainty about the M1s andparticularly about the relationship between M-1A and M-1B. Somebodyhere put it very dramatically with zero on one and 7 percent on theother or something like that. I don't know where we will come out atthe end of the year when we have to make those projections, but thereought to be some discussion of that problem and the fact that thoseparticular numbers may look quite different but in a meaningless wayin a sense. When we actually put forward the numbers they might lookdifferent--both of them--from what we had in '80. One may besignificantly lower and the other may be significantly higher", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I just looked at this language a minuteago. It takes the approach of saying we would like to get them lowerbut then putting a caveat on it", " I suppose the question is whether wewant to say---50-7/9/80MR. GRAMLEY. Suppose M-1A comes in at 3.55 percent for 1980,just within the lower end of the band. Would we really want to saythat for 1981 our objective is to get a lower figure", " That's right, only because of what is--MR. PARTEE. [Unintelligible] talk about ranges. We mightwant to have somewhat [narrower] ranges but even that is too risky, Ithink. But certainly we wouldn't want to say that in 1981 growth isgoing to be lower than the point estimates that we have for 1980", " Wewouldn't want to emphasize reducing that on a long--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I'm saying we would tell them we maynot reduce M2 and leave every implication that we're reducing M1", "MR. SCHULTZ. I think the markets would like that even lessthan if we were more general. That may get us in trouble", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One way we can resolve this target fornext year is the way Fred suggested. I don't know whether we want [toor not]. It's fairly straightforward to say the [1981] targets aregoing to be at or below [the 1980 targets]. I think it's a [choice]between saying that and saying in effect what this other statementsays, which is that we'd like to be a little below [1980] but we arenot sure we can be", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I'm sure we'd have differing opinions about whether wehave to make some overt \"tightening\" move to deal with the exchangemarket situation; I think that would be more inconsistent with whatwe're trying to do than accepting this delicate business of trying toskate through this period without getting the psychological screwsloose. And they're very close to being loose", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Now, [the interval before] the next meeting is so short thatI really can't conceive of these numbers getting to the point wherewe'd want to exert very strong restraint, but I suppose they could.To try to be specific, suppose we got a fairly big July--significantlybigger than this [projection]--and we were coming into August, but[before the] meeting, and the August projection was for a 12 percentincrease. I suppose we'd let the federal funds rate begin to go upand we wouldn't fully adjust the path to take care of a 12 percentincrease, say, on top of a 10 percent increase--just to pick twonumbers out of the air", "MR.

Excuse me, Nancy, but while I think of it,the most important question presentationally seems to me whether wepresent these forecasts with no tax cut, with a tax cut, or both. Iam afraid, frankly, of just presenting a projection which says \"with atax cut\" because I don't know how to avoid the implication that theFederal Reserve takes it for granted that there will be a tax cut andthat it's desirable. The only argument against presenting it at leastboth ways is that the numbers look so sour without [a tax cut].There's the problem of presenting a very sour economic forecast. Howthat gets resolved is beyond me.

Mr. Chairman, given the admission that 1/2percent is a pretty small number and the emphasis on imprecision andalso your expressed concern as to whether the Federal Reserve isreally going to maintain an anti-inflationary posture, I'm wonderingwhether it would be advisable--even though we are thinking in terms of1/2 percent--to say on the order of 1/2 to 1 percent. That wouldgive the impression that we are thinking of a minimum on the order of1/2 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I do have some language here [about that].What is essential is that our intention to lower monetary growthranges over time toward rates consistent with virtual price stabilityshould remain clear. There is language [regarding our intent to]7/25/80review this. Here's the sentence I'm looking for. This is close tothe end as it's now written: \"In accordance with usual procedures,all of the ranges will have to be reassessed in or before nextFebruary. The extent of downward adjustments in the ranges not onlywill be influenced by the technical factors noted above, but also willbe conditioned by the speed with which inflationary bias in labor andproduct markets can be reduced, and by the likelihood, therefore, thatthe economy can make an orderly adaptation to curtailed money growth.The need for public policies other than monetary policy to move in acomplementary way to speed those adjustments was, of course, theessence of my testimony before the Committee.\" Now, that paragraphobviously could be read either way, as permitting more downwardadjustment or conceivably none. I think it's probably the way I wouldlike it read. I must say that if we make enough progress on pricestability, we'd go faster. But I think it's formally neutral in itswording. We are caught in a box, obviously. Looked at from one pointof view the 1/2 percent doesn't sound like much. If somebody says:Hell, the inflation rate is 10 percent and at best they are going toget down to 0--and the progress will be measured by the decline in themoney supply--they have 20 years to go. On the other hand, if someonesays something like 0 on M1 monetary growth--or to have a range, let'ssay 0 to 3 percent--is ultimately where we would end up, we are notall that far from it. It's just these darn lags that have made itlook so far off", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Did you have a question. Well, it soundsto me as if we are at 1/2.

Mr. Chairman, I was wondering if we shouldn'ttalk a little about the way we respond to changes in the demand forexcess reserves in terms of the implementation of open market policy.It isn't just a matter of letting interest rates move up in responseto an increase in demand for excess reserves. If we do not treat thatas though it were a change in the multiplier and adjust the target for-5-8/12/80nonborrowed reserves accordingly, then we're implicitly changing bothour targets for growth of the monetary aggregates as well as the levelof interest rates we consider acceptable. We wouldn't do that if wethought this was going to be a change of [some] duration for, say, asix-month period. We'd obviously make some adjustments. And I wonderif we ought to think about the possibility of doing that in the shortrun, recognizing of course that we'll have to reverse that once itgoes the other way. I'm curious what your comments would be", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The trouble is that we can't do what youare suggesting, I don't think, in any particular week, and then thenext week assume [the relationship] is going to go back to normal.That has more or less been the behavior", "MR. GRAMLEY. You're responding to what you observe as thechange in demand for excess reserves on a day-to-day basis. You haveto be at least one day behind", "MR. ETTIN. The only thing I can add to this argument is thatthe daily pattern of excess reserves historically has been a very poorindicator of the excess reserves for the week. Sometimes there's abig buildup in excess early in the statement week and the average willbe far away from that because it will drop off later in the week.Sometimes it's the exact opposite, as the people taking care of thereserve position in individual institutions are making their ownpredictions of what the daily pattern in the funds rate will be. Asfor that [recent] period when the excess reserves were very large,there had been similar periods in the past of substantial excessreserves, say on Thursday and Friday, but they had disappeared by theend of the [statement] week. So, it's very difficult to predict", "MR. WALLICH. I am concerned about the danger of chasing ourtail because if excess reserves go up and we say there is this demandfor reserves and we have to accommodate it and supply some more, thenexcess reserves might go up further. We would feel impelled toaccommodate that again. Isn't there a danger that we'll findourselves involved in supplying more reserves than are needed", "MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, we were disturbed, as perhaps Frankwas, that in the Bluebook for the first time there was a reference tothe relationship between the fed funds rate and the discount rate. Ithink it would be a mistake in policy, or at least in practice, if wecaused or inhibited the movement of interest rates for the purpose ofmaintaining some relationship between the fed funds rate and thediscount rate. That's a totally new concept, I think", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I think it does matter where thediscount rate is. All I am saying is a very simple thing. It's verydifficult or impossible in the short run to maintain a penaltydiscount rate when borrowings are sizable, given the way we doeverything else--the lagged reserve accounting and these paths and allthat. It's not hard to do, obviously, when the borrowings areminimal. But the problem that we had before--and that we may have nowto a slight degree--is that when the discount rate was way above thefederal funds rate and borrowings were in fact minimal, as soon asborrowings became appreciable the federal funds rate would jump way upto the discount rate. Whereas if the discount rate was lower, thediscount rate is somewhat of a drag on that process. That is the mainreason why some of us, at least, wanted to get the discount rate down.That way, as soon as we ran into any borrowing we wouldn't have toosharp a jump in the federal funds rate. During a period like we'vehad in the last three months, I would say it would have been veryconvenient to have a floating discount rate--to let the discount ratejust go down with federal funds rate--and avoid all these announcementeffects. But if we did that, what do we do when borrowings increaseand we begin putting a little pressure on the money market. Thediscount rate would go up very fast and maybe we wouldn't want itgoing up all that fast. We haven't got any brake on the increase inthe federal funds rates from a fairly low level of borrowings", "MR. PARTEE. The trouble is that we would need to float thedifferential as well as the rate in some way so that we've got movesfrom above to below the funds rate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but what I am resisting--and thisconfusion arises all the time--is the concept that there is a raterelationship that makes sense on both sides of the cycle. I don'tthink there is. There may be a general concept [that makes sense]when there's practically no borrowing. Then I would think, ideally,we'd keep [the two rates] pretty close. Look at the other extremethat we were facing maybe a month or two ago: Suppose we reallyforced excess reserves on the system; the funds rate might have goneway way down if we had done that. I am not sure we would have wantedthe discount rate to go down to 5 percent, if that's where the fundsrate had been going for a few weeks. And there's the more generalconsideration that Tony mentioned. I don't see how we get out of thisbox with an automatic rate, although it would have been convenient fora period of a couple of months or weeks", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I was thinking of tying it perhaps tosomething other than the bill rate--to a combination of bill rates andother things--precisely because the bill rate is so sensitive tothings like foreign demand and technical scarcities in the market", " Well, the Canadians--MR. BALLES. One can also be judgmental rather than automaticin a formula. We could have a basket of rates but not reduce [therelationship] to a simple formula. We could vary the relation betweenthe basket and our rate if we wanted to go the tying route, I think", "MR. KICHLINE. That has constituted a large debate in thepreparation of our forecast. I would say that in the very short runwe would expect the argument to hold that people will jump in. Thatis, if we are talking about a rise of just a few basis points, thosefolks who were out of the market in the second quarter but were on theverge of buying may in fact be prompted to move off the fence. Ingeneral, however, we believe the impact of tighter financialconditions--in the sense of rising mortgage rates throughout theforecast period, which is implicit in our forecast--would have asignificant damping effect. There are two other factors and one is[particularly relevant]. Our forecast implies slower rates ofincrease in deposits at thrift institutions than in previous cyclicalperiods when interest rates declined and stayed low. I might mentionanother factor, which is that the growth of real disposable income inour forecast is really very small--certainly much smaller than in pastcycles. And we expect that to act as a drag on generating effectivedemands for housing", "MR. SCHULTZ. One other factor is the effect of actions bythe Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Monthly payments are the crucial[factor for most homebuyers]. If the FHLBB proposes that thrifts dropdownpayments from 20 to 10 percent and that [mortgage terms] go from30 to 40 years, that will considerably lower [the initial outlay and-14-8/12/80then] the monthly payments. What effect will that have on the wholepicture. That's another factor that probably will be important", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, the main point of difference we hadwith the staff continues to be that we expect less inflation than theyhave been forecasting recently. The Greenbook analysis places almostall the emphasis on the supply side. It talks about the effect ofrising oil prices and food prices and unit labor costs causinginflation, but it really doesn't address this question of thecontinued deceleration we have had--and that we see prospectively--inthe money supply. Nor does it address the shift toward a greatersurplus in the high employment budget. We would place great weight onthis slowdown in the money supply and some also on that shift in thefiscal mix. This will represent about the third year of decelerationin the money supply if [it continues] next year. If anything wasright with that October 6 policy, somewhere along the way we are goingsee some effect on prices. And we think it will come sooner than thestaff does. It's easy to forget that the rate of increase in priceshad hovered at double digits before the last downturn and we got [it]down to 4-1/2 percent but we let the aggregates get away from us and[inflation] went back up. Most people don't remember that. We alsothink that if we are partly right on this, we will have less upwardpressure on interest rates than the staff expects, both because of theremoval of the inflationary premium on long rates and probably lessgrowth in nominal GNP and more growth in real GNP than the staff isprojecting", "MR. WALLICH. The dollar could rise", "MR. WINN. I have to differ with my colleague on the left onprice expectations. I sense quite a feeling that our inflation-16-8/12/80problem is not behind us. Labor is very restive, with food costsbeing a real trigger for their demands. Secondly, new car prices aregoing to surprise people. Every business that I can find is quietlytrying to raise its prices to position itself. In that kind ofenvironment, I think there's an explosive side. The other factor isthe political environment on top of that, with everybody trying toout-promise everybody else. If we just look at what has happened tosensitive materials prices in the last few weeks as well as all of theothers, it seems to me that, despite our roller coaster ride, we havenot dented inflation expectations very much. I think we have a realgroundswell for an explosive development on that side again. In spiteof all we've done, we haven't laid to rest the inflation expectationsvery much", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're more optimistic than you were lastmonth, which they are too", "MR. BALLES. I find no quarrel with the general thrust oftheir updated forecast relative to where they stood a month ago. It'sbetter on the real side, better on unemployment, and worse oninflation. To put our current recession in some perspective, for whatit may be worth, we went back and looked at the behavior of pricesduring the last two recessions. We looked at the behavior of the GNPdeflator--and I had forgotten this, frankly--but it turned out that atthe end of the last recession, the GNP deflator was no better than ithad been at the beginning of the recession. That was also true of therecession prior to that. In fact for the 1974-75 segment, it was fourquarters after the trough of the recession that the inflation rate, as-17-8/12/80measured by the GNP deflator, hit its low point. Now, if I look atwhat seems to lie ahead--if the Board's staff and my staff are correctthat this dip in the economy will be over by the fourth quarter ofthis year and we will then be into the next expansion phase, as weakand anemic as it may be--to the [projected] GNP deflator by the end of'81, which is four quarters after the now projected trough of therecession, I get very disturbed indeed. The Board's staff shows theGNP deflator still rising at an 8.7 percent annual rate. My staffwould be a bit more optimistic. But that's an awfully high inflationrate to have at the beginning of the next expansion phase of thecycle.Also, with respect to the comments a little earlier on wherelong-term rates are headed, with special attention to the mortgagerate, I am distressed to see how high those rates are forecast to be.But I am also convinced that we won't get those rates lower than that12 to 13 plus percent for both the corporate bond issues as well asmortgage rates until we get the inflation rate down. Obviously, long-term interest rates are very heavily influenced by both actual andexpected inflation. I think we have a real dilemma here", "-20-8/12/80MR. PARTEE. I am impressed by the signs of the economycatching as we've [eased our policy]. I don't know to what extent weshould regard that as unusual. The decline in consumer spending wasexceedingly rapid and took us to pretty low levels in real terms insome areas such as automobiles. It may not be that unusual to have alittle recovery after we've had a decline of that extent--a littlecatching up--particularly with money and credit conditions easing.So, I guess I am not as convinced by the evidence that the recessionis nicely bottoming out and that it won't be very long before we getan upturn. I don't agree that this is conclusive since [the period ofimprovement] is so brief and since it seems any market would have alittle see-sawing when big changes occur. I wouldn't agree with thecomment that Henry made that nobody has gone bankrupt. I believebankruptcies are at an all-time high all over the country. Smallbusinesses are going bankrupt and the automobile dealers are having amajor shakeup. It's just that no big companies have gone bankruptbecause we didn't permit Chrysler to do so. Otherwise we would havehad a big bankruptcy as we've had before. Also I would point out thatthere is a long tail on this. If Bob is right, even if the staff isright in their price projections, we're going to have a period ofquite restrained profit performance. And when that occurs, there is afrequency distribution around it; some [firms] are going to be a lotless good than average and they might be bad enough to go bankrupt.So there's still a lot to be played out. What gives me most pauseabout being somewhat bearish about the outlook is the stock market,which has performed extraordinarily well, and sensitive industrialmaterials prices have moved up without fail for two months or more bya rather marked amount. And there are a lot of people out there who,unlike us, are putting their money behind their forecasts. They saythat profits are going to go up--I presume in order to justify thestock market--and that prices are going to go up because of the demandfor raw materials. And that does give me a pause. So, I am justuncertain. But I wouldn't be quite as favorably inclined on theoutlook as the discussion around the table has [suggested] so far", "MR. ETTIN. [Statement--see Appendix", "MS. TEETERS.

Well, I wanted to talk about this very subject.I wanted to indicate that I am somewhat dubious about giving muchimportance to M2 in the current environment for several reasons.Number one, our range for M2 was developed on the basis of arelationship the staff presented to us some time ago, which might havebeen right or might not have been right. Certainly, it is at leastdealing with an instrument that has different components in it thanbefore. Number two, the top end of our range for M2, an aggregatewhich includes most kinds of instant liquidity that people can thinkof, is 9 percent. That is about equal to the rate of inflation; so atthe top end that means the real value of liquid assets will notchange. That doesn't sound all that great. And we have the [prospectof] these shifts of the sort that Ed was mentioning, which do strikeme as possible. M3 is better than M2, I think, because of thepossibility that M3 components--that is, large CDs [primarily]--aremoving to identified M2 components as a result of interest ratestrategies and so forth on the part of holders. I don't find M-1A allthat bad an indicator. I think what we have to recognize about M-1Ais that it has a downward bias. That is, there is some shifting awayfrom M-1A, and we can't quite quantify it, but the basis for M-1A'srelationship to the economy is pretty well established over time andhas been pretty well researched. M-1A still does have currency in itand it still does have demand deposits in it so that we see what therelationship might be. It seems to me the best thing to do is to lookat M-1A principally and make an allowance--I don't care whether wemake it a 2 percent allowance or what--for the understatement of thegrowth rate that is occurring because of shifts into other-25-8/12/80instruments. I think that's the safer way to go. An alternative way,along our usual lines of suggestion, is why not average M-1A and [M-1B] and say that's our goal, on the [grounds that] neither is right.One has an understatement and one has an overstatement, so let's takethe average. It can't be all that bad. But I think M2 is verydangerous to use importantly in trying to steer monetary policy, and Iwould certainly advise against that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We [face] a real problem next year, in myrole wearing my other hat as Depository Institutions Chairman, onwhether to differentiate these rates. There is going to be a lot ofarguing about that. Mr. Corrigan", "MR. MAYO. A couple of points. Ed made the point very wellon savings bond redemptions; that has eased off a little now. But alot of that money is just parked waiting for what people think will be[higher] interest rates, I think. Also, the Treasury has a 9 percentbond coming due August 15, which was subscribed to by a lot of[individuals], at least in our area. They are already makinginquiries as to what [return] is available [on Treasury securities]and typically are saying: \"Oh well, I'll put [the proceeds] in amoney market mutual fund when it comes due. So we will be seeing moreof that, which again leads credence to the fascination with M3. Butit also gets to the point that the further out we go in the Ms, theless control we have over what we are doing. So I think we have to becareful not to get too fascinated with M3. I'm inclined to differ alittle with Chuck [on the relative merits of] M-1A and M-1B. We'dhave to adjust either one of them, whatever we were doing, and M-1Bmay be the better one going out a year or so. Also, that is what themarket is looking at. I think not much attention is paid to M2 in theeveryday market. Whether Peter [Sternlight] and Allen [Holmes] wouldagree with that or not, [I don't know]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other general comments. I take itthere is a good deal of acceptance of some of Mr. Ettin's comments,and there is some question about being too serious about M2. Maybe Ihave misstated that.

It seems to me that we've allbased this [analysis] on a projection of growth in the aggregates thatmay or may not occur. If it doesn't, then it seems to me that we havesome responsibility to get the path back up and let the [funds] ratehit the bottom.

It's not out of the clear blue sky in that sense. It doesn'trequire any heroic assumptions as to what happens in September; itjust says September will increase a little from what we now think thelatter part of August will be.

That is a monthlyincrease in the money supply that's half the normal increase for awhole year. And nobody knows why. I have gotten no enlightenment onit either.

So even there, [though] we know the social securitypayment has an impact on the money supply it is not clear that thatwasn't adjusted out.We haven't had much guidance here. I haven't heard anyreasons from the experts in New York and I haven't heard any plausibleexplanations from the market. Here we have, as I say, a money supplyincrease in a week that's equal to roughly half of the normal increasefor a year, and nobody in the world seems to have even much of aspeculation as to what is going on, what caused it, and whether it's[temporary]. Well, we have some sense that it is temporary; wenaturally think it tends to be temporary simply because it's so big.And the most recent data somewhat confirm that, at least in a partialsense.

That is the index the staff uses inits projection as the best index of inflation. [The projection hasfor] the first quarter of '81 of [an annual rate of] 10.3 percent, forthe second quarter 9.5 percent, and for the third quarter 8.5 percent.I can't understand what causes that tremendous improvement in theinflationary outlook in those two quarters.

KICHLINE. The big factor is the rapid acceleration offood prices that we have projected. On the second question you asked,on why use this one, all of the price indexes now present a[distorted] picture and we are frustrated as to which one to choose.We obviously shifted away from the implicit deflator because of theshifting weights, which give a distorted picture at times. You arequite correct that the Congress and others often refer to the implicitdeflator. My own preference, frankly, is for something like the PCEdeflator. But in a world in which we have rapid increases in energyprices, both the implicit deflator and the business fixed productdeflator tend to understate what is happening because of thesubtraction that is cranked into these numbers.

This could be for one of many reasons, whichcould be very hard to disentangle. I'd like to get your reaction.One would be that the automatic stabilizers are stronger than wethink, that the budget goes into a bigger deficit faster, and othersuch events. Another might be that our interest rate policy has beenparticularly effective. A third might be that the economy is just soinflation jittery that after people catch their breath they rush outand try to beat the game again. But in any event, we do seem to have-14-9/16/80gained a responsiveness to upward factors and lost a responsiveness todownward factors. I'd like to get your thoughts on that.Now, with respect to tax policy, I'd just say that if theeconomy is stronger than expected, interest rates presumably will behigher. Monetary policy in some sense would be tighter. A tax cutwill make fiscal policy easier. So we would be moving exactly in thewrong direction on the fiscal/monetary policy mix--toward tightermonetary policy and an easier budget stance. That's just the oppositeof what a growth-oriented economy should have", "MR. FORD. Well, I remember the President saying just a fewweeks ago that there was going to be a zero deficit next year. So I[proceed] based on the trend in their forecast rather than theabsolute level. Looking at off-budget spending trends that are comingon stream and adding them on to a realistic estimate of the deficit, Iwould come to the conclusion that we definitely have to resist acountercyclical tax cut at this time. It would lay the groundwork, asa couple of the previous commentators have noted, for a very toughsituation for us early next year in that we would be looking at a lotof pressure in the financial markets with a possible crowding outscenario. We'll be caught in the trap of either having to create andbe given [the blame] for a credit crunch or for letting the aggregatesget away from us in the first, second, and third quarters of nextyear. And when we have already committed ourselves in public toreducing the rate of growth of the money supply I don't see how we canhope to do that if we have to do it in the context of a huge deficitdeveloping early next year. So, I think we have to fight this-17-9/16/80countercyclical tax cut. But if we wanted to add something to what wesay, I'd say it should be directed toward the need for a longer-termchange in the tax structure that would emphasize taxing consumptionmore and investment and saving less, together with some indexedreduction over a longer period of time of the inflation premium in thetax structure on incomes of all kinds. I'd be inclined to continue tofight the tax cut as a countercyclical [measure] and start to fightfor tax reform as a longer-term measure", "MR. PARTEE. Is that for M-1A, Jim", "MR. GRAMLEY. But it persists unless the economy has an evenworse performance than that or unless the political pressures on us togive up are so substantial that we cannot persist", "MR. BALLES. Jim's answer to your question, Mr. Chairman,reminds me about a forecaster friend of mine who was quoted in thepaper recently on the outlook as saying that he had a whole pile ofnumbers in front of him and they were all useless. It is frustratingwhen one hears all the scenarios that could develop--the double-dip,the L, and so forth. But cutting through all that, if one looks backthree or four months ago and considers the divergence of opinion then,there may be a little more unanimity on what is really going on orlikely to go on than there was earlier, for whatever that may beworth. What seems to be showing through, particularly in comparisonwith the expectations of last spring, is that almost everybody wouldagree that the recession is going to be shorter than expected--that'sthe good news--and that inflation is going to be worse than expected,which is the bad news. And I know a few that I would consider to bereputable forecasters who are forecasting a boom in 1981. And thereinlies our real dilemma. As I look at the Board staff's forecast onreal GNP and the implicit price deflator and the unemployment rate--and our staff forecast is not significantly different on any one ofthose--the inflation picture is certainly discouraging, particularlyin terms of past cyclical experience. You will recall that in thelast recession the GNP deflator stood at 10.6 percent at the trough,the first quarter of '75. But a year later it was about half thatamount. We really made progress in the four quarters after the troughof the recession. If one tracks [the progress] in previousrecessions, [the pattern] is essentially the same. The real dilemmafor us on the policy side is posed by the inflation numbers we arelooking at in this forecast, where one year after the presumed troughof the recession, which is the fourth quarter of this year, we stillhave an implicit deflator of 8.8 percent, an unemployment rate of 8.3percent and a real growth rate of somewhere around 2 percent. Thequestion it poses is: How much, in fact, can demand management do tochange this. I'm not happy about what I consider a reversed mix ofmonetary and fiscal policy that seems to be shaping up; I would shareGovernor Wallich's feeling on that. But as long as we have this kindof inflation outlook, which is certainly too high to be socially oreconomically acceptable--and ditto on the unemployment rate--it wouldbe hard for me to favor a tax cut for the reasons that have already-21-9/16/80been set forth. I cannot support a tax cut in view of the outlook forpersistently high inflation unless or until the federal budget getschanged in a way I don't think it is going to get changed. I think weare stuck being the only game in town in terms of gradually bringingsome pressure to bear on the inflation problem. And as much as Iwould like to see tax reform, tax reduction net, I share your viewthat it's something we shouldn't encourage in the near future", "MR. WALLICH. Well, we're not looking at the substantialadditional deficits from the off-budget agencies, which are now movingtoward $20 billion. Then there's the borrowing by the sponsoredagencies, which also is on the order of $20 billion. I don't know ifit's fair to throw that one in, but surely one has to add the off-budget agencies to the $61 or $62 billion", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Right. But at the same time, giventhe increase in the tax burden and given the psychological attitudesin the country--and I'm not talking about politics in the narrow senseof the term--there will be an enormous loss of confidence in thiscountry's future and in the vigor of the growth of this economy ifpeople feel that they simply have to accept this increasing tax burdenwith no relief in sight. As I said earlier, I strongly support notgiving any relief in across-the-board personal income tax cuts, eventhough those [taxes] are terribly onerous. But I think we have to dosomething to show that we're working toward a tax policy orientedtoward structural improvement in the economy. I suppose it isanalogous to my feelings on productivity. It's not a question only oftangibles, things one can quantify. It gets get into social,cultural, psychological, and work ethic attitudes around the country.In an intangible way the people's perception of the tax burden andwhat government is doing about it is a very important substantivefactor in the economy. And I don't think we can just look at thenumbers and say: Well, it's $60 billion and, therefore, because weknow it's going to make monetary policy tougher we oppose it.Obviously, if we can bring down the expenditures side, that would begreat. But I don't believe it's going to happen because of thedefense component, no matter who gets [elected]. We have a choiceamong various unpalatable alternatives. If we can do something to getthe spending side down, fine; everybody agrees on that. But the issuestill is: Where do you stand on the tax cut", "MR. SCHULTZ. My view is very simplistic. I have been onthis Board a little over a year now and my attitude has changed fairlyconsiderably. I've come to believe that inflation is intractable,dangerous, and overwhelms all other problems that we have. I think weare going to have a very slow recovery; I think we need a slowrecovery. I don't see how prices and wages are going to come downunless there is pressure on them over a considerable period of time.I hope whatever Administration we have understands the luxury ofhaving the first year of its Administration be one which follows arecession, which hasn't happened in a long time in the past. I hopethey understand that they can do something next year that they may nothave the opportunity to do any other time. My attitude on a tax cutis that it ought to be geared with inflation in mind. We shouldignore questions of equity; we should ignore questions of stimulus.Our policy should be geared entirely to attempting to do somethingabout inflation. I like the idea of doing something aboutdepreciation. I like the idea of trying to offset somehow the socialsecurity [tax] increase. I think we have to have some considerationof a tax-based incomes policy. I don't know how that would work. Ihaven't been able to figure out anything that is practical. Ourexperience with credit controls leads me to believe that it's hard asthe devil to have that kind of situation, so I'm not very sanguineabout [devising] one that can work. But I believe some kind of anincomes policy is necessary because I think every single thing we dohas to be geared to that one fact that inflation is the most seriousproblem we face. It's bigger than everything else put together andwe've got to begin to get it down over time", "MR. WINN. Paul, personally, I have been surprised at thebounceback. I don't know how many more months it will take toconvince me that I'm wrong on that score, but I still have a questionmark. But I think we have lost our benchmarks regarding the impact ofcertain things on economic activity. Take interest rates, forexample, and the changes in financing practices that have taken placeto offset [the effects of changes in interest rates]. There is allthis building being done now with different kinds of financing wherethe interest rate per se is not as high, but a 10 percent gross kickeris established on top of any interest rate so that whenever we raisethe level of rates it doesn't necessarily change the outlook in the[usual] sense of the term. [Lenders] have gone to financing that isnot long-term; it's a 30-year commitment with a rollover every fiveyears and a 2-1/2 percentage point change in interest rates either wayadjusted over that [5-year] period of time. So there has been a lotof adaptability--in terms financing structures--to changes in rates,just as we have had adaptability in terms of money. I'm impressed asI watch the checks on the money funds flow through our office. Whenyou see a check for $12 million drawn against balances that don'texist, you wake up to what is being measured and what velocity means.There was an announcement this morning by Master Charge about theirintroduction of new check concepts and plastic money to replace someof our measures [of money]. So, again, I think our benchmarks interms of what we do [and the impact on] economic activity need to bereexamined.On the other side, I'm impressed with the sociologicalchanges that are taking place in our society. Part of this goes backto the inflation issue. We ought not miss the polarization that istaking place in society between those who are being pinched byinflation and those who are not. It's no longer just a racial issue;it's showing up in a variety of ways. And that scares me, frankly, as-26-9/16/80I ponder what it means down the road. When one talks to doctors andpsychologists and others about what complaints they hear [frompatients], one finds that finance has suddenly become the biggestfactor in their consultations. Personal bankruptcies in Ohio are thethird or fourth largest in the nation and they are growing. Again, ourbenchmarks are lacking in terms of our ability to appraise what ishappening on that score. There is a certain segment of our societythat is really being squeezed by inflationary developments, and foodprices are only going to add to this. So the pressure for a tax cutis going to be very real. The problem is that it won't really addressthe problem. It will just bail out a few people and the issue willcome back again down the road", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I can be very brief. I mainly wantto get on record on the tax cut question. I don't disagree in anymajor way with the staff forecast. The only reservation I would haveon the staff forecast is the qualitative amendment that was made onthe basis of the most recent retail sales numbers. I don't see anybasis for a sustained expansion in retail sales, and I don't seeanything in the personal income data or wage and salary numbers thatwould lead me to expect a strong or even a moderately strong-27-9/16/80resurgence in consumption expenditures. Like most people, I think weare seeing the signs of the early stages of the recovery, a very weakrecovery. And anticipating the discussion that is coming up, I don'tthink we ought to do anything to choke off this weak recovery in itsearly stages.With regard to the tax cut question, I'm pleased for thefirst time to agree completely with what Tony Solomon said, especiallyhis comments on the intangibles. I think that was a very perceptivestatement of our situation. So briefly, my position would be thatit's simply too late to think in terms of a countercyclical tax cut.But we have to think in terms of tax reform--tax reform in thedirection of increasing incentives to invest, incentives to save, andincentives to improve effort. And once an effective rational taxreform program has been developed, I think it would be very importantto announce the intent to reduce taxes over a given period in thefuture. In short, I have a great deal of sympathy for the Feldsteinproposal of announcing in advance what the government intends to dowith respect to taxes and the tax structure", "MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix", " Yes, and we'd expect a further rise--MR. PARTEE. It would be turning up as the quarter went on", "MR. AXILROD. The mortgage rate we have under \"A\" would bearound 13-1/8 percent, which is not far from where it is now. But ifthat were wrong, I suspect the rate would be higher. And under \"B\" Icould easily see the mortgage rate moving up between now and year-end-- this is my view and others maybe differ--to around 14 or 14-1/2percent, depending in part on the degree of concern institutions haveon whether rates are going to move up even further", "MR. AXILROD. I don't think we are going to get slow moneygrowth over the rest of the year. And whether that [more] rapidgrowth is going to occur in September, October, November, or DecemberI'd be the first one to say I couldn't really tell you because thereis a lot of noise in the month-to-month fluctuations of money growth.The only basis for saying slow growth in September is that we havemodestly firm data for the first three days of the month andpreliminary data for the next seven, so we have data for something-32-9/16/80like a third of the month. Those data show an average level for themonth below the level in August. So allowing for some rise over thebalance of the month--I think there will be some rise--we'd get a verylow growth rate. Now, if we get a revision in the preliminary datafor the week of the 10th of plus $1-1/2 to $2 billion, like we gotlast week, and if the week of the 17th shows no coming down from thatbut remains strong, then it's quite possible that September could bemoving up again to very high growth rates. Similarly, we could getdownward revisions and get very low growth rates. What I'm saying isthat all we have is the first 10 days, of which seven of those daysare partial data", "MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, all of us are deeply concernedabout the inflation problem; I don't think any of us is more concernedthan the others about it. And we are trying to find a way to dealwith it. But we just have to recognize that if we turn this economyaround again and promote another decline in economic activity once thebottom has been reached, this country and the Congress may not havethe tolerance to let us continue. I don't think it will. Now, thefinancial conditions that would emerge under \"B\" are no longerconsistent with the staff forecast. The staff's forecast has mortgagerates reaching 13-1/4 percent by the middle of 1981 and [underalternative B] we are talking about a mortgage rate of 14 to 14-1/2percent in the fourth quarter. I just think we ought to move slowerthan this. We will be in real trouble if we push so hard that we-37-9/16/80choke off any possibility of recovery. I want a slow recovery; Ithink we all do. But I don't want one that is so slow that theeconomy ends up turning back down again. So, I'm with GovernorTeeters. I would support alternative A", "MR. BALLES. I pretty much share the feelings expressed byGovernor Wallich and Messrs. Guffey and Morris in that \"B\" is themaximum that I would like to see us go. We are all torn between therisk on the one hand of choking off recovery with too great a rise ininterest rates and the danger on the other hand that we will make nosignificant progress on inflation. My first preference would be tolean against the inflation problem a bit harder by what I would call a\"B-minus.\" I wouldn't be unhappy if the specifications of \"B\" werereduced somewhat to avoid overshooting for the year as a whole, whichI think we could come pretty close to given the range of error and howthings go. Dave Eastburn mentioned 4-1/4 percent for M-1B. I hadjotted down 4-1/2 percent for the August-to-December target. Thatwould give us growth of 5.6 percent in M-1B for the year as a whole,pretty close to the upper end of the range. I think somewhere between\"B\" and \"B-minus\" is the lesser of the evils, considering the twodifferent evils we have to avoid", "MR. BAUGHMAN. He had different reasons, but wound up in thesame place. I would like to note also that when we reported to ourboard of directors last week on the new Regulation A and what weanticipate the guidelines coming along with that will be, we got quitea strong negative reaction. They felt it was a significantretrenchment in our posture at the window. They have been engagedaggressively in the last couple of years in trying to build betterrapport between the institutions in the District and the FederalReserve and feel they have been making considerable progress. Theyare persuaded that the institutions will see this as a more stringentface at the discount window and that they will have lost credibilitywith what they view as their clients in that respect", "MR. SCHULTZ. I'm delighted to hear that there's so muchcommitment to our targets and that we're going to have the strength tomake sure we get growth within them. I'm a little surprised to hearso many people feel that the fourth quarter is going to be so strong.I would remind you that interest rates have already gotten to thepoint where they are having some impact on economic activity. Mr.Kichline, for instance, has housing starts for August at 1.4 millionbut then dropping to 1.2 million in September. And that's just withmortgage rates where they are right now. I don't know how sensitiveautomobiles are going to be to interest rates, but it seems to me thatwe don't have very much chance of a big strong recovery in the fourthquarter, yet that is what I hear influencing the [policy preferences]around the table. I'm afraid that alternative B or something evenmore conservative than that risks putting us in a more difficult-39-9/16/80position than a path that is a bit more expansive. I don't want to goto alternative A; that may put us in some danger of going out of therange on the upper end. But, you know, New York may be right one ofthese days. I'm afraid that if we go to \"B\" or something even moreconservative than that, we may get ourselves in the difficult positionof having to be too expansive in the fourth quarter. And we will getthis stop-start pattern again. With these forecasts being all overthe lot, I think we're much better off somewhere between \"A\" and \"B,\"which gives us much more flexibility. And I really think it iscrucial that we retain as much flexibility as we can. So that makesmore sense to me than anything else. That will give us an opportunityto look at September and will give us the kind of flexibility we needto get where we want to go through the end of the year", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's everybody, isn't it. I confess Iam a little struck by what seems to me a contrast in some of thepolicy judgments, or aggregates judgments, and what I took to be thetone of the earlier discussion, which was highly restrained in termsof a forecast of ebullience in the business world and somewhatskeptical of full faith in short-term movements in the aggregates. Iapproach this with a feeling of some concern about [how we will] comeout of this meeting right at this stage. We've had a very highAugust, to be sure. We've had several months that were very high, butAugust was particularly high. There is some hope that September willshow a leveling and a possible turn in the business situation. Ithink it's probably [going to be] a real turn, if a real turnencompasses the idea of a W, with a rather weak middle of the W.I was somewhat concerned that we would come out and say, ineffect, that we're throwing down the gauntlet and that we would makedamn sure that we would meet our targets in a very acceptable way andtake all the risks on the side of interest rates and the economy. Ithink that's a real implication of \"B.\" I don't think we can inhonesty adopt \"B\" without saying: Okay, beginning tomorrow orwhenever we will go out and in effect force interest rates up. And Iwould have great reservations about that kind of approach. On theother hand, I don't feel quite comfortable with \"A,\" given the waythose charts look, particularly the M-1B chart, which a number ofother people have mentioned. I think Governor Partee's comments arecorrect. We look at these as targets--and God knows what's going tohappen--but we haven't got the short-term control mechanism thatguarantees we're going to meet the targets. That much has beendemonstrated by recent experience. But we do bias the [decision in aneffort to meet the targets]. I would pick up in Governor Partee'scomment, which has been seconded by the comments of a number ofothers, that the best thing we can do is to aim someplace in between\"A\" and \"B.\" I think that's consistent with not taking much of anovert step at the moment. We'll see how the money supply figuresdevelop. That may be as early as when we get a revision in thepreliminary [M-1A] figure. But certainly we keep getting surprised bythese [numbers] in one direction or another as time passes. I don'tknow what projection is right. But if the number comes out high, Ithink any of these alternatives imply that [market conditions] couldget tighter and borrowing would go up. If it comes out as favorablyas New York suggests, I suppose it would go the other way. If itcomes out as favorably as New York suggests, it probably means aweaker business picture than many people have in mind and we might geta rally in the markets. In those circumstances, with that kind ofaggregates picture, I'm not sure that would be undesirable.So, consistent with what a number of people have said, butcertainly not everybody, I would play it neutrally at the moment.That's what we did last time. It lasted for about two days until themoney supply figure came out high [unintelligible]. I hope another $9-41-9/16/80billion increase doesn't come along and throw us off course quite soquickly as last time. But [ongoing developments] are what we would beguided by to a considerable extent. I don't know what neutralitymeans precisely, given this borrowing discussion we just had. Ibelieve you've assumed $800 million with alternative B, Steve, andthat seems to me low if we really wanted to get to alternative B", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No, it brings us out to somewhere[unintelligible] than if in that situation we had put in \"B", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we obviously have some difference ofopinion and I am proposing that we come out someplace in between.These numbers do not lend themselves to easy averaging without comingup with rather small fractions. And when we get down to the lastquarter, I think it becomes fairly irrelevant. We have heard twoaveraging proposals. Mr. Solomon was a 1/4 percentage point higherthan Mr. Partee on two of the numbers. Have we ever used a numberwith 1/4 for a period this long", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if we took these--if I may so termthem--more hawkish views and if we were honest with ourselves giventhe range of probabilities, we would be saying that we've got to goout this week and take a rather overt step to tighten up the market.That may not be necessary, for sure. That's what we don't know. Now,[doing] that may turn out to be wrong if the economy is very weak, andwe might have to retrace the step. And that's one of the things thatI think we would be better advised to avoid", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I may just be talking about a gut feeling,but I tend to share the view that Steve first expressed: That ifthere's a risk here, it's going to be on the high side rather than thelow side. I'm just going by recent experience; that's the way it hasbeen. That could well be wrong. I have no problem with starting outwith $700 million or something in that range. But I do have a feelingthat starting out in that range and putting a lot of weight on [growthrates] as low as those in \"B\" may delay for two weeks what you'retalking about. I think the odds are that at some point we're going tohave to put [interest rates] up quite overtly and strongly. We mayhave to do that even if we went with \"A.\" If we went to an \"A+\" wemight have to do it. I can't guarantee [anything]. All I'm saying isthat we have a stronger case if [growth in the aggregates] did gethigh. Obviously the higher the monetary numbers are, the more-45-9/16/80protection one has in a sense--the more explanation one has for whythe market is reacting the way it has and why we have reacted the waywe have under those circumstances. I don't think we have much[protection] if we're demanding that September be practically flat,which is what the staff is projecting. And I hope that's what it is.But we're also demanding that October and November be [almost] thoughnot quite as flat. Obviously there's an arithmetic difference betweenthese, and the way one falls in the spectrum is what we're talkingabout. But I would want a little more justification, in terms of theaggregates, for the kind of interest rates some of you are talkingabout before I saw those interest rates in the market. We are talkingabout an M-1B that I quite agree is a little higher than I'd like tosee ideally. Just rationalizing, M-1A doesn't look so bad under thesealternatives. M2 we think is going to be a little high. There's notmuch we can do about it. M3 is a little higher than I'd like to seeit. But just weighing the risks, and against the background of thebusiness [conditions] discussion that we had, I would like to have alittle more evidence that the aggregates are fully running in excessof reasonable targets before very overt moves are forced. That's whatit comes down to. Mr. Corrigan, did you comment. You didn't", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that's right, but you're playingwith arithmetic in a sense. The question is what we want to do in asubstantive sense", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I sort of disagree with Jerry. We'retrying to set a target path that we think is acceptable. If thenumbers come in high, then markets are going to have to tighten; andif the numbers come in low, markets are going to have to ease. It's atarget concept rather than a projection concept that we should thinkabout when we're specifying these. So I don't see why we can't state,as suggested in the Bluebook, the target growth rate we would like tosee for the last four months of the year", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My comment about neutrality relates to howwe come out of this meeting right now, not for the next month. Idon't think we can ignore what is happening to the money supply forthe next month. As I said, we take a chance whatever target we set.If next week's figure comes out to something like a reduction of $1-1/2 billion it doesn't apply to anything we have said here. But if itcomes out significantly different from that, we're already beginningto diverge under any of these targets. I guess one can argue it anyway. My particular problem is that I think [\"B\"] is a bit unrealistic--that may not be a good word because anything can happen, includingthe New York projections, in which case it wouldn't be at allunrealistic--taking the broad range of probabilities. We probablywouldn't be neutral coming out of this meeting with alternative B", "MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, I was assuming that if theCommittee wanted to start off in a posture where in some rough sensethe pressures in the money market weren't terribly different from whatthey have been in the last week or two, I would think an average levelof borrowing of $600 million is way too low. An average level of $800million might just about be consistent, given the fact that borrowinghas been running high in the last week, with not much change in moneymarket pressures. If my interpretation of what the Committee means by-49-9/16/80neutrality to begin with is right--that is, basically money marketpressures about as they have been, taking everything relevant to thatinto account at least initially--then I would think a number between$700 and $800 million would about do it. We would technically writedown $750 million in the path, but if borrowing were coming in high,we'd adjust the nonborrowed reserves down a bit and vice versa. Wecould just as well do that with a $600 to $800 million range. We'dwrite down $700 million and if $750 million looked right, then we'dlower nonborrowed reserves in the course of the week. If $650 millionlooked right to give a money market sense as it has been, we'd raisethem a bit. We can operate with that kind of flexibility, and thatmay be best given this developing uncertainty about what particularlevel of borrowing is \"right", "MR. AXILROD. With uncertainty", "MR. PARTEE. You want preferences or can live with", "MR. ROOS. Mr. Chairman, I'm disturbed, not so much evenabout the figures as this: I thought we had agreed, and that allthinking that has ever been expressed about targeting aggregates[suggests], that we had to set long-term targets and stick with them.-51-9/16/80Trying to fine-tune, as I think this discussion is demonstrating thatthe majority in this Committee is dedicated to, for 30 days in orderto have some effect on interest rates I think is a reversion back tovery thing that we abandoned last October. It makes intelligentlytargeting on aggregate growth and on reserves an impossibility. Thiswhole conversation reflects, at least as of this moment, that we'vethrown in the towel on our noble expressions and intentions of lastOctober 6th. We're right back to trying to control interest rates andtrying to move from moment to moment, which is what has been happeningin this Committee as long as I've been sitting in these meetings.This is where we have gotten into trouble in the past; whenever we'vebeen faced with a difficult decision we've always said, in effect,let's wait another 30 days or another 60 days. We procrastinate. Andthat is why, I think, we are in the inflationary situation in thisnation that we find ourselves in today. I apologize for that", " That'sjust the opposite of what was done--MS.

Governor Rice", "MR. WALLICH. I'd like to point to a broader matter. I [willtry to] be very brief. We may be facing a situation we had early thisyear [when] the dollar was very strong--this time not so much becauseour interest rates are rising as they did at that time but because themark is weak. And we may find ourselves either having the dollar goup or with a possibility of accumulating a fair amount of D-marks.Now, last time we operated so as to allow the dollar to run up prettyfar; it came down again. We had a very pronounced upward and downwardtrip which did no particular good. We didn't accumulate or gather infor repayment a very large amount, although we did do some but overtime. We didn't pay all [our mark indebtedness] off and we could havedone so at that time. Now the question really is: If similarconditions develop, and there's no assurance that they will, should wefollow the same strategy or should we follow a different strategy.That is, should we lean harder against the wind, which in this casewould mean not just to gather in [marks] to pay off debt but toaccumulate some reserves which might be split with the Treasury or beall for the Treasury or all for us. There's a problem of risk infinancing to be considered. But I believe we should think ahead alittle and not just leave it to the developments of the day", " We've already purchased $55 million worth of marks thismorning and we would under the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we in the government are no way nearbeing in this position. The Treasury is $2 billion in debt, as Scottsaid. And they would like to cover their debt so there's $2 billionto go. They have a few problems in terms of the rate of speed withwhich they accumulate balances, because of cash problems, which raisesa question of whether we can put some element of flexibility in here.I disagree with you on the value of letting [the dollar] goup earlier. It may be that the reason why the dollar didn't go downfurther was that the market had seen that they lost some money when itwas going the other way. That doesn't mean that we've got to do itthat way again. But I don't think one can say that that wasmeaningless", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The Germans are running at aninflation rate of 5 percent or less and we're running at 10 percent orwhatever rate you want to call it. Eventually there will be areversal of this movement. I do not think that we get points--weought to let the dollar rise sufficiently so that traders do not tend10/21/80 -5-to be bearish on the dollar. They can be caught off guard. But onthe other hand, unnecessary volatility on the up side which one knowsis going to get reversed later is not helpful. It goes beyond thepoint of keeping the traders off balance. And I think we have shownin the last couple of years that a more activist policy in regard tothe exchange markets is a useful policy. So we don't have to have anexact sense of what an equilibrium rate is to know that at some pointwe want to limit the volatility on the up side and take advantage [ofopportunities] to restore balances", "MR. PARTEE. My only point, Tony, is that I can remembersitting here not too long ago and hearing that if the rate droppedbelow 2, the end of the world would be at hand. Well, we're not evenback to 2. I agree that it slips with time and perhaps what was 2then ought to be 1.90 now because of the differential in inflationrates.

That theory is notgoing to be borne out in practice all the time. But there are theseother considerations in that [the proposed terms] look moresymmetrical--in fact are more symmetrical--and the foreign countrieswant us to do it that way.

In thatparticular instance, we just haven't done any [swaps] with sterling.We don't anticipate any, but it could happen. And it could happenthat sometimes we will do it when we get stuck on the interest rate.When this interest rate was originally negotiated in the early '60sI'm sure that the U.S. presumption was that U.S. interest rates wouldalways be lower than the foreign rates.

When you observe a significant increase in banklending, which obviously requires the availability of reserves, do youaccommodate that. In other words, do you make those reservesavailable to the banks. Or sometimes if a bank decides to increaseits lending and knows it is going to have to pay the piper two weekslater or a week later on this lagged reserve accounting, do the banksjust assume that they can make these loans and price them because thegood old Fed will come along and provide the reserves to enable themto meet their reserve requirements at a later date.

This gets into somevery serious problems, as Steve suggested. If we had pressed downvery hard and pushed, I don't know where the federal funds rate wouldhave gone but the evidence seems to be that we get very little impacton the money supply in the short run. But we might get a helluva bigimpact two months from now and then you would say: My word the moneysupply is declining 8 percent and we have to push way the other way.So if we let the federal funds rate go to zero--I'm exaggerating abit--we still won't get much impact [in the very short run]; we'd getthat impact two months later. Now, if one wanted to be nasty andcritical of the Federal Reserve, one would say we reacted or pressedtoo hard in February and March when money supply growth was high. Theresult was a very [weak] money supply in April and May. And wepressed much too hard against the decline in the money supply in Apriland May with the result that it went up [rapidly] in August andSeptember. Now, I think there are other things operating, but to theextent that these lags are operating that's the dilemma we get into", " That's very easily--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I know there's no exact answer, butwhat are the best estimates of the length of the lag", "MR. GRAMLEY. It isn't just a matter of lags. It's also amatter of the size of the elasticities and what's happening totransactions demand for money as a consequence of changes in GNP. Theworst possible implication of thinking through this lag business isthat if we have both significant lags and a very low interestelasticity of demand for money, when we try to push the money stock inthe direction that's counter to the direction in which transactionsdemand is going, we don't get a response right away. It may pushinterest rates to a point where the response comes through the effecton the economy later on, in which case we could end up chasing ourtail more or less perpetually. And that's a possibility I think wehave to look at very carefully. I've asked the staff to begin lookingat this, but it's much more [than lags]; it's a complicated process", "MR. BAUGHMAN. And if we don't go that route, then it seemsto me we come back to the old problem we had--which we apparentlydidn't handle too well--namely, our ability to project what level ofinterest rates will give us what we want in some other measure", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Following up on what Fred said, Ithink we're in a major quandary because I think the way the countryinterpreted our October 6th announcement was that we were going to paya price in terms of volatility of interest rates but the implicationwas that there would be much more stability in the growth of the moneysupply. We have seen at least in a year like this--and possibly,although I hope not, even in a year when the underlying economy is notquite as volatile--that we don't have that kind of control for thereasons we were talking about. So I think we built up expectationsthat we can't meet now. And there's also an impression increasinglygetting around that it's not so much a lack of political will orresolution by the Fed but that the Fed basically doesn't have theability to control the money supply, which is your point. But, Fred,if we stress too much that we can't control the money supply in theshort run, it can give a very undesirable impression of the FederalReserve's [impotence] among those in the public and in the businessand even the financial community who are naive about [the extent of]our ability to control the money supply", "MR. ROOS. There are a lot of people in the markets who feelthat we announced we were going to do this and then we reestablishedour practice of flirting with [controlling] interest rates, so wereally only [went part way] in this process, not the whole way", "-21-10/21/80MS. TEETERS. Your housing starts alone would do that,wouldn't they. Aren't your housing starts trending downward", "MR. ZEISEL. We assume that housing starts will drop offrather sharply", "-22-10/21/80MR. AXILROD. I would say the effects of that probably wouldbe negative because I perceive difficulty already in the public'sunderstanding of the increase in the M-1B range [described] in theappendix to the Chairman's letter in February, having to do with the1981 targets. I've heard people interpret that as an increase inmonetary growth and an easier policy when it was explained that thatmeant a tighter policy. So I think an effort at this point to do thatfor 1980 would probably be nonproductive", "MR. ROOS. I would caution, Mr. Chairman, against ourbelieving that we can move in an admirable fashion from M-1B, whichcertainly has been the primary focus for our attention in recentmonths, to M-1A just because we are running into trouble with M-1B. Idon't think we can fool the financial markets. At Frank Morris'srecent conference, which was attended by a lot of individuals from thefinancial markets, there was pretty strong allusion to the fact thatthe Fed has several different definitions for the aggregates just soit can conveniently use the one that seems to be working best for themoment. I don't think we can get away with it. I was a littleconcerned, actually, about what I sensed as a primary emphasis on M-1Ain the Bluebook this time whereas [previously] we have talked aboutM-1B. I don't think we can switch the tiller, or whatever we areusing as the directing mechanism, at will and not confuse thisCommittee as well as the financial markets generally", "MR. WALLICH. I'm not sure that we have been using M-1Bprimarily and not M-1A, but I do think there are weighty reasons whywe should downgrade M-1A. There are substantial shifts into NOW andATS accounts. The indications that we get from M-1A are clearlybiased. So I would say that in the future we should look more atM-1B. There are some [financial flows] coming into M-1B that are notcoming out of M-1A", "MR. WALLICH. Well, as I look at the state of the economy, itseems to me that we have a lot of unpaid bills accumulated. We'vebeen through five years of expansion with a lot of inflation and otherdistortions and hardly any of that has been paid off--corrected orexpiated, if you will. We've had no reduction in inflation. We'vehad no significant restoration of consumer demand. The consumer hasbeen overbought because of inflation and is coming around slowly.We've had no restructuring of balance sheets. It's hard to believethat after five years of expansion the distortions could be corrected,so to speak, in one quarter of recession. Now, we didn't expect thatkind of short recession. We may have it. The forecast that we have--and it has changed quite significantly from last time--seems to saythat we have more GNP now and we'll get less GNP next year. At theend of next year we'll have about the same level of unemployment andGNP as we would have had if we had traced an alternative path with therecession continuing through 1980 and then a more rapid recovery. I'mnot sure whether this new path is as adequate in terms of correctionsas the previous one because we seem to be treating as a gain the risein the [third] quarter and maybe in the fourth quarter as something tobe defended by our monetary policies. We can't latch onto that. Ithink we have a bigger correction, unfortunately, to go through. Wemay be dragging it through 1981 with an almost zero rate of growth.That is why I conclude that we have to accept a degree of financialdiscipline. There just is no interest rate level that is bothnoninflationary and pleasant to live with in terms of the demandeffects that it has. If we're going to go to interest rate levels--and I always think of interest rates as being established of course bymoney supply targets--so if we go to money supply targets to produceinterest rates that will make the present situation livable andpleasant and make for expansion, I think we're building in moreinflation for the future. We're moving from an uncorrected base. Myinclination, therefore, continues to be to lean on the hard side ofthe aggregates", "MR. MORRIS. Yes", "MR. MORRIS. [Unintelligible] as they do. We either changethe ranges or--though I don't think we have this option--say we can'tstay within the guidelines that we've established", "-29-10/21/80MR. GRAMLEY. You characterized the staff forecast as agloomy one, Mr. Chairman, and I think that's right. Indeed, I thinkthe outlook is probably even a little gloomier in the sense that therisks in the forecast are mainly on the down side. The staff'sforecast assumes a shift in the money demand function, which may ormay not happen. I have my doubts about it. It assumes that thesaving rate is going to decline by half a percentage point; that mayhappen, but I have some doubts as to whether consumers are going tospend that aggressively. It assumes that businesses are going to wantto increase the ratio of inventories to sales moderately in a periodin which final sales growth is extremely weak--and in fact decliningoutside the personal consumption area--and interest rates are veryvery high indeed. I conclude from this that if interest rates go upsignificantly further from what the staff has forecast, that we'regoing to convert growth of 1/2 percent into a recession. I think 1/2percent growth--to respond to Governor Wallich's comments--isappropriate; I don't find that an unacceptable outcome. In my view arecession is not going to give us any help in our fight againstinflation. I don't think the first recession, the recession of '80,did any good. I doubt that another sharp recession would do any good.I think you are quite correct, Mr. Chairman, insofar as the fourthquarter of the year is concerned, that we're probably going to seemore real growth this quarter than was forecast. That doesn't give meany comfort. On the contrary it gives me additional worries, becauseI think we may find that the demand for money is growing even morestrongly than the staff has forecast and that interest rates will haveto go up a long, long way to get [growth of the aggregates] within theranges of either alternative A or B. And then we will set the stagefor another downturn. What I want to do at this point is not tooverreact because I believe there is a very real possibility that whatyou say is correct: That we may be caught in a cycle in which thevery way we're trying to operate is producing these fluctuations inboth money and interest rates and [thus] in the economy.I want to call to the Committee's attention, too, what hasbeen happening to the components of M2 that are not in M-1A or M-1B.It's quite dramatic. We had an M2 growth rate in the third quarteroverall of 15-1/2 percent; that's the quarterly average. But duringthe course of the quarter, these deposits have shown an annual growthrate of 22-1/2 percent in July, 13 percent in August, and 7 percent inSeptember and October. There has been a dramatic deceleration; andthose deposits are four times the size of the deposits that are inM-1A and M-1B. And that's something we ought to take into account inthinking about how hard we try to achieve those targets for M-1A andM-1B in the near future. So, I'm leaning toward the easieralternative", "MR. WINN. Mr. Chairman, I have several comments. First,with respect to the forecast, it seems to me that it's based on theinternalities of our economy rather than the externalities. I don'tknow how to recalculate it, but it seems to me we have oil problemsand military problems. [If one is] just conscious of what we'reshipping overseas at the moment, one can't miss the kinds ofactivities that are going on, and they are going to have a delayedeffect. Second, if one looks at the figures and then takes a smallsample--and I realize the danger of samples, but try to go to a-30-10/21/80shopping center some weekend. You can't find a place to park. If yougo in, you can't believe the prices they're charging. And people areall saying: Well, the price is only going to get higher; we betterbuy it now. And when you add to that what I see in the agriculturalarea, with foreign demand springing from China and Russia and otherplaces, the inflation pressure is very real to a whole host of people.So the saving rate decline wouldn't surprise me a lot, given what wesee people doing. It seems to me that somehow that [inflation]expectation has to be halted. And if the externalities get out ofhand on us, which we really haven't factored in [to the forecast], wewill have an explosive situation on that side of the coin that wehaven't thought about too much. Consequently, I lean rather stronglyto the feeling that with all the publicity that has been given to ouractivities we at least have to do our best to perform because thereare not many areas in which people have much confidence these days.Going back to my college days where A was a good mark, I guess I'dstrive for an A+. I'd not be too aggressive, but it seems to me thatwe really have to lean against the [tide] this time", "-32-10/21/80CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the best news I've heard in a longtime, Ernie. I didn't know that. The last wage settlement I heard ofdown in your part of the country was a 60 percent increase for threeyears front-loaded", "MR. PARTEE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't know that I haveanything to contribute on the economic outlook. I am not surprised atthe projection. As I view it, we have more or less established agovernor on the economy with our monetary aggregate ambitions and thecredit and interest rate implications that fall out. And if we have agovernor that limits the speed to 55 miles per hour for spending,well, we are not going to have more than 55 miles per hour spending.The question of how much head wind there is in the form of inflationis something that we all argue. I think wage costs, food costs, andenergy costs are pretty intractable and we'll have as much or close toas much inflation as the staff projects. But one could be moreoptimistic on that, as Bob is. However, the fact of the matter isthat if we get a little more housing, then we get a little lesssomething else in the existing environment, assuming we hold to ourassertions about monetary growth rates over the period.I do have a much stronger feeling about the shorter-runspecification of policy. I asked Steve where alternative C wasbecause it seemed to me that alternative A was totally out of the ballpark so one really needs to choose between alternative B, which [callsfor only 3-1/2 percent M-1A growth], and an alternative C which iseasier. The reason I say that is that I just don't think that one cansay to the economy at large--not the financial people or themonetarists but to the economy at large--that we are seeking, [as inalternative A], a 1-1/4 percent rate of growth in money supply over a3-month period in which we expect to have some continuation ofeconomic recovery. That just isn't the kind of number that one seeks,and it's way lower than anything I've seen. And 4 percent on M-1B isa very low rate, too, for the next three months. To get us down morecomfortably within the ranges, as alternative A would do, reallyimplies in the short run a policy which wouldn't be understood andwhich could very likely result in a second downturn, or at leastincrease its probability. I think it will occur anyhow, but that willincrease its probability. We faced a situation similar to this a year-33-10/21/80ago. We were running high in our target ranges. In fact, it lookedas if we weren't going to be within the target ranges. So what we didwas to specify, as Steve suggested at the end of his briefing [today]I think, that we would accept a rather moderate number or \"somewhatless.\" And I think that's the way we ought to specify ouralternatives this time in terms of the 3-month [specifications].Going off from alternative B I find tolerable: The notion ofseeking a 4 percent rate of growth in M-1A or somewhat less, a 6percent rate of growth in M-1B or somewhat less, and a 7-1/2 percentrate of growth in M2 or somewhat less. I think we can take a littlechance on M2 because, as Lyle pointed out, we have been getting quitea lot of [slowing] in that rate of growth through the summer and earlyfall. I do think that we need to be even-handed about this and thatwe need to recognize that our mistakes always occur not because we are[slightly] off from modest numbers, but because we are way off frommodest numbers. And, therefore, I think the funds rate range shouldbe raised to 9 to 15 percent, which is in keeping with Ernie's thoughtthat we should center our range around where the rate is, and themidpoint of 9 to 15 would be 12. And I think we need to recognize thepossibility that if we have enough demand, we'll have to move againstit and the funds rate could indeed need to move up considerablybecause monetary growth is above [our specification]. But I justcan't accept the idea of saying to the public that we seek a monetarygrowth rate of 1 percent over the 3-month period", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to thestaff's forecast of the outlook for economic activity, the only realdivergence I have is that I would suggest that the fourth quartermight be a bit stronger than they are projecting. In turning to thefinancial side, it seems to me equally that the Bluebook's forecast ofmoderate demand for money in the fourth quarter may be a bitoptimistic. Taking those two things together would suggest that wewill find considerably higher interest rates necessary to hit either\"A\" or \"B.\" And it comes to my mind that the Fed's credibility may bemore suspect now than virtually any time in the future because we arethe only one out there that the public is looking to for any comfortthat prices will come down some time in the future. Thus, with theprospect of difficult times ahead, I don't think we should shirk theresponsibility. It seems to me that the nation would be well servedif we made a fairly strong public comment and commitment thatinflation is the number one problem. And we can do that in myjudgment only by adopting a policy at this meeting that is at least nomore expansive than \"A.\" Let me suggest that if we adopt \"B,\" forexample, we would be saying to the markets and the public--maybe 30days from now to be sure when they look at the record--that the Fedgave up in November the opportunity to come within the stated ranges.And I think that would be very unfortunate. I would focus on at leastalternative A. I think we are going to have difficulty hitting either[unintelligible]; it does imply higher interest rates. There has beensome comment about the 1980 recession and the fact that we got noprice improvement as a result of that recession. I'd like to pointout again that it was a very short recession. I don't think one couldexpect any price [improvement]. If we now shy away in monetary policyfrom the risk of having a recession or a double-dip, I think we areavoiding our responsibilities for the future. Lastly, if we adopt \"B\"-34-10/21/80or something to the right of \"B,\" I think we would be making our taskfor 1981 impossible in the sense of trying to hit the targets we havealready announced. As a result, I would like to take the bite nowrather than some time later", "MR. FORD. On the business outlook we don't have much to add.My staff is exuberant about the fact that they have done better forthe last two or three quarters forecasting the aggregate economicvariables, and they are saying that the quarter we are in now may be alittle stronger than the Board staff's forecast. In the Southeast we-37-10/21/80are finding a very mixed economic picture and some of the sameconcerns that others around the table have expressed about what wemight do to housing and whether or not new car sales will really go upand all that. But the new things that I would like to add to thediscussion that has occurred around the table so far involve not justhow our policy would be viewed by the public but how the public andthe financial community will perceive the government's overall policyactions. And what is happening on the fiscal front concerns me asmuch as what we are doing. Irrespective of the outcome of theelection, if I read it right, we are going to continue to see aboverange spending in the federal government; every revision of the levelof the federal deficit has been sharply up in recent months. We arenow looking at estimates for the deficit during this fiscal year ofperhaps $50 to $80 billion, after closing out last year somewhere inthe $60 to $70 billion range, without considering off-budget spending.So on the fiscal side, if we ask what we will be looking at six monthsfrom now, regardless of the outcome of the election, it appears to methat both sides are coming out with tax cuts. [So] that applies tothe outlook of the Board [staff] for the fiscal deficit irrespectiveof the outcome of the forthcoming election. That has to beconsidered.Everyone has mentioned that the outlook for shocks isparticularly scary right now, with a major war going on in the MiddleEast. So we are vulnerable there to inflationary pressures hitting usagain. And that brings us down to what we should do against thisbackground of vulnerability to shocks and the fiscal outlook. Myfeeling is that we have to be very concerned not to go through thesewild gyrations of monetary aggregate growth. I wouldn't want toadvocate that we sharply contract [such growth] in an effort to get itway down in the middle of the range because that will just encourageanother round of [unintelligible] that we will settle up with monetarypolicy. Rather I do think we have to temper our approach at this timeto try to hit--your commitment Paul, you were the one who said it lastOctober--these targets. We can't ignore the fact that regardless ofwhat we say and how we interpret the different variables to thepublic, they are going to make their own reading on it. What they aregoing to say is that either we did it or we didn't. In thatconnection, I feel somewhat like Mr. Mayo: Whether or not we arehappy about these things, the fact is that we are going to be measuredby them. So we may as well try to play to win, whether or not we likethe rules of the game. The only element that I would add [relates to]the letter you sent to us concerning how the public would interprethearing that we are reconsidering our operating procedures. If youthrow that into the pot, I think you are very right to be worriedabout how it would be interpreted, especially if we miss theaggregates. So with all of that taken together, I come out on the \"A\"side, with a lot of concern that we are not going to win either way wego on this. But \"A\" seems to be the one that gives us a chance atleast to maintain some element of our credibility on the October 6,1979 plan you announced", "\"MR. SCHULTZ. We have credibility problems on one side and onthe other side we have interest rates that I think are beginning tobite. I'm not sure how much we can do about monetary growth over thenext couple of months. As the Chairman says, [the outcome for thisyear] is probably already in the cake. And although I think the[economy's] momentum is rather strong and this fourth quarter might bea little better, [the economy] is very fragile; and if we run interestrates up too much, I see a real possibility that we will slip intoanother downturn. I don't think that would be very helpful nor is itthe kind of policy we want to carry out. It seems to me thatstability is pretty important but I hate to be slavishly chained toany kind of special numbers. So I really am having a very difficulttime. I would like to talk in such a way as to keep our credibility,which leads me to \"A.\" And I'd like to act in such a way that wedon't let interest rates go up too high, which is equallyproblematical. So, we have a very difficult decision to make todayand I don't have a very good answer at this point", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. But let me follow up on whatFred said at the end. It seems to me that we ought to go for thetargets of alternative A but we ought to put the borrowing level closeto that of alternative B. I would suggest $1.3 billion. That canalways be reviewed later, but with a $1.3 billion [initial] borrowingassumption presumably we would not get any significant upward pressureon the fed funds rate if the other projections are correct. Now, bothalternatives may be completely unrealistic and we may just be sweptover by this situation. Taking these funds rate assumptions that areconsistent with the aggregates, it seems to me that we may pay someenormous costs if a month from now when the minutes of this meetingare published they show we targeted alternative B [growth rates] forSeptember to December, which clearly indicate mathematically that wehave given up on M-1B. Its growth would come in at 7 percent fourthquarter-over-fourth quarter, with the upper end of our range being6-1/2 percent. I think the public would not understand that. At thesame time, we are in this dilemma, and any significant rise ininterest rates right now would cause some proverbial problems to theeconomy. So my instinct is basically the same as Fred's, and I wouldreach toward a combination as I indicated", "MS. TEETERS. Steve, can you pinpoint a federal funds ratewith a level of borrowing", "MR. ROOS. That approach seems totally illogical to me, Mr.Chairman, because we say that there's very little we can do to affectthe rate of money growth right now and yet we say if something happensa few weeks from now, then we'll try to do something that will affectit, even though we can't affect it now. I don't think that makes muchsense, if I understand what people are saying. If we really want to-46-10/21/80do something about controlling the rate of money growth in the longpull, I don't think it's as complex [an undertaking] as we're makingit when we talk about borrowings and all of this. We are creating aterribly complex, complicated, and unworkable process of getting fromhere to there. We're never going to get the job done doing it thatway", "MR. ROOS. But, Lyle, hasn't that been where we've missed theboat for almost the last five years. As recovery has begun to occur,haven't we always said: Let's just look in the next 30 or 60 days andlet's not rock the boat because we might abort the recovery. Haven'twe procrastinated in taking any meaningful action so that in theaggregate what we've tolerated has led to this present recession.I've seen [that happen] ever since I've been on this Committee,whether we were trying to stabilize interest rates or were doing itthis way. We always have some fear that something negative is goingto happen to the economy. And almost inevitably we've had two[results]: We've been surprised at the resilience of the economy andwe've also failed miserably to do anything about inflation", "MR. GRAMLEY. But, Larry, if you remember back just sixmonths ago, the shoe was on the other foot. The money supply wasdropping like a rock and you weren't saying let's not worry about it.We're always too much concerned about interest rates being too highand having negative effects on the economy. You were saying let's seehow much reserves we can dump in to get money growth this quarter inthe immediate future. I think that's one of the reasons we're payingfor it now. We just let interest rates drop too far last spring. Wegot the economy turned around too fast. We should have thought thenthat we needed to play for the longer pull not for next month or thenext quarter. And that's the advice we need now", "MS. TEETERS. We're going to abort the recovery, too", " But I don't see--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We miscalculated, though. If we hadknown that the economy would turn up in the third quarter, I don'tthink we would have pumped in reserves as much as we did", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we haven't reacted in the last twoweeks. We've had quite a lot of reaction since the last meeting. AndI think the first question is: Do we want to react right now. That'sa reasonable question. I would say no, but that is the first questionto be decided, it seems to me. When I say no, I mean not reactdramatically; I think $1.3 billion or something like that may mean aslightly higher federal funds rate", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think one thing we have to bear inmind is that none of us really has any confidence in the forecast. Itcould come in at that level or it could come in much higher or muchlower. Al Wojnilower in New York is saying it's going to be astronger recovery [than generally forecast]. Other people are talkingabout the double-dip. The forecasts are all over the lot. Underthose circumstances, it seems to me that we have to start off fairlycautiously in terms of not wanting to see any major movement ofinterest rates. But I do think we have the credibility problem; Paulobviously feels that I may be exaggerating it. But I am concernedabout a September-to-December intermediate target that would make usopen to the charge that we actually targeted growth fourth quarter-over-fourth quarter that is higher than our target range. It seems tome that in this very unsatisfactory situation there is no good answerand we should compromise because I agree with Paul that thedifferences between \"A\" and \"B\" are not that significant. I thinkthey have a public relations importance. The difference between$1-1/4 billion and $1-1/2 billion initial borrowing is not [much] moreimportant than the $60 million reserve difference between the \"A\" and\"B\" [alternatives]. I think there has to be a mix, and I've made aspecific suggestion. I don't know what alternative specificsuggestions there are", "MR. RICE. Yes", " But the M-1B range is obviously a little low andjust on technical grounds--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON", "MR. PARTEE. I can't understand what has happened to M-1A. Iwasn't aware that Larry, for example, had shifted from M-1A to M-1Buntil right now. I can only conclude that it's because it's a highernumber and that therefore he's really not a monetarist but adeflationist", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will rest on a simple statistical factthat while these targets may be the most wonderful, impregnable thingsin the world, they are mutually inconsistent", "MR. PARTEE. I don't think that's technically true. Itdepends on the profile of the months", "MS. TEETERS. We're literally arguing over tenths. And thatseems ridiculous when we have such a short period of time left", "MR. FORD. There are two other dimensions to what you'rediscussing on borrowed reserves. One is that on Friday, if the ratesdon't break this week, I suspect you're going to get a number ofReserve Banks recommending an increase in the discount rate, whichwould obviously affect the borrowings. The other thing is that we putout a revision in Regulation A", "We're going to have an inflationary--MR. PARTEE. You want higher interest rates. I see", "MR. SCHULTZ.

TEETERS. Second", "MR. WALLICH. Scott, you made a number of very interestingobservations. I just want to check on how to interpret them. One,you said we bought as many marks as we possibly could. Was therereally in some sense a restraint on how much we could do. Whycouldn't we have done more", " It's very possible that it could have gone over2 marks to the dollar, but with a much more volatile market, muchgreater pressure on our foreign central bank counterparts to dosomething in response to the decline in their currencies, and muchgreater pressure on the EMS snake relationship", "MR. PARTEE. I guess I don't understand the operating rulesthat we use for intervention any more, Scott. I thought we intervenedonly in disorderly markets. We have had a market that has been moving11/18/80up; it was not particularly disorderly. You said we bought as manymarks as we possibly could. I didn't understand that to be whatpeople did when they intervened. And my impression is that we boughtfar more marks than the Germans did. That is, we are doing thesupporting of the mark, not the Germans. And you gave as a reason forit that it helps hold down interest rates abroad, which I think is avery strange reason indeed because it seems to me that if we want tohold down interest rates, we ought to hold them down here not abroad.So I just don't understand what is happening. You also said that wewere doing this to match the Treasury's [foreign currency] debt. Butwe have matched the Treasury's debt. We have gone $100 million overthe Treasury's debt and you were still buying like mad early thisweek. So I think it's time for a discussion of the terms on which weintervene and what our strategy is other than that we just buy as manymarks as we can every time the dollar goes up", "MR. PARDEE. To the extent that you back away, you leave animpression in the market that you're not holding the rate or, in fact,that your operations are not effective in holding the rate where itis. So you are helping the rate to move along that way", " I agree with your point, but the capital inflow isfacilitated by--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, we wouldn't have the capital inflow", " Well, certainly, if one assumes that 180 is theright rate for the mark, we ought to buy all we can at more than 180because when--11/18/80VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I think 193 is not sustainable", "MR. WALLICH. I think gains and losses in the exchange markethave to be evaluated including the interest that one earns. On oneside if we have D-marks, as Tony says, the chances are that in thelong run the D-mark will be stronger than the dollar, but we will havelower interest earnings on that. On the other hand, if we oweD-marks, having drawn on the swap, say, that is an adverse positionbecause the D-mark may appreciate. If we pay interest in D-markterms, we would be benefitting from that. So the interest to someextent counteracts the risk factor insofar as the risk factor is basedon purchasing power parity considerations, which will not work outexactly in the long run. Also, I would like to remind you that othercountries have enormous reserves. The Germans still have, I think,$40 billion; they had $50 billion plus. The Japanese have $20billion. They all take a great risk because these reserves are mostlyin dollars, which from their perspective have depreciated, giving themlosses. We have a very large gold stock.

Well, Mr. Chairman, I think we have all beensurprised by the resiliency of the economy since July and we areconcerned about the dip that the staff is projecting in the firstquarter. We'd all like to be able to produce a smooth 2 percent realgrowth rate for the next couple of years but I don't think that'scompatible with our attempts to decelerate the rate of monetary growthgradually.

We have probably produced a greatdeal by our actions in the past months that is not yet reflected inthe economic statistics or in the monetary growth rates. Nonetheless,I like the alternative B growth rates for the aggregates simplybecause I don't think we can continue to raise our objectives for thequarter month after month in response to unexpectedly high increasesin the aggregates. We did it last month. But I don't think we canmaintain our credibility if we respond to bulges in the aggregates byraising their targets. So I would stay with the growth path for theaggregates that the Committee voted for last month. I would set a 13to 17 percent funds rate range because I have a feeling that we canaccomplish our objective within that. If we find that we can't, thenwe can reassess it later", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't want to do it prematurely,but I'd like to get to some [views on the] borrowing assumption beforewe finish. Mr. Gramley", "MR. ROOS. No, sir. First of all, I feel that the techniqueof operating with the nonborrowed and borrowed reserve paths is notworking. I can't answer your question because we place more emphasison total reserves in our view than on borrowed and nonborrowedreserves", "MS. TEETERS. I think the talk about the targets for 1980 isirrelevant. We're done. At most we have four weeks in which tooperate and the reserves will be set with lagged reserve requirements.So it seems to me what we're really talking about is how high we'regoing to let interest rate go between now and the end of the year, andthat's it. I am also strongly of the opinion that rates are alreadytoo high. We have already killed the housing market. We aredepressing the automobile market. We have continued pressure onbusiness fixed investment, and it's to a point where I think it willstall out. I would like to point out to you that the last time we hada federal funds range approximately like this was in February of lastyear and we had a 9-1/2 percent drop in real GNP in the secondquarter. I think the changes in interest rates have influenced agreat deal the pattern [of GNP growth] we got this year. And I don'tthink the staff has done a bad job. I went back and looked at theirfourth quarter-over-fourth quarter projection of February of last yearand they had a decline for the year of about 2 percent. And if theyhave the fourth quarter right now, it's going to be a decline of about1-1/2 percent this year. The pattern was different; the pattern ofinterest rates was not the one anticipated. I think these risinginterest rates have an extraordinarily damping effect on the economyand if we let them go any higher, we're inviting disaster again. Inaddition, we'd be [inviting] a rerun of the great interest rate cycleof 1980 on an economy that is not where it was last February. LastFebruary we were at 85 percent capacity utilization and at 6 percentunemployment. A lot of things were different than they are now. Wehave a relatively severely depressed economy that would be put throughthe wringer again and I think that would be a mistake.Some of you say you're going to take \"B\" because it's nodifferent from what we did last time. There's a 4 percentage pointincrease in the federal funds rate range associated with \"B.\" It was9 to 15 percent [last month] and the staff is saying \"B\" is [now]compatible with 13 to 18 percent. I think 18 percent is outrageouslyhigh. On account of the growth in the money supply, we immediatelyrun everything up to the top of the range, usually within a week afterthe Open Market Committee meeting. Consequently, I don't care whatyou do with -the money supply. I do care what you do with the interestrate range. I would put the maximum at 15 percent with maybe a bottomof 11 percent. The borrowing assumption is funny because we determinethe borrowing from the nonborrowed reserve path. By doing anonborrowed reserve path, at least for the next two weeks, wedetermine what the borrowings are going to be. There's a Catch-22game going on here", "MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, after listening to this dialogue,I wish we had the option of saying none of the above relative to \"A,\"\"B,\" and \"C,\" because there doesn't seem to be a good answer. Broadlyspeaking, the dilemma that we've been faced with for some months hasgotten worse. In a sense, we are still the only game in town in termsof an anti-inflation policy. Despite the election, if one looks atbond yields, inflation expectations haven't gone down. The fact thatthe forward rate on the dollar has actually gone down may indicatethat inflation expectations in the view of foreigners have gottenworse. And while I continue to hope month by month, as does Steve,that these higher interest rates will result in some downward shift inthe demand for money, I see a contrary trend going on. I think we aregoing to experience more of it because the cost of long-term money isso darn high that there is immense incentive on the part of businessesto borrow short--that is, in the commercial paper market or throughbanks--and that drives deposits up. So I expect this recent surge inbusiness loans to continue.As I see it, the really damaging thing to the economy is theheight of long-term interest rates, and I don't see how we are goingto get them down until inflation expectations come down and until thebudget of the new Administration gets sorted out, which is going to bea source of uncertainty. Meanwhile, we have to worry about whetherour monetary growth rates themselves are becoming a source ofinflation expectations, as some of my directors and a good many of theprofessors at our recent academic conference think is the case. Inview of all of this, I think it is too late in the year to aim for\"C,\" which is a meat ax tactic; so the next less damaging [posture]would be to stay pretty much with \"B\" as Messrs. Morris, Guffey, andsome others have said. I wouldn't want to increase further the rangesthat we are shooting for. Furthermore, I would not be inclined tonarrow the federal funds range, as some people have [suggested]. Ithink 13 to 18 percent is a viable range to stay with, given all theuncertainties that we face", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I would prefer a $1.6 billionborrowing assumption and the specifications of \"A.\" My first instinctwould be a fed funds range of only 13 to 17 percent, but I am worried-37-11/18/80that if things don't go as expected, we might find that the 17 percentupper limit would force the supplying of very large amounts ofreserves, more than the Committee would want. So my instinct would benot to lock ourselves into the 17 percent but make it 13 to 18 percentwith some flexibility in judgment regarding that 17 to 18 percentarea. It seems to me that we ought to try to stay within the 17percent, but if in consultation with the Manager it looks to you asthough that will require supplying more reserves than is advisable,there ought to be sufficient flexibility in the directive for you tomake the judgment to go up to 18 percent", "MR. PARTEE. That's consistent, though, with having 13 to 17percent and then providing, as we've done previously, for consultationof the Committee if the 17 percent proves not to be reasonable", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let's see whether we can reach adecision. There is a fair amount of difference of views on some ofthe specifics but some recognition on practically everybody's part ofsome common concerns, too. On approaches, I would just make twogeneral points. I think what we are seeing now in general terms isthe famous collision between the recovery and monetary targets thatare in some sense too restrictive to permit recovery unless themomentum of inflation declines. I didn't expect to reach [this stage]this early, but here it is. A number of people have commented thatthese targets, just to put it very quickly, lower the limit on theability of the economy to expand. They are going to continue to dothat, I suspect, given all the uncertainties, with targets of the typethat we have until inflation declines. And that's a veryunsatisfactory picture from any perspective, other than sole-mindedconcern about hitting the targets. That's where we are and that'swhere we may be.Somewhat related to that, which has already been mentioned,is that we still have some concern as to how much fluctuation we aregenerating in the money supply figures and interest rates by notrecognizing some natural instability in these data. It's purely amatter of judgment and it's totally unsatisfactory in terms ofreaching specific decisions because, to exaggerate a bit, we areguessing. Let me simply put it that if we bend over backwards to hita target in the short run and find ourselves not making it, we end upwith exactly the opposite problem in a very limited period of time interms of the targets and with some real effects on the economy as time-38-11/18/80passes. And we have unnecessary fluctuations; we may be stuck withthem to a degree but they are not a happy circumstance in which tooperate. But that doesn't give us precise guidance on how to balancethose considerations.As for hitting the growth targets or not hitting the growthtargets--and I can only give you a personal view--I am not asconcerned about that as some people are because I don't think, as I'vesaid before, that these targets are written in heaven. There is a lotof uncertainty in these relationships. I do think we have todemonstrate, and I am satisfied that we have, that we take themseriously. That is important. Whether being precisely in the rangesor slightly outside of them is terribly significant to credibility ornot I think depends in part upon our own attitudes, how we portray it,and how we describe the problems. [To the extent that] there is arecognition of the very real problems that we have, that credibilityproblem is diminished. If we attach what I personally think is undueimportance to absolute precision, obviously the public is also goingto attach more importance to absolute precision than they otherwisewould. In that connection, I would only remind you that most foreigncountries use a range. I believe they all do now. Is there one thatdoesn't, Mr. Truman. I don't know. There used to be", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Sure, and that's part of the reason. AllI am saying is that in part the public's attitude toward these thingsdepends upon our general behavior, not the precise arithmeticprecision with which we reach the range. Well, that's a philosophicalcomment. We have to reach a decision here.So far as the money supply targets are concerned, I sensethat we are dealing with two somewhat conflicting concerns. One,which I certainly recognize, is that we are in the middle of thequarter. If we were on the schedule that we talked about before, thiswould be the middle-of-the-quarter meeting. We would already have seta quarterly growth target and the inclination would be not to changethat unless there was something very persuasive going on. But wewould consider whether to change it and how to alter our operations.Certainly we have been forced to raise that target repeatedly inrecent months, and one can argue that for purely presentationalpurposes it would be nice to avoid a further change in the target. I-39-11/18/80think there is a lot to be said for that view. The consideration onthe other side was described by Governor Partee: Is that beingrealistic. Is anybody here really proposing the strength of actionand the kind of interest rates that might be necessary in our bestjudgment to reach alternative C--certainly \"C\" but even \"B\"--whichimplies from now on [unintelligible]. Is it realistic to think [wecould achieve the target]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you could argue that. All I amsaying is that if we took the staff's median judgment and reflectedthe distillation of assembled wisdom, recognizing that there is a hugerange of uncertainty around it, I think one would have to say [itmeans]: Let's really bang it now. One could argue that that's a goodidea because it's going to save us a lot of problems in the future.On the other hand, a lot of concern was expressed that really bangingit now is just going to complicate our problem in the very short run.I think that kind of consideration would lead one in substance towardalternative A. If I take seriously what I think I am hearing incomments we have had about the interest rate range and the borrowingassumptions and all the rest--that people don't want to go out thereand really bang it--that leaves me in something of a dilemma because Ithink the Committee is in something of a dilemma. It doesn't excludethe possibility that we could hit the targets because we just don'tknow these relationships well enough. And there is the argument thatit's better not to change things and mislead anybody as to our realintentions. I am not sure, but I believe the Committee members aremostly between \"A\" and \"B.\" I haven't counted and I am not sure theyall said precisely [what their preference was]. But that pretty welldescribes the considerations. We are somewhat artificiallyconstrained because we are talking about a period that only has sixweeks more to run. If we were not right at the end of the year--if wehad looked at it from the perspective of the next four months insteadof the next six weeks--and were somewhat worried about how this looksin terms of the targets for the year, I don't know whether peoplewould say something like \"A\" is reasonable", "MR. WINN. But don't we have to consider the trajectoryeffect on 1981. To take the end of the year as the horizon withregard to where we want to be I think is the wrong [approach]", "\"MR. PARTEE. Well, $1.6 billion is right in between", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we have a conceptual difficultythere. I am sure that you are right, but sometimes those same peoplesaid we should not set out now to bang up the borrowing level and bangup interest rates. That's the inconsistency with which we aredealing. Verbally they may have said \"Don't tolerate an overshoot,\"but they didn't seem to be supporting the strength of action thatwould be needed to insure against an overshoot", "MR. GRAMLEY. Mr. Chairman, what would happen under thesespecifications if, in fact, we came out from now to the end of theyear with what I would consider to be a very fine performance of themonetary aggregates, i.e., no change in M-1A. If M-1A were completelyflat and let us suppose that in fact $1.5 billion in borrowing wereconsistent with the specs of \"B,\" then what we would end up doing Ithink--if I'm wrong, maybe Steve or Peter could enlighten me--would betaking actions deliberately to push interest rates up further. Andinstead of a federal funds rate of 15 percent we would end up with 17percent", "MR. AXILROD. Actually M-1A would come out at \"A.\" That is,the average for the week of the 5th and what we expect for the 12thcomes out to a level for M-1A of $387.9 billion, and that's theDecember level that's built into \"A.\" To achieve the specs of \"B\"would require a drop in M-1A from here on in", " Even though the change has occurred toward abroadening--MR. PARTEE. Sure, because I can't read M-1B with all thoseNOW accounts being created", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The trouble is, Larry, that they're bothwrong. You should average the two. It gives you a rougher \"rightanswer,\" as a matter of fact", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We are realistically looking at \"A\" now.That is the projection. Now, it's an extremely uncertain projection,and I don't attach a lot of weight to it, but the experts say that's-44-11/18/80where we are. The range of uncertainty around it is very wide. Thesense of what I have proposed, just distilling some of your comments,is that for visual reasons, which are not unimportant, we will stickwith \"B\" [for the ranges] and hope growth comes out at \"B,\" but actsomewhat like \"A\" at the moment. That leaves us with the question ofhow strongly we react if \"A\" gets confirmed or, worse yet, if growthgoes higher than the specifications of \"A.\" That's the sense of it ifwe adopt these specifications; and it's reflected in part in thefederal funds range. Obviously, we have to consult if we hit [thelimit on] that", "MR. WALLICH. You said earlier that we ought to think moreabout the deviations from the targets and the response to that thanabout the absolute targets, and I thought that very persuasive. So animportant ingredient of this decision seems to be where do we go withthe funds rate if [monetary growth] falls below or goes above. Now,one way of not capping but flooring the rate on the down side would beto set a rather high [level for the lower] limit, and I suggested 14percent. Another might be to say accept a shortfall in theaggregates. I am not quite sure what that implies in terms of thefunds rate, really", " It would come down some if we had a reallybig shortfall, but--MS. TEETERS. I strongly object to pegging that rate at 14percent. We have let it run up way above what we expected a monthago; and if you're going to play that game, Henry, you have to be ableto play it on the down side, too. A rate of 14 percent is justridiculous in this economy", "MR. PARTEE. That is, we would end up not adjusting thenonborrowed reserve path", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I think we're saying the opposite ofthat. We're very tolerant of an undershoot. What I am trying to pindown is how tolerant we are of an overshoot. I think the generalsentiment is that we're going to be less tolerant of an overshoot thanwe are of undershoots. But should we be tolerant at all of anovershoot is the question or do we react very quickly. My dilemma isthat if we're really not tolerant at all of an overshoot, we ought tobe whacking it right now, which is not what people said. So on howtolerant we are of an overshoot, I suppose what we're saying is thatwe'd be fairly tolerant right at the moment [up to the specificationsof] alternative A. If it got above alternative A, we'd beprogressively less tolerant", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Whether the funds rate gets over 17percent or not depends upon how tolerant we are", "MR. ROOS.

Ted Truman's paper wasuseful and interesting as far as it went. But what I was hoping tofind and didn't see--and I wanted some discussion around this table asa minimum if not a study paper--was something on the fundamentalpurposes of our intervention. In Ted's memo, on the top of page 2, hesets forth three types of reasons for intervening: The traditionalaim, prior to 1978, of heading off disorderly conditions characterizedby abrupt intra-day changes or wide spreads in bid and ask prices; abit more than that--countering disorder, characterized by so-called-12-12/18-19/80cumulative exchange rate changes that tend to feed on themselves; orthirdly, the disorder characterized by substantial exchange ratemovements that carry rates to levels that are judged to be unrealisticin light of fundamental economic factors. I gather, Tony, we havebeen more or less in that third mold since the crisis of November 1978and the $30 billion support package that was put together at thattime. I'm really skeptical about making judgments that are counter towhat the market is telling us. Who makes those judgments and on whatbasis. I guess I'm being a devil's advocate here. I think there's anawful temptation to substitute judgments for market forces. The keyquestion, since the dollar is in the very opposite position today fromwhat it was on November 1, 1978 when it was very [weak], is whetherthis very broad intervention, which in my view is at least semi-pegging within a range, is still justified. Is it necessary. Is itdoing something positive for the national interest. What are thecosts related to the benefits", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. John, on that I'd say first of allthat we simply lean against the wind and let the market pressures showup in terms of the direction. It's the magnitude of the [market] movethat we try to lean against in the short run. The record shows thatvery clearly in the last two years since November 1, 1978. Now, whenwe get to a situation where we have something like the November 1stcollapse, then of course we have to intervene massively. We have notdone that. There have been substantial dips in the dollar in thesetwo years during which we simply leaned against the direction. Thetraders themselves feel that there is a stabilizing influence if thecentral banks are in. It doesn't mean we have to be in every day.There have been many long periods of time when we haven't been in atall. It can reach a situation, though, where there is a very clearconsensus within the government, and even in the markets, that by Godthis [market move] just has gotten momentum and is out of control, andit's not reflecting the fundamental factors. That still leaves anextremely broad range in which we would, if they were very largemovements, simply lean against them. But we would let the movement goin the direction it's tending to go. It does not involve a conceptionof where the rates should be. It does involve a conception of how far[the markets should move] in either direction, when we begin to getinto an area of extreme undershooting or overshooting. But as I say,the only really massive intervention we did was in a short period oftime--a two-month period starting November 1st up to December of 1978--and then [the markets] turned around beginning in January. It isjust the facts of life. And the markets themselves like that kind ofstabilizing force because there is just too much at stake. Now, interms of more basic economic considerations, it is also true that ifthe dollar collapses too far, aside from any financial problems thatcan create, it really does feed inflation. If the dollar over-valuestoo far--again I'm talking not about making narrow judgments but verybroad judgments--it hurts our competitiveness and we end up with majorbalance of payments problems. So there is some kind of rough sense.Also, the markets really don't believe that central banks arecompletely indifferent to exchange rates over some broad area. Theythink we have a target.

I'm a little curious in view of the fact that M-1A isprobably the most volatile and least predictable aggregate in theshort run. Why do you use it as a predictive device", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Things overlap, obviously, but looking atthe year as a whole, give us some indication of what you conceive ofas the appropriate strategy of the Federal Reserve and what thatmeans. Let me put it specifically. If you accept the analysis of avery tight money supply figure or if you make a proposal of a moneysupply figure, I would be interested in knowing whether you arewilling to accept the consequences or see as a consequence of thatextremely high interest rates, perhaps higher than we have now. Doyou not mind if we have a recession, all things considered, if that'sthe price we have to pay. Is that what you're talking about or not", "MR. WALLICH. Excuse me, Bob. I don't understand the conceptunderlying the midpoint base. That's not really the route on whichwe'd be going. You'd have the aggregates expanding rather fast from alevel at which they are not. So they would not actually, with respectto the future, expand that fast", "MR. BLACK. Yes, I really do. I think that's the main reasonrates are high. But that's certainly a debatable point. In any case,I would recommend that we stick with the ranges we decided on before.And I've shown that in the form of cones on the last two charts. Thatbrings down the effective [growth] rate by 1/2 or 1 percentage point.I think it would be unwise to widen the range as Steve suggested--although I know exactly why he suggested it--because our critics wouldsay we were trying to obfuscate or that we really didn't have anytargets in mind. And, of course, we do have targets in mind, but wedon't know exactly what the figures are; I realize that. I'msympathetic with that and also with what Steve perceives as a greatdeal of difficulty in explaining this NOW account effect to the publicor even to those of us in this room. I find myself getting confusedevery time I go around on it. So when we announce the targets wedecide on, [I would] express them in terms of effective rates as thestaff is advocating and as Frank advocated. I would differ a littlefrom Frank in that I'd put out a statement at the time saying that itlooks to us as if the actual figures for M-1B might run, say, 2percentage points higher. And if [the adjustments turn out] asexpected, then the ranges we are setting for M-1B really ought to betilted up about 2 percentage points or whatever the incoming evidencesuggests. And similarly, in the case of M-1A we would suggest thatthe rates might come in around 4 percentage points [lower]. If wedon't say something like that, the people who are trying to track whatwe are doing on a week-to-week basis--and I'm talking aboutprofessionals here to a large extent--are going to see incomingfigures that are affected to whatever extent they will be by the NOWaccounts", "-35-12/18-19/80MR. BLACK. I understand that. But I'd favor being a littlemore open than you suggested, although when we are so confused herethere's certainly some argument for perhaps not being that open. ButI do think the data will be misinterpreted unless we at least makesome mention of that, as we've always done. Mr Chairman, when youtestified on this, you said that we would have to adjust these data.And I believe we ought to say it even a little more strongly than wehave in the past. People are going to be tracking them and thefigures are not going to look like our targets--even assuming we getperfect success--unless we have told them something about how thetargets have to be adjusted. It's going to be confusing as the devil.I'm under no illusions that it will be simple, but I just don't seeany alternative to doing that sort of thing", " Based on some work we have beendoing--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How do you conclude that", " I'm not sure that we couldn't ask forinformation from a sample of banks, for example--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We will ask. According to the ones we'vetalked to, the most they can tell us, if they tell us accurately, isthat they understand they have a frequency distribution ranging from10 percent to 90 percent out of transactions balances, which makes mea little suspicious about what data we are getting. The most they cantell us is where the check came from to establish the account. Thatdoesn't tell us what the ultimate substitution is. It may give us aclue, but I am very suspicious when those results come in over such awide range as they do. As I understand it, they have made an estimateof 2/3rds from the sample of banks that literally ranged from 10percent to 90 percent in one direction or another; the arithmeticaverage came out to around 2/3rds on the initial deposit. But that isnot a statistic which fills me with enormous confidence", "MS. TEETERS. Isn't there another [option] that will reduce[the uncertainty]. If we took as our target M-1B plus savings, thatwould cover most of the sources we think the funds are coming from.It would be a new concept in some ways, but it's also the one behindwhich we put reserves", "-42-12/18-19/80MR. WALLICH. I think we should make every effort to avoid areplay of 1980, with a sharp drop in interest rates which misleadseverybody as to what our policy is, and then probably a replay of whathappened this fall. I don't think there is a way of formingmeaningful expectations in that environment because if we have aweakening of the economy in the first quarter or first half, as Iwould expect, then the aggregates will slow and interest rates willcome down. And a few hundred monetarists in some sectors of the presswill say that we are tightening terribly, but the other 220 millionpeople will perceive this as an easing because they can get creditagain at lower rates and they will say the Fed has given up. So Ithink we have to let the facts speak rather than bank on generatingexpectations. I would say, therefore, that we should undershoot ourtargets, whatever targets we set, if necessary; to do otherwise wouldmean to force in reserves and to push down interest rates sharply.That doesn't mean we shouldn't have some decline in interest rates,just not anything like what we had in 1980. That would also have abeneficial effect as far as the dollar is concerned. The dollarwouldn't make that down-trip to the extent it did and that, in turn,would have some beneficial result with respect to inflation, althoughI think the gains for inflation from a high dollar are not all thatstrong. The reason is that the price of oil is fixed in dollars,unfortunately, and [the value of] the rest of our imports isn't verylarge. I think we should look very closely at interest rates and usethem to monitor the meaning of the aggregates. I have a suspicionthat the way we are doing things now we are getting in our own way bygenerating a cyclical movement in interest rates and monetaryaggregates--so-called instrument instability. And the level ofinterest rates is one way of judging what it is we are really doing--provided, of course, that we look at real interest rates.As to the strategies to follow, I would lean toward 1 or 4.Those are the tight strategies. I'm aware that these are going to bevery different from what the Administration is going to present, boththe current Administration and also very likely the next one. Andthey are very different from what the market thinks about 1981. So wemay have a problem reconciling that in our Humphrey-Hawkinspresentation with what the Administration is proposing, which issomething we have to do under the Humphrey-Hawkins rules.As for the techniques, [accepting] base drift versus startingat the midpoint, I have a sense that we are not likely to get the fullshift in demand that is implied in our projections. We may get some.We may get all, but if we don't, these targets are going to beextraordinarily tight because they are predicated on getting the full3 percentage point shift. Now, tolerating a bit of base drift heremay be an antidote. Otherwise, if we don't get the shift, thestraightforward thing to do--if it weren't so devastating in terms ofexpectations--would be to raise all of our aggregates by a couple ofpercentage points or whatever the shift implies for M-1A and M-1B. Iwould hate to do that. We have here a means of equivocating a little.If we do move from the old base, the last quarter '79 base, it meansthat the present targets would involve slightly higher rates ofgrowth, but not as sharply higher as those in Bob Black's first chart.For instance, M-1A of 3 to 5-1/2 percent would become under thatcalculation 4.3 to 5-1/2 percent; and M-1B instead of 3-1/2 to 6percent would become 5.5 to 6.8 percent. These, I think, arereasonable to tolerate. If we do raise the M2 target, however, then I-43-12/18-19/80would say we don't have that much leeway to tolerate past overshootsand perhaps then we'd better go back to the old base and try to growfrom the midpoint as Bob Black's charts suggest.Again, I think we have to put more weight on interest ratesthan on the aggregates. My preferred aggregate is still M-1B; itconceptually makes the most sense. But it will be looking pretty badand its interpretation will be enormously difficult. I think weshould simultaneously state M-1A as a compromise, but neither inspiresany reliability. M2 inspires little reliability. I've never feltthat was a very good indicator. Bank credit isn't going to be a goodindicator because the share of bank credit in total credit is going tofall drastically, according to the flow of funds analysis, fromsomething like 40 percent of total funds raised to something like 20percent of total funds raised. This has to do with the bunching ofcredit recently at banks as a result of a drop in bond issues and adrop in the use of commercial paper. So bank credit, too, may not bea good indicator. One is left with the idea that we need positivereal interest rates; that idea is gaining ground internationally and Ithink we ought to move in that direction. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "MR. FORD. Excuse me, Paul. May I ask one clarificationquestion. Did you say that you would or would not allow the basedrift. It sounded to me as if you said on M-1A and M-1B you wouldallow base drift and on M2 you wouldn't", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make some generalremarks first about the economy and then about long-run strategy.With respect to the economy, it's clear that economic activity isstill lively. That is indicated by the most recent data we've seen onindustrial production, capacity utilization, employment, retail sales,the average workweek, and GNP. We're in a quarter where we expect GNPto increase at a rate in excess of 4 percent. We have seen the latestdata, of course, and they obviously add up to strength, with housingstarts holding up and real disposable income not slipping very much.The major areas where we see weakness are in business capital outlaysand nonresidential construction. Despite this strength in theeconomy, it's difficult to see how this expansion can continue muchlonger in the face of interest rates as high as we are experiencingcurrently. Consumer demand, which has provided the main support tothis expansion, seems unlikely to hold up as inflation continues toplace strains on household budgets. And it's hard to see howhouseholds can continue to increase real spending as real disposableincome slips, particularly at a time when the saving rate is alreadylow. Therefore, I'm inclined to accept the staff forecast as the mostprobable outcome.However, I do have two concerns. The first is that thesaving rate, while low, may go lower as consumers try to maintaintheir living standards. That, of course, would impart continuingstrength to the economy and that strength could possibly continuefurther into 1981 than we currently anticipate. Now, if we have-45-12/18-19/80underestimated the consumers' tenacity, that would suggest thatinflation may become worse and interest rates may have to go higher.And ultimately, we may have in reaction to this a sharper decelerationthan we would like to see. The other concern is that the currentmonetary restraint and the current high interest rates, particularlyif continued longer as I'm sure they will be, may generate unbearablestrains in the business sector. If that continues and becomes severe,rather than a moderate drop in economic activity in the first half of1981 as projected by the staff, we may well see a very sharp declinethat becomes cumulative. And we could find ourselves in or headedtoward a severe recession. And, of course, if that happens, we willsee the kind of thing that Henry fears a great deal: We'll seeinterest rates fall sharply and will probably find ourselves insomething of a replay of 1980.Given all this, I think the best we can hope for is anoutcome that closely approximates the staff's scenario. And I think apolicy should be established which would maximize the likelihood thatwe will get only a moderate contraction or moderate slowdown in 1981.If we adopt a more restrictive policy than is being currently pursued,I think we'll insure that we will get a sharp contraction, which willresult in the downturn and the sharply lower interest rates that we'reconcerned about.With respect to the question of whether we should adjust ourgrowth targets downward from the ranges set in July or from the growthactually experienced in 1980, I think we should move in the latterdirection. We have been through a year when monetary growthcontracted sharply, even declined absolutely, and remained sluggishfor a while and then we've seen explosive growth in money, with growthrising above the upper limits of the targets that were established.Clearly, we don't know as much about money demand as we need to, andthat's an understatement. So it would seem to me a mistake to startwith targets that we already know to be unrealistic and to a degreemis-specified. So I would start with the actual results that we willhave seen in 1980 and shave off [some] from that rate of growth. Iwould like to see actual growth targets that have an upper limitsomewhere around the actual growth rates we experienced from thefourth quarter of '79 to the fourth quarter of '80 and, as I said, Iwould shave off from there toward a desirable midpoint. This wouldbring us somewhere in the vicinity of strategy II. It seems to methat following the strategy I that is suggested in the Bluebook wouldbe much too constraining for the economy. If we are to believe thenumbers, we would be buying some possible credibility with the hope ofinfluencing expectations, with a large sacrifice in real GNP in 1981--nearly a 1 percent decline in GNP--and with no effect on the projectedinflation rates. If we take strategy II, which seems more desirableto me, we get only a 0.2 percent higher inflation rate in [1982] and0.4 percent more in [1983]; and output is 0.4 percent higher by 1983.So I would be more comfortable with strategy II as a means ofachieving a moderate contraction in early or mid-1981 rather thanrisking a more severe recession later on with all the attendantinstability in interest rates", "MR. GRAMLEY. For M-1B the same exercise would give us arange of 4-1/2 to 9 percent. I think ranges like that are ridiculous.And I think the public would so regard them. Yet if we put out thekind of ranges we have been putting out in the past couple years,there is almost no hope of hitting them. So if we are going tocontinue to play the game of monetary targetry for 1981, we have tofind a monetary aggregate that is not going to be moved around so muchby shifts in ATS and NOW accounts. Now, I see some thinking going inthe other direction in the comments of Governor Wallich, PresidentGuffey, and President Corrigan; and if the whole Committee wants to goin that direction, I would certainly strongly support it. But if wewant to stay with monetary targeting, I think the way to go is witheither M2 or Governor Teeters' suggestion of M-1B plus savingsdeposits. And if you don't like the fact that savings deposits havebeen very volatile, then what you could do to counterbalance thatwould be to add all small time deposits. Then the aggregate would beM-1B plus savings deposits plus small time deposits. The logic therewould be that this year when we have seen very steep declines insavings deposits, we have seen accelerated growth in small timedeposits. And, conversely, when saving deposits have picked up,growth of small time has ceased", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why. I guess I would ask, if you go thatfar, why would you leave those out", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you mean by that. We shouldn'tpermit speculative loans", "MR. PARTEE. I was trying to think of a counterpart, Fred,for the United States. Pubs aren't so important here. And I decidedthat it was professional sports. So maybe we'll be in the sameposition the British are when professional sports teams go out ofbusiness. I say that not too lightly because I think it is an areawhere people get a sense of inflation in excess with the multi-milliondollar contracts.As far as I'm concerned, we really ought not to plan a policythat produces less than zero growth. I really don't want to followthe British [model] over a period of time. And zero growth, I'mafraid, is probably associated with a pretty fair sized expansion in-53-12/18-19/80the monetary aggregates. We have this cosmetic, psychological problemwith the aggregates, and I don't know how we can get out of the box.I fully agree with Lyle that there is a great deal of uncertainty hereand to have an equivalent range now means we have to go from -4 to +4percent or something like that. And as a matter of fact, I agree withBill that there is going to be a very big competitive situation in themarket for NOW accounts and that we might well miss on the other side.In thinking about all that, first, I wouldn't want to make upfor the overshoots in the aggregates. If we have to state thisproperly, perhaps the way Emmett has done it is the right way: Tostate that last year the aggregates were a little strong in realterms, abstracting from this NOW account problem, and we certainlywouldn't want them to be any stronger than that; we would like to seea lower rate. That would be one reasonable way of addressing thatproblem. Or, we could--after all there's no particular importance tothe midpoint of the ranges--extend the ranges. We are not so farabove the top end of the ranges and we could say that we have been atthe top end of the ranges and, therefore, to the extent we can get[monetary growth] down to fall more within the ranges, we would dothat. That's a possibility, too, Paul; that might be looked at.This is a preliminary discussion, so I would suggest that asthe staff focuses on this over the next month they take a careful lookat total reserves. I believe there may be some averaging advantage intotal reserves. After all, a good many of these NOW accounts aregoing to come from passbook savings, which has a 3 percent reserverequirement. They are going to go into a 12 percent reserverequirement. But some amounts are going to be coming out of demanddeposits where the effective requirement has been higher than 12percent, I think. In any event, somebody ought to take a look to seewhether the possible range of variation would be somewhat narrower byusing growth rates on total reserves as an approximate target forpolicy. It also associates well with what we say our operatingprocedure is, so it has that advantage. The disadvantage is that itdoesn't mean a damn thing to anybody except those 200 economists thatHenry mentioned. We ought to have a real market implication somehowthat comes from this, assuming that we can't do anything more thanspeak in rather subjective terms about the traditional monetaryaggregates. I'm wondering whether we ought to take another look atwhat we could postulate in terms of a financial number that we wouldlook at in judging the reserve growth along our target path, andwhether it could be credit. Bank credit happens to have been withinthe range during 1980. And maybe bank credit expanded to include theother institutions, so-called institutional credit, is a variable forwhich we could give a quantitative notion of what we think would beappropriate and related to our objectives", "MS. TEETERS. Frankly, I don't find any of these strategiesacceptable. We're not getting any decrease in inflation and any oneof them leads to at least a 1 percent increase in unemployment nextyear. And we still have a fairly rapidly growing labor force, withlots of young people and minorities and so forth that won't beaccommodated in that situation. I happen to agree with Chuck: Wereally are choosing how bad we are going to make the economy ratherthan anything that is positive at this point. However, I am alsoimpressed by the 15 percent projected CPI for the first quarter; Iworry about that because last year CPI numbers in that range causedpanic, and rather severe panic, and led finally to putting inemergency credit controls. Given those considerations, I think wehave to choose between a variety of unsatisfactory alternatives. Idon't think we can achieve either alternative I or IV if we're worriedabout our credibility. With the inflationary forces that are loose inthis economy, it is going to be impossible to [achieve] those targets.We might have a chance of achieving strategy II or III; besides, theyare certainly the least damaging in terms of employment and output andwe don't lose anything basically on the inflation rate. So I wouldopt to stay as near as we can [to those].Maybe the best way to handle the public relations problem interms of M-1A and M-1B is simply to extend the current ranges and usethe [explanation] that we're above them and are coming back into them.However, I would lobby strongly for the idea of at least lookingcarefully at M-1B plus savings. If savings are too volatile and ifwhat Jerry worries about happens, savings are all going to move intoM-1B. Then whatever volatility is left will just move into M-1B. Sothat doesn't seem to be a reason for not using that particular[aggregate] at this time. We should at least find something that wecan work on. I would also point out to you that this projectionprobably contains as much as any of us knows about theAdministration's program. It has the $35 billion tax cut; it has whatI think is our own good judgment that they won't get the nondefense[cuts]; and we still get a zero rate of [economic] growth. So I doubtwe are going to get very much stimulus out of the Administration,certainly not over and above this [tax cut].As far as base drift is concerned, I think that's asking toomuch. If we take [off] from the midpoint of the old ranges and try tobring the new ones down from that, that is a restriction on the rateof growth of money supply that we'd never be able to accomplish giventhe way things are going now. And I urge you to be very careful. Wecould create a very, very severe problem at the rates of interest wenow have. Obviously, people are hurting and it's not just [affecting]-55-12/18-19/80automobiles and housing. People can't make decisions with rates thishigh. And I would caution that we should decide how far we're goingto let rates drop, depending on what develops, rather than have somepreconceived idea that they should be kept at a certain levelthroughout the year", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't think we do any service tothe country let alone ourselves if we present long-run targets thatare almost impossible to explain with these screwy numbers, no matterhow much fine print and explanation we give. I feel we would beperfectly justified and would get a reasonable reception if we saidthat we have a year of transition ahead in which there are going to bemajor and unpredictable shifts in NOW and ATS accounts and, therefore,during the year ahead we'll be targeting a broader monetary aggregate.Then we would publish once a month the results of our broaderaggregates. Of course, the components that make up M-1A and M-1B arestill in those published numbers, but we don't have to publish them assuch. People can reconstitute them but there would be a difference inpress treatment. We've examined pretty carefully whether there aresubstitute targets. We looked even at the monetary base; we looked attotal reserves. I, at least, came to the conclusion that thosealternatives were worse than simply targeting a broader aggregate inthis year of transition. I feel also, as Lyle Gramley does, that wedidn't help inflation any by letting interest rates go to suchextremes as we did this year. It doesn't help to go to 20 percent forone or two months and then down to 10 percent for a couple of months.I think we have to pay much more attention to real interest rates andfactor that more into our policy decisions. I also agree with quite afew people that we have to accept the base drift--that the targets fornext year would be incredibly restrictive if we started the new rangefrom the the midpoint [of the 1980 range]", "MR. MAYO. Mr. Chairman, Messrs. Schultz and Corrigan gavequite a bit of my speech, so I can shorten it up. But I must joinvery strongly with what Jerry had to say [about our performance], andmaybe even more strongly than he said it. If our record in meetingthe targets for 1980 is the temperature gauge one is going to use forour success or failure, I think we got a B in the course. The reasonwe didn't get an A is the volatility; I feel very sensitive about thatand agree with what has been said here. But if you look at themonetary aggregates--adjusted for OCDs as I guess we call them now,Steve--we are within 10 percent of our ranges on all four of the Ms.If we got so statistically crazy as to average all of our targetresults with some sort of weighting, we could prove that we werewithin the targets for 1980.-57-12/18-19/80SPEAKER(.). I'd like to see that", "MR. MAYO. You know how statisticians are. Anyway, even ifone acknowledges that we are outside of our ranges, we are lessoutside of our ranges than are I believe most, if not all, of thecountries in the western world that have set up monetary targets. Allthe chips aren't in for this year, but I think that's a fair statementif not a completely accurate statement. Having said that, I agreewith Jerry's point that there are too many apologists around,including I suppose most of us on some occasions when we feel on thedefensive and spend more time pointing out why we didn't do this anddidn't do that and what went wrong than we do explaining the positiveside of this. We didn't have a failing record for 1980 by any stretchof the imagination.Point two is that I share Fred Schultz's question mark aboutthe extent to which we are going to get real relief from our \"onlygame in town\" syndrome during calendar year 1981, despite the sincereand I think conscientious intentions of a new Administration, whichstill hasn't gotten its act together. I hope it will get its acttogether. We have to do something in terms of a coordinated policybut until they put out their statements in January, there isn't muchmore we can do other than what we are doing today, repeating [thatdesire for a coordinated policy] in discussing the background for ourproblem in February. There is uncertainty in both directions fromprecipitous action by the new Administration, one of which is beingconsidered seriously and obviously has congressional support. Theother is whether they are going to jump in too fast and jeopardize theentire program or whether they will take a more reasoned approach,with all of the adequate staff work that requires, and meld these twothings. We won't know for some time yet.As for the outlook, I think we will have a recession, thoughnot as steep as in the second quarter of 1980, but I fear a littlemore during the first half of 1981 than is implicit in the Greenbook.That may make our [success] in controlling the aggregates seem alittle better, but [that could provide] a false sense of security. Ihope we handle it a bit better despite what I said about the basicadequacy of our record. We have to keep our eye on the ball and digin.I also don't think there is any alternative whatsoever to theconfusing technicalities we--and even more the Chairman--have toexplain on Capitol Hill and to the public next year. There is no potat the end of the rainbow. Even to Nancy's suggestion, of which I amsomewhat enamored, or the suggestion that we go back to reserves orthat we average M-1A and M-1B, or come out with some new M I sayforget it. In terms of our public stance and keeping our eyes on theball within this group there is no simple answer. It's like putting aquestionnaire around this table and asking \"If you had only one thingto eat in the next six months, and could have plenty of it, what foodwould you choose.\" Would it be peas or beef or milk or what.Everybody would say that's a ridiculous questionnaire. Everybodyknows it is necessary to have some balance in one's diet and thatone's excitement over a given type of food is relative to somethingelse. We're trying to get the ideal M and there isn't any ideal M.So let's realize that and, as the British say, just muddle through onwhat we can do. That means a lot of technical confusion and a lot of-58-12/18-19/80public relations confusion. I see no alternative to that. Any way wedo it, it's going to affect at least our statistical credibility,which I think is a little different from our economic credibility.Let's keep those two things in mind.I certainly would not go to the proposal in Bob Black'scharts. That would not only give us great problems in 1981, but is avery dangerous precedent. If that precedent is one we like, let'smake up all of our overshoots for 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1978 while weare at it, which to me would be a reductio ad absurdum. Let's faceit, we have a confessional at the end of the year in this church andwe are going to start a new year. Let's observe it that way. We havejustified or will be justifying what happened in 1980. Let's go onwith 1981 and not try to make it up. I must say that when push comesto shove, as they say, strategy I is okay with me. It maintains apublic position which is quite acceptable; perhaps in some ways it's acowardly \"don't rock the boat\" approach, but I still believe in it.The differences among the strategies in 1981 and their economiceffects [are minor]; the differences are all within the margin oferror in my book. So let's not take those differences too seriouslyas we try to aim for a simplistic approach as to what [the outcome]might be by 1983. I suppose I should stop there. But I also have aeuphoric goal in that I'd like to see us get rid of the blankety-blankweekly figures; given the state of the world, I guess that's still animpossible goal", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Baughman, you have the honor, givenyour status of attending your last meeting, of being the next to thelast commentator. I have to reserve the right to comment last formyself", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me say one thing. This market hasbeen affected yesterday and today by rumors about the money supplyfigures. One rumor involved whether the figures were affected by thischange and/or reserve saving games a couple of months ago, which isthe thing that worried me. But we haven't been able to identify it inany significant way and we are not making any revisions on thataccord. [Another rumor is] that there may be a decline in the moneysupply figure this week. I'm very much disturbed that it sounds as ifthere has been some kind of leak. That is just poison in terms of ourwhole posture in these markets and our credibility as an institution,and I am very much disturbed by it. The fact is that we are not goingto make changes but we were intending at least to point out that thereserve figures in November were affected by the changes in thatreserve game. Perhaps it would have been unusual, but maybe we shouldhave made an announcement [earlier] to market people, who haveinquired, that that did have an impact on the reserve figures duringNovember. That itself could have gotten confused with the moneysupply figures earlier. But as for the rumor suddenly appearing abouta decline in the money supply this week, which hasn't been announcedyet, I don't know where it came from. It may have come from no place,but on top of these other developments it looks like a coincidencethat I would be happier not to see. I don't know what else I can say", "MR. BLACK.

Well, the wording of that sentence isdifficult. This is a little different than the way I had it written,but that proved incomprehensible to Mr. Axilrod. I think my way had alittle less sense that we were expecting [a shortfall]. It was mainlythat [a shortfall would be acceptable] if it proved consistent orsomething like that, though I recognize that's obscure. Just howthat's written is a point of difficulty, I think", "MR.

I think the last sentence, with the expression ofa narrower fed funds range, could be terribly disturbing to some whomight view it as a signal that indeed we are moving toward greateremphasis even in the short run on targeting on interest rates. If wenarrow the range and set the upper limit at 20 percent--and we areover that now--with a lower limit of 16 percent, I think, that willwave a red flag to those who are suspicious of a possible tendency tomove back to our old procedures", "MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, as a point of information, theCommittee at its last meeting established a range of 13 to 17 percent.It was subsequently widened in a special meeting to 13 to 18 percent", "MR. MORRIS. I have a problem with this, Paul, because Ithink we have been in a corn-hog type cycle in monetary policy. Ithas produced the volatility of rates in monetary growth that we haveseen and that we're all disturbed about. Now, some of it isinevitable from the fact that we are trying to impose a strictmonetary guideline on an economy with a very high inflation rate. So,I don't think we can eliminate these cycles, but I think we can dampenthem. But to dampen them we need to act before we get clear evidencethat the economy is accelerating or decelerating. It seems to me theproblems of 1980 were: 1) that we clung to a very tight policy toolong; and 2) that we waited this summer and fall until it was veryclear that the economy was accelerating before we started moving veryvigorously against it. It seems to me we are in a situation now wherewe're beginning to get some evidence that the economy is about to noseover [into recession]. It's showing up in the money supply, in a jumpin initial claims and unemployment compensation, and in projected cut-backs in auto production. We know housing is going down now, eventhough it hasn't shown up yet in starts. If we want to get out ofthis severe corn-hog cycle, we've got to act on the basis of what thedata tell us right now. I would buy this if the fed funds range were14 to 18 percent. In other words, I think we have to move now onrates. If we don't, we will be back in the corn-hog cycle we were induring 1980, it seems to me", " I don't know how long it would takePeter to move on this, but it could well be a month or two if we havethe--MR. SCHULTZ. What would you want the Manager to do. Youwant him to get that funds rate down to 18 percent now", " If we get that rate down to 18 percent now andpublish that increase next week, God only knows what is going to--MR. MORRIS. No, I disagree. The action in the marketplace[suggests that] the market is anticipating that we are going to dosomething like this because they apparently think it's sensible", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, as I said, that M2 number may notbe. There's a presentational problem. If we put in a higher M2number in the short run, which is consistent with the projection forwhatever that's worth, it also raises a question to the reader of thisa month from now--the way it's constructed--about what we're doingwith the annual ranges. So I don't know what to do with that number;it's a bit of a problem", "MR. MORRIS. Could we ask the Manager, Mr. Chairman, how hewould interpret this directive. Maybe that would help Lyle and Larry", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the question you have to decide.This is simply designed to reflect the feeling--which I share to asubstantial degree--that we wouldn't like to see the funds rate go upa lot more in view of this hog-corn cycle. But I'm also reflectingthe feeling that a lot of people wouldn't like to see it plunge tooprecipitously if things get a little weak for a while. I don't knowhow to express that in the directive other than here, if it is thefeeling that we want it in the directive. We can presentationally sayone thing in the directive and have an understanding that it's alittle different than that in practice", "MR. AXILROD. Well, on that there is a divergence of opinionon the staff. My view, which has proved wrong this week, is that alevel of $1-1/2 billion of borrowing is probably consistent over timewith a lower level of the funds rate than we have had", "MR. CORRIGAN. I can live with a 16 to 20 percent range, butthe real question then becomes under what conditions you would feelcompelled to adjust the nonborrowed path if things worked in thedirection that we are talking about now and the edge came off thefunds rate for whatever reasons--borrowing got at or below thisfrictional level--even in the framework of six weeks. The realquestion is: What would be the attitude toward adjusting that path", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I tried to bring that to yourattention recently. And that's precisely [the reason for] myrestiveness about sitting there and putting down some money supplyfigure that we have no control over in the short run. It's not a verysatisfactory policy decision. The question comes to: What do we doabout it. And I think the question that this conversation is posingright now--and there may be differences of views and one way ofputting it is that it's related to the borrowing decision--is this:-76-12/18-19/80Are you willing to see the federal funds rate stay around or movehigher than 20 percent on the one end and are you willing to see itstay around or go lower than 16 percent on the other end. We have toget some consensus on that point, and people's views may differ", "MR. GRAMLEY. But that's my whole point", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't disagree with you [but] weought to discuss what we are talking about for the annual range. Ifyou want to say that this time, we've got to put in a higher numberfor M2, I suspect, if we give any weight at all to the staff forecast.It's on page 13, Lyle", "MR. PARTEE. This says reserves along a path consistent withgrowth of 4-1/4 percent in M-1A and 4-3/4 percent in M-1B. I thinkthat does allow some room for the kind of thing you are talking about;that is a bigger M-1B number because the M-1A number will be smaller.As far as reserves are concerned, it allows us some room. I justdon't think we are prepared to decide what these numbers ought to befor the range of aggregates today. We've just had a long, longdiscussion of it and we are all over the lot", " Yes, there is still some [lag]; this will be outin the market for--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the substantive issues--and they aresubstantive--revolve around the borrowing assumption and theimplications of that for the federal funds rate. And that's what wecan't duck. Before we get to that, I don't know what people thinkabout these [monetary growth] numbers. Somebody may think thesenumbers are too high and we should in fact aim for a significantlylower level--not just accept a shortfall but express it as anobjective. If we do that, it substantially increases the probability,or the possibility anyway, of having to force a higher federal fundsrate", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We don't know", "MR. WALLICH. It's too high to me", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. I'll ask another question [later]about the M2 figure. I'm talking about citing a figure which as apoint of departure is the midpoint of these tentative ranges andimplies that that is an acceptable number but shortfalls will beaccepted. We won't be happy about overshoots. How many members ofthe Committee find that a desirable way to go about it. That's not somany", "MR. PARTEE. We either have to depart from that base or giveup M2 and not state [a number for] it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It would go down if the incoming moneysupply figures are below the present estimates", "MR. SCHULTZ. I can accept 15 but I prefer 16 because I'dlike to see us talk about it if the rate gets down to 16 percent", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I can obviously go either way, but itseems to me that 16 percent has some advantage. Well, it's not goingto be published for a long time anyway, so maybe it doesn't make muchdifference. But there is some disadvantage in saying that theCommittee in the middle of December, when everything was still on thehigh side, was rather anxiously looking for a great big decline ininterest rates. I think there is some credibility problem in thatdirection, too", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The pattern is very clear if anybody--people who are so suspicious of us all the time--ever looked at it.This range has never bound that hard", "MR. PARTEE. We don't say how many days. It could be 30days", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's say \"a period of time\"--I willinterpret that as a series of days--and change the 16 percent to 15percent. We are reversing the language to conform with the way it wasbefore", "MR. ALTMANN. Hold a minute. Let's see whether we have anyobjections to [publishing the 1975 Memoranda of Discussion]"]}
