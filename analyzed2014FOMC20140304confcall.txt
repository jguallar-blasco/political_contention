Passage number 1.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It is a pleasure to be serving in the first meeting in your official capacity. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing gratitude and the response is a simple acknowledgment of that gratitude.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 2.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  My hope is that the forward guidance language we choose does the following.  First, as in the memo on the different options for forward guidance, I believe the language should have a neutral effect on expectations.  Expectations seem appropriately aligned with the Committee’s thinking at this time.  Given the weakness in incoming data, I would certainly not want the language to tighten financial conditions. Second, given the market focus on calendar dates, the language needs to avoid adding to uncertainty around the implications for our current thinking on the likely liftoff date.  This is achieved by the statement that the current target range for the federal funds rate will be maintained “for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.” It is tied to our actions—namely, the tapering program.  Since the tapering program can be slowed down or sped up, it has flexibility.  However, the modal interpretation of this language will be that liftoff would likely occur in the latter half of 2015.Third, the language should be as simple as possible.  The difference between purchases and liftoff and between triggers and thresholds has been surprisingly difficult to communicate, as witnessed both by the rise in short-term rates that followed the announcement of possible tapering in the middle of last year and by the confusion that persists around the 6½ percent threshold. In my view, the option that gets closest to these objectives is option 2.  It is designed to have a neutral effect on expectations, provides clarity on likely liftoff, and has a relatively simple construction.  However, I think it should be simplified further. For option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the first area highlighted in blue with “the Committee will consider the projected pace at which labor markets are normalizing and the projected pace at which inflation returns to the Committee’s longer-run goal of 2 percent.  In assessing the improvement in labor market conditions, the Committee will consider a broad range of indicators.”  The concept of normalizing seems more consistent with the concept of the long-run unemployment forecast provided in the SEP, although normalizing would incorporate more than just the unemployment rate. For option 2, paragraph 5, I would substitute the second area highlighted in blue with “at least as long as labor market conditions are in the process of normalizing, inflation projected between one and two years ahead does not significantly exceed 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.”  This refers back to returning to normalized labor markets.  It also replaces language that sounds like an inflation ceiling, “does not exceed 2 percent,” with “does not significantly exceed 2 percent.” In terms of the other questions, I would not include language on financial developments at this time.  I do not believe we have clarity or consensus on this issue yet, and we probably   need to have much more discussion on that topic. I am comfortable with paragraph 6 in options 1 through 3, and I would highlight one concern, which is that some of the SEP submissions may not be consistent with the guidance we are providing.  This is likely to provide less clarity than desirable, and it highlights more work that needs to be done on the SEP.  Ideally, how we report the SEP should be as consistent as possible with any guidance provided in the statement.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Rosengren.  President Lockhart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the following passage. In paragraph 5, President Rosengren suggests making changes to the language in option 2, specifically in the areas highlighted in blue. He believes that the language should be simplified further and that the concept of normalizing labor markets should be incorporated. This suggests that he disagrees with the current wording and believes it should be changed.


Passage number 3.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I would like to comment on broad communications tactics as regards forward guidance as well as the substance of the statement.  I will respond to some of the questions as I proceed. First, I would caution against going too far in reliance on the statement alone as our tool to transmit guidance.  A point I’ve made before in Committee meetings is that the Committee is designed to arrive at a common decision, not necessarily a uniformly held rationale for decisions.  So I prefer an approach to crafting the statement that treats it as a vehicle for communicating a framework, or a general statement, for our determination of the path of policy. I see the statement as a device for implementing forward guidance as having a tactical role within a set of communications alternatives, each with its own array of possible tactical uses.  These other communications devices are the Chair’s press conference, the SEPs, the minutes, the Chair’s speeches and testimony, our collective speaking opportunities, and, maybe, other devices to be developed.  The use of these alternative communications vehicles can convey more information, appropriately qualified details, and general color or can draw attention to quantification in the SEP of elements of the statement.  Proper governance, however, is a legitimate concern.  The principle of Committee ratification of the content of formal communications requires, it seems to me, a disciplined process around use of some of the alternative communications devices. As we move ahead to refine our communications strategy, I’d like to see us wrestle in good time with how to do all of this and deal with communications as a package. I can envision a checklist of sorts for composing and updating a statement to convey a framework for policy decisions.  It might include elements such as an assessment of progress toward qualitative goals, a projection of progress over a time horizon, a reference to a broad set of indicators, and critical considerations in setting or changing policies. Of the five options presented, option 5 comes closest to what I have in mind.  I think it adequately covers the financial developments consideration, and if we view financial stability as a distinct consideration, I would not be averse to language like that in option 4 on financial stability per se. A statement that serves to communicate a framework would almost of necessity rely on qualitative measures of economic conditionality.  Reliance in the statement on qualitative measures allows, in my mind, for interpretation elsewhere, particularly in press conferences. I would, therefore, drop the use of thresholds, targets, or triggers.  I do not favor linking the timing of the first increase of the federal funds rate to the asset purchase program.  I view the wind-down as likely to continue on the current track unless the economy deteriorates markedly.  This makes the terminal point of asset purchases fairly predictable.  Linking liftoff to the end of the asset purchase program introduces a date feature that I believe the Committee is trying to avoid. I also do not favor introducing an inflation floor, at least not at this time.  And I do not think it’s necessary yet to introduce additional guidance on the path of the policy rate post-liftoff.   The conditions for liftoff are still down the road, and I would prefer to assess and communicate our exit strategy with a clearer view of what conditions are likely to be at that time.  I see potential for misinterpretation of how near the liftoff date might be, so I would hold fire on additional post-liftoff guidance at this time.  However, I do not particularly object to the existing post-liftoff language.  Those are my comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Lockhart.  President Fisher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 4.
 MR. FISHER.  Well, first, Madam Chair, congratulations and condolences. CHAIR YELLEN.  I take both.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement between Mr. Fisher and Chair Yellen. Mr. Fisher begins by congratulating Chair Yellen and offering his condolences, and Chair Yellen responds by accepting both. This exchange is more friendly and amicable than contentious.


Passage number 5.
 MR. FISHER.  Let me just project ahead.  I am going to conclude pretty much along the same lines as President Bullard and President Lockhart, with the suggestion of adopting a minimalist approach for the present time—that is, option 5.  I suggest that our changes to the statement be minimalist and a little bit more qualitative, and at the same time maintain respect for the 2 percent longer-term inflation goal that we established under your predecessor. In considering all of this, I am very mindful of the fact that, first, we really don’t know— at least, I don’t believe we can successfully articulate with precision—what a maximum sustainable level of employment or of output growth relative to long-term trend actually is. Second, I wonder and would like to discuss with the staff—not now, but later—what our historical record of success is with projecting employment one to two years forward, or even inflation, for that matter.  And then, third, I am mindful of the fact that it is very difficult to define financial stability.  I suspect that among us we would have different definitions.  For example, would financial instability involve a significant correction in equity markets, or would it be a financial development that would upset the development of the real economy.  Against that background, I am going to tackle the questions that the staff proposed in the most recent  memo, more or less in reverse order.  I wish to make the following points and then to make a suggestion, Madam Chair. To begin, I believe that it would be ideal for the Committee to decide on a strategy for conducting post-liftoff monetary policy and also on a plan for communicating that strategy to the public—through statements but also through our speeches, and particularly through your press conferences—either before or in conjunction with the new forward guidance on liftoff.  I think this is a sensible way to proceed for two reasons. First, private-sector expectations concerning the post-liftoff conduct of policy influence current demand and, hence, the timing of liftoff.  And, second, the appropriate economic criteria for removing accommodation in the post-liftoff period logically determine the appropriate criteria for liftoff.  I think a statement of broad principles that merely recites the dual mandate or repeats what is said in the Committee’s Statement on Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy doesn’t contribute much, and it actually adds to what I consider to be an already overly long FOMC statement. With regard to a point made by President Kocherlakota about paragraph 6 in options 1 through 3 and paragraph 7 in option 4, that second sentence is the one that I have trouble with.  It states that short-term interest rates are likely to remain unusually low for a time even after employment and inflation return to mandate-consistent levels. Unless we have a consensus as to why short-term rates are likely to remain unusually low, and a consensus that these reasons are important, I don’t think that sentence should be included, and I wouldn’t include the first sentence in paragraph 6. As to my own preferences on post-liftoff forward guidance, I spelled them out in a memo that I sent around to our colleagues.  I would prefer a statement along the following lines—I’m just going to repeat what I wrote: “The Committee intends to adjust its policy instruments so as to hold projections of average PCE inflation over the coming three to five years, and beyond, as nearly as possible constant at 2 percent. Realized inflation of a rate modestly higher than 2 percent is acceptable if accompanied by weaker-than-previously-projected real economic activity, and realized inflation at a rate modestly lower than 2 percent is acceptable if accompanied by stronger-than-previously-projected real economic activity. The Committee believes that monetary policy conducted according to these principles will help households and firms plan their purchases and investments and manage their financial obligations in a manner that keeps employment near its maximum sustainable level.” I do believe that financial developments, if not financial stability per se, certainly need to be mentioned in a policy consideration.  And I conclude overall, with that background, that we are going to need some additional time to tackle thoughtfully and thoroughly the issues associated with post-liftoff guidance.  So for now I’d prefer a statement that meets the following criteria.  First, it does no harm.  Second, it keeps the door open to my preferred form of post-liftoff guidance—of course, this is my preference.  And, third, except as necessary to accomplish those first two points, it keeps close to the existing language until we get this hammered out a little bit more thoroughly than I suspect we are able to do in this phone call. So I come down to option 5.  I would make a slight amendment to option 5, Madam Chair, and that is in the second section, which begins with “The Committee anticipates.”  I’m just going to read what I would suggest here: “The Committee anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away, and projected inflation is not above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal”—in other words, I would strike the word “especially.”   Those are my changes to that sentence.  The key operative changes are inserting “and,” striking “especially if,” striking “continues to run below,” and inserting “is not above.” In keeping with what I think President Lockhart said, I would get rid of the next sentence because it ties liftoff of the federal funds rate to the asset purchase program, and I think President Lockhart made a very good point there.  I don’t think that sentence is necessary.  And then I would basically leave the last sentence that’s now in blue by itself.  So those are the changes that I would suggest we make.  Certainly, that’s as much as I could support at this juncture.  I think it does provide us a bridge.  It’s qualitative.  It maintains respect for our 2 percent longer-term inflation goal.  And it takes away specific date guidance and also removes the numerical reference to unemployment.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.

Passage number 6.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 7.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I actually find myself in complete agreement with the comments of President Rosengren.  Nevertheless, I will make my own comments, and I have my own version of paragraph 5, which is similar in spirit to President Rosengren’s comments but, I think, is something that may be even a little simpler. As we move from the extraordinary times of the past several years to more ordinary times, our policy statements and forward guidance should move away from numeric thresholds, triggers, and floors, as many people have already mentioned.  Instead, the statement should provide a more qualitative explanation of our policy reaction function in the context of the economic situation and our goals.  Over time, the statement should become shorter and should not try to cover all possible issues and contingencies. In considering the qualitative versus quantitative guidance, I think of the analogy of giving someone instructions on how to get to Disneyland from Northern California—say, fromSacramento.  And the first part of it is, get on I−5, go south for several hours, and just keep going.  That’s what I see as our threshold language of a 6½ percent unemployment rate, and I think that served us very well.  Eventually, you start going over the Grapevine, you come into Los Angeles, and you run into the massive traffic there, road closures, and situations that you did not expect.  Obviously, there you have to use judgment, and you have to adapt to a change in circumstances.  So any attempt to explain to somebody how you navigate through an area like Los Angeles in a predetermined way is going to fail.  I think that, as we’ve gotten closer to our goals, we are facing a choice to either say, “Well, keep going on I−5 at full speed”—the danger with that is, you end up in Mexico—or try to explain all of the contingencies and the factors and the thresholds that you should be following.  And it’s better to try to provide more of the framework, the reaction function, and not try to explain all of the conditions and contingencies. I see three primary goals of the March FOMC statement:  first, to reaffirm the public’s understanding of our policy approach and our plans—that is, keep policy expectations basically where they are today; second, to provide a bridge between the end of our asset purchase program and the date of funds rate liftoff; and, third, to provide a general contour of how we expect to see policy in the post-liftoff period.  Many of the proposals in the staff memo, in my view, try to do too much, distracting attention from these three basic goals.  I think we can be clearer and more effective if we keep the statement language more similar to that of January but, at the same time, importantly, anchor interest rate expectations appropriately. Toward this end, I have my own four-sentence version of paragraph 5, which I will read, and it goes like this:  “To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase programends.  In determining how long to maintain the current range of 0 to ¼ percent for the fed funds rate, the Committee will consider actual and expected future progress of unemployment and inflation toward their mandate-consistent levels.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including various measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee currently anticipates it will be appropriate to maintain the current range for the federal funds rate until significant further progress toward its goals is achieved, provided that longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored and risks to financial stability remain contained.” I am also comfortable with including paragraph 6. This approach anchors interest rate expectations in three ways.  First, it retains and highlights the “considerable time after the asset purchase program ends” phrasing, which I think is important. Second, it states that we will maintain the funds rate at its current level until significant further progress toward our goals is achieved, and, of course, it makes reference to both of our goals.  And, third, the inclusion of paragraph 6 should help anchor expectations about the path after liftoff. Now, regarding the questions in the staff memo, paragraphs 2 to 4 of the FOMC statement already discuss the general principles of our approach to policy, so we don’t really need to restate the general approach in paragraph 5, in my view.  I would also mention at that point that it’s important in thinking about paragraph 5 to reread paragraphs 2 through 4.  There is a lot of discussion there about objectives or appropriate stance of policy, and, in thinking about paragraph 5, you want to realize that that whole set-up is around asset purchases.  So, in my view, you want to start paragraph 5 with a reference to the end of asset purchases.   With respect to financial developments, I think the current discussion in the FOMC statement, the very brief mention of it, is appropriate and encompasses consideration of financial-stability issues.  And, to repeat a comment that has already been made, we want to be careful to avoid the appearance that we have a particular target for asset prices in mind. Finally, to even better anchor policy expectations during this transition period, we could start publishing the median of the SEP forecasts for the current set of voters on the Committee in addition to what we currently publish.  In my view, this approach would preserve the strengths of presenting the full set of SEP submissions, which gives you the full range of views of all of the 19 participants but, importantly, would give a clearer view of the center of the Committee, which would provide hard numbers to reinforce the message in the statement.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Williams.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. President Williams begins by stating that he agrees with the comments of President Rosengren. He then goes on to provide his own version of a paragraph and offers his own suggestions for the FOMC statement. There is no indication of disagreement or argument.


Passage number 8.
 MR. WEINBERG.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It’s clearly an opportune and appropriate time to modify forward guidance, given the approaching 6½ percent unemployment threshold.  At the moment, there doesn’t seem to be much of a case for trying to significantly shift marketexpectations for the path of short-term interest rates, as market expectations appear to be pretty well aligned with the Committee’s center of gravity as displayed in the SEP, for example. One of the key questions in thinking about what to communicate is how to describe conditions that would lead to an initial interest rate increase. The Committee has really not spent much time discussing the economic conditions that, for each participant, would likely trigger wanting to raise rates for the first time. On this, there is probably a wide range of views around the table.  Accordingly, anything more than a fairly minimalist approach could be premature at this point.  Trying to articulate something more precise involves implicitly staking out the conceptual framework, and more discussions about the framework might be useful before doing so. Our preference would be for a streamlined version of option 5 in which the third and fourth sentences are combined to read as follows: “The Committee anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.” This eliminates the clause “at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal.”  You could call this a “hyper-minimalist approach.” While the “complete recovery” language in option 5 is intentionally less specific, and that is appealing in some regards, I think that people seeing that language are naturally going to want to map it to a specific unemployment rate or an employment-to-population ratio or some other metric.  Using a phrase like “complete recovery” or “maximum sustainable level of employment” in this context seems to go beyond the Committee’s consensus statement of 2012, which states that “the maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors” and which emphasizes its variability.  Granted, the consensus statement goes on to cite participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment, but it never actually equates that concept with the maximum level of employment.  In the current context, pivoting from an unemployment rate threshold to a formulation that refers to “maximum sustainable level of employment” risks looking opportunistic, as if the Committee is responding to the fall in the unemployment rate by shifting to other labor market indicators. Finally, we’re against including a reference to financial-stability concerns or financial market developments.  Aside from a concern for financial stability, it’s not clear on what basis one would want to single out for special consideration the implication of financial market developments for our goals, compared with the full array of factors taken into consideration.  Further, the notion of highlighting concerns about financial stability in a monetary policy context creates some difficulties.  Would people conclude that the Committee would compromise on employment and inflation objectives for the sake of financial stability.  Or would they conclude that large asset price increases would induce tighter monetary policy, or that large asset price declines would induce easier policy.  Might they conclude that the Committee would ease policy in response to distress at one or more large financial institutions.  Without a shared understanding of how financial market developments ought to enter into the monetary policy reaction function, communicating to the public about the role of financial-stability considerations could create more problems than it solves.  Here again, further deliberations by the Committee on the relevant conceptual framework could be fruitful before expanding the dimensions of Committee communications further.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Pianalto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing different views and preferences regarding the communication of forward guidance, but there is no direct contention or disagreement. The speaker acknowledges that there may be a wide range of views around the table and suggests further discussions and deliberations on the relevant conceptual framework before making decisions on expanding communication dimensions.


Passage number 9.
   MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  And I can’t tell you how delighted I am to use those words—“Madam Chair.” I, too, am pleased to be serving under your leadership, although it will be only for a few more months—but thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. MS. PIANALTO is expressing her pleasure and gratitude for serving under CHAIR YELLEN's leadership. CHAIR YELLEN responds with thanks, indicating appreciation for the sentiment.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 10.
 MS. PIANALTO.  As today’s discussion demonstrates, the communication challenges before us are significant.  In my view, we face two broad challenges.  The first, and more pressing, challenge is communicating the conditions that will most likely lead to liftoff for the federal funds rate.  The second is communicating the likely pace of adjustment after liftoff. The first challenge is simpler to address than the second, although I’m not sure, after today’s conversation, that it’s going to be quite that simple.  But I do believe that our experiences, first with the date-based guidance and then with the unemployment thresholds for the fed funds rate liftoff, highlight the importance of proceeding cautiously with very broad changes to our forward guidance.  For now, I suggest that the Committee focus on addressing the first challenge—that is, the timing of liftoff—and then take some time over the spring and summer to study and discuss the efficacy of approaches to guidance on the pace of adjustment after liftoff. To address the communications challenges around liftoff, in my view, it would be most effective to revise the forward guidance to simply refer to labor market conditions in broad terms and to establish an explicit inflation floor.  In my economic outlook, the labor market will continue to improve gradually, and the inflation forecast is likely to be the key driver in the timing of liftoff.  In addition, since the current statement language has an inflation ceiling and other wording that comes close to an inflation floor, the formal establishment of an inflation floor wouldn’t represent a large change in guidance or a large change in our approach.   Of the forward-guidance options circulated to the Committee, I view option 5 as the best starting point because it provides continuity with the current statement and includes the full range of factors that the Committee will consider in deciding on liftoff. However, I believe that the reference in option 5 to “at least as long as complete recovery in the labor market appears to be more than a year away” could prove to be problematic.  One reason that it could be problematic is that the Committee is likely to have difficulty in clearly defining a complete recovery in labor markets, just as we had some trouble with the guidance around the LSAP program that referred to a simpler notion of substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  A second reason that it might be problematic is that such guidance would imply that the Committee can accurately predict complete recovery in the labor market at least one year in advance, even though the simpler exercise of forecasting the unemployment rate over the last two years has been difficult.  And a third reason is that we haven’t had the time for careful study of the efficacy of waiting to raise rates until just one year before the labor market recovery is complete. For these reasons, I would prefer a version of option 5 modified to drop the reference to complete recovery in labor markets, and, in place of that language, I would insert the inflation floor language that’s provided in the second sentence of option 3.  The inflation forecast will capture many of the factors that are likely to determine liftoff, but they are more difficult to spell out in simple terms in the forward guidance.  When you look at the December SEP, it suggests that using a 2 percent inflation floor would also be generally consistent with the Committee participants’ forecasts and policy views.  Based on the limited information available in the December SEP, it looks as though the liftoff for many participants was being driven more by an inflation forecast than by the unemployment threshold.   So, with those general comments, let me very quickly turn to the questions that were posed to the Committee.  Regarding whether to include a general statement on policy decisions, I believe that it would be helpful to include the guidance that is provided in the second and the last sentences of option 5.  I think any further general statement that the Committee wishes to make would best be presented in the annual Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  As for linking liftoff to LSAPs, I believe that the statement language should preserve the guidance that’s provided in the current statement.   To do otherwise might suggest a shift in our policy position.  Regarding thresholds, triggers, and floors, as I just stated, I would prefer forward guidance that includes an inflation floor. In response to the second question, I believe that it is best to include financial developments or financial stability in the broader list of indicators that the Committee will be monitoring to decide on liftoff.  And, in my view, the wording in option 5 is appropriate. In response to the third question, at this point, with liftoff likely to be some way off, market expectations seem to reflect an anticipation of gradual changes in the fed funds rate target after liftoff.  So, at least for now, I don’t believe it’s necessary to add more-explicit language that could, over time, prove to require changes.  Instead, as I’ve indicated, I’d prefer to focus now on addressing the challenges of liftoff communications and to use an inflation floor to address that issue. The Committee can take time again over the spring and summer to study and discuss the efficacy of approaches to guidance on the pace of adjustment after liftoff. At this time, in response to question 4, I don’t have any other changes to suggest.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President Pianalto.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. MS. Pianalto suggests modifying option 5 to drop the reference to complete recovery in labor markets and instead insert the inflation floor language from option 3. This is in contrast to the current language and the suggestion in option 5.


Passage number 11.
  MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Like others, I’ve appreciated the opportunity to discuss the Committee’s forward guidance ahead of our March 18 meeting, and I, too, thank the staff for teeing up the options that we’re discussing today. This exercise highlights, I think, the significant communications challenge that we face in the transition from unconventional aspects of our policy.  So, as I thought about the various options and the related implications and consequences, I gravitated to minimal changes at this point, continuing to simplify and clarify where possible rather than introducing new benchmarks or thresholds to describe the Committee’s sense of the future path of short-term rates. To that end, I would support language along the lines of option 5 for our March statement, including the alternative drafted by President Plosser and sent out earlier, while leaning on other communications vehicles to elaborate.  And I want to also join in with those who have expressed concern within option 5 about that language of “complete recovery.”  I think that will pose some challenges in explaining what we mean by that. In terms of the first and third questions, I would offer two thoughts on forward guidance relative to our existing strategy statement and the SEP.  I continue to think the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy provides a good depiction of the Committee’s approach to its policy decisions.  The statement is clear, I think, that we account for deviations of inflation from its long-run goal and deviations of employment from our assessment of its maximum level while considering risk to the financial system.  It also explains the balanced approach we intend to pursue when these objectives are not complementary and describes that we account for the balance of risk when setting policy.  So this statement is an important complement to forward guidance, and I would not muddy future FOMC statements with further   attempts to explain our approach to monetary strategy, since it’s likely to be either redundant or confusing. In addition to leaning on our existing strategy statement, we should not underweight the value of the SEP in providing guidance on the path of rates after liftoff.  The SEP, despite its noted shortcomings, offers an ongoing and consistent framework that currently communicates the intention of Committee participants to keep the funds rate at an unusually low level to support the economy. Unlike static dates or thresholds or other quantifications, which can move in unpredictable ways that don’t always align well with our policy intentions, the rate projections in the SEP over time will move in response to economic developments, providing information on how policy will vary with economic conditions after liftoff.  For this reason, I continue to believe that we could leverage the existing communication provided by the SEP to convey our future intentions by moving median projections of the funds rate into the FOMC statement. One issue, of course, that’s been raised is whether the median should reflect all participants or only voting members.  And because the submissions today are not identified, I’m not sure whether this is an issue just in theory or in reality.  But a reference by the FOMC to the SEP would not be without precedent.  SEP medians are referenced today in our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, and they’re visibly attached to and described as part of the FOMC minutes at each submission.  Of course, in addition to these two vehicles, the press conferences and FOMC minutes can assist importantly with the heavy lifting of communicating our policy intentions. In terms of question 2, on a more prominent role for financial developments, I tend to think that our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy already references this.  But I could support including a sentence along the lines of that offered in option 4. And, finally, I’ll conclude by saying that, in the longer term, I look forward to moving in the direction of statements like those that the staff shared from the Bank of England, whereby we can shift from some of our lengthy, complex statements to something more succinct and straightforward as we communicate our policy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, President George.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. While there is some discussion of different options and preferences, there is no obvious contention or disagreement in this passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 12.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’ll make a few comments here.  First—and I think this picks up on a theme that Dennis introduced, and several people have echoed it since then—I do believe that, particularly as we pass the 6.5 percent threshold, we’re better advised to have somewhat generally stated standards in the FOMC statement, which can be elaborated upon as circumstances dictate.  I might deviate a bit from what Dennis stated in expressing a strong bias in favor of having the Chair do most of that elaboration, particularly, though not exclusively, in the press conferences that she’ll be conducting.  To the degree that we think of communication of forward guidance as itself an element of monetary policy, I think it becomes particularly important to have an authoritative voice elaborating that position, and there’s no alternative here, really, but the Chair. A second point is, although I’ve got, personally, a fair amount of flexibility on the specific language that we will adopt, consistent with that notion of general standards, I do think it’s important that we not lose the advantage of what we’ve gotten already in the language that we’ve inserted into the existing paragraph 5.  One of those things is the notion that we are likely—not certain, but likely—to stay at the zero lower bound well past the time when we pass a 6½ percent unemployment rate.  And, second, as we begin to increase interest rates, we will, to use our euphemism, “take a balanced approach.” It might be advisable to substitute in that “balanced approach” language something that makes mention of—and I’m not sure this is theright term—the headwinds that we’ll be confronting, because those give a justification for why we think the path upward is, again, not likely to be steep, although we’re not prejudging anything. I would just note in passing that, although I’ve got a fair amount of flexibility on the language and, in some respects, I like some of the earlier statements in option 2 rather than in option 5, I really am less concerned with that.  I would say, though, that I think there’s a bit of a risk here.  Not many people have proposed it, but there’s a bit of a risk that too much reliance on projections as our standard becomes a bit circular.  That is, it almost is the conclusion being stated as the standard.  If you think inflation is going to be below target and employment is going to be below target, and that’s your projection, then, almost by definition, you’re going to be in favor of a longer period of accommodation, and you’re in favor of it because of your expectation that that’s where we’re going to be.  So I’m not sure it communicates an enormous amount of information very effectively, but I say that with the understanding that we already use projections and we’re going to continue to use projections as we go forward here and in other parts of the statement. The next point is that what we’ve got now is, first, some indication of when we’ll begin to raise rates and, second, some indication of how steep a climb we’ll have once we begin.  That’s where, I think, we don’t want to lose the benefits of the communications we’ve had to date, and we want to keep market expectations about where they are. We haven’t yet said anything about the endpoint, and this is where I, like several of you, find paragraph 6 in a few of the options attractive, because it does state an endpoint.  And it seems to me it’s an endpoint that, while not giving a specific number, communicates something about how we’ll be thinking about policy along the way.  Richard is quite right that we haven’t had a debate on that, and it may be   that it would be premature to adopt it.  But, unlike Sandy, I’m a little bit concerned about taking it one step at a time.  Let’s just say when we’re going to begin, and sometime later we’ll talk about how steep a climb, and sometime thereafter we’ll talk about the endpoint.  I think it’s preferable to say something about all three—again, in somewhat generally stated standards—and then allow the Chair to elaborate after listening to the whole Committee during the quarterly meetings that are followed by press conferences. With respect to the financial-stability point, I think Jim had it just right. It would be useful to make reference to it, but not to make too big a deal of it.  And a simple minimalist reference to financial-stability considerations would be just fine, from my point of view, but I don’t feel very strongly about that. In conclusion, Madam Chair, I would stay away, as much as possible, from projections being the basis for the standards.  I agree with what I think is the somewhat emergent consensus, with a lot of variation—that we go with a basic minimalist approach.  But with respect to the specific language, this is one for which I happily give you my proxy so that, as you try to allocate the votes, you’ve got an extra one just to lean in whatever direction you think useful. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks—much appreciated, Governor Tarullo.  Governor Stein.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Governor Tarullo expresses a different opinion than others regarding the use of projections as standards for monetary policy. He also expresses concern about taking a step-by-step approach rather than addressing all aspects of policy at once.


Passage number 13.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, think that some variant of option 5 is the right place to land, and I’ll talk about that.  But I want to talk first about a couple of the other issues that arise in the preceding options. First, I am not attracted to the idea of switching to an employment type of goal.  I think it would certainly be perceived by the market as a significant signal, and the signal would probably be along the lines of losing confidence in the unemployment rate as a measure.  But we are already saying in the postmeeting statement that we are looking at a variety of labor market measures, and, therefore, I think it might be confusing, and, in the end, doesn’t buy us a lot.  So I’m not attracted to that idea. Turning to the pre-liftoff guidance, I am not attracted, again, to the new thresholds.  And I take the point of the thresholds that are in option 2 and option 4 to be to set up some brakes on this locomotive against unwanted tightening if the economy does strengthen again.  But, in my view, we have already got effective brakes—and, for me, that is in the form of a link to the end of asset purchases.  Specifically, monetary policy will remain highly accommodative for a considerable time after the end of asset purchases. I realize we are mixing state dependence and time dependence there, but I think this is really the ballast that is holding market expectations   close to where the Committee is.  I think this is a very important fundamental aspect. It’s working right now and is central to the market’s understanding, and I think it would be very unwise to change it at this time. I’ll come to this in the end, but complete recovery in the labor market as a threshold, in particular—you know, you think about those words and we may never have that, if you take it literally.  Right. If you look at what we know of the Scandinavian countries or the long history of crises, there is permanent damage in some respect to the labor market in a lot of cases.  So it’s not a great formulation, in my view. Now, the current formulation of the “considerable time” sentence is linked to the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, which the memo points out is kind of ambiguous on its face.  But I strongly suspect that what many in the market interpret that to mean is the current target for the federal funds rate. I’m actually okay with either formulation, and, frankly, I think that either formulation is consistent with and in sync with the December SEP. A final point, and I’m going to put this into one proposed sentence, is that as we pass the 6.5 percent unemployment rate and the threshold language drops away, we lose, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal. I think you can put all of those thoughts in one sentence and come out with something like this, which would land in paragraph 5: “The Committee anticipates that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economy strengthens, particularly if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-term goal.” I think President Williams managed to squeeze “financial stability” into that sentence, too, and I wouldn’t object to that. On a separate point, what’s not in here—and I hate to complicate this even further—is that we have left open the question of reinvestment of the assets on the balance sheet. I don’t think we have said anything publicly about it since 2011, and at that point I think we were saying we would cease reinvestments six months before liftoff.  I think in the previous Tealbook, it was actually synchronous with liftoff.  So this is the time to think about whether we wouldn’t resolve that question and use this occasion, or an occasion soon, to say what we’re going to do about that.  In other words, we would indicate that we will maintain our reinvestment policy and preserve the size of the balance sheet as it exists at the end of the asset purchase program until liftoff, or something like that.  If we leave that out, there’s a suggestion that we forgot it. In terms of financial stability, I like the more explicit formulations.  I could live with either of the ones in paragraph 4. As far as post-liftoff guidance is concerned, I like paragraph 6.  It is pretty much fine with me.  What it doesn’t have, of course, is an explanation of why.  As someone pointed out, it just flatly states what the SEP already says, which is that we’re going to be at full employment with mandate-consistent inflation, and we are going to have a 2 percent funds rate.  That, I think, clearly falls to the press conference, and, therefore, I am going to jump ahead and say what I would say in the press conference.  First I’d mention the headwinds, deleveraging, lack of credit availability, that kind of thing.  I would also make the risk-management point that Jeremy made, that it’s an asymmetrical situation and we need to get as far away from the zero lower bound as possible before easing off the gas. I would also personally emphasize that the output gap is not directly observable and famously difficult to estimate in real time.  And I believe that, today, uncertainty about the size of the gap is unusually high and is probably skewed in a way that indicators, like the unemployment gap, are likely to understate the real resource gap.  Finally, I   would say that, given the unusually high uncertainty, we will carefully monitor inflation, particularly wage inflation, as well as financial conditions, to tell us how close we are to full employment.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you, Governor Powell.  And last but not least, Vice Chairman Dudley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident because the speaker, Mr. Powell, does not mention any opposing views or arguments. Instead, he is simply expressing his own thoughts and preferences on the different options presented.
