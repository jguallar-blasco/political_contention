{"1985FOMC19850118confcall.txt": ["MR. CROSS. All right. Let me proceed. [The overall limit]on balances for all currencies as you recall is $6-1/2 billion, and wehave available under that overall limit $1-1/2 billion. So we're verycomfortable there. This is broken down into [informal limits on]deutschemarks, yen, and other currencies. The other currencies[category] would be relevant if we were to intervene in other than theDM or the yen, namely in sterling. We have available under thatlimitation $167 million at the present time. So, our authorizedbalances are not in danger of being breached at this moment.With respect to the market, let me give you a little rundown:Immediately prior to the time Secretary Regan spoke yesterday, whichwas very late in the course of our day--our markets were closing--thedollar was cruising around 3.175 marks. The other currencies hadmoved more or less similarly vis-a-vis the mark. After his statement,there was an initial fallback in the dollar in the South Pacific andother markets that were open; it fell back about 2 pfennigs. Butafter hitting these lower levels and when the Far East became moreactive, there were buyers for dollars at these lower levels and thatseemed to cover professionals and speculators. We heard the usual--that speculative operators were in there, namely the Russians andSouth Africans and so forth. As a result of all this, the dollar thenrose again somewhat and opened in Europe at about 3.165 marks. Duringthe course of the European day the dollar was fairly quiet. It justbarely touched 3.18 marks once or twice but generally speaking was inthe 3.17 to 3.175 range during Europe's day. Since I've been sittinghere the dollar does seem to be rising and has now gone up above the3.18 level; it's getting close to 3.185.The attitude towards Secretary Regan's statement seems tovary considerably among the various market participants. A number ofthem called attention to the fact that it was cited as a reaffirmationof the Williamsburg agreements, and they tend to think that that makesit likely not to be of major significance--that it might be somethingto placate the Europeans. But there are a number of people who haveread the Regan statement as reflecting the possibility, certainly, ofsomething aimed at communicating more than that. And the market iswary. They read the comments that there may be some surprises andthat we might operate on occasions when it would be helpful and notjust [to counter] disorderly market pressures as in the past. So,there is a general wariness and uneasiness. And there is somelikelihood that the market, either in the course of today orrelatively soon, will try to test some of these [intervention] pointsand get a better understanding of the meaning of the Group of 5statement. As of now, that's the general picture. I think very fewpeople believe that it reflects any fundamental modification of our1/18/85policy. But there are quite a few who think that it may have somesignificance and they are rather wary because of that. Thank you", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. If the market pressures got strongenough--. Let me put it this way: I hope that we don't do anoperation doomed to be ineffectual by its niggardly nature, which iswhat we've been doing recently. So, while I don't particularly expectit, I don't consider it inconceivable that we might end up with anamount of currencies that would involve raising the question ofchanging some of these informal limits"], "1985FOMC19850213meeting.txt": ["CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] go about intervention inthe least effective way--in fact, I would say a counterproductive way", "MR. AXILROD. Governor Wallich, if I may add a [different]and maybe minority view on that operation: I would tend to deny itssuccess. I think it was rather a hit and run operation and that thefailure of the dollar to go up--if that's a failure--subsequently, hada lot to do with the drop in interest rates in this country throughthe winter. And I think the expectation that that [decline] wascoming to a halt was instrumental in the dollar turning around. Whenit turned around and got to that point it just went right through it;it kept going, as there was no intervention of significant size anddetermination forthcoming at that time", "MR. WALLICH. I'm simply saying that we took a negative viewof that operation; we viewed it as being contrary to good practice ofnot driving the rate but leaning against the wind. They seem to takea more positive view of it. And they seem to be of a mind to repeatit even though they know that they wouldn't get our cooperation on anoperation like that", "MR. BOEHNE. Looking back over the last 4 weeks, if we aregoing to do something like this, what's the strategy of doing it theway we have done it. If we're going to do it, we ought to do it withsome conviction or it's hardly worth the trouble at all. It seemsthat we're intervening as though we're kind of being forced to do itand we really don't want to. Our intervention doesn't strike me asbeing very convincing to anybody", "MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes", "MR. STERNLIGHT. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me ask you a question following thatquestion. In terms of these projections, we center on 4 percent forprices this year, which is an increase in the rate of price increasefrom last year. I get a little concerned about presenting price[projections] of an increasing rate of price increase--which show agreat faith in Federal Reserve policy--particularly when it's notclear to me why that should be. You have this decline in the dollarin your projection--I'm not talking about your projection; basically,2/12-13/85I'm talking about other peoples' projections--but I don't know whetherpeople assumed a decline in the dollar. Last time we used theconvention that we would not; I think we assumed some general range offluctuation within historical experience, which seems to me areasonable convention. It turned out to be a lot better, because thedollar was up, than if we'd assumed a depreciation. The actual priceresults have been at the very lower edge of our projections. And Iwonder why we're so pessimistic on prices this coming year when thewage trend looks good, the dollar continues to appreciate, the profitmargins have widened, as was suggested already, and the unemploymentrate doesn't go down much. One can argue about productivity; thestaff doesn't have terribly buoyant productivity estimates and maybeeverybody else is very low on productivity. But I would like to hearwhy [people think] prices are going to be worse this year than lastyear", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure as far as third years ofexpansions are concerned, but I don't see where we get any increase.I don't see why we don't have a decrease here, with what I see goingon", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't want to get the whole conversationgoing on this point. I think you might look at it again in the lightof an unchanged dollar assumption. Not as much as a lot of otherpeople, but we have been high on our inflation estimates before. Idon't know what prices are going to be, but there certainly will be arange of uncertainty. Maybe they will go up. The question is wherethe greater probability lies", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to take exception to the[projections for] housing starts and residential construction volumefor 1985. As the chart showed, the mortgage commitment rate ishovering around 13 percent on a 30-year fixed-rate loan and theproportion of adjustable rate loans has dropped significantly. Idon't believe, given the satisfaction of the deferred housing demandthat has occurred to date, that we can reach 1.75 million [in housingstarts] or $166+ billion in residential investment in 1985. It couldhappen with a lower [mortgage] rate but the assumption of the staff isfor somewhat higher rates, particularly toward the end of the year.In the models I've seen, it would take a fixed-rate somewhere around12-1/2 percent. If you add the servicing on to that mortgagecommitment rate for 30-year fixed-rate loans you get about 13-1/4percent. So it seems to me that we're looking at 1.5 million ratherthan 1.75 million [on starts].There are a number of other institutional changes. We knowthat the investigation of the Bank of America mortgage-backed securityfraud situation is only beginning. There will be some investorreaction in the mortgage-backed security area. The thrift institution-12-2/12-13/85regulators are attempting to slow the growth [of such securities], andto the extent that there is some degree of success, that would affectavailability. And finally, there is the so-called willingness factorin home buying that is disappearing, in the sense that theappreciation motivation that has been so prominent over the lastseveral decades is waning in several regions of the country. Themotivation to buy is for shelter and not for appreciation. Thesyndicates have been pushed out of the market in the multifamily area;the multiple unit vacancy rate is terrifically high in some parts ofthe country. It isn't enough to do a macro job and get this very highvacancy shown on the chart. For the United States there isn't anational housing market; there is mosaic of sub-markets around thecountry; and many of those have very, very high vacancy rates. So Idon't see how we can get 600,000 or 650,000 in multifamily starts in1985. I suggest that the forecast is [.25 million] high. Thatdoesn't exactly throw the forecast out.I would couple that remark with a commendation for theanalysis in the rest of the structural forecast for the next year interms of real business fixed investment. I think it's a very goodanalysis, showing a very big cutback in structures in the realbusiness fixed investment area. I did a little work prior to themeeting and then found that I was caught in the sense that I was onlyverifying what the staff has done here. I think that's quiteaccurate", "MR. KEEHN. On the business fixed investment chart I continueto be amazed by this very favorable red trend line that we've watchedthe last couple of years, which seems completely out of context withour experience. Mike, I think you did comment as you went through thecharts that most of that line, or a significant part of it, is in thecommunications/computer area. My question is: If you were to separateout what I would call for lack of a better term the \"grunt stuff\"--theheavy capital production type of equipment--from the computer area andthen, in turn, take a look at the part of that heavy equipment that isbeing supplied by the international market, wouldn't the line in factbe very, very different. And wouldn't that be a way of dramatizinghow terribly uneven all of this is, despite the fact that we have atrend line that looks very favorable", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Let me make a couple of more generalcomments. Our own view of the economy for 1985 is one that has realGNP growing about 4 percent, with the deflator a shade lower thanthat. And at this juncture, that has the characteristics of a goodforecast from my perspective. In the short run it could actually be abit stronger. The impression I get from talking to business peopleand others over the past month or so is that most of them have beenmarking up their projection of real growth and marking down theirinflation projection for the year. But I think there probably is aconsensus somewhere in the 3-1/2 to 4 percent range for both real GNPand prices.On the point that was just brought up, the feeling comes outvery, very forcefully in comments from directors and business leadersthat we have crossed the Rubicon on this external stuff and that itmay already be taking a bigger bite than even those numbers suggest.For example, who represents a very, very largemultinational firm heavy in capital goods, thinks that in recentquarters 100 percent of the increase in spending on equipment iscoming from abroad. Just within the past week he made some commentsto the effect that he had seen his order book affected in a verysizable way just in the past month because of the international tradesituation. So, that continues to be a wild card and it's gettingwilder by the minute. I have some of the same concerns that Pres had-14-2/12-13/85about the housing sector. It should be a good year, but there aresome things in there that I find troubling as well.Extracting from the traditional sectoral questions of whatthe risks are to a forecast, it seems to me that there are two orthree more generic risks that are particularly important in thecurrent setting. One of those is: What happens if interest rates goup in any appreciable way. Let me just define appreciable as morethan a percentage point in the short run. Obviously, that would be avery difficult situation. And then you ask yourself: What couldproduce that. If the budget deficit is not reduced, that couldproduce it; and if the dollar declines in any appreciable way, thatcould produce it even though the cushion for a dollar decline issomewhat larger now than it was before. That result could also comefrom the economy growing too fast because, from my perspective atleast, the balance in our credit markets is so precarious, asindicated in one of Mike's charts, that it doesn't take much to pushus into a situation in which the economy is growing too fast. Eventhough that might not reflect itself in price pressures, it couldeasily be reflected in interest rate pressures. Then, of course,there is always the possibility--perhaps remote at the moment--thatthe market could conclude that money growth in some broad sense isgetting away from us. So, there is a whole collection of things, anyone of which I think could produce pressures on interest rates. And Ithink it goes without saying that any appreciable pressures in thatdirection would throw any forecast to the wind.Another thing that I am somewhat concerned about in terms ofrisks is the burden of all this debt we're accumulating. I'm not assanguine as I thought you seemed to be, Mike, in terms of thecumulative effect of that debt burden--particularly in the context ofwhat I think is still some fragility in the financial system. And Idon't think all of these crazy new markets and instruments that arecoming along almost daily are helping that situation. Just to putthat debt situation in one perspective: Since 1982, the ratio ofnonfinancial debt to nominal GNP has risen by 17 [hundredths]. It'salmost a vertical line, and the level of that debt right now is so farout of line with anything we've ever experienced. That's just anotherway of looking at it that is troubling.The last thing I would mention on the risk side is the oilprice; that has been talked about a little. I was surprised the otherday when a point was made to me in a conversation with someone Iregard as a fairly credible source. The nature of the comment wasthat among a group of people thought to be experts, a third of themnow thought there was at least some possibility that the oil pricecould fall, say, to the $16 range. No one was predicting that as ahard prediction, but there was at least the recognition of that as apossibility by a fairly knowledgeable and sizable group of so-calledexperts. I must say when I stop and try to think about theimplications of that, I'm not sure what they are. They probably, ormost certainly, are not good. So, in general, I come out with [theview that] everybody is feeling good about the situation right now butgetting a little more worried about what the situation implies downthe road", "MR. KEEHN. Just to comment generally on the outlook, thestaff forecast is really quite consistent with ours. Our GNP is alittle lower and our inflation is a little higher but not materiallyenough to comment on. But, as you can gather by my earlier comments,I am still just staggered by the continuing unevenness of it all.Many of the industries on the capital goods side are very weak and Ithink a lot of them have come to the conclusion that they are going tobe left out and that this recovery is going to completely pass themby. I was talking with a man who runs a very large diversifiedcompany, including an extensive foundry operation, and they haveconcluded that they had better get ready for the next recession andnow are in the process of closing permanently about half of theirfoundries. They just feel that that business is never going to comeback.A risk I would point out--and I would say it's a local risk,certainly not a macro or a broad risk--is this agricultural situation.-16-2/12-13/85I almost don't dare mention it because I'm sure I can't say anythingnew or surprising and you've heard a lot about it. But it is veryserious and is continuing to deteriorate. And it is one that I findvery hard to get a handle on; I find it difficult to measure just howdifficult and serious the problem is other than I have a hunch thatthe statistics we look at really don't adequately describe theproblem. The land surveys that we look at suggest that land valuesare down 30 to 40 percent from the peak. But there isn't much landselling; and when land does sell, it's selling at 50 to 60 percentunder the peak. People purposely are trying to hold land off themarket [because] the real values are substantially lower.As the land value goes down, the debt [unintelligible] willget very, very high at the agricultural banks. Cash flow just isn'tgoing to be adequate to service the debt. The concern among the agbanks is getting very high. I went to the Iowa bankers meeting inSioux City last weekend and I was pleased to get out of town in onepiece. They are pretty close-mouthed about the problem but they allcan see that the losses are going to be very substantial when theytotal the direct loans to the farmers and the indirect loans tosuppliers and merchants and the like. Also in the Midwest there hasbeen a lot of this trading of banks around that is supported by loanson bank stock, and I have a hunch that that will be a problem that'sgoing to grow in magnitude. When you add those together, I think thelosses on the portfolios are going to be very substantial. Anotherway of saying that the numbers hide the nature of the problem a littleis this: Of the 530 state banks in Iowa only 15 have capital of 7percent or less; and of those 15, 12 are between 6 and 7 percent,which would suggest that there isn't a problem from a capital point ofview. But when asset quality problems arise, a bank can go throughcapital awfully darn fast and all of a sudden there is an escalatingproblem. The Superintendent of Banks in Iowa suggests that about 140of their 530 banks are what he would call problem banks and by that hemeans that 60 percent of capital is classified. But he thinks thatnumber is going to go up and that by the end of the year about half oftheir banks will be in the problem category. These are all, I think,small banks and this is somewhat of a regional problem as opposed toone with broad national implications. But I do suggest to you thatthis agricultural problem--and, again, it can't be news to you--isserious and is escalating and that the number of bank failures isgoing to be significantly higher in the Midwest this year than was thecase last year. It is not at a level nor of the type of institutionthat could be destabilizing, but I think it is a risk that meritsnotice", "MR. PARTEE. Well, maybe that's what I'm affected by. Iagree with Jerry that a sizable rise in interest rates would be quitedifficult for these burdened sectors to take on. I don't agree withhim that a 100 basis points is a sizable rise. After all, rates aredown several hundred points over the last several months, but I guessI would agree that a 200 basis point increase would be a verydifficult thing. From my vantage point right now, I'm beginning tothink our greatest problem may be an excessive increase in activityhere that in fact will bring a 200 basis point increase in interestrates looking out 6 months from now. Therefore, I'm more on the sideof those who are now becoming somewhat fearful of too much of a risein activity rather than on the side of those who think it's going tobe too small in the period to come. In the end all these problems andmore that have been listed by Jim and others are going to come out insome way or other, but I think probably not in 1985", "MR. WALLICH. That's what I had in mind. Well, I have oneother comment. We're in the third year of an expansion and there isno reason why expansions should come to an end after 3 years. Butneither do I believe what the [Administration's] economic report says:that there is no relationship between the age of an expansion and thechances of it coming to an end. So I think the risks, as others have-22-2/12-13/85 -23-pointed out, are that something untoward may happen and may interferewith this reasonably good evolution. We have no serious imbalancesother than, of course, the terrible one--the budget deficit. But wehave a number of danger points, mainly financial. So, again, thereare potential sources of the evolution being disturbed. To me thissuggests that the risks are more on the side of excessive expansionthan of going down unexpectedly, and our policy ought to be[formulated] accordingly", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not quite asking that. I'masking: Are you so unhappy that it's not so slow, having started inDecember above that cone as part of the low base, that you thought itwas important to get it back in the cone in January or February. Now,I would just assert \"no.\" But that's certainly an interpretation; Idon't know what the Committee thinks", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's so close it makes practically nodifference. For M3, I don't know what you want to do. We can drawparallel lines, I guess, and a cone. Mr. Sternlight, I have a noteindicating that you wanted to talk", "It doesn't--MR. GRAMLEY. If we have both, you can do the kind of shadingyou want with words; and you'll tell a lot more about what our thrustin policy is than in any kind of picture we can draw. If we draw thisstrange looking picture, you're going to spend about 6 pages of yourtestimony trying to explain to Congress what that crazy thing is", "MR. MARTIN. I join President Balles in the caveat that, tothe extent that alternative II is beginning to emerge as a consensus,I think we may have pragmatic difficulties with the upper bound of M1.Given the staff forecast of income and interest rates, their warningthat the projections on velocity have some confidence limits aroundthem, and given the lagged effect of the interest rate drop that we'vehad, V1 could even be a little negative next year. If we're going foralternative II--as I hear you, John--it seems that we ought to dosomething about the upper boundary for M1; 7 percent may be too low", "MR. GRAMLEY. It's room I don't think we need. And I thinkwe send the wrong kind of signal when, after having set these targetsinitially, we're forecasting more real growth and higher growth ofmoney balances with the lower GNP deflator. I don't see that we needthat additional freedom. And I would prefer to send a signal whichsays: \"Look, we're still concerned with bringing down growth of moneyand credit over the long run to bring down inflation", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. No, because if it were 8 percentnominal GNP growth, particularly in a more mature stage of thebusiness recovery, normally the deficit financing this percentage ofGNP would be down", " Well, maybe part of it--MR. AXILROD. The staff was tempted to suggest throwing awaythe debt variable as not being useful", "MR. KICHLINE. We have the advance retail sales number forJanuary, which is that total sales are up 3/4 of a percent. But therewere downward revisions for both November and December. The group,the so-called retail control--excluding autos and gasoline stationsand nonconsumer sorts of things--was down 0.4 percent in January.More importantly, December was revised down to minus 0.2 percent; ithad been plus 0.6 percent. And there was also a downward revision inNovember. Basically, the staff had assumed monthly increases ofaround 0.5 percent in the first quarter. That would have put theJanuary level of this so-called retail control about 1.5 percent abovethe fourth-quarter average. Taking these numbers as they now stand,January is 0.1 of a percent below the fourth-quarter average. So,these numbers are appreciably weaker. Who knows what they will be 3or 4 months from now when they're revised. But this is certainly nota bullish report", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We were discussing what the long-rangetargets should be. I think the conclusion has been reached not torebase, though some imagination in drawing lines may be desirable. Wewere on the subject of what the targets should be. There was someexpression that they ought to be the way they are in alternative IIand some expression that at least M1 ought to be a 1/2 percentagepoint higher on the upper end. There was one expression of that view.Does anybody else have anything to say. Mr. Rice", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, given the forecasts that we've made--noting that nobody expects real growth less than 3 percent or inexcess of 4-1/2 percent--I think alternative II looks very good. Itseems to me that the ranges proposed for M1 and M2 would accommodategrowth within the range of 3 to 4-1/2 percent. I'm quite comfortablewith a range for M1 of 4 to 7 percent and for M2 of 6 to 8-1/2percent. I could live with the proposed ranges for M3 and totalcredit, but I would prefer to see M3 raised 1/2 of a percentage pointto 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent and credit at 9 to 12 percent. We expect M1to come in near the upper reaches of the range. And while we hopethat M3 will also be in the upper part of the range established, wehave this experience of M3 running very high. And I don't see why we-35-2/12-13/85should not set the ranges so that M3 will be at least closer, if notwithin, the range. The main objection to that seems to be that thiswould transmit a signal to the public that we are not beingsufficiently vigilant or, in the case of total credit, that we'retrying to accommodate the deficit. I myself am not impressed withthat argument. It seems to me that the public cares most of all aboutM1 and, to some extent, M2. But I don't believe the public would bealarmed if we recognize that M3 is tending to run very high relativeto its range as it has in recent months and that we allowed for thatby increasing the band to 6-1/2 to 9-1/2 percent. I would favor alsoa range for total credit of 9 to 12 percent", " But your assumption that M3 will stay within therange is based on your expectations that interest rates will--MR. AXILROD. Yes. I would say that's equally important toM2", "MR. AXILROD. As it turns out, Mr. Chairman, it's more usualto change the tentative ranges than to adopt them. Of the fourrelevant years--1981 through 1984--only in 1982 were the tentativeranges agreed on [in July] adopted [the following February]. In 1981,1983, and 1984 they were changed in varying ways. In 1983 there was asubstantial change in M1: that's when it was reduced to a monitoringrange and was raised to 4 to 8 percent as compared to the 2-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent tentative range. In other [years] the changes were in M2or other broad aggregates", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we get into this problem partlybecause I suspect the inflation forecast is too high--not to beat adead horse anymore. There's room for real growth under any of thealternatives in here [if we had] more modest inflation assumptions.The choice boils down to this. I'm not going to make everybody happy;we have four targets here and 12 members and the permutations andcombinations of that grouping are enormous. The only proposal I canmake is to stick with something like alternative II; I don't know howmany people that would make directly happy. Most people have beenfocusing on M1, so we can talk about modifying some of those otherranges if that's important. But I would also say that we ought togive the message--we do that in the short-term targets, I suppose--that we don't mind being above that cone for the time being. I wouldbe inclined, in the interest of reconciliation if nothing else, and it-43-2/12-13/85may be meaningful, to put a sentence in the directive indicating thatwe wouldn't necessarily be unhappy if growth were in the upper part ofthe range. I don't like the sentence that's there now; and I don'tknow why we should single out M1 given all the comments either. I'dhave a sentence to the effect that: \"The Committee agreed that growthin the monetary aggregates more generally in the upper parts of theirranges for 1985 may be appropriate, depending upon\" something. Oneapproach would be to use \"provided inflationary tendencies remainsubdued.\" But I might say something about business too. I don't knowquite what we should say. I don't think we want to say \"would beappropriate provided business is weak.\" That sounds a little odd.It's the fact of the matter, but it might suggest we're anticipatingsomething in that connection.Let me just try this. We have a majority that wantssomething like alternative II; it's not a very large majority but someof those said they didn't want to put in anything about being in theupper part of the range. The obvious accommodation is something likealternative II but some acknowledgment that growth in the upper partof the range might be possible. I wouldn't put it as an aim; I'd sayit might be appropriate under certain conditions. An alternative, ashas been expressed, is to go to something like 4 to 7-1/2 percent andnot say anything about being in the upper part. Let me try broadlythose two alternatives. We'll return to fine tuning M3 and creditlater. Looking at M1: Who would have a preference for leaving it at 4to 7 percent but with some acknowledgment--the precise language to bedetermined--first of all, that running above the range now isn'thorribly prejudging the short-term decision; and secondly, that wewouldn't be amazed and may well find it desirable to be in the upperpart of the range, depending on how things develop. To have aspecific acknowledgement of that is one alternative. The otheralternative would be just to go to 4 to 7-1/2 percent and leave it atthat", " Everybody knows we studiously ignore M3 anyway,so whether we have 6 to 9 percent or 6 to 33 percent or whatever--MR. RICE. Since it doesn't matter, why not raise it", "MR. WALLICH. I definitely would not. I simply don'tunderstand why we have to raise all the ranges, or almost all of them,when we've had lower inflation than expected. It seems to me adevastating signal", "MR. PARTEE. Well, to me 4 percent is desirable and 4-1/2percent is acceptable. We're starting off with an unemployment rate-46-2/12-13/85of 7.4 percent. There was talk about that being the full employmentlevel; I certainly don't agree with that. I think we have room to godown; I don't think we know; we have to probe and see. I think weprobably could have 4-1/2 percent growth for this year withoutdifficulty", "MR. BALLES. I said if you think it might. That's what I'massuming ranges are for: to allow for realistic possibilities. We'renot committed to go to the upper end by setting it 1/2 percentagepoint higher, but it allows us to in case that develops, as our staffand the Board staff seem to think is likely. If it doesn't, so muchthe better. We're not committed to going to 7 or 7-1/2 percent.Governor Wallich raised the question: Why are we increasing ourranges. My answer to that, Henry, would be that it appears to us thatthe demand for money is increasing and one should allow for that inthe determination of the ranges. If we don't, I think we'll get thekind of results we did in the first half of 1982 when we tightened upat a time that, in my opinion, we should not have and we drove theeconomy into a deeper recession than might otherwise have been thecase. And it was because, in my case at least, of a belatedrecognition that the velocity of money was declining. I don't want tomake that mistake again", "MR. WALLICH. It wasn't declining last year; and 7 percent M1growth was associated during the '70s with rapidly acceleratinginflation", "MR. BALLES. Well, Mr. Chairman, the same factors thatinfluenced me on my views on the long-term ranges are coming intoplay, particularly in the short term here. My view, and I hope it iscorrect, is that we're experiencing an increase in the demand formoney as a direct reflection and delayed reaction to the drop ininterest rates in the latter part of last year. To slow money downfrom the rapid growth rates of December and January would require aconsiderable increase in interest rates, which I don't want to see,particularly in view of the precarious situation of agriculturalloans, international loans--the whole shooting match.

Some of those were absorbed at levels that nowdon't look very good. So that has been overhanging the market and[the intervention] has called attention to the fact that theauthorities can come in with a pretty heavy hand and do theseoperations. This is undoubtedly part of the reason, but not the onlyreason, why the markets themselves are in such a sloppy condition.People are increasingly unwilling to be market makers out there.

And Iwould hate for us to be a disruptive force by backing away from them", "MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix", "3/26/85MR. WALLICH. I find somewhat deplorable the way in which thelatest number always dominates the year's forecast. Earlier in theyear there was a widespread upgrading of projections for the year.Now we've had a month of relatively weak numbers and everybody isbacktracking. I think one has to expect that with a moderate rate ofgrowth the numbers will not always be strongly in one direction or theother and perhaps restrain one's eagerness always to take the latestnumbers into account. I'm speaking to market forecasters. I would bewilling to say we have made what seems to be a reasonable projection.Until there is pretty clear evidence that it is going off track weought to stick by that and not follow the monthly ups and downs", "MR. MARTIN. But, Henry, I would suggest to you that it isn'tjust a monthly up and down. In the Greenbook, the staff has reviseddownward the first-quarter data and has revised downward certain otherdata that apply to periods of more than a month. They are looking ata 3.3 percent real growth number, which is down something like 10percent. Certainly, the caveats are more imbedded in the materialthat is being reviewed than was true in February. We have just heardcaveats with regard to business fixed investment. I would agree withthose and add the comment, for whatever it's worth, that if I todaystill had the responsibility for Homart Development Co., I would notbe starting one office building, one shopping center of any size, orone multiple unit dwelling in the United States of America. If youlook at the curve of the starts in that area, it suggests somethingthat is headed for explosion--an explosion downward. Okay, animplosion. That curve is just unsustainable in that part of theinvestment area broadly defined. We have seen since mid-1984 adecline in orders in category after category of business fixedinvestments. It's not just technology and it's not just heavyindustry; it's virtually across the board. And it seems to me that a6 percent growth in business fixed investment, broadly defined, for1985 is just getting to be a less and less probable event.I would add to that the fragilities that were alluded to. Ifyou pick up The Wall Street Journal this morning, there is a storyabout a major Canadian bank. Are we going to go a month without alarge financial institution surprising the markets. Are we going togo two or three weeks without or some bank coming upwith another $70 million loss in Paraguay or Ecuador or somewhere.This drumbeat of negative news is having its effect, if you canbelieve the part of the surveys of consumer attitudes toward financialinstitutions and finance. It seems to me that we have a very slow--not a moderate--growth, a very fragile financial system, and a verydubious [outlook for] business fixed investment, housing, and non-residential investment. We are looking at a very vulnerable year", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me make a few comments, partlyreinforced by going to a few board of directors meetings of variousFederal Reserve Banks recently and hearing businessmen from theindustrial sector of the economy talking. I think there are quitedifferent trends in the industrial sector and elsewhere in theeconomy. But I don't think there is any doubt that the present tradepicture and the prospects for the trade picture are having effects.The question is whether it is cutting the legs off of any expansion inthat area or worse. We have seen the analysis. We have seen theevent in the past couple of years where a lot of domestic demand hasgone abroad, perhaps most strikingly in the area of investment goods.-8-3/26/85I think the question now--and the answer is not fully ascertainablebut there are some symptoms--is whether the level of the dollar andthe competitiveness of foreign goods are cutting investmentexpenditures--not just the supply of investment spending but thewillingness to invest at all. Well, I mean \"at all\" as a relativeterm; let me say \"at anything like the momentum that it had before.\"We have had a long series of production and orders figures that, withthe exception of February which had some recovery, have been prettyflat. I don't have the sense, and computer manufacturers don't seemto have the sense, that there is any great thrust anymore in that areaof the economy that had been the strongest. Now, that may be partlybecause supply conditions have increased but the indications are forless robustness there. And, of course, in many other areas of heavierequipment there wasn't much recovery at all anyway. In the commercialconstruction area that Governor Martin alluded to, the current figuresare still going up strongly but it's hard to believe that they aregoing to go up indefinitely. New single-family housing is doing allright and could continue to do all right; I don't know how much of anexpansionary force it is going to be. The mining and energy areasdon't seem to be going anyplace, to put it kindly. I don't think thefarmers are going to be a great source of expansionary thrust in theeconomy in terms of what they buy. So that's just reinforcing all thequestions that already have been cited on the investment side.In the meanwhile, consumption so far is doing all right andservice spending, of course, goes on. I might mention automobiles,which are doing just fine, but I don't know whether there are anyprospects for any increases there partly because if the demandincreased, I don't think the manufacturers--many of whom are more[unintelligible]--want to either increase capacity or employment inthat industry. They have gone about as far they are going to go. Ifthere are going to be any more cars sold, my sense is that they aregoing to be imported. So, while that's been a good area, it's not anarea of great upward thrust. I can't avoid having the feeling thatthe kind of forecast the staff has may be as reasonable as otherforecasts, as we always say, but it looks to me like something withinthe limits of a ceiling. It's hard to see where we can get morethrust out of the economy than they are projecting and I can seeconditions arising, particularly on the import side, that mightundercut the kind of forecast they have.On the inflation side, I think we also have a two-sidedsituation. On the services side, prices tend to go up with somemomentum, and I'm not sure that's going to change. I'm sure it's notgoing to change much in the short run; it may be getting a littlebetter but it's not suddenly going to turn toward stability. Priceson the goods side of the economy are basically flat. So, it's alittle hard to see in these circumstances--and I'm assuming no majorchanges in monetary policy, fiscal policy, the dollar, and foreigndevelopments--any great break-out there. Of course, we have thebackground of the financial strains that have been mentioned. I'll atleast stop there and you can all shoot at that analysis. Mr. Boehne", "MR. PARTEE. Well, like some of the others, I think thefinancial fragility is the new and potentially disruptive developmentthat we're having in the economy. The Ohio situation, of course, didget a lot of national publicity--far more than Mississippi did eightyears ago. That indicates something of the kind of concerns thatpeople could have, but it's not the only thing. At our last meetingwe were very much steeped and involved in the question of agriculturalfinance. Now, I don't think that has improved any in this period oftime; it's just that Ohio took precedence over it and got moreattention. The general savings and loan situation is pretty weak, aswe all know, and the Home Loan Bank Board has been working hard to tryto cut back on some of the lending that is totally unwarranted thathas been done there. We're still subject to accidents, and not justlike ESM. I noticed, Bob, that the strongest Texas bank reported inthe last couple of days a surprising loss in loans to its directors;and it's just [without] question about the best of the Texas banks.Of course, is probably accident prone, and who knowswhat the next thing might be that will affect them. My view of thematter is that this probably will be affecting both peoples' attitudestoward the stability of finance and also the attitudes of lenderstoward what their posture ought to be. I don't think it's at all asecret that the Comptroller of the Currency is taking a much tougherview in examinations now; he is classifying a lot more loans. And thenational banks have a lot of exposure out there now that they didn'thave a couple of years ago. I think that affects their attitudes and-11-3/26/85the Home Loan Bank Board is affecting S&L attitudes. So, both on thelending side--the availability of credit, which is something thatSteve mentioned--and in terms of public attitudes, we have a new riskthat I think has grown with the passage of time. And that probablywill be reflected by a change in liquidity preferences. There is alittle of that apparently in the market with Ohio but it could becomevery much stronger at some point in the future. I think it makes lessdependable--not that they are dependable ever--but less dependablethan usual the observation of the monetary numbers, because we don'tknow what kinds of attitudinal changes might be reflected in thosenumbers now or in the period ahead. I don't disagree with the staffforecast as a normative forecast. But I do think that the risks,stemming largely from the financial side, are on the down side", "MR. KICHLINE. I'll get around to that. In terms of theprice side, for the fixed-weight measure we have 3.1 percent and theyhave 3.3 percent, so we're off by two-tenths. All of this isattributable to shifting weights--and Mr. Truman's area is part of theproblem because it's a quirky thing having to do with oil importsbeing subtracted out on the import side. We imported less oil andthere is no offset showing up in inventories. So, whether or not itis entirely statistical like that--. It may indeed be revised away.-14-3/26/85If not, we would anticipate that the following quarter we could besurprised with a more favorable outcome", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're expecting a higher real number andthey say that real is going to be too low. Maybe it will be, but whenyou look at the assumptions they have made to put that figure togetheryou're not automatically led to that conclusion. They assume that thetrade balance will diminish from the January figure to a not very highlevel. All that has to happen is to have a higher trade balance. Ifit ran at the January level, that's going to knock off half the GNPgrowth that they have. They have no cutback in inventoryaccumulation; in fact, they have a slight increase from the Januarylevel, if I remember. These are figures they don't know at all andnobody knows at all. But just glancing at it and making somejudgment, I don't think you can argue that the assumptions they havemade are wildly on the down side. If I were making those assumptions,I would make them the other way. We just don't know what the tradebalance is and [whether] production is flat or down", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. As far as the economy is concerned,I too have a pretty murky crystal ball at this time. We have aforecast that actually is a couple tenths stronger than the Greenbookforecast in terms of real GNP. I don't see any particular reason tochange that right now, although I would concede that the balance ofrisks at this point seems to be on the down side rather than the upside. I do think that business attitudes, and perhaps consumerattitudes as well, have soured a bit even since we met last. As hasalready been said, part of that reflects the now broad-based--vergingon universal--concerns about imports and the way in which they areaffecting the domestic economy. I myself also sense a renewed senseof skepticism, notwithstanding Mr. Domenici's efforts, on the budget.At this point I think that skepticism, at least as it reaches me, isbordering on cynicism. Obviously, the Ohio situation and relatedproblems have taken some toll; I'll get back to that in a minute.On the price side, I don't pay any attention to the GNPdeflator but I must confess in dissecting the producer and consumerprice indexes for the last couple of months, I do see a couple ofthings there that bother me. I can't imagine why they are there. Forexample, in the wholesale area for finished goods--or producer goodsor whatever we call them now--there was a detectable uptick in therate of increase in both January and February, which gets sloughed offas being used cars one month and something else another month. I seea little of the same thing, again hardly detectable, in the consumerarea. Neither of those things in and of themselves is of greatconcern; but they are of concern in the sense that I can't imagine whythey are there at all under the current circumstances.I certainly would associate myself with those who say that insome ways the greatest concern right now is this financial fragility.But I end up a little differently than some who have spoken. I mustsay I am very hard pressed, notwithstanding the efforts of theComptroller and others, to see any renewed burst of conservatism ordiscipline in lending policies and financial market practices ingeneral. If you look at just the growth of total credit, you don'tsee it. If you look at the ways in which activities are beingfinanced off balance sheets and so forth, you don't see it. To thecontrary, you can still find--without looking very hard--instances inwhich banking organizations are moving in the direction of moreliberal lending policies in a very deliberate sense. So I would have,if anything, more concern there in that I do not see any real hard-16-3/26/85pervasive evidence of the kind of discipline in the financial sectorthat I think we ultimately are going to need. So far as the Ohiosituation is concerned, I think the jury is still out. Karen probablyknows more than I do about this, but it seems to me a distinctpossibility that we still are facing a situation in which smalldepositors may end up losing money. If indeed that is the case, Iwould suggest that the jury may still be out in terms of thepsychology of that and how that plays out over time. I'm not surewhat to do about these financial soft spots. On the one hand, youmight argue that a more accommodative policy would help; but to theextent that underlying discipline isn't there in the first place, Isuppose you could argue that a more accommodative policy could hurtthem. I'm not sure that we can solve that problem by the conventionalkind of wiggles in monetary policy. But I think it is a very, verysignificant overhang on the overall situation right now", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I want to comment briefly on thehousing market outlook, partly because there have been comments whichwere rather optimistic in that area that I want to dissent from. Ifyou follow the secondary market reports, it's clear that fixed-ratemortgage rates have been rising week-by-week. There have been someweeks in which the jump has been 10 or 15 basis points. We are allaware that there is a good deal less use of adjustable rate mortgagesnow. And to the extent that there's a shift in the borrower's purviewhere onto the [lender's], you're talking about a 233 basis pointincrease in the stated rate, going from adjustable to fixed onaverage--at least as far as Freddie Mac data are concerned. Theborrowers who are in the lower down payment category are facing higherprivate mortgage insurance premiums today if they are unfortunateenough to have to use that device. And that premium, of course, goesto the qualification of the borrower as does the higher rate that isshown in the secondary market data. The mortgage insurers arereporting very heavy underwriting losses, which means that theircredit analyses are more severe. Some of these companies are going tolose in last year plus this year an amount equal to their wholecapital base of only a few years ago. So, they are likely to beslightly more conservative in their underwriting. The same commentcan apply to the mortgage originator who faces delinquency ratesstarting with 30-day delinquencies of 5 or 6 or 7 percent--rates theyhave not faced in their whole careers, unless they're up in years abit. And, of course, the rate of foreclosure losses is significant.The motivation of the borrower of having an investment as well asshelter is diminishing in many sections of the country. Indeed, therehas been deflation in housing prices in certain price brackets incertain parts of the country. So, for us to attain the forecast of1.75 million single-family units plus multifamily units I don't thinkis feasible. Added to the investment downside risk, I think, is avery substantial downside risk in housing", "MR. PARTEE. How do you feel about multifamilies, Pres", "MS. SEGER. I want to thank the Chairman for visiting withsome of the same people who have been talking to me for the last sixmonths. If there's one theme that I get from these individuals, it'sbasically that their concerns involve the strong dollar--the surge inimports and the loss of export markets. These people include anyonefrom farmers to manufacturers but are primarily manufacturers. Iheard within just the last couple of weeks, for example, that FordMotors is closing the tractor plant that's right near where I havelived in the Detroit suburbs because they can no longer manufactureprofitably in this country. They're going to move the operationoverseas. I would just like to point out that once these movementsare made they don't quickly reverse course. The dollar could take adive in six months and it's unlikely, in my judgment, that they wouldthen move back. So, I think the longer this goes on the more seriousthe consequences. And I don't think that we should take them lightly.Another thing I'd like to mention involves what I see as therisks in the staff forecast. As a cynic looking at consumer spending,what I see besides a lot of the spending going to imports is a lot ofspending supported by credit--those magic plastic cards and thingslike that. In the auto industry, particularly, there are specialterms--extending from 4 years to 5 years the term on a new car loan inorder to get the monthly payment down sufficiently to qualify a buyer.You're living on borrowed time when that goes on to a very greatdegree. Also, there are tremendous special rate inducements; 8.8percent is one number that you see, again as a means of trying to dragthe people in off the streets and to get the monthly payments down sothat they qualify. I think this is producing some good auto salesnumbers at the moment, but it is the kind of foundation that to melooks like mush. The risk in business fixed investment has beenmentioned by numerous people but I will repeat it. There are highvacancies in office buildings; there are major lags here and I don'tthink we've seen the full impact of these tax reform proposals on-24-3/26/85business spending. In the multifamily residential area, I would sayditto. There are substantial vacancies in apartment buildings and,also, I don't believe the tax response has shown up entirely.In terms of the dominant factors I think we should look at--and maybe this reflects my background, having held their hands andnursed the sick thrifts in 1981 and 1982--I see this fragility of thefinancial system as going far beyond Ohio. It is not that Ohio was anunimportant event. It certainly was a media event and made a lot ofindividuals aware of this problem. But I think there would be a lotof sick people around this country if they knew the condition of therest of the thrifts and if they knew that probably a good 10 percentwill go in the soup between now and sometime next year. And that'snot because of somebody dipping in the till or a governor actingoverly enthusiastically. These are fundamental problems with solvencyand insolvency. And think what that does to FSLIC. To me it's likebeing reinsured by somebody who is three weeks from bankruptcy ratherthan bankrupt already. But I don't think that that word is generallyout and that the problems are generally appreciated.The other factor I think we ought to give primary attentionto in formulating monetary policy is this dollar strength that I'vealready referred to. I would be extremely concerned about any furtherrise in interest rates. I don't care if M1 growth goes to 37 percentnext month, which I don't think it will. But this is the one thing--in case people haven't followed the thrift situation carefully--thatdoes impact on thrifts very directly. It is the one thing that we dohave an influence on that does hurt them or does influence them. Ifthe increase in money market rates that has occurred since the lastFOMC meeting--30 to 75 basis points or whatever it was--would just goon to total one percentage point and if that were factored into thecost of funds for thrifts, it would put somewhere between 50 and 75percent of the industry in a loss situation. And that's on top of theones that are already staring at insolvency. So, I think thatinterest rates are the connecting link and I don't think that we canignore them if we're really concerned about this fragility problem.In fact, if I had been told at the last FOMC meeting that Steve andPeter would have been producing interest rate increases of 30 to 75basis points, I would have dissented. So I hope that our move todaywill be moderate and that whatever we do we will take careful noticeof what our steps are doing and will be doing to interest rates", "MR. RICE. I agree that this is not the time to tighten. Butit's also probably not the time to allow money growth to expandsubstantially above the band", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman we have a conflict between M1and the economic data. It seems to me that the more sensible thingwould be to stay where we are until we see how this conflict isresolved. If we have a second quarter of strong M1 and relativelysluggish economic indicators, as we had for example in 1982, then Ithink we simply have to revise the target for M1. I think there is areal possibility we might have to do that. But in the meantime, Ithink alternative B is the most sensible course", "MS. HORN. I would favor a borrowing level of about $500million; that would put me in the \"B minus\" range. And I think theadjustment from 6-1/2 to 6 percent on M1 would be appropriate", "MR. PARTEE. Right", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a wonderful 6, 7, and 8 percent, andit will have no discernible effect on what we do. Now, whether theborrowings will have a discernible effect on what we do, we have somedifferences of opinion. My own bias would be on the lower side ofthat. In all this hypothesizing about what we might do, it's easy ifmoney runs low; if it runs high, I'd want to know if it was runninghigh after three consecutive months of decline in industrialproduction and the dollar 3 percent higher than it is now or whetherit was running high with industrial production rising and the dollarfalling. Then I would have a quite different attitude. I don't knowhow you forecast that at this point. And that's my problem. I have asneaking suspicion that one of those is more likely than the other,which biases my attitude toward this a bit. The low end of thepreferences on borrowing is roughly the $350 to $400 million range;then there are those who said a $500 million range and those who said$500 million or more", "MS. SEGER. I wanted $350 million; I don't think I said it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm not so sure about that. No, Ithink that would be a mistake, because we might get more demand forexcess reserves. If we set a net borrowing target, that's puttingmore pressure on the market; I think that's in effect what happenedlast time. And I think we would not be getting the results that wewanted. What we do is make some judgments ex post, as a result ofthis meeting, that we have made an excess reserve assumption that istoo low, though too low is a kind of qualified [assessment]. Wedidn't mind that so much when M1 was rising rapidly. If the businessnews isn't too weak or isn't doing anything extraordinary, we lean onthat side or tolerate that side. If we're not so tolerant of that, wewill be a little more aggressive in making sure that borrowings don'tget too much above where we're talking about. It's very hard to judgethat mechanically, because it depends upon what the market is thinking--how high the market shoves the federal funds rate. Therefore, wecan get some surprisingly high borrowing in the beginning of theperiod, and there's not much we can do about it, once it is borrowed,without really putting out the money later in the week", "MR. GRAMLEY. If I thought that were going to happen, I wouldshare Roger's concern. I would rather have the market say: \"There hasbeen no change in policy and the Fed is even-keeling now; it hasn'tpanicked because of those high growth numbers for money early in theyear; on the other hand, it is not prepared to lower interest ratesbecause it appears that the economy is going into recession.\" So, ifRoger is right, I'd rather see $450 million.

Well, it is certainly the case that theiroperating capital account budget surplus position has improved overthe past year, and we think it will stay reasonably positive. Lastyear there was some spurt in construction outlays, but on the wholethere was not a tremendous growth of state and local expenditures.The first quarter of this year doesn't look particularly strong. Andwhile there is a lot of talk about a backlog of repair and renovationwork that needs to be done, we just don't see the evidence of it. Ithink there is a great deal of caution on the part of many state andlocal government units about forging ahead with spending programspartly because, given taxpayer attitudes, they don't think they aregoing to be able to keep all those tax revenues that they got fromincreasing taxes in earlier years. Then there is the question of whatwill happen both with tax reform and federal spending. Both the Houseand Senate proposals spell the end of grants to state and localgovernment revenue sharing by 1987. So, I think there is a good dealof caution being exercised", "MR. MARTIN. I would like to add some rail cars to thelocomotive of expectations already alluded to. I am struck by thecumulative nature of the vulnerabilities of markets and of thefinancial side of the economy. Notice that in our first two reportsthis morning there were some comments on the variability in foreignexchange markets. Think of the junk bond phenomenon, which continuesinto this year. The SEC indicated that they are not disposed tointervene in the merger and acquisition surge. You are talking about$80 or $90 billion at an annual rate of equity retirement replaced bydebt. In the commodity markets and the COMEX in New York, the threelargest traders failed to meet a margin call one day, though it wasonly a temporary phenomenon. As for the LDC debt deterioration, weget reports out of Argentina on a series of private bank failures; thegovernment steps in and this passes. Capital flight has resumed fromthe LDCs and various measures we're all familiar with are beingimplemented there. It is not all one-sided, of course. We have whatsounds like favorable news out of Venezuela and the Philippines, butstill there is the onus of this capital flight situation. Newspapersin the last few days have had the Coldwell Bankers survey, which talksabout $25 billion plus of nonresidential construction coming onstream--80 percent above 1980. I think there is a kind of frenzy ofoffice building and other kinds of activity. Sooner or later that isgoing to put pressure on major money funds around the country becausetens of billions of dollars are coming in there, resulting inoverbuilding. Multiple unit dwellings are hung on the revenue Mbonds, industrial revenue bonds--techniques that are a tax phenomenonin part. Vacancies are accumulating there. As for government bonddealers, obviously, we know the work that has been done in that areaby the New York Fed. But I wonder if we weren't so concerned with thecost and we weren't so concerned with the smooth running of this5/21/85enormous market, if maybe we might have come up with something alittle less voluntary and more like the rulemaking being extended inthe municipal securities market. But we have the vulnerabilities tocontend with and who wants to take that chance. Ed Gray has talkedabout $100 billion in savings and loan assets in savings and loansthat are essentially defunct. Well, that's $100 billion out of anindustry that is 10 times that large that he has found; and I wonderwhat else is out there that could come around to haunt us.The President is about to go on the road to present the so-called tax reform and simplification program. There is going to be agreat deal of attention to top bracket rates and a capital gainstreatment a little more favorable than the Treasury proposal. Is thatgoing to add to a speculative bubble that seems to be occurring inmarket after market after market. Where can we find a financialmarket that doesn't have this feeling of a kind of froth in it rightnow. And how many of these things need to go down in one day, oneweek, or one month before we talk about expectations and attitudes.Government securities and mortgage-backed securities markets areenormous markets trading hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollarsnow. And one day, Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac may decidethey are not going to settle. Well, all that [happened in the past]and there were negotiations and so forth and every one of thesepotential crises worked out fine. Everybody saluted and got in [line]and did what they had to do and it worked. But what are the dangersthat we are facing here.I am not so concerned about the tiny bit of evidence of priceincrease; I certainly am concerned about unemployment and the lack ofemployment growth and the 0.7 percent real growth figure that thatimplies. Think of the cumulative nature of financial vulnerabilitiesof the country right now. I think I voted for--maybe I even made themotion, I can't remember--the [recent] discount rate cut. I think weshould have done that. But my goodness, let us be aware of what we donext in terms of this tremendous pervasive, ubiquitous, financialvulnerability that we have here. That is my cheerful message", "MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, reverting for a moment to thesimilarities and dissimilarities of the Board staff's forecast to ourstaff's forecast: We have similar views on the outlook going throughthe fourth quarter of this year in a number of major areas includingconsumption, capital spending, government spending, and inventories.Where we differ, and where our staff turns out to be somewhat lessoptimistic than the Board's staff, is with respect to our expectationthat imports will be up somewhat more because of the recent behaviorof the dollar and that housing will be up somewhat less than the Boardstaff's projection because of the weakness in disposable income. So,even though our two forecasts tend to converge, ours is up a littlefrom last month and the Board staff's outlook for real GNP has beenrevised downward this time from last month. We are stillsignificantly lower for the year as a whole, showing a 2 percent realGNP gain, fourth quarter to fourth quarter, versus the Board staff'sview of 2-1/2 percent. Whether it is 2 or 2-1/2 percent, it is stillgoing to be a pretty weak year. I share the view that we areexperiencing already--and are likely to see more of it as the yeargoes on--a pretty sluggish economy operating below its potential, inlarge part because of an enormous distortion and imbalance that hasalready been touched on, particularly relating to the impact of thehuge federal deficit and the high dollar and the import surge that hasresulted from all of that.Like Si, we recently had our meeting of our council on smallbusiness and agriculture in response to your suggestion. We got awhole earful of bad news and I, too, was surprised by some of theanecdotes that we heard. For example, one of the small business firmsrepresented was a very small manufacturer up inOregon, which is outside the Portland metropolitan area. It turns outthat they export a good deal of equipment all around the world;more than half of their business in fact is foreign. We really gotsome graphic illustrations of what the high dollar has done to thissmall little business. We found similar illustrations from otherrepresentatives of small concerns that were there. Contrary toconditions in your District, Si, or yours, Roger, where the familyfarm still predominates, as you know in the West it is the large scalefarm that predominates. And even representatives of those agri-businesses were singing the blues and gave some pretty graphicillustrations of how bad business was, not just because of the highinterest rates but also the strong dollar. Cotton is one of the majorproducts of our agriculture in California and traditionally about 80percent of it has been exported. You can imagine what the high dollarhas done to cotton exports; that particular business is in bigtrouble.Based on the latest information we have, nearly all of thenine states in our District experienced an increase in unemploymentfractionally; and in the latest month for which we have data for totalemployment, it actually dropped a bit. Electronics, which had beenone of our stronger growth industries for some years is now flat;manufacturing has been rather weak except for defense spending; andlumber is still a disaster. Aerospace is the one industry still goingfairly strong. On balance, adding up all these strong and weak areas,it is clear that the weaknesses predominate and that we are seeing inthe West what we are seeing in the national statistics: a pretty-10-5/21/85sluggish performance. Therefore, when we get around to the policydiscussion, that would be the reason I would like to err, if we aregoing to err at all, on the side of ease", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think the major concern iswhether the economy is going to rebound moderately in the second halfas projected in the staff forecast or whether it is going to continuealong the present sluggish path. Now, if one is convinced that theeconomy is going to perform along the lines of the forecast in thesecond half, I don't think we need to worry too much; the worry thenwould be about next year. While I think the staff forecast probablycaptures the most likely outcome, the factors supporting that outlookdo not seem to me to be very strong. While we probably can expectcontinued strength from residential construction, the rate of growthin business fixed investment and consumption expenditures will bedeclining. Yet, the 3 to 3-1/2 percent growth that we look to dependson some moderate strength in both these categories. So, it is veryhard to be confident that there is this basic strength in spendingthat's going to produce this outcome. With resource utilizationsignificantly below capacity, with capacity utilization most recentlyfalling--and even if it stabilizes from this point on, it will stillbe at a relatively low level--and with the outlook for unemploymentnot very reassuring in that it is not declining significantly, itseems to me that the economy is vulnerable on the down side. Thereseems to be very little risk of excessive growth in thesecircumstances. So, I would say that what we can reasonably expect isan economy that is, as Governor Martin put it, very vulnerable. Itcould go either way; I see no strong momentum in either direction.I think the inflation outlook is moderate. Most of therecent influences on the inflation rate are probably temporary; I amnot convinced that the recent spike in wage costs is more thantemporary. I would say, therefore, that with the inflation outlookmoderate we should not be satisfied with anything less than a 3 to3-1/2 percent rate of growth in the second half. And I think weshould make our policy judgments with that particular bias in mind.Thank you", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, looking at the economyfirst and taking a little longer perspective on it, I think the-12-5/21/85numbers would suggest that domestic final demand really has beenperforming more or less as expected for the third year of the recoveryand maybe even a little better than expected. But the wild card, ashas been amply reflected so far in the discussion, insofar as the GNPand production, etc., is the external side. Against that backdrop, Istill lean to the view that for the balance of the year real GNP islikely to be growing in the 3 to 3-1/2 percent range. And I thinkthat this recent rather pronounced decline in interest rates providesa little further measure of insurance in that direction. At the sametime, that kind of forecast is one that assumes a much smaller dragcoming from the external sector over the balance of the year. Whileeconomists seem pretty comfortable as a group with that, I will bedarned if I can find a businessman--whether in small or largebusiness--who agrees with that. I think that remains, therefore, thewild card.I agree with those who say that the nonresidential sector--the construction sector in particular--looks very vulnerable at thispoint. On this question of financial shocks and disturbances, thepoint has to be made--whatever else one might want to say about them--that to the extent that they are being managed and contained, they arebeing managed and contained with a very high degree of governmentinvolvement. Whether it is front page news or not, that has been thecase. Indeed, what I see almost daily is the situation where \"freemarkets will take care of things\" is a slogan only until people thinkthey are on the hook. And then that slogan goes out the window in oneheck of a hurry. I would like to say that I can see some reemergenceof discipline growing out of this cumulation of problems, but I don'tsee it. The leaders in banking and investment banking institutions,foreign and domestic, have reached the point where I think they wantdiscipline. But in a setting in which all of the institutional sandhas been taken out of the wheels, they don't seem to know how to getit. I think that those vulnerabilities in that setting are somethingto be concerned about.On the inflation side, I keep coming out on the side of beinguneasy. I look at the numbers and I listen to what everybody says andI am tempted to reach the same conclusion that Governor Rice juststated: that these are all temporary things. But I can't quite getmyself comfortable with that. Even if these things are temporary, therate of inflation that we are seeing right now, against the backdropof the exchange rate that we are seeing right now, still strikes me ashigh. I am concerned that if the inflation rate were to start tocreep up from where it is now, even by a percentage point or so, andproduce the situation in which we felt at some point we had to moveagainst that, it would be a very, very difficult thing to engineer, toput it mildly. But more importantly, I think some of this financialmarket situation that we are seeing still reflects a kind of residualpoint of view that says somewhere down the road inflation is going tobail this situation out. So, I can't bring myself to be sanguineabout the inflationary situation, even though I certainly don't thinkit is something that has to be the number one priority for policy.But I think it has to be watched very, very closely", "MR. STERN. First, in terms of our District economy, I wouldcharacterize that as simply more of the same. The split that we have-13-5/21/85had, which may be most easily described as urban versus rural,persists. The economy in the urban areas--from the city of Rochesterto Sioux Falls to Rapid City--continues to do reasonably well onbalance; the economy in the rural areas is very difficult at best.And that has been the situation for quite some time.On the national level, without wanting to belabor theobvious, the key word in my mind is uncertainty. As I look at theGreenbook forecast, my own view of the situation is that the economyis going to have to hustle just to get that 2.3 percent real growth inthe second quarter, given the monthly trajectory in the first quarter.But having said that, I expect that the economy may do a little betterthan the Greenbook suggests in the second half of the year, largelybecause I think the interest sensitive sectors of the economy may dosomewhat better. But I would re-emphasize the term uncertainty. I donot have a great deal of confidence in that particular scenario,although it is the one that, under the circumstances, I am inclined togo with.We too have had our first meeting of our advisory council onsmall business and agriculture, and we included labor as well. Mostof the news would have to be described as grim, particularly from thepeople associated with the agricultural sector. The focus of concernseems to have shifted a bit, however, in the last several months. Thefocus used to be on the producer--the farmer. I think now the focusis shifting to his or her lender, be it the Farm Credit System or theagricultural banks. There seems to be rather vague but mountingconcern about the status of some of those lenders", " I thought you indicated earlier that thatwasn't going to bring it down, but I--MR. WALLICH. Well, the inflation should come down; theunemployment and the growth rate will be less satisfactory under that[scenario]", "MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, I don't really have anythingpositive to bring to the table today. The situation in the EleventhDistrict pretty well mirrors what has been going on [in otherDistricts]. We obviously had a slowing in the first quarter of 1985.In the fourth quarter of 1984 we were pretty well paralleling thenation in terms of economic growth but our rate of increase hasslipped below the pace of the nation in the first quarter, in partbecause of absolutely declining activity in energy, electronics, andconstruction. Reference already has been made to office buildingconstruction and that sort of thing. Of course, we have had an awfullot of construction in our area as I've reported in the past. Theproblems in Houston are very well known; they are not unforeseenproblems; they have been trying to live with their problems for acouple of years. We are getting reports that now there is concern inAustin, which has been a very strong boom area; that seems to beslowing very significantly. As an example, based on a recent survey,we had about 18 million square feet of office space sitting empty inDallas in March--a vacancy rate of a little over 21 percent. But ontop of that in March we had another 25 million square feet of officespace under construction. The conclusion of the survey was that we-15-5/21/85are now approaching the end of a real estate cycle. I think I canaccept that statement. Agriculture remains weak. Our preliminaryindication on our latest survey of agricultural land prices actuallyshowed a little increase in 1984 but the first quarter now isbeginning to show a little decline. So, it looks as though those whosaid we are about a year to a year and a half behind the Midwest mightbe right.Having said all that, I would also share the view expressedby a few others regarding a little concern about overreacting on theside of ease, despite all the gloomy reports. The uncertainty isvery, very great and I still think it remains to be seen which way theeconomy is going to turn", "MR. MORRIS. Yes", "MR. MORRIS. Ten billion dollars out of the $26 billiongrowth in M1 has been in Super NOW accounts. In the prior 6 months,instead of growing at a $10 billion rate, they grew at less than $2billion. I think the answer to why M1 exhibited slow growth in themiddle of the year and very rapid growth in recent months is shown onthis chart. The interest rates on Super NOWs as administered by thebanks tend to be rather sluggish relative to market rates. When rateswent up sharply in the spring and summer, the opportunity cost ofholding Super NOWs relative to money market mutual funds rosesubstantially, so we had a very slow rate of growth in Super NOWs", " Asthe opportunity cost dropped--there's now only a one percentdifferential and I suspect in the weeks ahead it may drop below theone percent level--you would expect people to--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Before you say that, let me just ask: Aone percent differential between what and what. That's not what itlooks like", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Those institutions are under somepressure", "MR. PARTEE. You are prepared to accept those low M2 and M3numbers, though", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, my wife tells me I'm hard to pleaseand if she were here today she would say that my actions would provethat because I don't like any of the alternatives. I am mindful ofthe risks involved in this, but all of these alternatives would put usabove the upper band and also above the upper cone for M1. And I justdon't think anything would be gained by pushing M1 above the long-runtarget range; on the contrary, I think we have a lot to lose. Thefinancial market participants are well aware of these parallel bandsand if they see us running short-run targets above those bands, Ithink they are going to question our anti-inflationary resolve.Therefore, I couldn't accept anything above 5-1/2 percent, which wouldput us about at the top of the band. Actually I prefer 5 percent,which would give us a little breathing room. I don't know what kind-26-5/21/85of federal funds rate it would take to do that--it might take a littlebit of an uptick from where we are now--maybe where we were rightbefore the discount rate was cut. But if that had to be, I wouldrather see that than encounter the kind of scenario that Chuckoutlined earlier, where later we find that we were wrong and have topush it up still more. And if an increase is necessary, I think thatmight be some indication that the economy is really stronger than theGreenbook suggests.On this matter of not changing policy: If the Committee doesadopt alternative B, as I suppose it will, I think most people wouldregard that as a clear easing of the short-run policy stance that weadopted at the March meeting. Now, there is nothing in the directivelanguage to indicate that any easing has occurred but we have taken asmall step in that way. And in particular the term \"maintain\" in thefirst sentence of alternative B would be somewhat confusing. Irecognize the system we use and that the term \"degree of reservepressures\" refers to the level of borrowing. But I don't think thatthe outside world looks at it quite that narrowly, so they might notunderstand it. So, I think that's at least a question we ought toaddress if we go with \"B\" as I would guess the Committee probably isgoing to do", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would favor theaggregates specifications of alternative B. It doesn't bother megreatly that we are at, or near, or above the top of the parallel line[for M1], given the weakness we've had. I think it's an appropriateresponse, with the velocity [growth] being negative for what wouldappear to be two quarters. But what I am bothered about is theborrowing level suggested in the Bluebook: the $300 to $350 millionrange, which will achieve a 7-3/4 percent federal funds rate. If I'mcorrect in my thinking about that, if we maintain the same pressureson reserves that we've had in the past and have dropped the discountrate 1/2 percentage point, then that would suggest that in order toget a funds rate of 7-3/4 percent we would need to have the sameborrowing level that we had before we dropped the discount rate. Andif I understand the numbers right, that level is closer to $400million than it is to $300 to $350 million. I think borrowingaveraged $380 million over the intermeeting period. The point thatI'd like to make is that $300 to $350 million seems a little low and Iwould be a little more cautious so as to get to the 7-3/4 percent overtime. As a result, I would opt for a borrowing level of $375 to $425million with a target, obviously, of $400 million starting out. And Ishould think that if we're looking ultimately to move to 7-3/4 percentthat we can do it gradually.The other point that I would make, and I've made it before,is that seasonal borrowings are now running about $170 million, whichis half of the $300 to $350 million, and they will continue to buildover the upcoming intermeeting period. Therefore, with a $300-$350million borrowing objective, we're really getting very close toturning loose and actually pegging the federal funds rate, which Iwould oppose. Therefore, I would accept \"B\" and recommend a borrowingrange of $375 to $425 million, centering on $400 million for the startof the intermeeting period", "MR. PARTEE. Yes, I think that's right. But I'm hearing alsothat April was the lowest M2 growth since 1970. That goes back a longway. It may be strictly technical, but it gives me pause so long as Isee it there", "MR. PARTEE. No, they're going to make as many bad loans butthey're going to make fewer good ones", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Mr. Axilrod,] you had a rather selectiverecitation, I think, of the average borrowing", " Just yesterday there were--MR. AXILROD. It was high with all the thrifts in. They arenot all in extended credit yet. So we're running high with them in", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. \"In most recent weeks", "MR. BOEHNE. We could put M1 on a 6 to 7 percent basis andkeep the timeframe the same for all the aggregates. It's a littlepeculiar, isn't it, to have one aggregate over one time period and theother two over different periods", "MR. AXILROD. Yes, \"in light of that--\"SPEAKER(.). \"April performance.\"SPEAKER(.). \"In light of April", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The way this would read is: \"This actionis expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual rate ofaround 6 percent or a little higher while M2 and M3 are expected togrow more slowly over the quarter than anticipated earlier in thelight of their weakness in April\". The advantage of this is that ithas M1 a tad higher than what we said we envisaged before and it'simmediately balanced by saying M2 and M3 are considerably lower. Thealternative is just using the two-month growth rates. Or we can dowhat we have here. Which do you prefer. I guess I slightly preferthis", "\"MR. MARTIN. I'd prefer \"would/might", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. I don't like to get in a position ofsplitting hairs about this borrowing. But it seems to me that $350million taken by itself is kind of a threshold because if it goes downand stays down at $350 million or falls below that, there is a realdanger: I think we'd find ourselves again in a situation where itwould start pushing on the current level of the discount rate. And atthis juncture, I at least would not want us to fall into a situationwhere the behavior of the federal funds rate starts to give rise tomarket expectations of a further discount rate reduction. I hadmentioned $350 to $375 million, but I think the $350 million number atthis point is more than symbolically significant because I think itdoes get you into that range where I would start to get veryuncomfortable", "MR. AXILROD. Yes. There may be slight differences injudgment among the staff here. I had $300 to $350 million; there areother people, and I think Mr. Sternlight is one, who would say $350million or maybe a shade above for that. I don't know how one couldpossibly be certain on this", "MR. PARTEE. Where you said that there would be less growththan earlier anticipated for M2 and M3, don't you think we ought toput in the percentages earlier anticipated. There's no base thereunless somebody goes back and looks at--SPEAKER(.). Yes, that's right", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. Well, if that's all right andnobody wants to raise any further points, [we can vote]"], "1985FOMC19850710meeting.txt": ["MS. GREENE. [Statement--see Appendix", "MR. FORRESTAL. Could I ask a question about these consumerand mortgage delinquencies. While we have had some better experiencerecently, they are still very high on balance. Does that conflictwith what we are seeing in higher net wealth or is there anexplanation due to distribution of income. How do you explain thatapparent conflict", "MR. KICHLINE. Do you want two opposing answers. If Mikeanswers, you'll hear something very different from what you will hearfrom me. I would be concerned about it. Mike and a number of otherpeople are less concerned about it. It has been a topic of greatdebate among the staff looking at this. At least two things are a bitdifferent now, allegedly. One is that a portion of the increase isassociated with a supposedly growing use of credit cards forconvenience purposes; those balances get built into the numbers but,indeed, are paid off monthly and are presumed not to be a problem--just a shift in means of payment. The second argument is that theoutstandings were so depressed in 1980, 1981, and 1982 that,7/9-10/85basically, repayments have been lagging. And if that view is correct,with the strong debt taken on in 1983-84 and so far this year,repayments ought to be rising and, therefore, we ought to be seeingvery limited further growth. If you go back historically, I thinkit's hard to isolate that factor as one element, but it did peak inlate 1978 or early 1979 and things got worse from there on. But lotsof things were going on in that period of time. I would say thatthere are really differing views on this whole issue--certainly amongthe staff", "MR. KEEHN. Mike, I have a question with regard to laborproductivity and unit labor costs. With productivity continuing toincrease and with compensation continuing to be fairly level through'86 [in your forecast], I am a little surprised that the unit laborcost doesn't show more improvement than it does or, in fact, come downa bit. If these numbers are right, I'm also a bit surprised that yourexpectation regarding inflation isn't a little higher. Can yourationalize that", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I am struck not only by the usualdifficulties of forecasting but by the degree of uncertainty--not totake away from any of the work of our colleagues on the staff here andat the banks. It seemed to me that as you worked through thepresentation and the graphics today the theme could be uncertaintyabout non-oil imports and real GNP. Mr. Truman, in an attempt to bereassuring, said that even if we hit the higher imports--therefore thelower line relative to the GNP--it won't put us in a recession. Thatwas an attempt to be reassuring, which I appreciate. But if youtranslate that into the projection of consumer spending, which overthe last nine quarters has represented about 60 percent of the realGNP chain, you note the uncertainty that the import segment of thatspending presents. I noted in the presentation that that was areasonable comment: that the consumer spending element of the GNP7/9-10/85assumes that the domestic segment of that spending will be somewhathigher. There will be a bigger domestic share. But there again, itseems to me that the uncertainty presents itself.In the business investment area, I have no problem with theinventory projection; but when we get to business fixed investment, Iwonder whether or not the computer and the telecommunications spendingare indeed going to revive or hold, or whether [such spending] reallyhas topped out and the catch-up in that has occurred. It seems to methat there is uncertainty there. There certainly is uncertainty as towhen the nonresidential building industry is going to collapse--notwhether, but when. That certainly applies to the industrialbuildings, which haven't gone anywhere. There are closed plants allover the United States and there is overbuilding of office buildingsand shopping centers. So, that is a question of when, not whether. Idon't have any problem with the rather optimistic housing projectionsbut we certainly can have difficulties in the business fixedinvestment. It just seems to me that uncertainty is practically thetheme of our forecast, necessarily. I am struck by the range [ofuncertainty] that we have to have around any of these lines we'relooking at", "MR. WALLICH. In the Greenbook you note that the capacityutilization has fallen by more than 2 percent. Labor capacityutilization--that is, the rate of unemployment--has remained almostflat. Can one put these two things together and say that there isincreasing pressure against price increases: constant pressure againstwage increases and more pressure against industrial price increases", "7/9-10/85MR. BOEHNE. I would like to pick up on the uncertainty themethat Governor Martin raised. I think there is uncertainty here; butas I look through the presentation and think about the varioussectors, I can visualize this forecast materializing. I can visualizesomething slower than this; I can even visualize a recession over thistime horizon. But I find it very difficult to visualize sufficientlymore rapid growth than is in this forecast that would jeopardize theoutlook for inflation. As one goes through this, sector by sector,one could make a case for slower consumer growth but it's hard to makea case for booming consumer growth. In the investment sector, I thinkit's the same kind of outlook and it's the same in the governmentsector. The foreign sector may be less of a drag, but it is stillgoing to continue to be a major drag. Even if we got somewhat fastergrowth, it's hard to see that bringing about a significant increase ininflation above this forecast. The major source of inflation in herecomes from the foreign side. Someone made the point earlier, withwhich I agree, that those margins are big and fat in terms of what'sbeing imported into this country. And this is a very lucrativemarket. So I am much less fearful of that kind of import inflationbeing as serious as is [suggested] here.The other point I would make is about the tone that I senseout there. My District has been, I think, one of the most upbeatDistricts in recent quarters. I think that has been true up and downthe Atlantic coast. That area has been more upbeat than other partsof the country. I have sensed a change in that tone. I sensed thebeginning of a change the last time we met; but I sense it even morestrongly now that there is a definite scaling down of the outlook forthe rest of the year and in 1986 by a whole range of businesses. Theonly strong sector in my District now is real estate and construction,and I think that has a definite time limit. Like every place else,there has been weakness in manufacturing, but it has now spread toretailing and to some of the services. So, if you look at theobjective evidence that is here and at the change in the tone--evengranted the uncertainty that is present--it seems to me that there ismore chance that we are going to end up on the softer side of thisforecast than on the too strong side of it", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me make another comment about theseforecasts [by Committee members]. If that is true, it is notreflected in the forecasts given in preparation for this meeting.They are almost invariably higher than what the staff is forecasting,sometimes substantially", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I fall into that camp that you justdescribed, and it wasn't staff input. I put in a rather higherforecast, but this chart show gives me the uneasy feeling that we areabout to stall. The problem, as I see it, is in these charts thattend to be toward the bottom of the page. As I go through theforecast here, for example, you have a very sizable rise in the7/9-10/85multifamily vacancy rate and an increase in the mortgage delinquencyrate; and I think that starts to raise some questions about whetherresidential construction will be all that high. I agree with Pres; Iam surprised that your vacancy rate for office buildings is only alittle over ten percent since I think there is hardly a place in theColdwell Bankers survey that that's low. Maybe New York City is soheavily weighted that it brings it down. In any event, it is just aquestion of when there will be a collapse in office building ratherthan whether", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that we will inevitably get tothat. You are talking about the assumptions. I would have wishedearlier that $50 billion [in deficit cuts] might turn out to bereasonable, or in my wildest thoughts, low. I must say right now thatI think it is much too high for an assumption as to how much thebudget is going to be cut in 1986. Mr. Black", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think there is one element ofuncertainty that possibly overshadows these other uncertainties thatothers have mentioned and that is the issue that Steve outlined in hisvery fine paper: the question as to whether we have had this permanentone-time drop in velocity of money or not. The truth of the matter isthat none of us knows. I am inclined to think that we have had someof that; but if we have not, then I think there is a definite riskthat with this much money, we could have more growth than is beingprojected. I think that's the key to the uncertainty to all of thisand I don't know how to find an answer to that one", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have a forecast very close to thestaff's on real GNP; you're quite a lot higher on prices", "MR. STERN. Well, I agree with the more positive tone thatseems to be developing. Our forecast is for more rapid growth thanthe staff has for both this year and next. While it differs invarious bits and pieces, I think the critical difference is in theconsumer sector, in consumer spending. Underlying that is the factthat I am impressed by some of the things that we have already talkedabout: the wealth effect stemming largely from the run-up of stockprices; the effect stemming from declines in interest rates; the pent-up demand that may or may not be satisfied. My own view is that Idoubt that the last couple quarters have gone all that far ineliminating a lot of that [demand]. So I come out on the morepositive side, largely because of those things and because I thinkthat we have been reasonably accommodative as well.In the District, there seems to be very little that's new.The two-tiered economy continues with a vengeance. The one thing thatis new, and does concern me, is that the preponderance of theanecdotal evidence does seem to be becoming more negative, and it'snot confined entirely to agriculture and mining. If it were confinedto those sectors, I would certainly expect it and believe it. Butsome of that negative tone in the anecdotal evidence, I think, is abit of something that feeds on itself. You hear about layoffs inhigh-tech companies or one or two of the computer firms and you getthe impression that employment is dropping, net; and yet you look atthe data and [don't see it]. I know of at least one firm where, yes,they have laid off some people in their peripheral operations buttheir total employment is up because they have a main-frame operationthat is doing very well. What gets covered and what gets commented onare the layoffs; and what gets lost is the growth that is occurringelsewhere. So I am inclined to temper that somewhat more negativetone to the anecdotal evidence a bit, based on the numbers. Theunemployment rate in the Twin Cities is 3.8 percent. Everywhere yougo there are help wanted signs up. That [area] accounts for about 1/4of the people in the entire District and certainly more than that interms of non-agricultural economic activity", "MR. BALLES. Well, with regard to the outlook, our staff isalso somewhat more optimistic than the Board staff, starting with thesecond half of this year and running all through 1986. We wouldexpect, starting with the quarter we are now in, that the growth rateof real GNP would be something over 3 percent and that 1986 would comein at 3.4 percent. Certainly, we are not great optimists becausesomewhat over 3 percent isn't exactly something to write home about interms of rates of growth, but at least it is not quite as bearish asthe Board staff's forecast, which may still turn out to be correct. I-13-7/9-10/85am just giving you what our staff thinks. The differences, with whichI concur, seem to be that our staff is expecting a somewhat strongerpicture both in consumption as well as in business capital spending,in large part because of the lagged effects of lower interest ratesand greater availability of money and credit. Time will tell whetherthis modestly more optimistic view is right or not", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am glad to be at ornear the end of the ones to speak because I was a little depressedwith the earlier conversations, and I was delighted to hear FrankMorris and others come forth with a little more optimistic view. Ourforecast is very close to the staff's forecast. My staff wouldsuggest that the risks are more on the down side than the up side andI guess I don't totally share that view. It seems to me that the two-tiered economy that has been spoken about--not only in Gary Stern'sDistrict but in mine and others that are predominantly agriculturaland mining-related--is certainly there. But looking on a nationallevel, I am more inclined to believe that we have experienced a pausein the first and second quarters. With what the Federal Reserve hasdone in conjunction with the very stimulative fiscal package, it wouldseem to me that we could look forward to some better growth in thelatter half of this year and well into 1986.But I don't want to minimize the impact of the two-tieredeconomy. It seems to me that one of the greatest risks that we mayface is the instability in the financial system. As Jerry has noted,there is a lot of liquidity; but when you look at agriculture andmining and the prospects for a further drop in oil prices, whichimpacts the producers in the United States largely in the Texas,Oklahoma, and Wyoming areas, the prospects for financial instabilitythat can throw this forecast askew seem to me to be very great. Andthat is one of my greater concerns--not whether 3 percent is right or2-1/2 percent is satisfactory, but what may happen in these other-14-7/9-10/85areas, particularly in the financial area. I am not at all convincedthat what we have done up to now isn't about enough to stabilize thesituation; to do more may translate into prices rather than stabilityto that system. In other words, I am not sure that the Committee cando a lot to fend off those kinds of uncertainty", "MR. PARTEE. Would you think things are still deterioratingin agriculture", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I agree that there seems to besome conflict between the anecdotal evidence and the figures as youtry to make some sense out of them. On the anecdotal side, most ofthe people I talk to and most of what I read suggest that the economyis a lot weaker than one would expect. On the other hand, trying tomake some sense out of the figures, one gets the impression of lessweakness and some improvement, at least in the short run. While myforecast is on the weak side of the range, I should explain that itdoes hide what I see going on between [now and year-end]. My forecastwas influenced by what happened in the first part of this year: thefirst two quarters of the year came in very low. But in the secondhalf of the year, I see the economy expanding at least at a 3 percentrate and maybe as high as 3-1/2 percent. The reason for that is that,looking at the numbers, it appears to me that it is hard to find anylarge component that is going to be weak for the next six months. Thebusiness fixed investment outlook is pretty good for the rest of theyear. Business plans seem to be pretty firm, from 9 to 10 percentnominal. Despite the overbuilding in office buildings, the numbersfor non-residential construction are strong and contracts for non-residential construction seem to be holding up their strength. Soapparently growth in that area is going to continue at least foranother six months. And I am not at all convinced that consumption-16-7/9-10/85expenditures are going to slow down to the extent that the staffforecasts; I am not entirely convinced that the pent-up demand hasbeen entirely satisfied. There has been a very strong increase inemployment in the first half of this year and that may well influenceconsumption expenditures through the rest of the year, so consumptionmay well hold up higher than the staff forecasts. So, my forecast isupbeat for the second half of the year. Averaging it with the firsthalf of the year brings it out on the low side. And this strength inthe second half, in my view, carries over into the first half of 1986.But then as 1986 proceeds, I [would expect] increasing weaknessbecause (1) the expansion matures, and (2) as time goes on consumptionexpenditures are more likely to fall in line with disposable income,which has been declining and probably will continue [to decline].Eventually, non-residential construction is going to peter out as wemove toward the second half of 1986. And in the absence of anystimulus--and of course the net new fiscal stimulus gets weaker andweaker as time goes on--it is hard to see where stimulus for continuedgrowth along a 3-1/2 percent path will come from, especially in thelast half of 1986. So, I would expect the economy to be expanding inthe 3 percent range in the first half of 1986 and petering out verynoticeably in the second half. Again, averaging the two halves, 1986comes out low as well. So, my overall forecast for 1985 and 1986looks low, but it does mask fairly credible performance for the secondhalf of this year and the first half of next year", "MR. WALLICH. Having listened to the forecasts, which is theprincipal function, I do think that we haven't done a great deal interms of evaluation of what these forecasts mean. The rate of growth,at 2-1/2 to 3 percent, is not great. It's not going to get us back tofull employment. But it's at about our long-term potential; at thatrate we are going to continue to expand more or less with a constantrate of unemployment. The rate of unemployment of a little over 7percent is not good, but it is not very far from what most peoplethink is the so-called natural rate of unemployment, the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. We can gain maybe 1/2 or3/4 of a point to 6-1/2 percent or so, but that is all. Now, the onenumber that I think is totally unsatisfactory is a 3-1/2 to 4 percentrate of inflation. That is quite abnormal in terms of the historicalinflation level of the American economy. It's abnormal in terms ofthe inflation levels that are tolerated in industrial economiesabroad, if they regard themselves successful in this respect. I thinkthe inflation rate cannot be accepted as satisfactory--inflationsimply defined as a continuation of a going rate with the going ratebeing, in effect, acceptable. I think the main shortfall in thesethree variables we are looking at--the rate of growth, the level ofunemployment, and the rate of inflation--is the rate of inflation", "MR. MORRIS. That's me. You didn't call on me. Norm wassupposed to tell you", "MR. WALLICH. I would just suspend it, so to speak, becausethere is no point in rebasing M2 and M3 and we are almost forced togive those more weight, even though we don't think very highly ofthem, because of the failure of M1", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The actual level has been way above thetarget a good part of the time. So have free reserves. Who could saythat wouldn't happen if we did the same thing again. I've heard fromthree people saying that they would like to tighten. Does that meanthat the other nine don't want to", "MR. MARTIN. I don't want to", "MR. MORRIS. We would have had a world depression", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I would not have thought anyone wouldthink 10 percent was likely", "MR. MARTIN. I think we have to be very careful with May andJune, particularly June. We go back and revise, revise, and revise.My goodness, that June could be like May or whatever it was last year:it could come down when we revise", "MR. BLACK. I think the best solution, Mr. Chairman, is torebase this. It probably surprises a lot of people that I say that.But I'd rebase, in a sense forgiving part of this on the basis thatthere is probably some substance in what Steve is saying. If we wereto rebase, for example, and keep the 4 to 7 percent range and hit thetop of that, that would result in an 8.9 percent rate of growth in M1for the year, which seems adequate even if M1 has changed in meaning.I would think that would be enough liquidity to keep the economy goingpretty well", "MS. HORN. I would support the point of view also that we putM1 on a monitoring basis. That may come as a surprise to some of youwho know that I believe in targeting M1 and in its relation to pricesand in its usefulness in the past. I also think it will be veryuseful to us in the future in the long run in the fight againstinflation. But I do think that rebasing or revising the currenttargets is an indication that we are serious about pursuing thosetargets. Or at least I believe that when we do set targets for M1, weought to be serious about them because I think it's that important.And at this point, at least speaking for myself, I don't know where Iwould like M1 to be in the fourth quarter of this year. It is tooearly, I think. We don't have the kind of information I would like tohave to set the serious M1 target that I would like to set. So, itseems to me that it is most appropriate to say M1 is a monitoringvariable right now. The rest of what I would like said is that we areserious about the long-term battle against inflation and about comingback to M1 as soon as practicable. Our experience the last time wedid this was that it was after something like a year that we found wecould indeed reemphasize M1. We could indicate that we would hopethat at least by the fourth quarter of this year we might have enoughinformation to then reemphasize M1 and conclude on that. For thatreason, I would not do anything with the 1985 targets but for 1986 Iwould reduce the target for M1 to a range of 3-1/2 to 6-1/2 percent,slightly below the 1985 range, to indicate our seriousness in comingback to this kind of strategy as soon as we have some moreinformation", "MR. BALLES. I'm not sure", "MR. PARTEE. If we are giving any serious thought to puttingM1 on standby, I think it would be a serious error to raise thetargets on the rest of the aggregates, which have been reasonably wellbehaved. Dropping M1 and then raising M2 and M3 would certainly givethe impression that we are letting [monetary policy] go to the winds.I think the only way we could possibly say that we are going to watchM1 carefully and do that credibly--and we don't know what all that hasbeen going on means--would be to hold to the [ranges for the] otheraggregates that have been expanding reasonably. It's true that creditis above its range; I believe it hasn't increased its excess above therange. And the projection has it generally coming down in the nextyear", "MR. WALLICH. I don't quite see the consistency of sayingthat we suspend M1 in some sense and then we fiddle around with theupper margin by 1 percentage point. I think it is better to leave itand say it was a bad job", "MR. KEEHN. As I hear the numbers, it appears that if werebase--and I think there are some compelling reasons to rebase--andmaintain the same 4 to 7 percent range, there is a high probabilitythat we would be about in the range", " If we had a 9 or 8percent top, I think---37-7/9-10/85MR. BALLES. I would like to support Bob Black's point onthat. I think [there is] the historical continuity factor asperceived by the public when we have to announce not only '85 buttentative '86 targets. We might get to the same end results byraising the range to 4 to 8 percent or even 5 to 9 percent versusrebasing and keeping 4 to 7 percent but I think it would make the 1986rationale a lot harder to establish, whatever range we decide on.Either keeping them the same as they were or cranking them down anotch would be my preference. So that led me, Mr. Chairman, to favorrebasing over raising the range", "MR. MELZER. One problem that I have in terms of thinkingabout rebasing--and yesterday I thought that was the appropriate way-38-7/9-10/85to go--is not knowing whether the problem is behind us. That concernsme. On the other hand, putting M1 on a monitoring basis also troublesme. As I reflected on some of the activity in terms of the foreignexchange markets and also what is happening to the growth rate in GNPhere in the United States versus overseas economies, I could see asubstantial shift in psychology in terms of what has been driving someof the capital flows in this direction. None of us really knows howthe dollar is going to correct. We have assumed an 8 percentdepreciation for next year, but it seems to me that if we got a moredramatic weakening of the dollar--not even a precipitous one, but amore dramatic one than that--that is going to feed back pretty quicklyinto inflationary expectations here, certainly amongst marketparticipants in the domestic credit markets. At the same time thatwill affect feelings about the ability to continue to finance thedeficit through foreign investments. And at the same time we havewhat we were talking about yesterday, in terms of a less favorableoutlook on the budget deficit. It just seems to me that if we were toput M1 on a monitoring basis against the backdrop of all thosepotential developments, people could question our resolve in terms ofdealing with inflation in the long term. And it could have a verysignificant impact, particularly in terms of the shape of the yieldcurve, I would say. So, as between monitoring or one of the other twooptions, I would do one of the other two. And, as I say, I amtroubled about rebasing because that implies that we know the problemis behind us. As I said yesterday, I think it is a more difficultargument to make in terms of the rationale than it was two years ago", "MR. GUFFEY. That's not true. [Laughter", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I must say, if this is right in substance,that this is a most peculiar sentence, it seems to me. We reaffirmthe range and then we say it doesn't mean anything", "MR. MARTIN. Considering the difficulty in predictingvelocity so far in this expansion and considering the difficulty inprojecting interest rates, real and nominal, so far in this businessexpansion, it would seem to me that we would want to give ourselvesthe flexibility that has been alluded to several times here and thatrebasing gives us that flexibility. It also recognizes theunusualness of recent events with regard to both velocity and,therefore, on the other side of that coin, the growth of theaggregates. Why not give ourselves the operational flexibility thatrebasing presents and indicate--to work a word to death--theuncertainty associated with these relationships at the moment. Maybewe ought not use the term \"monitoring\" and so forth if our goal hereis [unintelligible]. Let us not call it \"monitoring;\" let us call it\"bananas\" or something else. But let's give ourselves someoperational flexibility. We don't know what will happen to interestrates; we don't know what the public's attitude is toward holdingvarious kinds of assets", "MR. FORRESTAL. But we haven't rebased. Why not try therebasing and then--", "MR. MARTIN. I would like to make the argument for rebasingon a slightly different basis. It is certainly important that thefinancial markets accept what we do here as being operationallydictated and not an abandonment of disinflation as a primary goal ofthis institution. On the other hand, it seems to me that theoperational considerations are important here and that we shouldattempt to adopt those features of a policy which are most likely,with all the difficulty of forecasting, to be attainable. We rebasedin very recent history. There was not a reinflation following thoseactions, and it seems to me that operationally we would have a littlemore flexibility [by rebasing]. We can be careful with the languagein which we ascribe weight to M1, but nevertheless I think it isimportant to reiterate that M1 is an information variable. It doeshave content; most of the time it does have information that isvaluable in the implementation of policy. I think that rebasing andthe right language accomplish this. Why not pick the alternative weare most likely to succeed in", "-45-7/9-10/85MR. MARTIN. But we have to raise the top limit so high if wedon't rebase, Mr. Chairman.

Arithmetically, obviously you canmake them come out to the same thing. But to my way of thinking--again, this is a highly judgmental thing--[there is a difference].Raising the range and accompanying that with some verbiage along theline that several people, including Mr. Stern, have suggested says: Wedon't know what has happened; we don't know if it's over; we stillthink over time this variable matters; and we still have a view overtime as to what we would like to do, but we are not going to--particularly in these current circumstances--let that view get carvedin stone. Now, rebasing seems to say something that in my judgment isa little different than that. The way that it is different is that tome it does not carry the same conviction in terms of what we aretrying to do over time", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. It doesn't express great conviction.I just don't think we can go on in the situation that we have in termsof rebasing when we don't have a good explanation as to why we arerebasing", "MR. BLACK. I pretty well agree with you, Mr. Chairman, thatthere isn't a lot of difference, but one minor issue is: Which onewould make it easier for us as we work over the long run to lowerthose ranges.

CROSS. One of the interesting things has been that thedifficulties in South Africa do not seem to have caused a greaterincrease in the price of gold. Now, there are all kinds of questionsabout that. There is a feeling that substantial supplies are beingwithheld from the market by the main producers, the South Africans andthe Russians in particular. As the price moves up, then they tend tosell a little more and then it goes back down again. That seems tohave been the pattern. One might have thought, with the concerns inSouth Africa and the possibility being talked about of mining strikesand other potential supply disruptions, that the price might haverisen more than it has. It's now about $336 today, and that's not upall that much from where it was before so much attention was beingpaid to this. What has happened is that the price of platinum hasgone up. I gather that South Africa is more critical to the platinummarket than to the gold market, and platinum has moved up much morerapidly.

Well, Mr. Chairman, I don't have a very positivescenario. I think the staff work was careful and conservative. Itseems to me that if you look at the sectors in which they are pickingup that increase in real growth from 1.7 or 1.5 percent--or whateverthe revised figure is going to turn out to be--to 3.0 percent, you getfederal spending, residential spending, inventory change, a bit ofbusiness fixed in the producer durable equipment area, and a littleincrease in consumption. But as I look at those categories and thinkof the downside risk in most of them, it seems to me that it is nottoo much like Cassandra to look at the chance of a recession. I willtake the other end of the spectrum from Steve. Certainly, we have theimbalances in this expansion. They are not the usual imbalances thatwe are used to: it isn't capacity utilization pressing against athreshold; it isn't rising interest rates. But goodness knows, thereare imbalances: the foreign trade side, the farm situation, and allthe rest of them we know about. I think that the mortgage backedsecurity market is extremely vulnerable, and that is an $80 billion ayear market. On the federal spending side, could we have a realcutback there or a real expansion for that matter. I think neither.The procurement criticisms, the resignation of one procurementofficer, and the hearings in the Congress are all constraints onWeinberger and company. So it is quite unlikely, even if they wantedto, that they could give a big push to the economy by saying they haveall of this [spending] authority, now let's spend it. Nor is itlikely, given the philosophical [mind] set of Mr. Weinberger and hisboss, that there would be the opposite--a real cutback in that area.So that's probably a small contribution on the plus side.-14-8/20/85 -15-We have spoken of the consumer. Employment is still going upa little, unlike the Europeans. The debt burden looks like it hasadjusted a little. With tax refunds coming in, those credit cardcredits have dropped a little, so maybe the debt burden can behandled. In the residential area, I think we are very vulnerable inour forecast. Jim, this will come as absolutely no surprise to you: Ithink the talk about a 16 percent spurt in residential spending isoverly optimistic. It might be half that. That's a couple percentagepoints off the growth increment maybe. I already made a comment withregard to the importance of the fixed rate mortgage, but there are theTICOR mortgage-backed security losses and private mortgage insurancecompanies are already talking about $50 to $100 [billion] in lossexposure. I don't know whether the Swiss reinsurance process is goingto work here; it has never been tested in this particular kind ofinsurance. I don't know whether REITs, as they are called, will comein and make the settlements and back up the private mortgage insurancecompanies so that you can get that $80 billion continuing as fundingfor the residential spending", "MR. MARTIN. No, they won't do it willingly--not when you aretalking $50 million at a clip per company. So I think there is a realexposure there. As for inventories, goodness, what swings there are:We can get a $50 million help or we can get a $50 million hurt. Theinventory situation is puzzling all of us, in terms of its swings. Itcould help or not. So it seems to me that there are vulnerabilitieswith regard to the very careful forecast of Jim and his associates foran increase up to 3 percent real GNP. The risks are on the down sidein every one of those areas and in other areas that we all know about.The risk of recession, though, seems to turn on some kind of systemicfinancial--well, not collapse--but real troubles that are hard tohandle. I'm talking not just about the ag banks and the thrifts andall of the things that we have talked about so many times, butsystemic--[all] financial institutions [unintelligible] privatemortgage insurance companies don't pay. And the mortgage-backedsecurities side of the market--I am stretching to get the biggestfigure I can--may be in the widest sense a $350 billion market. Idon't think that is the most probable occurrence, but the risks are onthe down side. We need to keep those in mind as we set policy", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I normally have afairly optimistic outlook on most things in life, but I must say atthe moment that it has been damped somewhat. In our area of thecountry there has been a great deal of discussion about agricultureand what may happen. At the moment, as I think most of you know, wewill have an outstanding wheat harvest and the prediction on corn, soybeans, sorghum, and so forth is very, very good. On the other hand,there already has been a 20 to 25 percent drop in prices for those8/20/85commodities; for each of them the price is now below the break-evenpoint for production. At the same time, red meat prices, hogs andcattle, have dropped roughly 20 to 25 percent over the last 60 days.And those producers now are either at a break-even or a loss position.The energy problem somebody has mentioned--the rig count is indeeddown by 25 percent from a year ago, but it is flat or going on down inOklahoma, Wyoming, and Colorado. Mining is flat on its back.Aircraft sales, which are a fairly large component of the output inthe Tenth District are flat--flat being no sales at all unless to themilitary. As a result, there is not a great deal of happiness outsideof the metropolitan areas, where economic activity is still goingfairly strong in terms of auto production and other activity.Let me say further that I take no comfort in the budgetresolution that has been passed by Congress, because if you look atthe history of what has happened in this so-called new budgetenvironment, the budget resolution has not meant very much in thepast. Indeed this time, if you look at the agricultural sector,whether you like it or not, the government is going to end up withabout 2/3 of all of the production this year as a result of the sign-ups for CCC; the producers simply are going to walk away because thetarget prices are higher than the commodity price in the market. Andthat all is a direct tap on the Treasury", "MR. GUFFEY. That's a very big number--somewhere in the $24to $30 billion range. It is something like $18 billion above whatotherwise would have been projected. So in my own view, the budgetdeficit problem is far from resolution and it is going to get worserather than better. It seems to me that with respect to monetarypolicy, we have one of two choices. One is in some way to get realinterest rates down, which will help marginally in agriculture andsome of these areas; and to me the only lever we have to pull is lower[nominal] interest rates and that implies monetization of the debt.As a result I am gloomy and not very optimistic", "MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, in the Southeast wecontinue to experience some moderation in the economic growth. Ithink what is happening there is basically an adjustment to a lessboom-like atmosphere than we had previously. While there are someareas of weakness, I think the strengths in our local economy outweighthose weaknesses at the present time. Louisiana is clearly a veryweak area at the moment because of the energy sector, agriculture, andnonresidential building. And while nonresidential building iscontinuing in the rest of the District, it is a source of concern; Ithink the absorption rates are not going to be good enough to takethis glut of office space that we are getting in most cities of theSoutheast, and I think that is going to catch up with builders andfinancial institutions before too much longer. The recent decline inthe dollar has given some hope to the textile and apparel people,although I think most of them realize that it is going to take quite along time before they feel any particular impact from that. Just aparenthetical observation: I have been very, very surprised at thestrength of the protectionist sentiment that I am hearing around theDistrict. In fact, it is not really just from around the District.For example, I had a meeting with the board of directors of a localcorporation that has directors from all over the country and thevirulence of the protectionist sentiment and the anti-Japanesesentiment was really remarkable to me. I thought we were back inWorld War II. If this is true around the country, when Congressreturns I think we are going to hear a good deal more about this.-17-8/20/85The virulence and the \"them against us\" sentiment was really quiteremarkable. I had no idea it was that strong.As I look at the economy as a whole, I guess I would revisemy forecast down somewhat, although basically I would agree with theGreenbook forecast both for the rest of 1985 and for 1986. Myconcerns would be that the dangers are on the down side. I think wemight be lucky if we get 3 percent growth. And I say that because Iam not very sanguine about consumer spending. Given the level ofconsumer debt and the lower personal income that has come in, I am notso sure that the consumer--although consumer confidence appears to behigh--is going to spend at quite the levels that the forecast implies.I am also not so sure about the inventory buildup. I think that thereis a feeling among many people that they don't have to build theirinventories because of the [excess] capacity that we have in thesystem--that production times are lower and, therefore, they don'thave to have as much inventory. Also, I think the uncertainties aboutthe economy are causing some people to reconsider their inventorybuildup. So given all of that, Mr. Chairman, I too am not terriblyoptimistic, although I don't fear a recession. And people I havetalked to don't fear a recession, but nobody that I have talked tosees any particular boom for the rest of the year and nobody sees anygreater danger of inflation either. So in terms of monetary policy,we are in the usual dilemma in light of the sluggishness of theeconomy and the growth of the money supply. My hunch would be that weought to stay about where we are; I will talk about that a little morelater when we get to the specifications", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, I feel as comfortable with theforecast in the Greenbook as I can feel, and I don't at the moment seea recession looming immediately in front of us. In terms ofdevelopments in the last 6 or 8 weeks, the thing in the economy thatprobably has surprised me most is housing. I certainly did expectthat we would see a little more spark there than we have seen, whichled me to believe that maybe this rise in delinquency rates that wehave seen in the home mortgage sector was telling us something. Buteven that doesn't seem to hold up because, for example, on closerinspection we find that the delinquency rates are higher in theNortheast than they are in the South and the West, even though thereverse pattern seems to apply in terms of where the housing shortagesare versus the surpluses. So I am at a complete loss to rationalizethat. More generally, I sense a much more acute dilemma growing outof the dollar situation than a number of the comments around the tablewould seem to imply. For one thing, barring a recession in the UnitedStates, which would obviously raise havoc with the LDC situation, Isee more risk in the possibility of some kind of sudden tumble in theexchange rate, notwithstanding all that the exchange rate implies inthe current situation for the trade account", " We really ought tothink about rewriting them in a more basic way, but I don't think wecan do that in the next--MR. PARTEE. We have had a sort of informal desire not tochange the directives in the mid-quarter meeting. It will be prettyhard to avoid that", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, to adhere at this time to anemphasis on the monetary aggregates, which has been [our approach]since 1979 or at least from 1979 to 1982, is not justified by what weknow about them or what we can predict in terms of the pattern ofchange in the aggregates, particularly in M1. Well, let me correctmyself: the narrow aggregate is still behaving in a pattern outsidethe modeling of projections plus or minus some standard error. Ithink there is increasing merit to the thesis that there has been ashift in the demand curve. It seems to me that there's a cumulativeeffect on the public of financial crises in state after state and intype of institution after type of institution. I am not just talkingabout Ohio and Maryland and thrifts in California and industrial loancompanies in Utah and institutions in Texas and so forth; I'm thinkingof the cumulative effect on the public's consciousness of thisconstant news about failed financial institutions following a multi-decade period in which nobody failed. Take Chicago--pardon me Silas--where the two biggest S&Ls and the two biggest banks, the fourdominant financial institutions there, are on sufferance. There'sBank of America, Seafirst, Financial Corporation of America, TexasCommerce--you could go on and on. [There are problem] maritime loans,energy loans, and now real estate loans.I think we will see more evidence as time goes by that therehas been a shift in the demand curve. And for us now to gear ourpolicies around bringing M1 down simply is not warranted given theextreme degree of uncertainty. So I would not support any move whichwould raise interest rates at this time. Think of the leverage--I usethe term badly--that interest rates have in the foreign exchangemarkets, in less developed countries, in debt coverage servicing, andon and on. While we should not dismiss M1 entirely, of course, wedon't know [what drives] M1 at this time. Eventually we will; ex postwe will look back on this period and say it was quite obvious that X,Y, and Z were the reasons why M1 behaved in the way it did. So, do welose credibility if we continue to treat M1 the way we have. No oneknows. But we have a Chairman who communicates pretty well with thefinancial community. After all, we have sublimated or at least setaside to some degree the narrow aggregate to date; we have two otheraggregates and we have the debt number and other measures; and we havean able spokesman here. What I am trying to say here is to someextent heresy and that is that I think in this six-week period weshould concentrate more on the fed funds rate in the execution ofpolicy. I would mean by that that we would keep the rate exactlywhere it is now. We would not let it drift up or push it up as somehave advocated. I believe we can maintain credibility by maintainingthe rate. While I would go for \"B,\" I would hope that in theimplementation by the Chairman and the staff that we would keep ratesrelatively stable. I think stable interest rates might be acontribution to this short-run period. We have heard of stable rates;we have experienced those--it is hard to remember--and I think thatmight add to our credibility and to some measure of stability in anunstable world. It might even add stability to the decline, andhopefully the gradual decline, in the dollar. I would hope in thatregard, Mr. Chairman, that in the [wording of the directive] we would-27-8/20/85move the [reference to] foreign exchange markets up in position and/orhave language indicating that we are paying considerably moreattention to that part of the directive", "MR. PARTEE. --because I think we are going through a verydifficult period in which a little ease in rates might not hurt. Itmight be pushing on a string and it might not accomplish too much, butit certainly would not hurt. I am also quite bothered by the foreignexchange market. I think that Jerry and Paul are right: that we couldget quite a drop in that. And I suppose a material move toward easierrates would increase the odds that that would be true. I think alsothat there is a little question about the credibility of the FederalReserve developing out there. I have seen quite a few reports andheard from quite a few people who say: \"Well, we don't see anyinflation immediately but you really are setting the stage for it--youare providing all of the liquidity--and we think the result of this isgoing to be inflationary in the long run", "MR. STERN. I would favor alternative B with a slight tilttoward alternative C; that, in my mind, is associated with borrowingof perhaps $400 to $500 million. This credibility issue seems to meto be a troublesome one because in the abstract it can cut both ways.There are risks in ignoring M1 and there are also risks in reacting toan aggregate whose behavior we don't seem to understand very well. Atleast in my mind the foreign exchange market is perhaps decisive atthis juncture and it seems to be expressing some doubts about the kindof disciplined policy that is being pursued in this country. Largelyfor that reason I would tilt in the direction of \"C,\" as I indicated", "MR. PARTEE. If I understood Mr. Black correctly, we didn'ttighten enough, given the aggregates", "MR. RICE. Well, the range is fine; the midpoint is not", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if I could blink my eyes and wake uptomorrow with a lower dollar and no accompanying change in attitudes[as a result of] that, I might argue that that is a good thing. Butthat is an impossible scenario. The question is: How do we get alower dollar if that is what we inevitably have to get over time,without throwing inflation off course, interest rates off course, andwithout overshooting on the down side, in some short-term senseanyway, and if that would bring more pressure on the industrial sectorthan we can stand because we are so far behind the eight ball there.And we do have to shift literally--it is going to happen. It's notgoing to happen in the [unintelligible] but it may happenexpectationally and in terms of prospects. What does it come to now,Mr. Truman, with a $150 billion trade deficit--maybe 15 percent of ourmanufacturing output. If we went from where we are now to balance intwo years or three years we wouldn't have the capacity to meet [the-36-8/20/85export demand] without a lot of inflationary pressures, I am afraid,assuming the economy generally isn't otherwise in recession", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. One would hope to get it down asfast as when it first began coming down and get it over with and thenhave a feeling of greater stability. Could we take another 4 percent[decline]. That depends, really. If people thought we were concernedabout 4 percent and concerned about the inflationary impact, we would8/20/85get a different situation. What I would fear the most is a feelingthat we were driving it down, that we were easing policy to drive thedollar down, saying \"Let's get this thing going.\" That, I think, isfraught with danger", " So long as thereis a feeling that it's not getting out of hand, I think--MR. CROSS. It's very unrealistic, isn't it, to think that wecould really have a soft landing that people talk about", "MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I could ask Sam toexplain a bit further why he thinks that a soft landing for the dollaris a very unrealistic possibility", " It would happen overnight once they--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now, it might not be the worst thing inthe world if it happened--if, as I say, you woke up tomorrow and thedollar was 10 percent lower and people said: \"That is the end of it.We are down there now.

I would have some preference, or more thana slight preference, for not changing the numbers if we don't have to.That is the only advantage of 7 to 8 percent, but I will not press thepoint.

Well, one could make a case that we're seeingsome backsliding in the demand for money. If you think about theincreases in velocity over the last 30 years and the various reasonsfor that--higher rates, inflation, increased use of credit cards forcash--now we're finding less inflation and more of M1 bears interest.There could be some backsliding in a number of local markets. Creditcards aren't what they used to be; service charges are being appliedfrom the date of purchase rather than giving that grace period of amonth. It's nothing we can measure very precisely, but it seems to methat in the '80s there has been some backtracking in the very same10/1/85kinds of forces that led to an economizing of money in the '60s and'70s. And there just could be some backsliding", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't want to get involved with theparticular numbers, but what these exercises illustrate is that if youtake extreme--I hope extreme--assumptions and you're going to correctthat $150 billion current account deficit, you have a helluvarelocation from domestic consumption to the external sector. Youwould have what's going on in Latin America where they have had noincrease in domestic consumption while they are putting all [theirexpanding production] in exports. And unless events force some of itout of domestic consumption, you have a helluva inflationary impact10/1/85and capacity problems and employment goes up and unemployment goes waydown", "MR. PARTEE. You have to cut the domestic demand 5 percentagepoints. That's a lot", " Well, I think--MR. BOEHNE. But on the other hand, why would you want to cutdemand all that much. Where we have a lot of excess capacity is inthe manufacturing sector and that's just exactly where you would havethe substitution with imports.

STERN. That was based on a radical assumption about thedollar. I would like a little elaboration from Steve or from Ted asto how market participants have viewed the G-5 announcement so far", "MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, looking at the general businesssituation, I have changed my forecast very little from the lastmeeting. I think we are beginning to see the kind of numbers we hopedfor and that we wanted to see. I feel more confident about theeconomic situation than I did a month ago, and I find that thatimpression is shared pretty much around my District by the businesspeople I talked with. There seems to be much less uncertainty aboutthe course of events. The people I talked to are seeing some forwardmomentum in the economy that they think is going to carry over intothe fourth quarter and, indeed, into the first half of 1986. Now,that view of the economy may be influenced a little by conditions inthe Southeast, which are relatively better I guess than in some otherparts of the country. While we have some weaknesses, particularly inexport-related areas such as textiles and so on, those weaknesses arebeing offset by strengths otherwise.-11-10/1/85On the aggregate picture, I would agree pretty much with theforecast of the Greenbook, although on the composition of thatforecast I would differ marginally. I would think that perhaps we aregoing to have a little less strength in housing than in the Greenbook,but otherwise I am generally in accord. I think consumer spending isa real question mark here. My staff is telling me that they expectconsumer spending to increase, especially in durables. I am not surethat that's a correct assessment, given the high debt level and thepersonal income situation that we have", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Just a brief comment on the businesssituation: My own view is similar to Mr. Forrestal's in that I do drawmore encouragement from the collection of latest statistics--not thatthey lead to anything different than the staff forecast, but I thinkthat they raise the chances that that, or maybe a tad better, in factis what will happen. But I must say that in and around New York Cityanyway, the people associated with the very large multinationalcompanies [unintelligible], notwithstanding the recent businessstatistics, are still very distinctly on the bearish side of things.I am not quite sure whether that's just a further manifestation of theway in which those companies are being affected by the external side.-12-10/1/85There may be some of that, but I detect in the time frame of the pastsix weeks or so a higher level of concern in that community about theunderlying policy situation. There is even, as I said before, somewhispering to the effect that sooner or later that underlying policysituation is going to lead to more inflation--not that anybody sees itright now, but that there's a sense of inevitability about it", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would agree withthose around table who suggest that an uptick in the national economyis probably in train--that the Greenbook forecast is very reasonable.That, however, is only from a national view. From a regional view, inthe Tenth District things have not gotten better; they have gottenworse. And the projections for the fall and winter, particularly inthe agricultural and energy areas, hold out no great hope. As amatter of fact, the financial strain simply rolls back into thefinancial institutions; the outlook for banks, savings and loans, andothers looks to be devastating. From strictly a national viewpoint; Iwould agree with those who say no change in policy. From a regionalviewpoint, I guess I would have to urge perhaps some relaxation ofinterest rate levels. I will just note that on the inflation front,much of the contribution to stable inflation in the short run is acontribution by food and energy. And that impacts my District ratherdramatically.There has been a good deal of talk about M1 and I wouldagree, in view of what I have just said, that we shouldn't pay verymuch attention to it in the very short run. Although I would hate togive it up as a part of policy, over the next intermeeting period andperhaps over the fourth quarter as a whole I don't see M1 as a majorplayer in policy decisions, unless other matters such as the dollarcome into play and we may want to use it. On the other hand, thedollar and the G-5 arrangement are a bit puzzling to me. That is tosay that there's been a great deal of talk here and I think you, Mr.Chairman, expressed the concern of a precipitous drop in the dollar.I think that is a real risk, obviously. But if you look at it inanother way the fundamentals haven't changed, as far as I can see. Asa result, it seems to me that the dollar has come down relative to theother currencies but I would expect that in the short run the traderswill test the United States, for example, and will try to push thedollar back up to see how far the United States really will go toparticipate in the G-5 agreement.So with that in mind, and with the background of the economy,particularly queuing off of my own region, I would prefer alternativeB. But I am troubled a little by the language describing alternativeB and that is that the staff would project a funds rate of 8 percentor a bit higher. I would object at this point, if it were up to me,to having a rate of 8 percent and pushing on up unless some of theseother exogenous forces, such as the dollar, come into play. As aresult, I would modify that and be someplace between \"A\" and \"B\" and-21-10/1/85start out with a borrowing level, say, of between $400 and $500million, centering on $450 million. I am hopeful that that would beenough latitude and flexibility, if the dollar did start to drop, thatthere wouldn't be a [conference] call and the policy prescriptionchanged as a result of that call", "MS. SEGER. Many of my points have already been made, but Iwould just like to emphasize that I believe the risks are on the downside. The consumer spending numbers that look very robust and retailsales that look good are being supported by very generous use ofcredit cards and other kinds of credit. I picked up some numbers fromthe treasurer of one of the captive auto finance companies and theterms of auto credit really did something to me: 45 percent of theirAugust contracts were for 60-month loans. Almost half of thecontracts were for five years, which means that they needed thatincentive plus a very low rate of 7.7 percent to get a monthly paymentthat was low enough to drag these people in off the streets. I don'tread that as a terribly, terribly strong demand situation. Also, Siand I may talk to different people in the auto industry, but I haven'tfound anybody out there who doesn't think that this temporary burst ofsales is going to be reversed, that in fact they are borrowing fromthe future, and that later in October we will see a very big andsignificant drop in sales as they pay the price for moving these '85models out very rapidly. So I think we are going to see somedistortion in the numbers here for a while that will make it verydifficult to get a handle on what is really going on. But I thinkthat there isn't as much strength basically as one might conclude.Secondly, on the housing matter, as the standards of the mortgagelenders and of the mortgage insurers are tightened, I think we aregoing to see that show up eventually in [a drop in] new housingstarts. I admit it hasn't happened yet, but I think it will and,therefore, starts may come in a little below what the staff is nowestimating. On plant and equipment spending, here again I think moreand more companies are having profit problems, and that does feed backinto their capital spending decisions and doesn't make them verypositive about it. So, I think there may be some downside risk there.On the inflation front, like most of the others here, I thinkthe numbers look pretty good. I also would like to emphasize thatthere are sectors of the economy where there is actual deflation,which doesn't seem to get mentioned much. Also, I certainly wouldread the M1 numbers, but I would be much more concerned with what'sgoing on with M1 if M2 and M3 also were going off the top of thechart, which they aren't--particularly M3. Having just met with theDecatur Chamber of Commerce yesterday and the National Association ofManufacturers, you would need to give me a bullet-proof vest if Isuggested any policy change that would lead to higher interest ratesor a tightening, because both of those groups are very sensitive tothe financial side of the economy. They are tying that to their ownproblems. So I am torn between supporting \"B\" with a tilt toward \"A\"or just going straight to \"A.\" I would be very, very concerned aboutany uptick in interest rates at this point for the reasons Imentioned--the impact on agriculture, the other areas that have bigdebt problems, and furthermore the possibility that that wouldundermine the recent G-5 agreement. So I guess I am somewhere between-22-10/1/85\"A\" and \"B\" with the borrowing down to the level we were talking aboutat the last meeting", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not particularly during a period when thedollar is weak. I would if the dollar were surging up; I would notunder today's conditions in the market.

In that connection, I'll make an ad hoccomment--not about computer problems in particular.

Like others, I [havereservations] about the assumption of the saving rate staying at alittle over 4 percent, but we explored that pretty thoroughly andthere is no point in going over that further. It is interesting thatthe forecast contains a shift in government spending in the fullemployment budget deficit sense, which should be a matter of someinterest with regard to what Jerry Corrigan has indicated as a verycautiously optimistic outlook with no sector particularly giving apush. It does not look as though [stimulus] is going to come from thefederal government sector. I am delighted to see the housing forecastrevised downward a little. I like that old joke about the people wholived in [unintelligible] and everybody knew everybody's story, sotheir stories were numbered. I am going to number my comments, so Iwill simply say \"number 17\" rather than make you listen to myritualistic housing comment. I warn you, however, that tightening ofcredit standards by lending institutions has yet to have its fulleffect and that is coming. That is down the road and I think it willbe in 1986 but that--in other words, \"17", "11/4-5/85MR. MORRIS.

You don't show net exports asbeing a drag anymore but, certainly, we're not seeing any significantresponse to the fairly sizable decline in the dollar that has takenplace.

We think there will be overrunsin a number of areas. The farm area is a prime one; we don't have thespecific number on the farm bill, but we think that it is going tocome in higher than the Congress had expected", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I tried to have a very optimistic view ofthe economy all through the summer, thinking that there would be apretty good resurgence in the fall. There were some pretty favorableindicators at our last meeting, but I must say that this recent setbothers me. I am most affected, I guess, by the McGraw-Hill surveywhich is down one percent--and nobody mentioned that--in nominalterms. Now that's a pretty good survey. It's the oldest, and wealways thought the best, of the private surveys. That's a prettypoor, unrespectable survey result to be occurring in the fall afterboards have met and plans have tended to firm up for the next year.That did shock me. The other thing that I worry about is thatpersonal saving rate; the only thing you can do really is assume thatit won't come back very much. But it's so low that one wonderswhether there hasn't been some kind of a spending desire on the partof consumers associated with the use of credit that will disappear,and that in fact the automobile producers are wrong about theirforecasts for next year and it won't be as good as Si, I guess it was,suggested. I don't know; that bothers me. I am not sure, but it's avery mysterious thing to have a saving rate that low. After all,there was supposed to be an environment that would encourage saving in-15-11/4-5/85connection with supply side economics. It's totally the wrong answerthat has come out of the data from that point of view. It's verydifficult for me to incorporate the net export/import picture becausewe have had so little experience with that being a large factor. Itmight be that there could be a bigger increase in exports than thestaff has forecast, but the fact of the matter is that for the nextyear they have a contribution coming from net exports--that is,smaller net imports. It's the first time since 1980 that there hasbeen any contribution to the economy from that source, so it is arather radical change in GNP effect that they have already put inthere. As far as office building is concerned, I think the longer itgoes on the worse it is going to be. I don't know when it is going tobreak, but it is going to break pretty big; and the longer it goes onthe bigger the break will be when it occurs.So, I'm starting to lose my optimism; I figure at best wewill get the staff forecast for the period to come and it could be agood deal worse. There is a possibility of a recession and we need torecognize that. I said that last time, thinking of it as sort of aremote possibility. My feeling is that the possibility is a littlestronger now that there will be a recession some time in the next ninemonths. It's a distinct possibility. In any event, I would want topoint out to you--and I think this is what Pres Martin did--that thestaff forecast is well below our bogey for the performance of theeconomy. We [as a group] forecast 4 percent for the second half ofthe year, I believe, in real terms. Apparently, it is going to bewell below that. We forecast a pretty good 1986, and it looks asthough it is going to be below that by an appreciable percent or so.So we are below our bogey; that seems to be increasingly clear as themonths go by, and I think we will need to take that into account indetermining what the monetary policy ought to be", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You have made our forecast a bogey", " The--MR. PARTEE. And with no drop in the discount rate, I takeit", "MR. PARTEE. You suggest a little operation twist", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Well, looking at operational policy in ourusual format, I didn't hear anybody talking about anything thatsounded like alternative C. I suppose it's impossible that themonetary numbers would come out that low. Who knows. But I don'tthink anybody wants to drive them there, if I heard the conversationcorrectly. The difference between \"A\" and \"B\" in the actual numbersI'm not sure is big enough to send anybody very much. We had 6 to 7percent last time. We're in one of these mid-quarter periods when,just as a matter of form, I prefer to make fewer changes rather thanmore in these targets that we don't meet anyway", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

I don't disagree that the dollar is asignificant variable, but I would point out that the objective was toget the dollar down. That was a program to which you agreed: to getthe dollar down. And it has come down and, I think, has behavedextremely well. I thought for the whole period between meetings thatthe dollar had a lifting tendency and that's why we had to do theintervention. If it doesn't lift, we don't do the intervention. Itwas just very recently that we got a little weakness. And I think theweakness has come because of the Japanese raising their rates, whichis certainly a contra-economic policy from a world point of view--notbecause of anything we did.

MARTIN. Let me play devil's advocate for just a minute.We have been talking about what I think is the real risk of aprecipitous decline of the dollar.

PARTEE. How much of each", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. There is another way of looking atit, too, just in terms of institutional sources of demand for dollars.A lot of that demand has come from Japan, of course, and in Japanthere are two sets of institutional factors that tend to cut the otherway. One is that most of the pension funds [and] insurance companieshave a 10 percent limit on the percent of their portfolio that can bein any non-yen currency, and almost without exception they arecrowding up against the 10 ten percent. Now, that won't keep themfrom buying dollars completely, but it means that they can only buydollars prospectively to the extent that their overall asset basegrows. Secondly--and I think this is particularly relevant in thecase of Japan--according to the reports that we get, through much ofthe second and third quarters Japanese corporations, of course, werespinning off a tremendous amount of excess cash and were making veryshort-term dollar investments in very large quantities. And thereports that we get have begun to suggest that, partly because of thechanged economic situation, that very large supply of short-termdemand for dollar-denominated assets may not be there prospectively inanything like [the way] it was retrospectively. I don't know how allthat fits in, but it is one of the factors that tend to work on theother side of the equation", "12/16-17/85MR. MELZER. I would say, just as a general comment--I am notclosely in touch with the psychology of that market--that the factthat there might be a perception that we have reached target levelsand that we have achieved some kind of stability actually couldincrease the vulnerability to a precipitous decline because those thatwere short dollars and riding it down very likely have covered those[short positions]. So that takes a bit out of the market. Now, Idon't know whether that is the case, Sam--whether you feel positionsare pretty well squared off--but if those short positions are out ofthe market, there could be a chance for a more precipitous decline", " But ifthat is covered, that limit is not--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN.

I would like to stress that the workis really quite experimental in the sense that the statistical basisfor the weighting is not that strong. We have done surveys in theResearch Division to develop data and, while it's as good as we thinkwe can make it under present knowledge, the statistical basis is notthat strong. Secondly, I would like to stress that, at least in myown view--and it's probably important to get more input from others inthe profession--I don't think it solves the policy problem. It mayhave certain presentational advantages but I don't think it solves thepolicy problem of whether or to what degree the aggregates are a goodguide to [the Committee].

But I think they are worse in another way, asidefrom the analytical, and that is from the communications aspect of[policy]. M1 was very useful at one time to help us rationalize anddefend what needed to be done several years ago. But it has fallenfrom grace on a pretty wide scale. And while I think there areadvantages to hanging on to the hope that it could somehow berehabilitated, it seems to me that it has been wounded so badly thatit would be very difficult for a considerable period in the future tobase any hard medicine on something like M1. Therefore, it seems to-11-12/16-17/85me that it goes beyond the analytical problems that we have with M1.It just would be very difficult from a public relations and apolitical point of view ever to base--no, ever is too long--in theforeseeable future to base any kind of bitter pill on something likeM1. We ought to continue the work and I think the suggestions thatPres made are worth pursuing. But I think we are dealing withsomething that is much bigger than just analytical work.

We'll seewhether it has had a partial recovery; I'm not sure it will return tofull health. We would have to have one heck of an increase in theeconomy in the next 3 to 6 months, which is contrary to theprojections we have before us", "MR. AXILROD. One other way of looking at it, Mr. Chairman,is that a lot of these NOW accounts are simply, in effect, the oldsavings accounts re-designated. And all of this volatility that weare observing as interest rates go up and down, would have occurredonly in M2 and not at all in M1", "-13-12/16-17/85VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. There are a couple of straws in thewind, but not much more. One thing that I think is true that bears onall of this is that today even compared, say, to 1980, the public atlarge is much more sensitive to interest rates and relative interestrates in managing their financial asset portfolios. That's just ahunch, but it does look that way to me. The second thing that may betrue is that in terms of general liquidity characteristics offinancial assets held by the public that are not bank-issued--in otherwords institutionalized savings such as thrift-plan type savings,pensions, IRAs and so on--a good deal more of the nonbank-relatedfinancial asset holdings of the public may be perceived by the publicto be less liquid than bank-issued financial assets. Again, I don'tknow this to be true, but my hunch is that it is. And if both ofthose things are true, that also may help to explain why the public,including the business sector, does seem to be on the one hand moreaggressive in shifting among classes of bank-issued financial assets,while at the same time increasing their holdings of nonbank-issuedfinancial assets. The problem with that, if it is true, is that itbrings into sharp focus in my mind the point that Dave mentioned interms of what it implies about the interest sensitivity even of M2 butespecially of M1. If you argue that M2 in some sense is less interestsensitive and, therefore, is a better \"indicator\" than it used to beor even better than M1 is, but you also accept the point that Davemade that it really isn't the quantity that matters, it's the pricethat matters, then it seems to me that you can get yourself into areal box, if it turns out that M2 is less sensitive but yet theeconomy itself is in some sense more sensitive. That to me makes thisquestion of what you look at more difficult in one sense but maybeeasier in another sense. That's because if the public is moresensitive and if there is anything at all to this question ofliquidity of bank-related instruments versus nonbank instruments, it'sanother reason to believe that money growth relative to GNP is goingto be permanently higher than it was in the past and velocity growthis going to be smaller at least than it was in the past.The other point that has been made about drawing someconsolation from the fact that the broad aggregates, M2 and M3, lookmore respectable and can help us interpret, or at least roll with M1in this recent period, I am not very sure about. For example, in thecase of M3, I cannot help but think that M3 is as weak as it has beenat least in part because of the way banks are financing things thesedays. They are issuing standbys and all these other off-balance-sheetinstruments. Somebody else is doing the financing and the bank itselfno longer has to issue the large CD until something goes wrong and theborrower comes to the bank to execute a standby. I think if you makeany allowance for the tremendous explosion of off-balance-sheetcontingent financing by the banks, as opposed to the traditional bankfinancing of business credit through issuance of large CDs, one atleast has to question whether in fact M3 is telling us the same thingsit used to tell us insofar as that broad measure of bank liabilitiesis concerned", "MR. PARTEE. The point though, Paul, is that M3 doesn't tellus anything either", "MR. PARTEE. They were in the zero growth area; you put inall that has been growing", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Maybe. If you take that line, why are allthese aggregates rising so much faster than the economy", " Plenty of cash deposits as far as thehouseholds are concerned--MR. MORRIS. I think the answer is in the opposite directionof your assumption. We have been looking at total financial assets asa percentage of GNP and that ratio has declined from the 1960s andreached a bottom around 1978; it has been rising since then, althoughit's still below the level of the 1960s. But the percentage offinancial assets comprised by checkable deposits and currency is lowernow than it was in 1978, 1979", "\" At the moment it seems tome much cheaper to buy a piece of plant and equipment--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you're right, I think you would have toget very low levels of plant and equipment and housing expendituresand I am not sure that they have been all that low", "MR. PARTEE. It would be an effort to capture a larger shareof the business of the transactor", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Not for M1; legally we have to have someranges. I think there might be a certain amount of disappointment--though maybe not so much after our recent experience. But a couple ofyears ago we wouldn't have gotten by without having an M1 range", "MR. GRIFFITH. Mr. Chairman, I am going to pick up onGovernor Seger's comments about simplification and maybe somemechanical problems that will make M1 worse. I think the reason thatbanks have not simplified is very simple: For the most part, mostbanks have little or no internal cost controls and don't know what [adeposit] costs them. I know for the West Coast [banks] I can saythat. They have zero idea what it costs them to run a savingsaccount. Those that have looked at it recently have come up withstaggering numbers: I am talking about a hundred dollars a year to runa 5-1/2 percent savings account. If you take that number on a $5000deposit and you went up to 5-1/2 percent on an MMDA rate, up to 5-1/2percent you would be better off; it would be cheaper to offer a higherrate of interest and get rid of the overhead cost to run a savingsaccount", "MR. GRIFFITH. It's cheaper to run any type of account than apassbook savings account by virtue of some of the anomalies--forexample, sending out quarterly statements, the mailing costs, and thefact that some still require passbooks, etc. Yes, you can achievesome real economies of scale as far as trying to get one account thatwill enable you to have trailing balances. I'm saying 2 or 3 thingsfor information. All I am suggesting is that the reason we haven'tseen simplification is not because it won't occur, but when it doesoccur it will further complicate M1. It's simply because bankshaven't figured out how much it costs them. But probably moreimportant than that: In the 1980s banks, particularly the large banks-- [unintelligible] the East Coast banks, the large money center banksin the West--have not had the earnings necessary to spend the dollars,the millions of dollars, for automation redesign. So I am just sayingthat I think this is going to occur and it's going to furthercomplicate M1.The only other comment I have has to do with the staff paper,which we in San Francisco enjoyed reading and thought was well donealso. We take one exception, and we may be totally wrong, but wouldjust point it out for Committee consideration. The staff here saysthat they believe that the large debit risk overdraft program will-20-12/16-17/85have little or no impact upon M1. That's on page 18 of the staffreport. We have trouble with that. If you look at the total dollaramount of daylight overdrafts that are currently in existence, I inparticular have trouble with a statement that it is not going to alterpayments. Our analysis would indicate in our own District--in anyevent, the first four or five banks that we have looked at who arepretty good performers from the staff point of view--that overdraftsare really caused by international payments. Jerry could probablyspeak to this better than I, but the overdrafts are not caused byfunding needs; they are primarily caused by the participation in CHIPSand things like that. And we say, yes, it will affect things ineither one or two ways. Either somehow there will be fewer paymentsmade per day or some alteration in the payments scheme of things or--what we think is much more likely and what we are hearing from ourbanks--there will be a real push, frankly, by the commercial banks toget their depositor to pony up overnight liquid dollars to hold downthese payments", "MR. FORRESTAL. I am not really quite sure why I feel thisway, Mr. Chairman, but I have a completely different point of viewfrom the one that has just been expressed and that Press Martinexpressed. I think it is really premature to give up on M1. Irealize that monitoring is not really giving up on it and that M1 is asick patient, to be sure; but I am not sure that it is ready to die.I think we ought to give it a little more time. Some of theseportfolio shifts to which we are attributing the difficulty of M1 mayslow down. According to the staff, and I have to agree with them, weapparently are not going to see the effects of further deregulation.-21-12/16-17/85So, I think we ought to give it a little more time, and I would liketo see us continue with a range for M1. But because of thedifficulties that we have had with it, I think that the range needs tobe wider than we traditionally have had. So for 1986 I would like awider range perhaps at about the level that it is. The other thingthat troubles me a little about putting M1 on a monitoring range isthat I am not sure the markets are going to interpret that in theright way. I think they might very well feel that this is our way ofabandoning further efforts against inflation", "MR. KEEHN. Given the results of M1 this year, I certainlythink abandoning the range would have some appeal. But other than thelegal aspect, it seems to me that there are public perception aspectsthat would be difficult. By saying that we are not going to establisha range and that we have a lot of work going on to try and get abetter understanding of what has been going on gives me the impressionthat we have a bunch of engineers in the back room busily crankingaway and at some early point we'll come up with an ideal model thatmight work. It might indeed work, but we would have to have aconsiderable period of time to feel comfortable with that. Clearly,in my mind, we're going through a period of considerable uncertainty.But given that, I would be inclined to use ranges as broad aspossible, perhaps at least as broad as this year or maybe wider andcertainly not narrower. I'd just put in the testimony a lot ofjudgmental comments as to how we are going to end up in those rangesas the year evolves", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that we are talkingin terms of widening these ranges much more than they would have to bewidened under any set of reasonable circumstances. For example, if weshould say that 4 percent real growth next year is a reasonabletarget--and I think we would all be very pleased with that--if M1[velocity] should resume its historical rate, 3 percent being thenormal rate, then a 4 percent rate of growth in M1 would be enough.-22-12/16-17/85In the past if we had no trend in velocity at all, if it was zero,then 7 percent growth in the money supply would be enough to financethat 7 percent rise in nominal GNP. So 4 to 7 percent would encompassa pretty broad range there", "MR. MARTIN. Bob, the trouble I have with that is that themonetary policy assumption in the Greenbook carries a 125 to 150 basispoint decline in interest rates next year. That means you're throwingin another big variable, the same big variable again--a big drop ininterest rates", "MS. SEGER. Mr. Annunzio said to cut up your credit cards", "MR. BOYKIN. At midyear we tried to make some adjustment inrecognition of what has actually happened--rebasing, widening theranges. It is true that the behavior of M1 has not improved, but itseems to me that keeping the M1 range--downgrading it through words ormonitoring it or whatever you want to call it--and widening the rangesome would be the only prudent thing to do right now, until some ofthis other work could be done and we know a lot more than we do [now].I don't think I could say with any assurance that things might notreturn over the next six or eight months", "MR. RICE. The more you ask us to focus on this, the moreapparent it becomes that we should be hesitant about moving away fromthe aggregates too quickly. The alternatives seem unsatisfactory", "MR. PRELL. Governor Martin, I might mention that venturecapitalists in various paper surveys have indicated that therelatively low capital gains rates are very important to them. Withthese tax reform proposals, the capital gains taxes would not be asrelatively low as they are now, so that some shift--according to theseviews--might be in store in terms of that kind of entrepreneurship", "MR. FORRESTAL. Jim, on the face of it I would have thoughtthat the lower interest rates that you're projecting would have givenmore stimulus to the economy than you have. I take it from what yousaid that you're seeing an offset in the Gramm-Rudman Bill. Butaren't there government spending plans in the pipeline that are goingto carry through to the first quarter and perhaps into the secondquarter. The second thing I'd like to have you comment on, if youwould--if you said it, I didn't hear--is the effect of inventoryinvestment on the economy", "MR. KICHLINE. Right", "MR. MORRIS. One reason, as I understand it, is that they hadbeen assuming that the price of computers has not changed over thisperiod. And they're substituting an assumption of a 10 percent peryear decline", "MR. KEEHN. In terms of the Midwest perspective, our feelingsboth currently and prospectively are very much unchanged from theprevious meetings. As we look ahead we think the expansion willcontinue, albeit modestly and certainly unevenly. Therefore, ouroutlook is certainly consistent with the staff's forecast. Indeed,perhaps there is an opportunity for somewhat improved results nextyear as opposed to what the staff is suggesting, as the risk of comingin weaker is diminishing, I think.-32-12/16-17/85I have a couple of specific comments. I almost hate tomention it, but the agricultural situation does continue out there.And I think the situation is, if anything, more serious. The cropharvest is about completed, on normal schedule, but the production isgoing to be very significantly higher than last year. That willcontinue to put pressure on commodity prices, and I think we're in aperiod in which production loans are going to have to be paid off. Itwill be interesting to see how the production values come in relativeto the loans. There is also, of course, the issue of land values; therate of decline certainly is diminishing but values are down verysubstantially whereas the debt has not come down. So we have thisvery difficult gap between debt and land values, which has to be dealtwith. As a consequence of all this, I think the stress on theagricultural banks is continuing in a very significant way. Theircharge-offs this year are going to be substantially higher than wasthe case last year. A very significant number of them are going toshow losses this year as compared to last year. So the agriculturalproblem continues to be very important.My second comment is on the tax bill. I must say that thepeople I talk with say this continual uncertainty is extremelydifficult from a planning perspective. They just are having anawfully tough time figuring out what to do. There are a lot of peoplewho say cynically that a bad bill would be better than this continuinguncertainty that they are dealing with. Also, as kind of an editorialcomment: Those in the manufacturing sector do feel that the bill as ithas been proposed by the House is, at least from their point of view,a very bad bill.I think the most significant change that I've seen over thelast few weeks is related to this exchange value of the dollar. Theattitudinal change that I sense out there is just very important. Noone will say they got this deal or that deal because the value of thedollar is down; but everybody says it just is a much betterenvironment in which to at least negotiate. They'd like more. Interms of the yen, they would like 180 or 190. But most importantly,they are pleased with what has been accomplished and are very hopefulthat the rate will not go back up. The whole change of attitude basedon this I find very, very positive", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On this farm situation, I don't knowwhether you or anybody else had any comments, but we've had quite anincrease in agricultural prices from a very low level in the lastmonth or two months. Does that make anybody feel any better.MESSRS. KEEHN & GUFFEY. No", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that as we enterthe fourth year, if that's what it is--if anyone can measure thebeginnings and ends of these expansions--the risk elements continue tobuild. The Chairman mentioned agriculture. There is some miraclekind of farm bill, which looks like it has made some progress, thatbegins to change the game a little--and perhaps in a positivedirection--with regard to world prices and targets and other pricesfrom the U.S. government. That bill would require a bit of change offormat by agricultural producers and traders in the commodity markets,if it passes in that way. I think that's characteristic of the exportarea on which we are depending for late-in-the-year support for theeconomy. What's different about that to me is the much more assertive--I won't say aggressive--stance and approach taken by Clayton Yeiderand by this administration. I am not criticizing that approach but itcomplicates the [effort to] increase U.S. exports in that there are[potential] retaliatory actions in Europe and elsewhere. I haven'tseen anything that really clearly lays out how in this assertive,almost adversarial, atmosphere we get that additional export help inthe GNP sense. Probably we will, but it seems to me that there is arisk when you approach these negotiations in a somewhat different way.As far as housing is concerned, I am usually the pessimist inthat area. I think the staff forecast in the housing area isreasonable at this time, but it is reasonable because of the monetarypolicy assumptions. A decrease of 125 to 150 basis points in rates isreally necessary if we are to get this more or less modestimprovement. There is a down side in this too, of course, in that asthe regulators put pressure on the originators and servicers ofmortgages, there is a risk that this plus in the GNP won't come aboutbecause the credit standards will be higher, because they won't beable to qualify the borrowers, and because there have to be morewrite-offs. They are getting to this talk about good banks and badbanks and splitting the mortgage originators into the goodinstitutions and the bad institutions. Well, that's another factor tocope with, another bit of uncertainty. Uncertainty means risks inthat area. The risk of a collapse in non-residential spending isobvious. We have gone over practically every molecule of that risk inour meetings here, and rightly so. There is a slight decrease, 0.7percent or something like that, in the model results here. And I-34-12/16-17/85understand that. Jim warned me that he built some other slow growthrates in there before and the markets raced on ahead. But there is arisk, isn't there, of a collapse--of a really sharp negative in thatarea. One could go on to examine the risks in the financialinstitutions; 113 banks have changed the name on the door. In mostcases, it's not a calamity, but the risk goes on. And banks reallyhaven't addressed the write-downs that they are going to have to dowith the Perus of the world, have they. Some have started, butrelative to banks in other countries and relative to so-called taxreform, now characterized as a revision treatment of the bad debtreserves, that certainly is a risk--in terms of facing that questionand in terms of bank credit growth (not off-balance-sheet but on-balance-sheet bank credit growth) and the funding of continuedeconomic growth. We are only talking about another four quarters ofaround 2 percent. We certainly have had enough quarters of around 2percent with the downside risk what it is. So what I want to stressthis morning is the need to keep in mind the monetary policyassumptions in this projection. I support the projection but I alsosupport the monetary policy assumptions, which go to a rather prompt--I almost said a bad word--a rather prompt accommodational posture andcarrying that on out for the balance of the year", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, it appears to me that we aredepending on the modest growth in employment, some pickup in housing,and favorable consumer attitudes to get us to a moderate 2 percentrate of growth over 1986. If we look at the uncertainties in theforecast, particularly the uncertainties with regard to consumercapacities to continue spending, and if we also take account of ourexpectations that there will be some movement toward fiscal restraint,it seems to me that the risks to the forecast are on the down side.Now, obviously, some very good things have happened. In very generalterms, interest rates have come down and the dollar has come down.But when you try to evaluate what the impact of these generallyfavorable developments would be on specific sectors, it's very hard tosee how this is going to get us more growth than is forecast for 1986.So, far from seeing the risks on the up side as Bob does, I see themrather on the down side. So to me, the main question that is raisedis whether a moderate 2 percent rate of growth for 1986 is acceptable,-35-12/16-17/85all things considered, in the current circumstances, particularly inlight of the inflation outlook", "MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, form the perspective of theSixth District, things are looking considerably better than they did amonth ago. We have had a very sharp decline in unemployment--from alittle over 8 percent to about 7.3 percent--and even the employment inmanufacturing, textiles, and apparel has tended to stabilize. Thetextile and apparel people, as well as some manufacturers, even haveseen some increases in their orders over the last month. This is notreducing the protectionist sentiment, I might say. They are notreally attributing this [improvement] to a fall in the dollar,although they recognize that there might be some of that. But theyare still looking for protectionist measures like the Jenkins bill tomake some fundamental changes in their situation. Constructioncontinues to be very good in most areas. To be sure, we have weakspots in the District, such as Louisiana, but construction in moststates is doing pretty well. Retail sales have been very, very good,particularly in the post-Thanksgiving period. And from animpressionistic point of view the business people that I talked toreally are exhibiting a good deal of confidence about 1986. Theythink that growth is going to be not marvelous, but fairly moderate,and perhaps a little better than in 1985. People I talked to, likethose Si Keehn mentioned, are very discouraged about the tax bill.They would like it either to be passed or to be taken off the table sothat they can make their plans. If the bill is revived, as perhaps itmight be, that is going to cause additional uncertainty, and I thinkthat business people might very well defer some business decisions in1986, which might be a negative for the economy.So, extrapolating from that kind of local experience, itwould seem to me that maybe the risk is slightly on the up side. Iwould think that the effect of interest rates would perhaps be more ofa stimulus to the economy, notwithstanding Gramm-Rudman, than in theBoard staff's forecast. So I continue to look for a little strongereconomy, perhaps somewhere in the area of 2-1/2 to 3 percent for GNP.I guess the difference between my forecast and the Board staff'sforecast is not so much in the numbers. Rather, it's in my feelingthat I can accept the 2-1/2 to 3 percent growth rate, while the Boardstaff's forecast would be unacceptable. If they're right, I thinkthat perhaps the time has come to make some move to bring that up alittle. But again, I believe we are probably going to see 2-1/2 to 3percent growth", "-36-12/16-17/85MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, the economy in Texas and inthe Eleventh District has continued to grow at a sluggish pace.That's due in large part to a further deterioration in the energysector. For example, the rig count is at its lowest level in tenyears. The District's construction activity in 1985 has shown morerapid growth than that for the nation as a whole, but thatrelationship is expected to flip-flop in the year ahead. Even thegrowth of the service sector is like that of the nation, and noturnaround is in sight. Both the economy and the economic mood havecontinued to deteriorate, and I am hard pressed to find any sources ofpotential optimism. In short, the District's economic problems arepervasive and extend far beyond those attributable to the energysector.Having said that about the Eleventh District, our view of theeconomy as a whole for next year is that we would anticipate probablya little better year than we had in 1985. Our GNP number probablywould be closer to 3 percent than to 2 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Just looking at forecasts--for whatthey are worth, which is probably not a lot--our forecast for 1986 isone that has GNP in real terms growing at about 3 percent or a shademore. In that sense, it looks more like the consensus of privateforecasts than it does the Board staff's forecast. There is anotherimportant difference in that our forecast basically assumes thatshort-term interest rates are unchanged from roughly where they aretoday rather than having a decline already built in. But likeGovernor Rice, I don't have a lot of conviction about that forecastbecause when you go through sector by sector it's hard to findconcrete evidence that would suggest that there is any real marginalgrowth on the up side, and there are the risks on the down side. Weare at a point, in my judgment, where we have 3 or 4 very, very majorfactors that transcend the sectors. I am not sure anybody has reallydigested these factors, and I am not sure one can. One is the declinewe have seen in the foreign exchange rate itself. I think we had somesurprises on the up side of that phenomenon and I think one couldargue that we may get more bang out of that than is being allowed forin the conventional kind of forecast. Just as one example: If the so-called Baker plan works as designed, that in itself could end upfinancing a very [robust] increase in import growth in the developingcountries and Latin America, and we would be presumably the majorbeneficiaries of it. But leaving aside that particular aspect of it,I think that one at least has to allow for the possibility that we mayget a little more help there than we are counting on.The second area that seems to me to transcend individualsectors is this recent run-up in stock and bond prices. I can make acase that if those gains are roughly sustainable, they could veryeasily provide more of a kick to the economy than the quarter pointthat Jim mentioned, particularly when you recognize how late in thisyear a major part of that gain, particularly in the stock market, hasoccurred. Of course, the big question is sustainability. I think onecould argue that there is some danger, especially in the stock market,that it already has overshot the mark in some fundamental sense, inwhich case what looks like it could be a plus for the economy rightnow could turn out to be a minus. I also think that there is at least-37-12/16-17/85a good chance that we do not really know how to build the oil price,and more generally commodity prices, into an economic forecast--especially the oil price implications. We don't know what will happento the oil price. That too strikes me as a variable that could have alarger effect than is being allowed for now, simply because nobody hasa way to take account of it. I think the fiscal situation nowpresents some real uncertainties: the combination of Gramm-Rudman,whatever it turns out to be, and the tax bill. Again, if you look atthem in a rather conventional way, I think one is powerfully drawn tothe conclusion that if they play out as scheduled, their effects onthe economy--at least in the timeframe of 1986-1987--are going to beto reduce growth, net, and possibly even to increase prices a little.But, again, I don't think we know enough about what in fact willhappen; we certainly don't have a good fix on the kinds ofanticipatory behavior, both in the market and in spending decisions,that have already been built into the equations so to speak.And finally, there is this whole money and credit problemthat we talked about yesterday. As I mentioned yesterday, when youmake what seem to me to be some reasonable assumptions aboutdefinitions and so on, I think you have to come to the conclusion thatmoney and credit, however defined, have been growing very, veryrapidly--whether you look at that in terms of debt accumulation or anyway you slice it up. Now what does that mean. As a number of people,including myself, suggested yesterday, you can argue that velocitytrends have changed. Nevertheless, even if you make that argument,that phenomenon still sits there and it has to be something of aconcern. So, back to the question of a forecast: As I said, ours is 3percent or so; but I don't think we can quite capture the dynamics ofthis situation we face simply by looking sector by sector, because Ithink these four of five things I have mentioned transcend that. Andit's not clear to me how they're going to play out", "MR. BOEHNE. Well, I think the Philadelphia District is astronger area--particularly in New Jersey, Delaware and thePhiladelphia part of Pennsylvania--than many other parts of thecountry. There are still many depressed areas in other parts ofPennsylvania, but I think the District generally is doing better thanthe rest of the country.As far as the national economy is concerned, we are talkingabout roughly 2-1/2 percent real growth, give or take a little, and Ithink that's a reasonable forecast. One can make a case that it willbe somewhat stronger or somewhat weaker depending on the dynamics thattake place. But I ask myself this question: Is 2-1/2 percentsatisfactory. I don't think 2-1/2 percent is satisfactory. Supposethe dynamics lead us to 3 or 3-1/2 or even 4 percent. I think thatwould make me happy. I think it would move the economy in the rightdirection: it would help us get around some of these financialproblems. So, if we erred in that direction, I think it would be aplus. On the other hand, suppose we erred in the other direction.Suppose we end up with 2 or 1-1/2 or 1 percent. I think that wouldbring forth a number of negatives in the economy. So, even though it-39-12/16-17/85is a good forecast, and I think that the risks are probably about evenas to whether it will be up or down from that, I would much prefer ifI could do it to be on the high side, at about 2-1/2 percent. Andthat has some implications for monetary policy, which I think areappropriately dealt with later", "MS. SEGER. Well, I think the economy has grown too slowly in1985. I went back and looked at the information we put out at thetime of the February Humphrey-Hawkins meeting and the July Humphrey-Hawkins meeting. Looking at the central tendencies that we published[in February] for real GNP growth for 1985, we had 3-1/2 to 4 percent.So it looks as if there are some other people who must be disappointedalso in the performance. By July we had cut it back to 2-3/4 to 3percent, but again that's above what we actually seem to be achievingfor this year. Then I look at 1986 and the staff forecast of arousing 2.1 percent growth rate and again compare that to the centraltendency for 1986 as published in the July Humphrey-Hawkins Report.That was 2-1/2 to 3-1/4 percent. So again, it seems to me that we arerunning short of a number of our expectations. I guess what concernsme is that even to get this 2.1 percent in 1986 we have to assumeadditional monetary ease, a significant decline in interest rates.And we also assume--I think I heard Jim say--that about half of theimprovement in real GNP next year will come from net exports. Thatmeans to me, anyway, that we will need further declines in the dollar.We all have our pet samples of people we talk to, and the group that Icheck my ideas with suggests that they have noticed the decline thathas taken place, but they are not going to be in pig heaven withoutstill further declines. I am also concerned about the impact that thetax reform proposals are having on the economy. I think it hascreated a lot of uncertainties and I am afraid, as Chuck said, that atsome point the activities that had been based on beating the taxreforms in certain areas are going to evaporate and that will yank therug out from under certain sectors of the economy. So having said allthis, what I would like to propose is that we get going with thisadditional monetary ease and that we try to get interest rates movingdown, in line with what the staff forecast is assuming. I would liketo suggest that one reason why short rates haven't come down is thatthe discount rate is preventing them from moving down. That's justlike an anchor, and I would hint that a one half percentage point cutin the discount rate would do great things to move a number of short-term rates down, including the prime rate", "MR. GUFFEY. And then a full half point after that", "MR. KICHLINE. Yes", "MR. PRELL. You can't really couple the two series thatdirectly, but it sort of looks that way", " Well, that may be right too, but--VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Or input", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, if ours were a closedeconomy, I would support some lowering of interest rates at themoment. The forecast may be reasonable, but I don't think it'sacceptable as a good target. I would share your concern about a 4percent pattern of real growth, but it seems to me that 2 percent isnot acceptable as a target; 3 percent would be more in line with whatI think we ought to shoot for. But we're not a closed economy. Wehave overhanging us a necessity to continue to finance a $140 billioncurrent account deficit. So we have to keep in mind what the gnomesof Zurich are thinking about us", "-49-12/16-17/85MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, given my view of the economy, Idon't think we really need to do anything at the moment. I think theeconomy is going to be somewhat better in 1986 than it has been in1985. Certainly, my forecast is that it's going to be better than thestaff's projections. So given that, I'm not concerned about theeconomy at the moment. I am concerned, however, that if we were toease we might begin to lose some of the gains we've made in terms ofinflationary expectations. Now, if the economy in the shorter termwere to begin to turn down, or if we lost some of the gains we've hadwith respect to the foreign exchange value of the dollar or long-termrates--that is, if either of those began to back up--then I wouldsupport some easing in policy. As has been pointed out, we have beenaccommodative with respect to the monetary aggregates. I don't thinkanyone can say we haven't been. Of course, the question is howeffective that has been in terms of moving the economy. But allthings considered, I would prefer that we take a wait-and-seeattitude; and that means, I suppose, alternative B with a borrowinglevel of around $400 to $450 million", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I think you were quite right indirecting our attention to the growth in bank credit and totalreserves and other factors. They are labeled here the key monetaryaggregates. I think, though, particularly in terms of Ml, what hascome out of our discussion yesterday, which spills over to some ofthese other aggregates, is that given deregulation--given the pricingand the consumer reaction to new instruments and new spreads and newopportunity cost relationships--we really don't know what thosefigures mean. At least we don't know as much as we used to know aboutthem. Secondly, it seems to me that the staff's forecast has not beendemolished in our discussions earlier today. Therefore, with theforecast, which would be extant if we kept conditions as they aretoday with the adjustment and seasonal borrowings running $633 millionin September, $558 million in October, and $672 million in November,it seems to me that we run a risk of recession--to get that word outin the discussion--rather than a 2 percent growth.It seems to me also that your comments with regard tocoordination are certainly in order. I believe in the technicalinformation we've had with regard to a discount rate cut that what hasbeen assumed here is 50 basis points. I haven't heard anyone mention25 points; 50 points seems to have been implicit or explicit in thediscussion. Plus a move to a configuration such as alternative Amight be: (a) risky as far as the dollar falling; and (b) over-stimulative relative to what little we do know about these monetaryaggregates anymore. So, I would like to see the Chairman and thestaff use the alternative A course in conjunction with a futurediscount rate cut. I think there is merit in removing what appears tobe the floor under short-term rates vis-a-vis long-term rates. Iwould hope that we would have an alternative A which would merge inthe direction of alternative B down the road. I would hope that thisCommittee would give the Chairman an unusually wide band for theborrowing. I don't know what the band should be--perhaps $300 to $500million or something rather wide so that this operation could takeplace. By this operation I mean to start easing in the market, movingtoward $300 to $350 million so that the fed funds rate begins to comedown, and to adjust the discount rate by 50 basis points and continue-50-12/16-17/85to work the Desk operations so that the borrowings firm up a littlewithin that range, depending on the Chairman's judgment at that time,back to $400 million, let's say. At any rate, [I favor] a starttoward providing a 50 basis point change at the short end. I thinkthe market expects that and that we run the risk of its backing up onus, including in the short-term rates. That, as the Chairmanindicates, is certainly a desirable direction. But as we all knowrates are still at a very high level in real terms. And the staff wasindicating this morning that the high real level of long-term rateshelps produce 2 percent growth for another four quarters which, as hasbeen commented here, is insufficient. We should do what we can tobring growth up some. Therefore, I vote for alternative A with a wideband around the borrowings; and I'm looking forward to a discount ratecut and some adjustment of the borrowings accordingly", " Honesty compels me to say that we have notbeen terribly sensitive to small changes in Ml, but higher concern--MR. BLACK. I'm aware of that. But you did paint a pictureof a lot of liquidity that we had pumped into the economy, or so Iinterpreted your remarks. So I would hope there would be a bit moresensitivity to additions in liquidity on top of that", "MR. RICE. Well, Mr. Chairman, I find the outlook for a 2percent rate of [GNP] growth for 1986 unacceptable in the currentcircumstances. So I find myself in sympathy with the observationsthat have been made around the table by Messrs. Boehne and Guffey andalso Mr. Stern. I would prefer an alternative somewhere between \"A\"and \"B\" for now. I tend to separate the reduction in pressures onreserves from the discount rate decision. I would prefer to easepressure on bank reserves somewhat now and see what effect that has,and then make a discount rate decision in light of what happens whenwe ease somewhat. So for now I would come down somewhere between \"A\"and \"B,\" holding in abeyance the discount rate reduction", "VICE CHAIRMAN CORRIGAN. Well, I have a rather strongpreference to work within the framework of alternative B. I certainlyam not as sanguine as some are on this foreign exchange ratesituation. I think we've done very, very well to date. I'm notuncomfortable with where we are, but I must say that as I read thesituation I think the downside risks are still very much there. Onecould quibble about whether they're a shade less or more than theywere a month or six weeks ago, but I certainly feel that they arethere. Also, as I said yesterday, when I look at these financialaggregates and make some rough adjustments for what I think is reallyhappening with M2 and M3, I come to the conclusion that in anunderlying sense they all are growing very, very rapidly. And if Ican take a little poetic license, when we talk about easing policywhat in some sense we are saying is that we want people to go out andborrow some more. And when I look at what's already there, I'm justnot quite sure that that's the right response. I think Karen has apoint. You can almost, at least somewhat more abstractly, raise thequestion of whether given what is already there we should in somesense be looking at policy from a different vantage point altogether.But I don't think that's in the cards. In sum, I would want to workin the framework of alternative B. I think the nicest outcome that Icould imagine would be one in which we could lower the discount ratein concert with other countries doing the same thing and end up withthe borrowing sticking around the $400 million level. Now, I don'thave the authority on either side of the coin to say whether thatreduction in the discount rate should be 25 basis points or 50 basispoints, but I think the question of 25 basis points is one that is atleast worth serious consideration. On the question of what I would doif there were no prospect for some kind of a parallel movement inpolicy elsewhere--and, of course, that we won't know today--I think mydruthers would be to stick more or less with the framework of \"B\" asis. But, again, if there were some opportunity for movement elsewherein tandem with something by us, I think that would be fine. Thatwould be the best of all possible outcomes, from my perspective", "MR. GRIFFITH. I am personally totally uncertain as to whatshould happen. But having discussed this with John Balles and no oneelse, and having listened to this conversation, I think we want to beon record as just a little concerned that the forecast that our staffis making for 1986 on growth, as I indicated earlier, depends uponlowering the short rates very rapidly--front-loading early in the yearto offset what may be sluggish spending in the last half of the year.So for that reason and other discussions that have gone on here aboutconcerns that 2 percent growth may not be what we want to happen--orat least not sufficient or desirable--we find ourselves in the Guffey-Boehne camp at somewhere between alternatives A and B, with some ease.I think we would feel a little more strongly that there ought to be adiscount rate cut to get the short rates moving downward", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you can get one side; I'm not sureabout the other side. I'd be very skeptical on the other side. Youmay get an exchange rate realignment in Europe; I don't know whetherthat's good or bad. There's considerable pressure over there now.Well, it's hard to read this as a great consensus. And sincethere are too many variables in the equation, it is neither a-58-12/16-17/85consensus nor by and large an enormous difference. The tactics makeit very difficult. This is a little messier than I would like to makeit, but let me try to suggest something. For the moment we have asomewhat lower level of borrowing, but not so far that we couldn'treverse it without being too obvious about it, if the discount ratewent down. If the discount rate doesn't go down, we might want topress that further. If it does go down, we might adopt this strategythat a number ofpeople have suggested of reducing the discount ratebut not the borrowing, which means something like--particularly takinginto account a minor point, but nonetheless one that is there, thatseasonal borrowings are running very low--$350 to $400 million or $300to $400 million at the moment, and going to the upper side of that ormaybe above it if the discount rate went down by a half. If itdoesn't go down, depending upon the aggregates and other things, wewould push toward or beyond the low side. If the discount rate goesdown, or if it doesn't go down, we could reconsider or fine tune thatafter New Year's Day. I will be more specific: Assuming the discountrate doesn't go down, I think a borrowing number of $300-$400 millionor something like $350 million would be the mechanical number thestaff puts down [in the path] for the next week or so", " Do you expect that to bring the funds rate--ofcourse this is a very difficult period with the funds rate--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the funds rate is coming down, Ithink. It has a lot of psychology in it; it surprised me a little.If the discount rate expectations are all that strong, why has thefunds rate stayed so high. I'm not sure that they have been all thatstrong. But it seems to be coming down a little now. I don't knowwhether that's lasting or not, but I would guess that we are talkingabout no more than 7-3/4 percent and maybe a lower discount rate,depending upon the anticipation. You fellows down the end of thetable can refute that if you want", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you feel strongly that M3 is going tobe a little lower than M2. Given the uncertainties surrounding all ofthese figures, it's nicer to use one figure", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Just given the vast amounts of uncertaintyin these numbers--. We had the same number [for both] last time,didn't we. For several times. Wasn't it the equivalent of 6 percent", "MR. BOEHNE. It's a little strained. I think we have to havea more general statement than that. We comment on something thatmight not happen, and we have control over it", " It's hard to call what we have \"pressure,\"but- -MR. PARTEE.
