But they wanted to reduce their war chest", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Until the dollar reaches extremelyweak levels, we're not likely to get any really meaningful centralbank cooperation on major intervention. So, Frank, the onlyreservation I have to increasing the war chest of foreign currencies,1/30-31/84which as you know I have always been in favor of--and we did follow[that approach] until this Administration came in--is that even thatwar chest is going to be of very limited value unless we get verystrong cooperation by other central banks", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

We'll get a combined reversal of theinflows. I agree with Frank that [the exchange value of the dollar]has been so high for such a long period of time that when it turns theprobability is that there will be a very substantial move downward", " It has been talked about a lot and ithasn't happened, which suggests that maybe the market is fairlyresistant for the moment, but--MR. WALLICH. The market sees all this as much as we do andfor some curious reason doesn't respond. I think they anticipate twopossibilities. One is that we will put our [fiscal] house in order.Then the budget deficit would go down and the United States wouldbecome a more dependable place to keep one's money. The otherpossibility is that we won't put our house in order. Then theopposite of these things would happen. Nevertheless, interest rateswould be high, so the dollar might not come down very much. I can'tbelieve we are going to continue on with $100 billion in capitalimports for very long; that I understand", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris", "MR. MORRIS. I have a question. I don't know whether it'sappropriate now or later, but one of the problems that I have with theforecast is that it doesn't seem to be compatible with the M2assumption. Would you prefer to defer that question until later on", "MR. PRELL. Well, as you can see, that line has edged offvery slightly. If one looks back at 1975, one can see also that itwas a while before that rate dropped very substantially. Clearly,there has been, and even now still is, a great deal of unemployment,and that could be a factor holding the rate up. And there may havebeen some problems among people who had short-term loans that they gotearlier at low rates which they have had to renew at higher rates thanperhaps they could handle. We don't have any information suggestingthat that has been a major problem, but that's a special feature inthe current period", "MR. MARTIN. To take the analysis of the housing financialsituation out to the margin, I note that data on the losses fromforeclosures in residential property last year, including the fourthquarter of last year, indeed [support] Mr. Prell's premise. Forexample, the mortgage insurance industry, which could be accused ofinsuring some of the submarginal and certainly a lot of the marginalresidential credit, is now experiencing losses from foreclosure atabout 3-1/2 times their historical level. That industry historicallyhas had a ratio of losses to premium of about 20 percent and now has aloss ratio to premium of 90 percent. So, at the margin, there isconsiderable difficulty in the mortgage market", "1/30-31/84MR. PARTEE. Let me ask the staff who look at the domesticside of the economy whether they were aware that the implication ofthe international projection is for the residual rate of priceincrease to go down as 1984 and 1985 transpire. It seems ratherinconsistent with what you have for unit labor costs, which don't godown, and GDBP prices, which don't go down. Yet the working throughof this I take it by Ted's people on the international side is thatonce you take the international effect out, you must have a decline inthe rate of inflation. Do you want to comment on that, Jim", "MR. PARTEE. Is that the CPI", "1/30-31/84MS. TEETERS. Ted, I'm a little surprised in your foreignprojection that the continued very moderate growth of the industrialcountries doesn't do anything for them on prices. Is there somereason that they get very little impact on prices", " The answer to the question, GovernorWallich--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Somehow this chart of yours on inflationabroad seems somewhat improbable to me too. If we have that kind ofdecline in the dollar, all these countries are benefitting from a 25percent [decline] in the price of oil--and you still show noimprovement in their consumer price indexes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But you have unemployment rising, Ithought you said", "MR. KEEHN. I have a question on capital expenditures. Maybeit's a question of the scale, but capacity utilization in the perioddoesn't go back to the '79 level yet the capital expenditure lineappears to be going up fairly steeply. Are you pretty confident aboutthat real business fixed investment [projection]", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Now, maybe I should be smarter andunderstand this, but what conclusions do you come to about the so-called \"crowding out\". What is the impact later in '84 and in '85 onmedium- and long-term interest rates. Would you just take that as agiven coming out of monetary policy", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, as we go on we do not have in thisforecast any growth in housing; it begins to taper off in 1985.Second, we have a slowing in the rate of increase of durable consumerpurchases, which we think are credit sensitive. So, that is slowingand business fixed investment itself is slowing over time, and arelated factor is the massive current account deficit that we have.So in a variety of ways it's sprinkled throughout the projection", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I have a couple of comments I want tomake on the price forecast. I think there is very considerable dangerthat prices are going to go up more than the staff is forecasting overthe next couple of years, and I think so for several reasons. One is-13-1/30-31/84that I am more optimistic on growth--or pessimistic, as the case maybe. I don't want to chop that one up, but I noted Ted's comment--and[I did so] with approval or otherwise I wouldn't be mentioning it--that when net exports go down as they have recently, one shouldn'tregard that as a sign of weakness in the economy but as a sign ofstrength. It's a consequence of the fact that the domestic economy isgrowing very rapidly. We have a lot of fiscal stimulus and highinterest rates. If you apply that to the fourth quarter and take intoaccount the fact that the rise in inventory investment in the fourthquarter was very small, that more than explains why we had a slowdownin [economic] growth. Indeed, if you take the private domestic finalpurchases--they went up more in the fourth quarter than they did inthe third--my hunch is that we're going to have a stronger economy inthe first half than the staff is forecasting. I think the underlyingdynamics are stronger than the 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent growth rateprojected for the first half. And I think that is going to bebuilding up pressures on prices as time goes on. Second, I think wehave to reckon with the possibility that the turn-up in the laborforce participation rate that the staff is forecasting may or may nothappen. And if it doesn't happen and we have somewhat stronger growthto boot, we're going to have a much bigger drop in the unemploymentrate in the course of 1984. Third, to go back to what Governor Parteewas saying, I don't understand the consistency of the staff forecastin regard to prices", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, not forever, that's for sure. Somethingis going to happen. But the fact is that a $9 billion drop in net-14-1/30-31/84exports in 1972 dollars at an annual rate is most unlikely to continuein the first half of this year. This would be a lot greaterdeterioration in the trade balance than what the staff is forecasting.And if what happens is that we get a somewhat smaller decline in netexports and a somewhat larger increase in inventories and continuationof fairly strong private domestic financial purchases, we're going toget a growth rate, I think, in the 5 to 6 percent range during thefirst half of this year. And that is going to be trouble for us,particularly if we continue to get slow growth in the labor force", "MR. CORRIGAN. I think the predicament we have has actuallygotten worse even though the business statistics at the end of 1983 insome sense look a little better. In the near term, and by that I meanthe first half of this year, my forecast is almost identical to thestaff's. The problem is that I'm not sure I believe either one ofthem. The risks continue to be on the side of a stronger economy andmore inflation--not by a lot, but I think that's the direction. Theirony is that an economy that is better in the short run is likely tobe worse in the long run. And what we have been talking about on theinternational side brings that home very forcefully. On the inflationfront, for example--even aside from Governor Partee's point--thestaff's forecast basically assumes that profit margins are exactlyflat. As I detect things out there, I still see a lot of pressure onthe part of businessmen trying to widen those margins in any way theycan. And that's one of the reasons why I just wonder whether the kindof assumptions that historically are reasonable about the implicationsof a declining dollar for the inflation rate are really in theballpark. It seems to me that we may have a situation right now wherethe indirect effects of the exchange rate and the import issue ondomestic inflation are greater than the direct effects. In otherwords, it's not just the question of the price level of an importedgood coming into this country as much as it is the way in which thoseimported goods are affecting the behavior of domestic manufacturers,wholesalers, and retailers in terms of what kinds of pricing theythink they can get away with. So, I'm inclined to think that if thedollar did in fact come off--whether by 17 or 25 percent or whatever--the impact on the domestic price level could be larger than thatcontemplated by Mr. Truman's exercise, even though it's a quitereasonable expectation from an historical perspective.On the whole credit flow question, I see the complication atthis point growing out of the international side and the deficit incombination. That seems to me problematic and then some. I find itdifficult to conceive that we can easily get $45 billion in capitalinflows in 1984. I don't know what we would ever do if we had anegative statistical discrepancy. That's another story. Moregenerally, even if we could get those capital inflows, I have a verydifficult time squaring the circle as it were in terms of the overallcredit flow analysis that Mr. Prell went through in the context of thekind of interest rate outlook that's associated with the staffforecast, absent a reduction in the deficit in 1984. Personally, I-16-1/30-31/84don't think the so-called crowding out issue in the context of thecurrent international situation is an '85 problem; I think it's an '84problem and then some. So, again, while one can feel a little betterlooking at the very recent statistics--as I do and I think we all do--the overall situation that we face has become a little moreproblematic, if anything, from my perspective", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join those whohave been warning that the interest rate projections may be on the lowside, even with regard to 1984. Upward pressures on rates may findtheir way out even by mid-1984--not in the clash between private andpublic financing, which I think obviously has occurred and will occur,but between financing the international trade deficit and financingthe enormous [budget] deficits. Deficits in 1984 of $189 billion or$195 billion--take a number--will give us an interest rate situation,given these other assumptions in the forecast, that may catch ussooner rather than later.I look at the curves depicted in the charts here on the levelof housing starts and the line in the diagram depicting business fixedinvestment. I can't reconcile that to my expectation of interestrates rising sooner than projected here. The housing curve, Ibelieve, is unrealistic. Housing doesn't reach equilibrium; housingis either rising or falling. With increased interest rates, I don'tthink the level of housing in this projection can be achieved. I'mnot even sure it can be sustained with today's interest rates becausemuch of the first-time home buyer segment has been used up and now wedo not have the strength in trade-up purchases that has been typical.We have mortgage payers unable to handle their financing in partbecause the builder points that kept their interest payments down arerunning out. And, with an increase in interest rates in mid-1984, theadjustable rate mortgages will be adjusting upward. That willincrease the foreclosure rate--a depressing element on the housingmarket.As far as business fixed investment is concerned, I think wesee here that the easy kinds of investments have been made. Businessfirms that did have some cash and could finance themselves to easilymodernize the plant or the office building have done that. In arather remote way it's [comparable] to the first-time home buyer, asthese people attempt to match the hurdle rates that their boards ofdirectors are going to require of them with what they have to pay inthe stock market. I would suggest to you that the broad [stock price]measures have decreased since midyear. We aren't talking aboutfinancing 30 firms whose stocks go into the DOW. We're talking aboutfinancing a thousand firms whose stocks are represented by the broadmeasures of the New York and American [Stock Exchanges] and theNASDAQ; and those broad measures have declined, not increased. Add tothat higher interest rates on raising credit and I think you get aflatter curve than the business fixed investment curve here. So, itseems to me that those are two factors that mitigate against what someof our colleagues have indicated here might be a much strongerrecovery in 1984. I join those who feel that we certainly will have acumulative impact of the various imbalances by 1985. It seems to methat we have a considerable downside risk right now in 1984, and it-17-1/30-31/84arises from the difficulty of financing the enormous mega deficit andthe mega trade balance deficiency", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just interject: Beauty may be inthe eye of the beholder, but I don't see any normality about thevelocity of M1 ex post. We have had some increases--much less thanthe normal cyclical increases and well delayed in the cycle. Now,this may all be consistent with a presumption that M1 may be gettingmore normal in the future but you can't prove it by what has happened,I think, through the fourth quarter. Mr. Solomon", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do those who are saying that M1should be reinstated as a target mean by that that we should return tothe automatic feedback on the nonborrowed reserve path that we hadbefore, with all the volatility in the short-run [interest rate]movements. Or do we get to the Henry Wallich view--and I want to askHenry what he means by this in practice or whether it is justsymbolism. Since you said you're opposed to that kind of automaticitybut you want to give more importance to M1, by that do you mean we-25-1/30-31/84should target it rather than have it as a monitoring range for thefourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter period. And if so, what does thatreally mean then", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan", "MR. CORRIGAN. The ones I'm talking about here are acombination of benchmarks and seasonals, but most of the changes comefrom seasonals. But when we go into 1984, looking prospectively withCRR, I think it's going to be a noisier series anyway. In addition tothat, seasonal factors are going to have to be different in naturebecause they reflect a week that ends on a different day. So, I wouldkeep M1 as a monitoring range. Generally, I'd be comfortable with thealternative II specifications, although I do have a preference evenwith M1 as a monitoring range for going to 4 to 7 percent or 3 to 7percent--it wouldn't matter to me either way--just because I think thelower range might give us a little more flexibility in the event wewere faced with a situation in which we thought we had to firm up abit. So, I could go with alternative II for M2, M3, and debt. AndI'd favor alternative I for M1 and would keep M1 in a monitoringstatus for at least the foreseeable future", "MS. TEETERS. I would agree pretty much with Lyle and Tony,and with some exceptions with Henry and Chuck. We really should giveourselves--as has been said many times--as much flexibility aspossible. One of my reasons is that I think the international sceneis not going to be like any of the alternative [scenarios] that havebeen presented. And we will need everything we can have in order tocope with that because I don't think we know what is going to happenout there and what the interrelationships are going to be. I woulddisagree with Chuck and Henry in that I don't think M1 should beelevated at all. I think M1 is an indication that we have found thewrong interest rates. I feel very strongly that the relationship withmonetary policy to gross national product is through the interestrates and not through the Ms and that any change in the rate of growthof the Ms is an indication that we found the wrong interest rate.There are other indications that we found the wrong interest rate aswell: whether inflation is going too fast, or business fixedinvestment is going through the roof, or inventories are out of whack,or a lot of other things. So, I tend to look through the Ms to whatis going on in the world out there rather than at the rate of growth.I do not discount them entirely but I give them a fairly low [weight]as they are only one of many indicators of what is happening. I wouldstate that we need to keep [an approach] where we can change interestrates when we think it's necessary. I don't want to go back topinpointing them. I would follow the procedures that we have used inthe last year, moving them gradually in response to changes ineconomic developments.Given that background, I come down for alternative II. Ithink that we want to continue the recovery. We need to figure out aswe move into the year what the appropriate rates are to do thatwithout choking it off. And this seems to me to give us a lot offlexibility. Also, I would adopt the attitude that if it goes wrong,I'm willing to change the ranges. I just don't think the ranges areall that important that they should restrict us as a corset would tosome dictate of policy", "MR. WALLICH. Well, I think we can say that price stabilityis becoming the orphan of this expansion. We're having a lovelyexpansion if nothing sensational happens to the dollar. But inflationcontinues to mount. And the suspicions around this table are that itis going to go up more than projected. That is why I think we oughtto lean a little on the side of price stability, recognizing thatwe're not going to get there, of course", "MR. WALLICH. If you get very flexible, somebody will comeand push you", " We're in either range now, and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you mean that we're in eitherrange", "MS. HORN. Rebased 4 to 8", "MR. BLACK. A rebased 4 to 8 percent is what he's talkingabout instead of rebasing to 5 to 9 percent, I believe, Mr. Chairman", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, last year we anticipated--I rememberthis discussion--that debt would increase faster than GNP. It didnot. We also are anticipating that it will increase faster than GNPthis year, rightly or wrongly", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, does 4 to 8 percent, 6 to 9 percent,6 to 9 percent, and 8 to 11 percent capture where we want to be. Thismay or may not be reflected in what we say in the language, but we arethinking very roughly of M1 somewhere around the middle [of itsrange]. I say all this with a question mark. What the staff assumesfor M2 and M3 is 8 percent and I think their projection for credit isabout 10 percent or so", "MR. MARTIN. On page [15 of the Bluebook], in paragraph (b),is it appropriate to use language that might put a little more weighton M1 at this stage, Mr. Chairman, or would you rather--", " The Xerox machine hasbeen--MR. GRAMLEY. We have a special Xerox machine in [thiscorridor] that only the Board Members' secretaries can get to", "MR. PARTEE. Well, I would go with Si's suggestion, too, butI think we're quite split on this question. Did you count half[unintelligible]", " It has been between 2-1/2--MS. TEETERS. If we get 9 percent nominal GNP, that puts therate at 2-1/2 percent", "\"MR. CORRIGAN. That's the problem that I have with thislanguage about velocity. The same argument that we're making aboutthe velocity of M1 could easily be applied to M2 as well. I agreewith the need to hedge M1 more, for the same reasons I think Tony issuggesting that. But I think logically we have a little problem herein that the hedge that we're creating could easily be said to apply toM2. As a matter of fact, if interest rates are rising, it might applymore to M2", " Well, the second paragraph--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The second paragraph hedges it all, I'dsay", "MR. GRAMLEY. I have a little problem with the sentence about\"taking account of emerging evidence that in the light of the changedcomposition of M1 its velocity growth over time....\" I think webelieve that on the basis of theoretical considerations. That is, wethink the more elements that bear interest in M1, the higher theincome elasticity of demand will be and the less tendency there willbe--the more we have Super NOW accounts--for M1 velocity not to slowdown as interest rates rise. But that's primarily a theoreticalproposition. We really don't have much evidence of that yet", "MR. GRAMLEY. A question may arise as to what a reader wouldinterpret \"more substantial weight\" to mean--more substantial weightthan M1 or more substantial weight than they had previously. Onecould get around that problem, if it is a real one, by simply puttingprincipal weight instead of more substantial weight", "MR. PARTEE. I think maybe the word \"more\" should be takenout", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And leave out the last few words at theend of the paragraph \"as tentatively agreed\" and go down on all theothers", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's putting \"more\" back in", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I got a letter from Mr. St Germainyesterday, an irritating letter, saying \"I direct you to release itimmediately.\" I sent him back a letter telling him it's not hisdecision to direct us [unintelligible] release", "MR. BALLES. Paul, I'd like to suggest that in order to avoidthe kind of problems we had last July--or at least as far as my Bankis concerned, I'd just as soon not have a copy of the directive thatis sent to New York. In fact, I've already told my economic adviser Ido not expect to notify him of what went on here in this meetingtoday. And I think the rest of you might abide [by that] and do thesame thing", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think the only question is NewYork", "MR. AXILROD. [Yes.] But I don't think there's any strongtechnical need to change that 6 percent even though [6-3/4 percent] isour best estimate, based on an uncertain January. The other twoalternatives, Mr. Chairman, are simply: alternative A, which is formore rapid growth in the aggregates; and alternative C, which is forless rapid growth in the aggregates. We believe that alternative B,continuing on the same path, would be about consistent with the sameconstellation of restraint on reserve conditions. But, of course,there is some uncertainty given the introduction of CRR and what thatmight mean specifically. In particular, there is the possibility thatin a transition period we might place excess reserves even higher thanwe've had in recent months recognizing, though, that there is a 3percent carryover in two weeks. So it's not clear that excessreserves would stay higher for very long periods. Our explorationwith banks as to how they are situated would suggest that possibility,at least in the transition period", "MR. CORRIGAN. Yes, but even if the Reserve Banks areprepared, the problems with the commercial banks are a great unknown.There are very, very, conflicting views and opinions. I must say I ama lot more concerned than I think you are or Steve is", "MS. TEETERS. We've already said that", "MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, the only other technical point Iwish to make is that we assumed that alternative B was consistent withcontinuing a borrowing level of $650 million. There are uncertaintiesabout excess reserves. There probably also are some uncertaintiesabout borrowings because we can't really be sure exactly how banks aregoing to decide to manage their positions. If they make mistakes,they may be forced into more borrowing than they are otherwisethinking about; or they may have an excess of caution and so much inexcess reserves that they're not going to have much borrowing; or thelevel of excess reserves will show more variation because of theswitch-over. But I think a degree of uncertainty can be attached toboth excess reserves and borrowing in thinking about reservepositions", "MR. PARTEE. How was there a free ride. I don't understandthis at all", "MR. STERNLIGHT. There was a period of a couple of weeks whenvault cash in effect counted double", "MR. GRAMLEY.

Some series came out for December and for the fourthquarter that indicate that there are risks and vulnerabilities inseveral areas. The leading indicators, of course, may now have been-56-1/30-31/84reversed. But the international situation is certainly notencouraging. Housing has vulnerabilities that I think have not beenadequately analyzed by anybody--no reflection on our staff. And thefact that a lot of equipment has been purchased by industries is notthe whole answer; a lot has been purchased from foreign sources. Itwasn't all just imports to the consumer; there were imports tobusiness. And we have not had the kind of investment revival that hasbeen typical in recoveries. This has been kind of a defensiveretrofitting. That's not a gross private domestic investment surge.It's a defensive [approach]: How can we stay in there with theprospect of a diminishing market share. I think there are a greatmany vulnerabilities in several areas here. It isn't all on thepositive side.

In fact, I hadinitially written a summary for my own staff summarizing the pros andcons, which came out marginally for staying with the operations. Wekicked it around for a while and were persuaded, with varying degreesof enthusiasm, to come out on the negative side. But again, for someof us anyway, quite narrowly. That was our evaluation of, on the oneside, the modest usefulness of continuing the operations and, on theother side, a small but nonnegligible risk of continuing thoseoperations", "MS. TEETERS. Are you typically offered more of these thanyou accept", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's what worries me: that wegive this implicit blessing and we don't really use it to see whetherthe market is behaving within certain parameters yet there's thisassumption that we do. If we don't use it, get rid of it", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But can we really have anannouncement that we will be discontinuing this within a few monthswithout raising questions that we think some banks are shaky orwithout the market wondering what lies behind our doing this", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You haven't made that distinction in youroperations, have you", " We could have a line in theannouncement that says that if the budgetary deficit--MR. PARTEE. It is conceivable that we might have someembarrassments looking ahead. We don't have any now. We can get outgracefully now. And it won't present a possible issue later on", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, one could conceive of asituation in which we would want to use the authority and we mightwant to use the authority without waiting for the next FOMC meeting.Presumably the Executive Committee could authorize that if there weresome reason", "MS. TEETERS. But Lyle, if we do that, then it is not beinglimited to Fauntroy and his staff. It becomes almost a publicdocument and not an FOMC document", "MS. TEETERS. Just looking at the current Greenbook, I thinkthe very first sentences of Part II would have to be totally-22-3/26-27/84rewritten. That reads: \"The pace of activity picked up vigorouslyearly this year. Housing activity surged, auto purchases and otherretail sales rose strongly, and industrial production advanced rapidlyin both January and February.\" There's no question about where theFederal Reserve staff views the first quarter as a result of that.Practically every one of those adjectives would disappear", "\"MR. KICHLINE. I think there is some concern. When you gothrough these with a little time lag, it's pretty difficult to spot awhole series of things that are a potential problem. They come up inTed's area particularly. On the domestic side, in the past there havebeen occasions when the monetary data we had were not for the fullmonth and we put in rates of growth for the full month. Or we haveput in our corporate bond and stock markets forecasts of variousthings going out several months. With time, I think the sensitivitydeclines. I do remember for many years I was assigned the unpleasantchore of writing the Quarterly Report for Mr. Proxmire's JointEconomic Committee and that report was very different from theGreenbook. It supposedly said the same thing--it was on currentfinancial conditions--but it was quite a different animal. When youwrite something you have in mind the nature of the audience and itmakes you more sensitive", "MR. PARTEE. [The Governors] don't have the personal staffsthat the Presidents have to give us all that information. We have toread Part II", "MR. MARTIN. Second", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're looking at me rather than at thepeople at the other end of the table. Well, I think the answer tothat is \"Yes.\" Most of the attention right now is focused onArgentina where, as you know, they have a new government and a verydifficult external problem. The amount of indebtedness is large; it's-24-3/26-27/84half the size of Brazil's or Mexico's, but it is still fairly large.The new government has had a lot on its mind to say the leastinternally as well as externally and they were not moving very rapidlytoward an external--or internal for that matter--economic adjustmentprogram. In a sense they lost a quarter or so while they werepursuing other priorities. As a result, there are possibilities atleast of more substantial problems. I suppose it's fair to say thatthe possibility of getting a letter of intent this week before the endof the quarter is at the vanishing point. It seems very unlikelyunder those conditions that interest [arrears] will be brought up todate through the fourth quarter of last year, which means those loanswill become nonperforming early in April and will affect earningsstatements early in April.But more important than that: This is the first time, Ithink, that this has happened to any of these major borrowers. Andwhat psychological reaction it will have on the banks' attitudes or onthe market, and indeed on Argentina, remains to be seen. That wouldbe amplified further if it is followed by a classification of theloans, which isn't automatic and which seems to be natural unlessactivity picks up pretty rapidly with the [International Monetary]Fund. There are some indications that it is picking up now and therehas been a reasonably straightforward effort going on to reachagreement with the Fund just in the last week--in terms of actualdiscussions with the Fund even in the latter part of last week, to bemore precise. There are indications that the government wants toreach an agreement. Certainly, the Fund wants to reach an agreement.There are discordant voices within Argentina and some very realdifficulties on such little matters as how far they can reduce thebudget deficit, to take one example. Wage policy traditionally entersinto these negotiations. They have been following an ad hoc policyfrom month-to-month of increasing real wages. Inflation isaccelerating; monetary policy is lax; and the [peso] is probably alittle overvalued. And two-thirds of their exports would'be eaten upby the need to pay interest. Otherwise there wouldn't be any problem.I might say in just looking at the Argentina problem thatthey have a big trade surplus, very largely based on agriculturalexports. The country is reasonably self-sufficient. Part of theirbig debt reflects some recent current account deficits, but not halfof it and maybe not more than two-thirds of it. In rough numbers theyhave had proportionally an exceptionally large amount of capitaloutflow, and like some of these other countries they finance privatecapital outflow by the government borrowing the money back. But theassets have flown. They don't generate any income for Argentinabecause the income stays abroad as well as the assets, and it puts avery large burden on their current account to manage their externaldebt. We have a problem within Argentina and, of course, we have thecontrary problem that whatever happens to Argentina--which in and ofitself might be a manageable situation--how can you expect a situationto remain manageable or what are the risks that it will spread toother borrowers and we will have a much bigger problem on our laps.So, that is the focus of concern.Now, there are continuing concerns with other countries.Peru lost a finance minister recently. Mexico continues to look goodfrom the external side but it still has sluggish growth. However, itdoes look as if they may be approaching a situation where they will-25-3/26-27/84not have to rely much, if at all, on net new external expansion.Brazil, on the other hand, is just in the middle of what has finallybecome, I think--there are still some questions about it--a prettyforceful internal adjustment program, tightening their monetarypolicy. But the success of that is still not clear", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't know what you mean byconcessions. It's a very foggy word. The idea of giving what onemight term a subsidy, which Argentina no doubt would like, would be anextremely difficult one for the banks and in itself would raise a lotof questions of precedent for the other countries. Certainly, theArgentines will at the very minimum go for whatever concession--morenarrowly defined as a low spread--they can get. That would give bankssome heartburn too on the theory that the Argentine payments are notas large as the payments of other countries and why do they deserve asnarrow a spread as Mexico has gotten. The Argentines probably won'tbe very happy with the Mexican spread. That poses a problem", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. On those 22 reschedulings that havebeen held up, one went through; it was controversial. The newgovernment came in and they basically want better terms. On those,what the banks have offered them is to reconsider the maturities butnot the spreads, and so far there has been no movement becauseeverything is held up in Argentina. It's not only the IMF thing,which of course is the key. There is also still that billion dollarsof money that they could make available to Argentina that would becoming back to them as interest. Then there are the 22 reschedulingson which there is no movement. So, there is an impasse", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They would have to not record the accruedinterest for the first quarter and also subtract out from the firstquarter earnings what they already had accrued from the fourthquarter. So they get a double hit in the first quarter", "MR. TRUMAN. That's right. That's the so-called acceptableway of doing it: to deduct it against loan loss reserves and thenreplenish the loan loss reserves to that extent. That, in effect,-27-3/26-27/84takes the income hit in the first quarter. But in some cases, Iunderstand, banks have declined to do that--or their internalaccounting people have chosen not to do that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I detect an interesting phenomenon in thisarea. When you talk to the banking statesmen, if there are suchpeople--or to those who would like to think they are banking statesmenat large banks or small banks or American banks or foreign banks--theytalk very freely about reducing interest rates and the need forconcessions, for caps, or whatever. When their delegates arrive atthe banks' advisory committee meetings that atmosphere seems to benoticeably absent", " I think it's fair to say that we can have formalconversations that probably encourage larger thinking but it doesn'tget transmitted very much in their--MR. BALLES. That's surprising, because I know that at leastat two of our big banks on the West Coastthose at the top level have stated that they feelconcessions ought to be made on interest rates. I wasn't aware thatthe people who show up at these meetings are taking a different view", "MR. BOEHNE. Some of the regional bankers in my territoryhave said that they won't kick another dime into these but they wouldtalk about interest rate concessions. Apparently what you are sayingis that they will talk about it, but that's about as far as it goes", "MR. FORRESTAL. There was some talk in my District, Mr.Chairman, about the banks getting together in connection with theBrazilian situation to resist any kind of new money going in but thatnever did materialize either", "MS. HORN. Yes, and so am I. Sometimes we get calls fromstaff members from various places and it's a little hard--at leastspeaking for myself--to read the seriousness of the problem andwhether it really does warrant a Fed president stepping in or whetherto tell these staff members that they really ought to try the regularchannels [through] the correspondent banks. It's a little hard toread the calls we're getting from the System to the banks", "MR. PARTEE. There could be a debt limit problem couldn'tthere", "MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Your comments raise a number of questionsin my mind. Let me just cite some of them and other people cancomment on them. On this last issue, the agricultural situation, yourcomments are not what I am getting from some people in the Midwest.They say the banks are liquid enough but the ability to repay after afew years is getting less. Land appraised values have declined andland price [declines] if anything are accelerating and a lot offarmers are getting increasingly stuck. On this energy situation thatyou started out with, my impression is that in recent months it hasbeen getting a little worse or going downhill instead of uphill forsome reason", "MR. BOYKIN. Yes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you look at the aggregate figures--Idon't remember them offhand but somebody here collects data and makesan estimate--there are a lot more than 15 percent that have theseheavy debt burdens. It's a minority but it's very sizable", "MR. KEEHN. Yes, Chuck. I think it's a fair comment withregard to the industrial sector that those parts that are susceptibleto a cyclical improvement are indeed experiencing it. Many of them,particularly those that are consumer-related, are doing very well. Infact, many are right up to the top on capacity. The sectors that arehaving a problem are those that are dealing with some pretty secularproblems; they are doing better this year than they were last year butnowhere near as well as some of the other parts. But I think they arebeyond the scope of monetary policy. They have some special problemsall their own.I must say I've been very impressed with the continuedprogress on the wage side. People I talk to are still settlingcontracts in the 4 to 5 percent area but nearer 4 than 5. And theyexpect to have a pretty good year this year, although they are allvery, very apprehensive about the auto negotiations. They can do wellnow but if the auto negotiations go badly, that would create adifferent environment. On the price side, though, those sectors thatare doing well and are up toward the top of their capacity arebeginning to move through price increases with some success. Theyfeel growingly encouraged that they are going to be able to put theprice increases in and make them stick. So, particularly in thosesectors that are doing well, the price pressures are beginning togrow; and with the passage of time that could be a significant risk.Broadly, I think the answer to your question is that the industrialoutlook in the Middle West is far better than it has been", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to comment on the thriftindustry and housing and very briefly on this situation with regard tocommercial property development and the syndication process, thelimited partnership process. Accepting the staff projection ofinterest rates, we have a situation in the thrift industry in whichthe losses could run between $700 million and $2-1/2 billion,depending on certain aspects of the sale of assets by theseinstitutions. As we all know, the sale of assets has been one way inwhich they have kept their profitability and avoided losses. Ofcourse, what is happening is that the interest rate increase that hasalready occurred is affecting the turnover of the 30-monthobligations, many of which are coming due now. And the weakerinstitutions may have 40 or 50 percent of their nonbrokered--I saythat carefully--funds in and around that maturity category. So, weare seeing the beginning of a conversion of 30 or 40 percent of theliabilities at a time when that conversion of assets can run perhaps10 percent of the assets. These interest rate increases, of course,are likely to continue at least in the near term. The nonoperating-45-3/26-27/84income of these institutions, which one could look at as 15 basispoints or 20 basis points against the asset, is becoming increasinglydifficult for them to accomplish. As there is more discussion of thecredit risks and the overbuilding and the question of values, it isgoing to be more difficult for them to attain that 15 or 20 basispoints. That could push them toward the upper end of that range oflosses. And here I'm talking about 1984. Before, at lower levels ofinterest rates, there was an expectation of turning over the 30-monthpaper at lower rates than face rates. Of course, the outlook for thatindustry was one of reasonable profitability for this year. That, ofcourse, tends to push these savings banks into very deep operatinglosses. It tends to produce some reliance upon the Federal Home LoanBank System. Perhaps not unduly, it tends to force even more franticefforts to attain fee income by originating loans without, let's say,complete or careful credit analysis and risk analysis.That means, of course, that the housing numbers that are inthe Greenbook could be supported with an increasing exposure of riskfor these institutions, with what that means down the road. We'vealready seen the Mortgage Bankers Association delinquency figures.The foreclosure losses continue. That is almost never talked about inthe financial press, but the rate of foreclosure is substantial as therate of bankruptcy continues to be on a very high plateau; [so], inanother segment of the private economy the foreclosure losses are verysubstantial. With regard to the comments on commercial development,of course, the new element in housing is the builder bonds. As I'veindicated, in one case that is a rather large number. The newerelement in commercial development is, of course, the limitedpartnership syndicate that the Congress has been trying to address insome of the so-called \"loophole closing\" proposals. Those syndicatescontinue to flourish; the limited partnership sales are substantial.Down the road that is going to mean that these heavy vacancies aregoing to cause those partnership interests to be of little or novalue, with a resulting impact on the commercial development process.My only point is that as we witness the interest rates unfolding asgiven in this scenario here, we're building up a future problem inhousing, in development companies, and in the commercial real estatesector of the economy. All those things inevitably will producelosses and close thrift institutions and commercial banks and otherkinds of enterprises down the road", "MR. RICE. Steve, the Bluebook says that the alternative Bproposal is consistent with the staff forecast of GNP. Does that meanthat alternative B takes into account the rise in interest rates thathas already occurred. Or does it mean that it will result in anadditional rise in interest rates over and above what has occurred", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we should over-estimate Mr.Kichline's ability to predict the economy and even more Mr. Axilrod'sability to project interest rates", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That figure you gave me excludesgovernment, doesn't it", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It seems to me that it's verydifficult to have as useful a discussion, and ultimately a decision onwhether and how much to tighten open market operations, if we don'tfactor in what the Board of Governors may do on the discount rate.Let's say we tightened along the lines of alternative B and presumablygot a fed funds rate in the neighborhood of 10-1/2 percent. If thenthe Board were to move the discount rate a half point, we might notget a full 50 basis points out of that move coming on top of thisbecause there is some expectational component. But I think we wouldget very close to that. So, we really would end up with somethingvirtually close to alternative C. It seems to me that we have thisproblem that doesn't usually arise. This time we have a combinationof circumstances where the markets are expecting a discount rate move.There are some good arguments for that. There are some argumentsagainst it, I'm aware. If we want to be in the posture of not sendinga strong signal that we're taking the initiative--that we are simplynot resisting the market's tendency to drive up interest rates--thereis an argument against a discount rate move. If we want to indicate amore forceful view, then there is an argument for it. All I'm saying,though, is that I don't see how we can know whether to talk in termsof the objective as alternative B or alternative C unless we have somesense as to whether there is going to be a discount rate change. Irealize that you would be reluctant to talk about that in a largegroup but I don't know quite how to address this question", "MR. GUFFEY. If I look at \"B,\" for example, it may beattractive to me at least in terms of a 10-1/4 percent or maybe 10-1/2percent funds rate. But if we get a discount rate increase on top ofthat and use the post-1979 procedures, that would get it up to 11percent", "MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I would support alternative B. Idon't have the confidence in the behavior of M1 that Steve suggests hehas--that, after not having served as a very useful target in '82 and'83, it is somehow going to revert to its old historic norm in '84.But I think the rate of growth of debt is quite clearly excessive.That growth plus the extraordinarily strong economic numbers that havecome in tell me that we have to move now to moderate the rate ofadvance in the economy. I think moving to \"C\" and having a funds ratepossibly as high as 12-1/2 percent is a little overkill. It seems tome that we need more feedback from the effect of interest rates thanwould be implied in alternative C, and the idea of returning to theold automaticity sends a chill up my spine. I certainly would like torestrain the funds rate range to no higher than the \"B\" level", "MR. GRAMLEY. I agreed with Emmett all the way up to where hesaid that alternative B was his choice. I start with the view thatthe staff forecast is not an unreasonable one but that if it is wrongit's likely to be that growth will tend to exceed the 5.3 percent ratethe staff has forecast for the fourth quarter to the fourth quarterand that we will have somewhat more price pressures. I would be happywith the kind of growth the staff was forecasting a month or two ago--4 to 4-1/2 percent or somewhere in that neighborhood. But 5 to 5-1/2percent and possibly more in the second year of a recovery when we'removing rapidly toward much higher rates of resource utilization forboth capacity and labor is something that I find disturbing. Now, \"B\"is essentially the alternative that is consistent with the staffforecast. And that means, I presume, that in the second half of theyear if we stayed with \"B\" and extended it with the same interestrates that we are talking about as consistent with \"B,\" we would findthat money growth would slow with the slowdown in the pace of theeconomic expansion that is forecast. And this is a policy that Iwould call leaning with the wind. It's providing enough money in thefirst half to keep interest rates from going up too much and thenletting the money growth come down a little as the economy begins toslow down of its own natural processes. If we are in the second yearof a recovery and are willing to supply the kinds of increases in theMs that are involved in \"B\" and to permit credit to grow by more than11 percent, when are we going to get back to a policy that is designedto bring inflation down over a long period. So, I just don't think\"B\" is the right alternative. I share your worries and concerns aboutthe economy, but I think we've got to go further than that. Now, \"C\"is a bit of a shock perhaps, but I think we ought to move in thatdirection; something between \"B\" and \"C\" is where I would come out", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, I don't view that as inconceivable atall. We struggled with this whole issue. There are some technicalreasons that the number could readily come out below 6 percent andthere are some rather substantive reasons that it could come out below6 percent. My personal view is that 6 percent is a good number. Ifit's wrong--and I'm assuming that interest rates don't decline in thisenvironment but perhaps are where they are now or rise a bit--I thinkthe odds favor a smaller number than 6 percent. One example is in theauto area where we have production levels that we think are sensible.But GM is closing several plants. At the moment the way the CommerceDepartment is going to measure the numbers, they are not inclined tochange the seasonals; and if they don't do that, we're going to findauto production declining substantially. That's a technical reasonbut it shows up in the numbers. There are a number of cases wheresome of the retail sales may well have come early in the year due toweather effects and we may be facing a situation where the economy isnot that strong. So, I feel very comfortable with the 6 percentnumber; but if I were to bet that it's not 6 percent for the secondquarter alone, I would bet on a little lower number", "MR. PARTEE. Raise the discount rate to 10 percent", "MS. TEETERS. It's at 9-1/2 percent isn't it.SPEAKER(.). 8-1/2 percent", "MS. TEETERS. If we raise the discount rate by a halfpercentage point, then it seems to me that the specifications shouldbe the federal funds rate at 10-1/2 percent and the borrowings at $800million. If we raise the discount rate, we want to offset the impactof that to some extent because if we don't we're going to get 11percent on the fed funds rate. If we don't raise the discount rate,then it seems to me that we can go with \"B\" and have borrowings of $1-64-3/26-27/84billion and have the fed funds rate fluctuating in the neighborhood of10-1/2 percent. But I don't think one can disconnect those twodecisions at this point", "MS. HORN. For many of the reasons that have been stated, Iwould like to see the monetary aggregates closer to the middle of theranges. And I'd like to see that happen sooner than alternative Bwould bring it about, in part because I do have real concerns aboutthe strength of the economy. But I also think there are significantrisks in the future on the down side and that moves me more toward\"B.\" While the other reason moves me away from \"B\" toward \"C,\" thatmoves me back toward \"B.\" I must say I like the Chairman's words onhis second option \"help nature along.\" In my view a \"B-\" path doesthat. By a \"B-\" path I'm talking about a borrowing assumption ofabout $1.2 billion but I'd not quibble on decimal points there. Andthen just one comment on Henry's hippopotamus: When I say \"B-\" I amassuming no change in the discount rate; I'm assuming that we'd be-65-3/26-27/84moving with open market operations rather than with the discount rate.So, I would be for a \"B-\" path", "MR. BOEHNE. I think the risks in the economy have shiftedtoward too much growth. But that long list of vulnerabilities--whichyou started with, Mr. Chairman, and others have added to--is animpressive list as well. It is the time in the cycle, I think, forsome restraint. How I would do it at this point is to accept thegreater restraint that has become apparent in recent weeks but keep an-67-3/26-27/84open mind about whether additional restraint is needed in the comingweeks, depending on how economic activity comes in. I don't think Iwould load the dice or load the directive to tilt it more toward overt[restraint]. I would accept what we've done but not much more. Itseems to me that a move toward alternative C really would be too muchtoo soon. On the question of automaticity and additional reliance onM1, I'm not in favor of that. It seems to me that the crosscurrentsthat we're dealing with are just too complex to return to someautomaticity or to rely on a rule. Whether we like it or not, I thinkwe're just stuck with using a lot of judgment. On the discount rate,I'm lukewarm at best on raising the discount rate. One argument, if Iwere making one, would be that as we go through a cycle the longer wewait and don't move the discount rate the more we can't move it lateron. So, there is some argument for doing it, if only to keep theoption open in the future. If the Board in its wisdom should decideto raise the discount rate, I would be in the camp that says theborrowing figure ought to be reduced so as to offset pressure on thefunds rate. And since I only have one vote and not two as Nancy does,in order to get a little better coordination here and a little firmergrip on what we're voting for and its implications, I would feel morecomfortable with an 11 percent ceiling on the funds rate. That wouldseem to me to keep it more in the spirit of alternative B, given theuncertainty as to what the Board might do with the discount rate", "MR. PARTEE. As I said yesterday, I think that there is now adanger of an overheating of the economy in the foreseeable future.And that, of course, will materialize rather quickly if the staffprojection of a moderation in economic growth does not come about. Itmay well come about, but it's a risky business. I also am impressedby the extent to which debt expansion has played a role in this morerapid growth in activity. When we had to use a variant of Frank'sfavorite number--private domestic nonfinancial debt--at the meeting ofthis Committee on January 26 we were estimating for the fourth quarterthat it would increase at a 9.2 percent annual rate. The quarter wasalready over by 26 days. The revised estimate that we have this timeis 10.9 percent--an increase of 1.7 percentage points for the fourthquarter. For the first quarter, the estimate we were looking at lasttime was 8.4 percent. Now we are looking at 11.1 percent--an increase-68-3/26-27/84of 2.7 percentage points from the [previous estimate], some of whichis due to these oil company takeovers but not more than a point, Ithink. Clearly, it seems to me, there is an excessive rate ofexpansion in domestic debt that can't be attributed in a first effectsense at least to the deficit but to private borrowing. I have thesense--and I only look at the Washington papers and maybe to someextent New York--of a tremendous amount of momentum in the drive toextend consumer credit to the public on the part of the banks and ofthe drive to put out mortgage credit. There are radio ads and allkinds of ads--a lot of them deceptive--about the terms and conditionsof borrowing, and people are responding to those ads. Businesses aretoo. They have variable rate loans and whether people know what thatmeans I have no idea. But there has been too much debt expansion, Ithink.I wouldn't be as aggressive as Lyle in saying that it's timenot only to pull the punch bowl a little distance away but to turn itpartly over because I'm not that certain of the future. And I dothink there are some structural weaknesses of the kind that theChairman mentioned. I'm worried about the thrifts. The thrifts aregoing into a deficit situation very shortly now with this level ofrates. And the higher the rates, the greater the deficit. It mayturn out, as I told some of them, that 1980-81 was just a dressrehearsal to what is going to happen to them in future, in which casewe have a whole industry that will be very, very shaky in the economy.I'm worried about housing. Those are housing starts, not housingsales, and it's not customary for builders to line up their buyersbefore they start a house. I'm worried about the change in psychologyin the consumer market that would turn people off housing so that thehousing inventories would be sitting on the market as unsalable itemsthe way they are in Dallas. And I'm worried about the LDCs who Ithink will react quite adversely to a major increase in interest ratesin the United States economy and will be very, very sorely impacted.So, I just don't have the courage to move as aggressively as anaggressive fellow like Lyle Gramley would at this stage. Therefore, Icome down to alternative B as not being unreasonable. If we take thatin terms of the aggregates, that's not a modest ambition for thesecond quarter. The reason that M1 is as low as it is in alternativeB for the second quarter is that there's one relatively low month, andthat may or may not materialize. It's not a slow rate of expansion asyou look over the quarter as a whole; it's going to be a rather hardthing to accomplish. I'm particularly impressed by Steve's comment,which I happen to believe, that after a quarter where velocityincreases sharply it's more likely that in the next quarter velocitywon't increase so sharply because the money supply increases a lotmore than it did before. I think the danger is going to be thatwhatever of these alternatives we set, money is going to run higher.That's why I questioned Jerry on \"strongly resist\" because to resiststrongly, if we really mean that, could mean very high interest ratesby the end of the second quarter. I think we need to lean and leanpretty hard and look at the aggregates more seriously than we havebefore, but I don't want to lean all that hard.In sum, I would buy alternative B; I certainly wouldn't buyanything tighter than alternative B for the period to come.Considering what I think may happen, 11 percent on the funds rateseems to me too much of a near-term constraint that will require atelephone call and I would use the full funds rate range. On-69-3/26-27/84borrowings, $1 billion seems okay to me; $1.2 billion seems awfullyhigh. We're starting to move up toward the levels of borrowing thatare associated with fairly tight money periods as we get well above $1billion. And, what's that rate, Henry. I don't know what to do aboutthe hippopotamus rate", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, I understand. You know, themarket tends to over-interpret, and I think the changes in the wordingof the directive are reinforced by putting M1 in front. Okay, we putM1 further back. But I think this will tend to awaken expectations-71-3/26-27/84that we may once again be on that roller coaster. Nobody is going tobelieve necessarily that this is the last ride, particularly if theeconomic data continue relatively strong. And then there would beexpectations of [rates] going to very high levels. I just think it'sdisturbing to move back in that direction. I realize we haven't movedback 100 percent in terms of the way the short run feeds back with thenonborrowed reserve paths", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have a little technical problem, butit's a very great problem, in starting out with reserve pressures,which is partly what convinced me [to start with the aggregates]. Idon't know how we'd describe the current degree of reserve pressures.It's a meaningless concept. Well, the concept isn't meaningless butif you look at borrowings or if you look at net borrowed reserves orfree reserves, you're going to get entirely different answers for themonth of March. You get borrowings up to what--$1 billion.--with netborrowed reserves probably a minus. What does maintaining theexisting degree of reserve pressure or increasing it or decreasing itmean in that circumstance", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, because of this problem of not knowinghow to interpret borrowing numbers, I'd like to hear--when we get tothe point of getting down to specifics--what we're going to mean withthis directive or any other in terms of how far we're willing to letinterest rates go up. I would not be shocked to contemplate a federalfunds rate of 11 percent. I take it that others would be. But if theidea is to run a monetary policy which in effect says that what we'vedone so far is let the federal funds rate and associated rates ofinterest go up in recent weeks and we will just hold them there, I'mnot going to be happy with that. I just don't think that's the way weought to go. But I'd like to have a translation", "-73-3/26-27/84VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The markets may overread what thatnew ceiling is going to mean", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but even if you're moreconcerned as I think we all are--that's where the risks are--why doesthat argue necessarily for an asymmetrical articulation in thedirective", "MR. PARTEE. You may well have to do that", " We can't really--MR. CORRIGAN. I think we can try to minimize the risk of it.We would really be in the soup then", "MR. AXILROD. Mr. Chairman, maybe I answered Governor Teeterswrong. We are within the long-run cone. The weekly figures we'regoing to publish will be below the weekly figure consistent with the[target]. If the number that we're not publishing--the one we have atentative estimate for at the end of March--holds up, it will be abovethe long-run cone. But month-to-month, on average it's just below", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me move to the borrowing level where Ithink there is, in fact, a bigger range of opinion. I suspect thatreflects in part that we don't know whether where we are is because ofcontemporaneous reserve requirements or other expectational factors.We have a classic case in this two-week period of the way one wouldthink things might happen frequently with a two-week reserveadjustment period. Everybody thought that perhaps [markets] weregetting tighter earlier in the period and they borrowed a lot. Theybuilt up excess reserves and now they end up the period with bigexcess reserves and the market is getting easy. In previous weeks, Iguess the opposite happened. This used to happen with the weeklyreserve pattern and now it can happen with considerably more amplitudebecause [banks] have a two-week period before they get caught upshort. So, those who would like to calibrate the federal funds ratein their thinking down to a gnat's eyelash have a bit of a problem. Idon't know what this means for the level of borrowings this week andfor the federal funds rate, particularly during a period when it mightbe higher [initially] and then turn out to be lower at the end or viceversa, depending upon the pattern during the period", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I would take just the opposite pointof view. The federal funds rate, with a billion dollars of excessreserves--though not during the early part of the period and I don'tknow what it will average--averaged well over 10 percent. And we willhave a billion dollars or slightly more borrowings and we happen tohave a billion dollars worth of excess reserves. If we have $650million of excess reserves, I don't know what we will get", "MS. TEETERS. What role do we see excess reserves playing.Are they precautionary. Or are they an accident because of CRR", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I think it will be lower", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Different people may have differentopinions about things", "MR. PARTEE. Do you agree with that, Steve", "MR. MARTIN. I think you're right, Chairman. But isn't theresome difference of view here as to how much tighter or lessaccommodative [we should be]", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is an entirely different question. Idon't want to disagree. But could I at least assume by my very modeststatement that if by some development the borrowing turned out to bequite consistent with a 9-3/4 percent federal funds rate, that wehaven't got enough borrowing", "MR. GRAMLEY. I think we're in very serious danger of losingcredibility as an agency that is trying to hold down inflation. Itseems to me that the numbers have been coming in very strong on thereal economy. We have been looking at money and credit numbers thatare very large in any kind of historical perspective. We are doing soin the second year of a recovery when expectations have been greatlyexceeded. We are doing so in the context of a fiscal policy that isthe most stimulative we've ever seen. I just don't know how we cantalk about making sure we don't ease. The situation calls for morethan that. It calls for more, in my judgment, than just confirmingfor the market the fact that interest rates have gone up in recentweeks", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In fact, a quarter point move wouldcarry an interesting message. If we went back to quarter point moves,it would be interpreted as meaning that we're not going to have a lotof volatility in the next year--that basically we are thinking interms of more cautious moves and that that will be the likely patternover the next year. I don't think we want that interpretation either,for the reasons that Lyle has pressed so strongly", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. No. Without a discount rateincrease", " If you accept the commentary in the Bluebook,it's 10-1/4 percent with $1 billion borrowing and some possibilityof--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not going to accept a federal fundstarget that narrow", "MR. GUFFEY. I agree on the easing, but I guess I'm concernedabout approaching that 11 percent rate--whether with $1 billionborrowing without a discount rate increase or some other level with adiscount rate increase. That 11 percent triggers some real concern", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. Obviously, it's consistent with whatwas just said. If things were very tight, we would take that intoaccount in changing the discount rate. We may want to change thediscount rate but we might not want to do it without some offsettingadjustment, and we could consider that at the time if it appearednecessary. But I don't think there's any presumption that that'sgoing to appear necessary. If it seemed to be a little too easy, inthe wisdom of the Board we can raise the discount rate and that wouldbe one factor bearing upon that decision. Let's come back to thatfunds rate question we left dangling--this 1/2 percentage pointquestion. My own preference, knowing that this presumably isn't going-88-3/26-27/84to be published for a month or more, is to raise the funds rate rangea full percentage point to [7 to] 11 percent in the comfort that if wewanted to go higher, we would. But I'm not sure I want the largerheadline implied unnecessarily, on the order of [another] 1/2percentage point on the range [by going to 7-1/2 to 11-1/2 percent].I might well want to go there, but I can go there without the extraheadline of saying we had that [in the directive but didn't implementit.] It's like that very asymmetrical directive that we had workedout all right in December. Nothing happened; it never was triggered.But it became a fact of life that the directive was written that way.If, contrary to expectations, the economy began levelling off and wenever got to the 11-1/2 percent, I'd just as soon not have it in therecord", "MR. PARTEE. I'd be inclined to vote against this 7 to 11percent. I just don't think there's enough room from where we are", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, what you're trying to do is to hold thefunds rate in the 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 percent range", "MR. GUFFEY. At 11 percent", "MR. GRAMLEY. I'd rather have the consultation now. I don'tthink we will see anything in the next two weeks that is going to beconvincing on where the economy is going to go. And two weeks more onthe money numbers is not going to tell us anything about longer-termtrends of money, which is what really matters. I think we're pussy-footing. I think we've been sitting here for some months now looking-91-3/26-27/84at an economy that continues to exceed everybody's expectations. Thisis going to come back to haunt us if we don't decide to act. And wecan't act by just confirming what happened in the market in the pastcouple of weeks", "MR. MARTIN. I would agree with Tony, but I don't think it's25 basis points; it's more likely 50. I think we're talking [aboutgoing from] 10-1/4 percent to 10-3/4 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Okay, we can't pin it down that much.But I'm assuming that there will be some upward movement if we go inthis direction. Are you saying that you don't believe that or are yousaying that's too little", "MR. GRAMLEY. It's just that I'm not trying to hide the move,you see. I think the economy needs to be told that monetary policyhas tightened because the economy is growing much too fast forcomfort. I think we need to do something that's rather obvious anddecisive", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm going to vote for both sides", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're only going to get two choices here.The other side is: How many want 6, 8, and 8-1/2 percent. I came outthat it goes the other way--6-1/2 percent", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The trouble with this whole processis that there's no quid-pro-quo bargain. I would trade my vote onsome of those last votes for the wording of the directive you'resaving. The way you're slicing us off, it's a salami tactic", "MR. PARTEE. Paul's saying no salami goes with it", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But there's also going to be a heckof a lot of concern if people think that we are going back to the kindof volatility we had in interest rates, which I think is damaging bothsubstantively and perception-wise", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I feel that we did a lot of damage tothe economy by the enormous swings [in interest rates] from 8 percentto 20 percent and then down again. I think if we had stayed longer attighter levels, we wouldn't have had to go up to 20 percent. Now, Iunderstand the rationale, but I think the notion that we don'tinfluence interest rates--that all we are doing is targeting moneygrowth--has gotten very thin in the country. We moved away from thatand we used the excuse that the velocity of circulation was no longerin a typical traditional relationship. What would you say. You haveto say that we're back again in a period where the velocity ofcirculation is a little more dependable. And this all fits in withthe feeling that we would get in the market that we're returning tothe pre-summer of 1982 [approach to policy]", "MR. PARTEE. I was thinking we could say annual rates of\"around.\" That would be one other way", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can leave it out and point out allthese problems in the text [of the policy record]. That's one way ofhandling it", " It's just that when we say we're seekingthe degree that allows for changing that pressure--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but it's kind of funny when you lookat it. Maybe it will have to be changed. We say \"The Committee seeksa degree of pressure.\" That's a perfectly general statement. Then itsays \"greater reserve restraint.\" Well, that's implied already.There is something logically lacking when you leave out the secondsentence. I have no great desire to leave the second sentence in, butit raises a question about the next sentence", "MR. CORRIGAN. Well, I'm concerned with the way the sentencereads now. It's subject to the interpretation, indeed the meaning,that all we are doing and are prepared to do is ratify what hasalready happened. And I understand this discussion to say somethingmore than that", "\"MR. PARTEE.

WALLICH. At the Basle meeting there was considerablequestioning, at least by some central bankers, as to the adequacy ofour arrangements. There was a considerable lack of understandingabout what the Federal Reserve does--providing liquidity on a securedbasis--and about what the FDIC does--providing solvency support. Andthe question really was whether these arrangements were adequate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There may be some questions about itnonetheless", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There is some questioning by foreignbanks--I've heard this in a couple of places--as to whether it is 100percent risk-free at [every] stage of the process because they are notfamiliar with the way the FDIC would step in and what would happen.They wonder whether there is some point in time where they would be atrisk", " That is intended to be answered in thepress release by saying any arrangements--or whatever the exactwording was--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. [The guarantee] was so sweeping thatthey had difficulty believing it. Also, some of them say: Well,isn't the unlimited liquidity commitment of the Federal Reservelimited to the amount of collateral that Continental Illinois can putup", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. $40 billion, if you take it all", "MS. HORN. Have we labeled it extended credit yet", "MR. ROBERTS. There are also a lot of shell-shocked investorssitting on big losses. They don't want to buy any more long bonds", "MR. PARTEE. My thought, Tony, has been that the dealers werelosing on spot transactions and gaining on the futures, which meansthat somebody other than the dealers was losing on the futures", "MS. HORN. Mr. Chairman, I also would talk about attitudes,but attitudes mainly in financial markets. Attitudes are indicatingdifferent kinds of strains in financial markets than we talked aboutyesterday--the international situation, the Continental situation andso on--and are what I call attitudes of excesses in financial markets.They start with some of the kinds of financial contracts we see beinginvented and being written, such as leveraged buyouts and that wholelist of things. It continues in the talk about how banks are runningtheir businesses; I keep hearing more and more that banks around thecountry are shoving money out the door, if you will. We hear about itfrom real estate developers; and when you start hearing real estatedevelopers in the Fourth District talk about these things, you knowthat it's much broader based in the country. Real estate developersare telling us that they can't put any equity in a shopping centerthese days--that banks are giving 100 percent financing--and that evenif they wanted to put equity in, because that's the way they wouldlike to run their business, they can't do it because their competitionisn't doing it. And worse than just the leverage problem alone isthat the 100 percent financing is short term. They are getting 5- to7-year terms from a bank at variable interest rates and at the end ofthe development they are not going to the insurance companies and arenot getting the long-term money. So, the specter arises: If you havea lot of unoccupied office buildings that are on 5- to 7-year term5/21-22/84loans, what happens when those loans came due. We only have one suchbuilding in Cleveland because we haven't had the building boom thatother cities have had. But if this is the situation around thecountry, then this very short-term financing of long-term assets couldbuild to be a real problem.Another Fourth District story about banks but about banksaround the country that I found very interesting was in connectionwith this recent takeover bid bythe fellow who controls that, needed--I don't remember theexact number--in excess of a billion dollars to make the bid. And forreasons of confidentiality, he didn't want to have a bank form asyndicate to get the loan for him. So, he did what he was advisedcouldn't be done. He went to thirty-two banks and asked them forlines of credit for a takeover for an acquisition and he wouldn't tellthem the acquisition target, and out of the thirty-two very largebanks he approached only one refused to give him a line of creditbecause they wanted to know the name of who was being taken over.Then, on a Friday afternoon, within several hours he pulled down allthe lines and made the offer. It is, I think, an indication of howbusiness is being done these days.The thrift stories, of course, continue and we increasinglyhear concerns about the lack of matched maturities--that thriftsaren't being run in a conservative way. In the Fourth District we'rebeginning to get anecdotal evidence about some of our thrifts that arein very poor condition suggesting that things are so bad for them thatthere is nothing to keep them from trying to take a big bet and tryingto hit a home run in real estate development kinds of projects.Because if they fail to hit the home run, have they really worsenedtheir condition. I guess it has always been true that there is acertain number of portfolio managers who have a very short-term viewon investment and manage their portfolios by saying: Let's pick thenext takeover prospect. But it seems that one hears about thesepeople prospering now, and I suppose that would be another thing Iwould add to my list of concerns. Just to complete an incompletelist, one more subject would be the auto negotiations. We'rebeginning to hear a minority view, expressed by people in thetransportation equipment industry in the Fourth District who arereally in a position to have very good information, that GM will notbe willing to take a strike. They are talking about and hope thatthey will be able to get a settlement that will tie wage increases toprofitability. But the talk that they are hearing is that GM may beunwilling to take a strike.I guess one could build a very pessimistic case from thislist of attitude excesses, if you will, and we could say that thefinancial contracts of today might be the international debt problemof several years from now. That may be overstated, but I've just beengetting so much anecdotal evidence across the board that I do believewe are beginning to see in attitudes a situation that is notinconsistent with rising inflationary expectations. Those are mycomments", "MR. WALLICH. First, I would like to support what Bob Blacksaid about not worrying too much about small temporary changes. As Ilook at our directive and policy record, we've really been through amini-cycle since the last FOMC meeting. At that time we had not seenfully the weakening of March. It was March 27th or thereabouts whenwe met. Had we known the March data we might have said: \"Aha, thingsare slowing down.\" However, in April they picked up again. Someeting now in May we've had the weak March and the strong April andwe can just take off from there. The same applies to the aggregates.Had we known the weakness of the aggregates for April, we might haveworried about that but now we see that for May there probably is anexpansion ahead. So, again, the interim fluctuations don't mean verymuch. As I listen to the discussion around the table of the taperingoff, I ask myself: What is it that businessmen really pay attentionto when they evaluate conditions. Is it the rate of expansion oftheir sales and activity or is it the level at which they proceed.Now, the rate of expansion may be tapering off somewhat but the levelthat they have reached must be taxing their capacity or be giving thema sense of very high activity at least generally. I think thisslowing that seems to be taking over ought to be regarded as a successof our policy--a success in avoiding overheating, to the extent thatwe've done that. It certainly is not a reason to resume some kind ofstimulative policy.In thinking about what we should do now, we are financiallyvery much constrained. If we wanted to restrain more, we have thesituation in developing countries. We have the situation ofContinental. I find these things very hard to weigh. The wise adviceis to say that financial fragility should be handled by structuraldevices. And perhaps that is not quite as foolish as it soundsbecause this is the time to fix the roof--it's not raining. That'sthe time when one should fix the roof and not wait until it rainsagain. So, that would mean strengthening the capital of banks, doingsomething about LDC loans along the lines of our conference forfinding ways of limiting the effect of interest rate increases,[imposing] penalties for poor banking. That again is more possible inthe domestic area than in the international area where we're dependenton the same banks that made mistakes to continue making loans. So,this disciplinary supervisory action is somewhat stymied. I thinkthis is the principal choice we have to make right now: In terms ofeconomic activity, it seems to me that further restraint is stilldesirable; in terms of the fragility of the environment, there areobvious fears and inhibitions. How to weigh this, I find verydifficult. But I continue to lean in the direction, if I have achoice, of a little more restraint", "MR. GRAMLEY. I'm less certain now about where the economy isgoing in the near future than I have been at any time since very earlyin 1983. These recent numbers are to me very, very puzzling. If wereally had an almost 9 percent increase in real GNP in the firstquarter, the fifth quarter of recovery, there ought to be a sense ofeuphoria around the nation. Boy, we sure don't hear that here thismorning. I can't figure out why the increase in nonfarm inventoriesin real terms was so very, very large in the first quarter. Clearly,it wasn't undesired. It was not a case of an unexpected slowdown infinal sales, yet I have a hard time arguing that businesses are sodesperately concerned with shortages or so desperately worried aboutprice increases that they are scrambling to get inventories. I justcan't understand it. This number on new orders this morning is veryweak. It's a volatile series, as Mr. Kichline said, but there arenegatives all down the line. It is just very, very puzzling. Asecond uncertainty has been added by recent developments in financialmarkets. I don't have any doubt in my mind that these developments onbalance are a significant negative, but I don't know how much. Wehave had a big increase in interest rates since the last meeting--bigger than I think any of the more hawkish members of this Committeewould have wanted at that time. We also have had a drop in stockprices and we don't know precisely what effects those changes aregoing to have. It may well be that confidence, at least among banksif not nonbanking institutions, has been affected a bit by what hashappened with Continental. I think a slowdown is ahead and if I wereforced to write down numbers, I probably would write something downvery close to what the staff has. If it works out that way, I don'tthink we should be concerned. We need that kind of slowdown. But,frankly, it could be a little more or a little less, it seems to me.I would like to make a couple of comments on the price side.One of the things that has happened in the past several months that tome is very comforting is that the increase in the civilian laborforce, as a consequence of increases in the participation rate, isfinally developing along the lines the staff had forecast earlier. Itlooks much less likely now that we're going to get down below thenatural rate of unemployment in the very near future, as I was worriedabout earlier. Still in all, I do expect to see some larger priceincreases relative to wages because in the kind of markets that thestaff is forecasting, with the increase in the capacity utilizationrate, I think businesses are going to take the opportunity to try towiden profit margins. I would just like to say in closing thatdevelopments in credit markets are to me still very, very worrisome.We had an enormous increase in the debt of the nonfinancial sector inthe first quarter. The forecast now for the second quarter is evenworse. And when I listen to comments around the table, particularlyby Karen, about the lack of discipline, I have to conclude that upuntil very recently at least we have not had much financial restraint.Whether we'll see that as a consequence of developments in the pastfew weeks I think is still problematic", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It has to be. That's the only thing theychanged", " Maybe they just--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Institutions don't hold securitiesthe way they used to; even longer-term investors don't think in thesame terms that they used to. Therefore, they just don't want to sitwith big paper losses because it looks very bad and it reflects onthem and hurts their position in these various institutions where theywork. So, even if they are fairly confident that inflation is notgoing to go up to anywhere near the previous levels, they don't wantto be seen sitting with substantial paper losses in their portfolio", "MR. CORRIGAN. I have just a couple of comments, Mr.Chairman. I share the view--it's just a hunch--that the edge may becoming off the speed of the recovery at this point. I'm compelled tothat conclusion even though I'm not sure that it can be backed up bystatistics as yet. On the farm sector that has been mentioned,obviously, in a substantive way the situation is a mess. The onlypoint I would add is that I think it is at or near the point where thepolitical implications of it, broadly defined, could get very testy.For example, I hear, as I'm sure others do, stories of people saying:Well, if you're going to cap foreign loans, you better cap farm loans.Certainly, in my District we have had a couple of situations involvingthe closing of small banks because of bum agricultural loans in thecontext in which the treatment of depositors is different than in thecase of Continental. And I think that is just another manifestationof how this problem could really start to close in on us. I continueto get very frequent reports of sharply different--or what isperceived to be sharply different--treatment of farm credits byvarious regulators, which reinforces the view that the process is insome sense discriminatory toward that particular class of credits orthat particular class of banking organizations", "MR. BOEHNE. Yes. The FDIC is the SOB on the block right nowin my District as far as a regulator--for these kinds of reasons andfor what the banks regard as nitty gritty kinds of stuff", "MR. BALLES. Out in the West, the picture of strong spots andweak spots really hasn't changed at all since I reported on that atthe last meeting. I continue to be mystified, I guess, by the factthat business confidence for some months has not been as good as thebusiness statistics. The thing I wanted to call attention to thismorning is that even prior to the Continental Illinois crisis, I hadgotten some very strong protests and indications of concerns fromsmall and medium size banks--particularly those represented on ourfive boards of directors--about the policies of the FDIC. The concernis what those policies will do to the availability of bank creditamong the community banks or regional banks, given the modifiedpurchase and assumption cases, which have meant less than fullcoverage for uninsured deposits in a number of small banks that haveclosed down in our District. The fear of these bankers is that theywill begin to lose deposits to the large banks--that whatevercustomers they had with deposits of more than $100,000 will run tosafety now. I'm afraid that fear has been considerably exacerbated bywhat is going on, for obvious reasons. They understand why it had tobe done in the Continental Illinois case but they aren't much consoledby the thought of what it will do to them. As a result, theirconfidence in their ability to supply local credit needs in the futureis considerably shaken", "MR. PARTEE. I think the staff projection is quiteappropriate to use for planning purposes by the FOMC. It does tend tomake the future look a lot more favorable than the recent past, butmaybe in fact that's how it will work out. I've been impressed in thelast six weeks by the growing number of uncertainties, however, aboutwhat is occurring on the inflationary side. I would say my gravestconcern, which, of course, we can't really evaluate, is the PersianGulf. If oil shipments from there are closed out, as they might wellbe, that is going to have major repercussions that are very hard tosee but that might well turn out to be of an inflationary character.Incidentally, Tony, I think the main reason that we're not gettingthese projections of double-digit inflation is that people aren'tfactoring in a big increase in oil prices such as occurred in 1979 andwhich had a major effect on the rate of inflation that most countriesexperienced in the 1980-81 period. If you were to add a 50 percentincrease in oil prices, say, I think you might get a much higherinflationary expectation from the surveys. In any event, there's justno way of evaluating that except to recognize it as a problem and aproblem on the inflationary side, if it occurs.-24-5/21-22/84I get a little worried when Bob starts to talk about dustbowls. Of course, the other thing that has given us some inflationarytrouble in the past was a major crop failure. On the other hand, ifit's only half of Texas, I think we're probably all right. It takes amuch wider dust bowl than that to give us major difficulty. On theother side, I think the major negative--and it's awfully hard for meto evaluate--is the uncertainty of financial markets. Karen talksabout the leveraged buyouts. Those leveraged buyouts, as I understandit, are usually leveraged 4 or 5 to 1. They depend on an interestrate assumption and are very sensitive to the interest rateassumption. If you put interest rates up 2 points on the 4 or 5 partsthat are financed, it raises great questions about those leveragedbuyouts. I noticed that Lyle mentioned the stock market has declined.I just looked it up in the Greenbook and the NASDAQ index is off 25percent. Did you realize that. Those are the kinds of stocks thatare in leveraged buyouts. And a major decline in that market hasoccurred since the late 1983 high. I'm inclined to agree with Jerrythat for these deals to work out there has to be more inflation. Andif there isn't more inflation, they're not going to work out. Thequestion is: Which is going to occur. Will there be more inflation orwill the deals begin to fail and the people begin to pull back. Onthat point I would make the observation that I don't know that we havehad much restraint on the part of lenders for a long time. I don'tknow if that was true during the last cycle either. There was verylittle restraint on the part of lenders", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. All I will say is that in my area Ihave a sense that on the one hand things are very, very strong andthat at the same time there are enormous financial uncertainties andvery poor profits in the financial markets, particularly compared tothe last couple of years. It creates a very mixed feeling. I wouldassume that the staff forecast is most vulnerable to financial shocks--virtually the same thing you said, Chuck. The staff forecast seemsvery reasonable in the absence of financial shocks, but I think thereis an increased possibility compared to previous cycles that it couldbe upset by something happening. For planning purposes I think onehas to go with something that basically tracks the situation and-26-5/21-22/84previous experience in recoveries. And that seems to [be true of thestaff forecast]", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me say a few words before we have thecoffee break. I don't like quite a lot of things I see these days.whether in the real economy or more particularly in the financialeconomy. I certainly think attitudes are very volatile and I wouldn'tbet on the economy slowing down all that much. I have one hypothesisbut it could change very rapidly. If you forgot about the financialside--and I'm not sure I'd propose it anyway--it might take somewhatmore aggressive action than we've taken before to bring the economy toa suitable path. And I might argue that that's the best thing in theworld for the S&Ls, for the farmers, and for others--to take it in theshort run and have some hope that they are going to get out of thissituation over a period of time. But, unfortunately, I don't thinkthat course of action is open to us. I look at this financial marketas being on a knife's edge. I don't believe all this business aboutpolicy at this point working at the margin with a nice little rise ininterest rates slowing things down here and there. We have afinancial market that for better or worse works by bankruptcy. Andwhen the economy is getting strong, people are going to make leveragedbuyouts and they're going to make construction loans without anytakeouts and for full value and I don't see any sign of that stoppinggradually. In some ways it seems to increase as the economy getsbetter, whatever happens to interest rates, until all of a suddensomething happens and then it may go [whirling] in the otherdirection.The biggest sign we have of something not working at themargin right now, I think, is the LDC situation. They are all goingto survive together or they are all going to go down together. Ifthey go down together, we will have a reaction in our financial systemand in our economy that I think at the very least is going to be verydifficult to cope with. We have this strange situation. Karen startsoff today by saying bankers are shoving money out the door; you hearthat all over the place. I'm sure they are engaging in financialpractices of a type that probably would send the fathers of some ofthese bankers whirling in their graves. There are things you neverheard of in the banking system on the one side; and on the other sidewe have this other force coming on. If you want to see a group ofashen-faced bankers, sit down in a group and talk to them about theContinental situation and possible repercussions for the funding oftheir own banks against the background of this LDC situation and whatthat might mean in terms of their own behavior and policies. I don'tthink it is occurring at the moment, unfortunately--I don't know,maybe some of this is going on--but what it could mean is a suddenchange in attitudes. I hope it's working gradually at the margin, tosome extent, and maybe it is. I don't see any evidence yet but thisis very recent.My bottom line is that we've run out of room for the timebeing for any tightening, given this situation. I don't know for howlong. I don't know what is going to happen in the weeks or months-27-5/21-22/84down the road, either to the economy or to the aggregates or theseother things. I don't have any sense here that we should be easing.But I do think we have to be concerned about a very potentiallyvolatile and actually volatile set of attitudes here and elsewhere.This Continental situation is rather enlightening in the sense that wehave a government guaranteed institution at the moment which nobodymuch wants to fund anyway. There is no doubt that it has caused a lotof looking at other banks and we don't see that strongly evident inthe market now. When we see it strongly evident in the market it willbe too late, in my opinion, to keep it under reasonable control.We're pretty close to the edge of that now. So, I'll leave you withthose thoughts and go have some coffee and orange juice", "MR. BOEHNE. I can ditto that. I think we ought to staywhere we are. The financial side alone justifies that but even if thefinancial side were less fragile, I would still advocate no changebecause we've had a substantial run-up in rates and I would want forreal sector reasons to hold where we are and see if, indeed, theeconomy is slowing. I agree with what has been said by you andGovernor Rice", "MR. AXILROD. There's another point to add. I don't think weknow what is going to happen in the banking system in the next severalweeks, in the wake of this Continental business. It may be quiet andit may not. If it isn't quiet, I think there is some possibility thatbanks will become more conservative in the management of their own5/21-22/84reserve positions, conserving access to the window and maybe holding afew more excess reserves. We could find holding [excess] at $600million and [borrowing at] $1 billion gets us even higher funds ratesbecause the banks' general attitudes have shifted, in which case Ithink some allowance ought to be in there for that", "MR. MARTIN. I think the indications of future inflation areweak. I think the relationships among and between many of theaggregates this time are somewhat different and alternative B has thelogic of giving us time to observe the lagged effects of the verysubstantial changes in interest rates we've already had. And, inorder to add an element to the discussion that we have all been alittle too polite to enunciate, I will say that we are in such anintense political environment at the moment, with so much scrutinyfrom the Hill and elsewhere about what we are alleged to be doing,that holding to the course--if that's what alternative B with $1billion in borrowing and $600 million in excess reserves means--iscalled for both for economic and political considerations. So, Iwould vote for \"B.\" Obviously, the Chairman and our associates on theDesk need some flexibility. It seems to me that excess reservespossibly ought to be $500 to $700 million because of our uncertaintiesas to how the Continental situation and other developments will affectborrowing levels. I would not quite go along with Lyle on this, but Ithink the borrowing range ought to be $900 million to $1.1 billion forthe same reason", "MR. WALLICH. It seems that we're sliding somewhatinadvertently into net borrowed reserves [targeting] from what Iunderstood to be a gross borrowing posture. I think there is asubstantial difference. If at any given time the Desk sees borrowingmoving one way and excess not changing, they have to make up theirminds whether they are going with borrowing or are going with net[borrowed reserves]. So, I hope we're going to differentiate betweengross borrowings, which is what I think we've done so far, and netfree reserves as the conversation seems to be going. As far as thelevels are concerned, I think we ought to raise the gross borrowinglevel a little precisely to avoid a relapse in the markets, whichwould give a false signal. In a sense the markets have done our work.I don't think one could have anticipated these increases at the timeof the last FOMC meeting. So there is justification, I think, for await-and-see attitude but not for an attitude of appeasing, whichcould be misinterpreted in many ways today. Also, I think one oughtto hesitate a little before one takes for granted that financialfragility is necessarily a cause for relenting. The rule about thelender of last resort operation is to lend freely but at a high rate.In the case of the thrifts and the LDCs and the farmers, I see thatthe nature of the fragility is related to the level of the interestrates. In the case of Continental it isn't quite clear to me whether-34-5/21-22/84they would be in a more fragile state if interest rates were a littlehigher than now", "MR. PARTEE. I think \"B\" is all right. I would point outthat \"B\" has specifications for a number of aggregates and that if theaggregates run stronger--which they might well do in the case of M1particularly and are already doing in the case of M3--then thequestion arises as to what to do if they are strong or well above thepath. There is language in the directive left over from last timethat deals with that and speaks of greater reserve restraint if thereis more substantial growth in the monetary aggregates.-35-5/21-22/84Now, I think we are all talking about financial marketconditions in one way or another as a paramount feature of ourdiscussion this time. I wouldn't support the prominent and extremebilling given to any unusual financial strains in the very first partof the operating paragraph in the directive. On the other hand, Ithink we could put in a more general phrase about financial marketconditions late in the paragraph. That is, it could go down where weare saying that in either case--if we decide to ease or to move higherin terms of rates because of the behavior of the aggregates--such achange would be considered in the context of appraisals of thecontinuing strength of the expansion, inflationary pressures,financial market conditions, and the rate of credit growth. That alsohas a desirable attribute in that it includes things other than theContinental problem. We have had a very bad couple of months infinancial markets and, indeed, a repetition of that could well give ustrouble in an unknown way. It could be a futures market that breaksor something like that. And financial market conditions is a termthat could encompass all of that.I don't think we ought to bias the borrowing number towardtightening, as Lyle suggests. I would buy Pres's $900 to $1100million. I guess I would have assumed that $1 billion means $900 to$1100 million and that there's not much difference from what we nowhave. I also wouldn't want to prejudge long rates. Lyle made thepoint that long rates shouldn't be permitted to come down. Well, Ithink they have gone up quite a bit more than one would have expectedas a result of a run toward short instruments in a time of greatuncertainty. Should the uncertainty unwind in the weeks to come--which is a possibility, I think, as Steve pointed out--that could meanthat people who ordinarily would be in the longer market would committhemselves and we could get a decline in long rates. And I wouldn'tresist that. I think it would be a natural market process that oughtto be accommodated", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Our Secretary is a little bothered by theEnglish in the first sentence. What we can do is make two sentences.Before we just said \"seeks to maintain pressures on bank reservepositions judged to be consistent....\" When we say \"maintain existingpressures,\" which is I assume what we're talking about here--I'll getback to that precise numerology in a minute--it might just be a littlebetter to make two sentences: \"The Committee seeks to maintainexisting pressures on bank reserve positions. This is expected to beconsistent with....\" Let's put a \"somewhat\" in front of \"greaterreserve restraint might\" and in front of \"lesser restraint might.\" Iwould just emphasize the qualifying clause a little more; [instead ofa semicolon] I would put a period there. \"In either case such achange would be considered only in the context of appraisals of thestrength of the business expansion, inflationary pressures....\" If weadopt the Partee suggestion we would put in there \"financial marketconditions, and the rate of credit growth.\" I would be perfectlyhappy to write a separate sentence about that", "MR. RICE. I'm not so sure. We put out this press releasewhich seems to me to indicate a very deep involvement in this wholething. Now we come along with a statement to the Desk and we try toignore it. I don't think that's really very prudent", "MR. PARTEE. We could also do something with that lastsentence, Paul", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The question in my mind, which is notrelevant to our decision here, is that we look like knee-jerk reactorsin the sense that the first time we put in financial markets as athing we consider to modify our behavior is after the ContinentalIllinois situation. Many of us, including the Chairman, certainlywere worried about the financial market situation and vulnerability ofthe banking system before this month of May '84", " I would agree with that, Tony, but the questionof whether to put it in now just because of the events--MR. PARTEE. If we had several Continentals, the operationalreference here to maintaining existing pressures on bank reserveswould be modified", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. So you're going to have \"a changewould be considered only in the context of appraisals,\" right", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I find the word \"only\" confusing. Doyou see that differing interpretation. Is there any great advantagein putting in only, which the Fed watchers will look at and wonderwhat is happening", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Okay. But I thought the practicalimplication of what you were saying was that you don't want thequalifier \"only\" inserted, which we didn't have in the previousdirective", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I don't want to make a big deal outof it; it's not. But if a Fed watcher sees \"only\" this time and notbefore, does this imply that earlier we were more responsive to themonetary aggregates and now we're less responsive", "MR. PARTEE. I have a marginal preference for leaving it out", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We weren't reacting thatmechanistically to the aggregates before this and no one seemed tofeel dishonest by not having the word \"only\" in at that point. Idon't know; I wonder if people are going to overread"], "1984FOMC19840717meeting.txt": ["MR. PRELL. The way we got the adjustment, in essence, was tomake an estimate on the basis of all that we know about the equityflows and all the merger activities. And we came up with a net equityabsorption number. There was a net decline in equities of somethinglike $60 or $65 billion in each of the first two quarters. We thenwould hypothesize that, in the conditions that prevailed, that wouldbe the relevant number. We know that new equity issuance is somethingslightly positive--say, on the order of $10 billion. So, the [grossretirement] is on the order of $70 or $75 billion", "7/16-17/84MR. GRAMLEY. If you put the market value of equities intoit, you can't do that. You have to figure out what base to put inthere; the amount of the base that's included is the critical issue", "MR. BOEHNE. I have a question on the chart that has the wageincreases, which is about in the middle of the package. I keepreading these figures in the Greenbook that show wage increases around4 percent or a little under or a little above. Yet everywhere I go inmy District, except for the really hard-pressed manufacturing areas, 6percent is the most common number. There are very few under that andmost are over that; yet the national figures keep showing theserelatively low rates. My District could be different or there couldbe some wide discrepancies among industries. Do you have any sense ofhow firm these numbers are", "MR. ZEISEL. Yes, something of a credibility gap", "MR. GRAMLEY. That's the converse of the argument thatproductivity hasn't gone up so much; those two are mirror images ofone another. It's hard to use the one to justify the argument thatproductivity is going up faster than it really is. The reasonproductivity didn't go up so fast explains why we had such a bigincrease in employment given the rise in GNP. The rise in GNP in thefirst 6 quarters has been a little above average but not much. So, ifyou had that much larger increase in employment, it is preciselybecause the rise in productivity has not been so great", "MR. TRUMAN. We'll fool you next time", "MR. GRAMLEY. One of the determining factors will be whetheror not we get 2-3/4 percent real GNP growth fourth quarter to fourthquarter for 1985 or, let us say, 1/2 or 3/4 percentage point more.We're getting down into the range on the unemployment rate where thatmuch additional growth, quite possibly, could trigger quite differentresponses in labor market conditions and wage rates than the staff hasanticipated. Similarly, an additional half percentage point real GNPgrowth would result in maybe 1-1/2 to 2 percentage points [more] inmanufacturing output and that gets the capacity utilization rate intoa range in which we begin to have problems. So, while the staff'sforecast might not be unbelievable in terms of internal consistency, asomewhat stronger economy can produce quite different results", "MR. CORRIGAN. In terms of the task of sitting down and doingone of these forecasts twice a year, as Mr. Kichline knows, it isnever very easy. From my perspective right now it's harder than ithas been because on the one hand we have an economy that on thesurface--by most indicators, statistical and otherwise--looksabsolutely terrific. But underneath that gloss we have some veryserious problems that seem to me on balance to be getting worse ratherthan better, and that colors my thinking about a forecast. Forexample, as Jim indicated, the Federal budget deficit in a structuralsense continues to deteriorate in a very significant way and withnothing in sight that I know of that is going to change that. AndJim's estimate of the structural budget deficit next year of $172billion is literally off the scale of experience. Similarly, andagain notwithstanding the spectacular performance of the aggregateeconomy, high interest rates are clearly placing very serious strainson selected classes of domestic and international debtors. Thebanking system, to put it mildly, is fragile. The conditions areaffecting all sizes of banks and thrifts which, as Jim indicated, arenow right back on the edge, if not worse. As for external trade, thefinancial position of the United States, which is helpful in somerespects for us and for others, now leaves us highly vulnerable to thesudden and sharp fall of the dollar. Whether that will materialize,of course, is another question. From my perspective, looking at thefirst six months of this year, it seems to me that what we have on ourhands is a good old fashioned credit binge--almost irrespective ofwhich set of numbers we look at. They all say the same thing; andsome of them relative to GNP or relative to inflation or relative tosomething are outside the spectrum of experience. Against that7/16-17/84background, as I said, I find it very hard to make a forecast. Forwhat it's worth the forecast that I've come up with is one that showsthe real economy a little stronger, by 1/2 point or so, than the staffhas. I have no real good reason for that other than my sense of thesheer momentum that the economy has right now, notwithstanding thehigh interest rates.In the inflation area, which I really think is the swingvariable for 1985, I also found it very tough [to make a forecast].In July of last year and February of this year, I had an inflationforecast that was very much at the bottom of the range of Committeemembers' forecasts. And I had it that way for two fundamentalreasons. One was that I thought the economy was going to be strongerand at that phase of the cycle a stronger economy implied strongerproductivity in a context in which wage restraint was still very muchin evidence. Clearly, in retrospect, inflation was better than even Ihad thought and I attribute that almost exclusively to the dollar.Looking at 1985, unlike 1984, I have an inflation forecast of almost 6percent on a fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter basis, which is on thehigh side of the Committee members' forecasts. I ended up there withconsiderable reluctance. But fundamentally the reason I ended upthere was that I did have in mind an acceleration, however modest, incompensation, very much like the staff's. Strangely enough I had inmind stronger productivity growth than the staff, at around 1-1/2percent. But the difference in my case is that my forecast basicallyassumes that we will continue to have a positive spread, on the orderof 1-1/2 to 2 percent, between the deflator and the rise in unit laborcosts in the economy. I arrived at that for three reasons. First, itis certainly not without a precedent at this stage of the recovery.Second, we are moving into ranges of capacity utilization andunemployment that seem to me to imply at least some further pressuresin those areas. Last, but certainly not least and perhaps mostimportantly, I continue to think that the point will come when thedollar will have to come off; and if it does come off, my view is thatthe potential effects of that on domestic inflation coming from thedirect effect on imported prices and also the indirect effect on thekind of restraint that these imports are producing could be evengreater than the 1 percent that Mr. Truman spoke of. I am, of course,mindful of the fact that not only wage statistics but commodity pricesand other things right now could very well lead to a different view oninflation. But even in terms of commodity prices, I assume at themoment that an awful lot of that also is a direct and indirectreflection of the international situation. I am not yet ready toconclude that its effects will be permanent over the forecast cycle", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I have very little confidence ineconomic forecasts--my own in particular--but forecast we must, so Iguess I will have to bare my soul. Like most everybody else, we endedup pretty close to the staff's forecast for 1984. But when we got to1985 we differed in the same direction that Jerry Corrigan did, onlymore so. We came out with a little higher real growth, but the maindifference was on the inflation side. We were on the high end of thatand we would stress the factors that he stressed, but also would pointout that we still have not yet paid the piper for the rather rapidgrowth--or what I view as rather rapid growth--in the money supply inthe past. And even after allowing for the possibility of a rightwardshift in the demand for money, I still think we're going to see moreinflation probably than the staff is projecting. This, obviously, isone argument that I don't want to win", "MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I think there is an awful lotof uncertainty as we try to make a forecast at this particular time.Generally speaking, we agree with most of the staff forecast with theexception of the inflation and unemployment numbers. I do think thatthe staff's inflation numbers are low. We look more for a 6 percentinflation number, fourth quarter '85 over fourth quarter '84, basedpretty much on reasons that have already been alluded to by othermembers--namely, the depreciation of the dollar and so on. But I alsothink it is very unrealistic to think that the wage concessions andwage moderation that we fortunately have had so far are going tocontinue. Nobody knows, of course, what is going to happen with theautomobile negotiations but I'm fearful that they could turn out to bedifficult. And there are other wage pressures that I think are goingto develop in the economy.The other thing that I haven't heard mentioned, which wefactored into our projection, is the monetary growth through aboutmid-1984. So, I think the factors of expansionary policy, wagepressures, depreciation of the dollar, and capacity constraints--whichwe certainly see in our District, incidentally--augur for a somewhathigher inflation rate than the staff projects. Also, as theunemployment rate goes through 7 percent, those wage pressures aregoing to increase as well. I also think unemployment is going to be abit higher than the staff suggests, but otherwise I think theirprojection is pretty accurate", "MR. PARTEE. I've been reflecting on Jerry's comment aboutfinancial fragility, which contrasts so sharply with the strongeconomy. And I suppose that the link is what Henry is talking about:the next recession. There are probably many roads to recession. Butone that seems quite certain to me is to get into an environment inwhich interest rates have to increase substantially, because I think asubstantial increase in interest rates, in fact, would turn thefinancial system on its ear--certainly the thrifts, probably the LDCs,and very possibly some of these people who have signed up for variablerate mortgages and that kind of thing. And, of course, the thing thatbothers me is that if you look at past recoveries, we've always gotteninto a period in which interest rates went up substantially toward theend of the recovery. So, I suppose the best and safest insurance thatwe could buy would be to try to insure that the economy does not growso rapidly as to bring the inflationary consequences that will lead tosubstantially higher interest rates and bring the next recession.Now, the reason I haven't commented along those lines is that thestaff forecast, I think, does that. That is, the staff forecast givesus a [slowing of] real growth in time to keep off some of these touchpoints that Lyle was talking about. It gives us a 3 percent rate ofreal GNP growth, roughly, in the four quarters of 1985. I have toadmit that I forecast the same thing, but I'm darned if I know why Idid because, taking it right up to where we are today, everything isstronger--and quite a lot stronger--than that. Maybe it's just a hopethat the real growth will recede to a point where we can live with itover an extended period rather than a true forecast that all of us areexpressing here. As I said, there is nothing in the consumptionfigures or certainly in business and plant and equipment spending oreven in housing so far that would give one the strong assurance thatthe 3 percent rate of growth would be established by the latter partof this year. And I think we need to try to guard against thepossibility that for the quarters ahead, as in the quarters past, wewill find real results to be substantially greater than what had beenforecast beforehand. That is very important because, otherwise, I dothink the financial system is going to tumble", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me make a couple of commentsthat have occurred to me in listening to all this. I could have leftthese for later, but what jumps out at me is how atypical this cycleis. Just on the face of it, we have had more rapid growth than at anytime during the postwar period--which I guess makes it atypical--though we started from a low level, to be sure. Take those domesticdemand figures, which didn't include inventories, that were presentedto us a little while ago. If you compared the domestic demand withearlier cycles, I think you would see nothing like what has been goingon in the past 20 months. And, in fact, it doesn't show much sign ofa slowdown. If you look behind it, we obviously have a budgetdeficit, as was mentioned, that is out of line with all ourexperience. It is in fact rising in the third year of expansion andthe full employment deficit, however calculated I guess, is risingrather sharply. Of course, the mirror image of that is the trade-19-7/16-17/84deficit, and however one adds it up I cannot believe such a deficit issustainable forever--however long forever is.I would like to think that there is something else atypical--but it remains to be seen--and that is that prices are moving upexceptionally slowly, given the strength of demand at this point. I'msure the dollar has something to do with that. But how much we haveingrained in the wage situation from a succession of recessions orother factors remains to be seen. I share the feeling that a numberof people have expressed that the reliability of any economic forecastin the 18 months ahead under these conditions is exceedingly limited,to say the most for it. I don't doubt that there's a lot of momentumin the economy right now; I wasn't so sure a month or so ago, but itsurely looks that way now. And I don't doubt that we're getting acontinuing thrust on fiscal policy. I must say that I don't see mucheffect from the rise in interest rates we've had and I'm not surewe're going to get it when we're in the midst of one of these periodsof considerable momentum. I was--I don't know the right word--bemused, I guess, by the analysis of the last Michigan survey thatsays the public thinks interest rates are low and one of the reasonsthey are buying is that they think rates are going to be a lot higherlater. That doesn't sound as if marginal changes in interest ratesare going to affect purchasing very much. Of course, consumerinterest rates in fact aren't doing anything, except maybe veryrecently, and I doubt that there is much there to change the behaviorvery strikingly. At the same time, all these interest rates produce alot of income on the other side of the balance sheet--on the incomestatement--that we haven't had in past expansions. We certainly needsome slowdown in my judgment, given all that's going on. In fact, Ithink we're having a test of monetary policy in deregulated marketsand it doesn't look very sensitive in terms of responses out in theeconomy. I have to say that I think a lot of the difficulty we arefacing is due to no great news on the budgetary situation. The onlypromise I can see in that area is that the budgetary situation wasn'tabsolutely written in heaven or wherever it was written, maybe theopposite place, and it conceivably could be changed--not in the nextthree months but looking beyond the next three months. I'm almostinclined to say it better be changed or we have an almost insolubleproblem. I won't berate the fact that we now have a financial systemunder pressure in every direction. I don't for a moment want tounderestimate that problem, which I think is a considerable risk onall sides in terms of looking ahead. We'll talk more about thattomorrow when we get to the short-run policy. So, with that muchcomment from here, why don't you give us your wisdom about the longrun, Mr. Axilrod", "MR. BOEHNE. I have one technical question on the history ofthe 4 to 8 percent range on M1. Wasn't it at one point 4 to 9 percentand then dropped to 4 to 8 percent. It seems to me that a year or twoago there was some special reason that it was dropped to 8 percent.Do you remember that", "MR. BALLES. This is a technical observation, I guess, Mr.Chairman. If I remember your most recent testimony correctly, you atleast--and perhaps the Committee--are on record as saying that M1 isstill on probation. I would think that before this meeting is over weought to get that question settled as to whether it is or isn't. Interms of public understanding at least, the record should show whether-21-7/16-17/84we're still placing primary emphasis on M2 and M3 or whether, in fact,we're going to restore M1 to its prior position", " If it's a forecast, I would say we made a badforecast, but--MR. RICE. Well, the target is the forecast", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would leave the Ml,M2, and M3 ranges the same, but I would argue for increasing the debtrange at this time to 9 to 12 percent.

CORRIGAN. I'd go one step further even than Tony. I'dbe troubled by raising that credit range, particularly on the groundsof raising it because of mergers and leveraged buyouts. It seems tome that that's tantamount to sanctioning a pattern of financialbehavior that is going to get us in trouble sooner or later. If we'regoing to raise it, raise it. But I would not say that we're going toraise it because we have all these damned leveraged buyouts. Thatseems to me to be just bad policy", "MR. GRAMLEY.

Or the competition that you mentioned yesterday", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me raise another question while Ithink of it and we can return to it. These price estimates thateverybody has given bother me a bit, partly because I'm not sure weshould be in the public posture of saying our monetary policy isineffective in keeping prices under control. It became very clearyesterday that you have a variety of assumptions about the dollar andI have no doubt that over a period of time--I don't know about nextyear--that can be a big influence, [particularly] if the dollar reallyfell out of bed. I wonder whether it would make some sense to have astandardized assumption on the dollar and do all these projections onthe assumption that the dollar isn't going to be changedsubstantially, which would encompass a depreciation of 5 percent plusmaybe, but not, I think, 15 to 20 percent. We could present the priceforecast that way and say quite clearly in the material that theseprice forecasts are made on a standardized assumption that the dollaris not going to change very substantially and that if the dollar doesdecline substantially, everyone would be raising his inflationforecast appreciably. That would get us out of this business ofevaluating different assumptions about the dollar, where I take itthere is a good deal of uncertainty about the timing of any declineanyway, although there is a good deal of feeling that the dollar mightdecline, as I well understand", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Doesn't it get a little embarrassing,Paul, if you're asked by the [Congressional] Committee about thereasons for the wide spectrum [of views] among the members of theFOMC. If you said that some of them assumed a 15 percent [dollar]decline and some of them didn't assume that, is that going to look alittle strange up there", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me return to picking out thesetargets. On 1984, I'll make another attempt to see whether we candispose of it relatively quickly. When I said no change yesterday, Ithought I noted some oral acclamation. I may have been wrong aboutthat because people began saying they disagreed. But let me just trysomething out to see whether we can [agree] without spending a lot oftime on this. Suppose we keep them the same with a very clear caveatthat we're keeping M3 and debt the same and expect to come in over theranges for them but are not too happy about that. Is that the bestway to present these. The alternative, obviously, is to increase theM3 and debt ranges. Among Committee members, is that the desirablecourse", "-32-7/16-17/84MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, it is just a matter of emphasis.It would seem to me that in the presentation we shouldn't couple theimportance of M3 and debt. We are learning something about whatinformation the debt numbers will give us. My only footnote to thatto join the raised hands would be that we differentiate between thetwo aggregates. M3 is more important", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is there anybody else who feels that way.My problem with the alternative--and I think we could do it eitherway--is that if we raise them we really have to say we're going to tryto meet them. And then there's the question of how far to raise them.I think the worst of all worlds is raising them and then saying we'regoing to go over them anyway", " And we are so uncertain about the merger/acquisition/LBO component of debt that I don't see how we could--MR. BOEHNE. Well, I think that is a good argument. It maybe best to say \"Here they are\" and then say \"Hell, we don't know", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just observe, along the lines ofyour concerns about velocity, that something like 4 to 7 percent orwhatever number you pick looks pretty good compared to the staff'snominal GNP forecast. Yesterday [we noted that] the staff's nominalGNP is below everybody else's except for one; quite a few of thenominal GNP forecasts are around 9 percent and some are as high asalmost 11 percent, which raises the greater question of consistency", "MR. MARTIN. With velocity growth moving from 2-1/2 to 4-1/2to a presumed 2 or [a little less than] 2, we better leave some degreeof freedom, by going to 7-1/2 percent rather than 7 percent for a top", "MR. MARTIN. Is it beginning to behave or are we assumingthat it may behave in a more normal cyclical pattern", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think there's as solid anintellectual argument for 5 to 8 percent for M2 as there is for 4 to 7percent for M1. Why would the assumption of roughly, let's say, 0 to1 percent velocity of circulation for M2, be any different than a 2percent assumption for velocity of circulation for M1. I don't thinkthat's any shakier. We've been running about 1 percent, haven't we,for velocity of circulation for M2", "MR. CORRIGAN. Personally, an 8 percent nominal GNP as agoal--as distinct from a forecast--is very appealing to me because Ithink the optimum that one could reasonably think about for 1985 issomething like 4 percent [real] and 4 percent [on prices]. In mymind, to the extent that nominal GNP grows faster than that, it wouldincrease the likelihood that more of it would be prices and less of itwould be real. So, primarily for that reason, if I think about '85from a policy viewpoint and what we should be shooting for, I come outwith around 8 percent nominal. In terms of the targets I am more thana little attracted to Tony's thought, but my initial thought had been4 to 7 percent for M1. But as I said, Tony's point has some merit.Personally, I would go with 4 to 7 percent, 5-1/2 to 8-1/2 percent,leave M3 where it is, and use 8 to 10-1/2 percent on credit. Thebottom of the credit range doesn't matter at all, but I do think thatshaving a half point off the top of that has some value. As I've saidbefore, I am really troubled by this explosion of credit that we areseeing. That consumer credit number yesterday is another indicationof this. Gosh--a 30 percent annual rate of increase in consumercredit. That's where I would be", " Tony, that's not what I--MR. GRAMLEY. The staff's views are of less value than theFOMC's. [Laughter", "MS. HORN. To speak about M1 for a moment: When we revisedthe M1 targets because of the problems we were having with velocityand the NOW account assumptions and so forth, if my memory serves meright, we moved them up 1-1/2 percentage points on the bottom of therange and 2-1/2 percentage points on the upper end of the range. Now,with the threat of future inflation and the course of fiscal policybeing slow [to adjust] in the future and, of course, with ourincreasing confidence in velocity of M1, I'd like to see the M1 rangenarrowed first and lowered second. I would narrow it because of thereduced uncertainty. That brings me to something like alternativeIII. I suppose between the two options [for M1] in alternative III,the 4 to 7 percent is more appealing to me because I think the upperend of the range has been particularly meaningful to us in theCommittee as we've operated. But I'm a little uncomfortable even with4 to 7 percent because I, like some other people around the table,like the idea of 8 percent nominal GNP as a policy objective. And I'ma little uncomfortable with assuming 2 percent velocity [growth]. I-39-7/16-17/84think we might get velocity coming in a bit higher than that. So, asI say, the two things I'd like to see are a narrowing of the M1 rangeand a lowering of the M1 range. And 4 to 7 percent doesn't quite makeme comfortable at this stage", "MR. BALLES. In deciding between alternatives II and III, I'minfluenced by our staff's forecast of velocity for the coming year.We expect it to continue to show a significant rise--certainly abovethe less than 2 percent that the Board's staff has forecast. Afterall, the first half of this year is up, with a 4-1/2 percent annualrate. We look at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis; we've had threesignificant rises in velocity and we expect that to go up further in1985. Who is right, of course, remains to be determined. But basedon that and based on our views of long standing here that we really7/16-17/84need to restore M1 to at least its former position--I agree with BobBlack on that--I would come down in favor of alternative III, usingthe 4 to 7 percent option", " Ithink that would be a better procedure than doing what we've done inthe past when we have changed the guidelines at midyear and then feltthat we were more or less stuck with those guidelines in February whenwe really ought to be doing our basic thinkingCHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I really don't think that option is opento us. If you will recall, everybody was on the Committee when wetried precisely that one year and got sent back like bad boys to go doour work over again. We were told to come up with the guidelines forthe following year in July--that that was what the law required", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you're coming pretty close to sayingthat", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody else have anything to say.Well, let me try this in reverse order. After listening to this, Icome out very close to where some other people came out, but without acomplete sense of conviction. On debt, we are all conscious thatwe're running way above and I don't hear any great sentiment to reducethat very much. You put down 8 to 11 percent; that bothers me a bit.No, let me start differently. From what I hear people saying, interms of policy--and this encompasses most people's, but noteverybody's, forecast--we are talking about a nominal GNP of 8 to 9percent. There aren't many at 8 percent--only the staff. There are alot between 8-1/2 and 9 percent and some above 9 percent, to be sure.But in terms of a policy objective I sense that that's about where weare. If that's where we are, a debt range of 8 to 11 percent, which-43-7/16-17/84is unchanged and allows for a larger growth in debt than GNP for thethird or fourth consecutive year, is not an entirely happycircumstance", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On M1, I get a little concerned. It hasrun about 7-1/2 percent so far this year--within the range--with the12 percent nominal GNP. If we're aiming for an 8 to 9 percent nominalGNP, based upon recent experience it seems to me that the range oughtto be lower or we will give a rather peculiar signal. Then it's aquestion of how much to lower it. If you allow a 2 to 3 percentvelocity increase, 4 to 7 percent seems all right and gives the rightsignal. Then we get into this tactical question of whether to do ahalf point now and maybe do a half point later. Just sitting here, Idon't have any absolute final conviction about this. It has beenrunning 7-1/2 percent so far this year; announcing that we'resatisfied with 7-1/2 percent next year but are looking toward adecline in the nominal GNP on the order of 3 to 4 percentage pointsstrikes me as a bit peculiar. I'm assuming here that we don't puttremendous weight on the midpoint and that the most operative thingtends to be the upper limit. A number of people have said and a lotof people would interpret that as the same growth in the money supplynext year as this year with a hope or stated objective of havingsubstantially lower nominal GNP growth", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, what could happen next February.None of us knows. Let's suppose we're running above that [range] nextFebruary for good and understandable reasons; that must mean thatwe're worried about something--interest rates or something in theeconomy. In that kind of scenario we would go [to Congress] and say,\"Look, you haven't done anything about the budget. We can't hold itby monetary policy alone without running undue risks. We're going tohave to raise this target and that is all the more reason [you] oughtto be working on the budget deficit", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we haven't made the decision. It'sat least debatable. I don't know whether they will or won't", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think that's what we're debatinghere. I don't know whether it's enough or not, but it looks prettymealy-mouthed. It depends on how one interprets it. If oneinterprets it as the midpoint, it's okay. If one interprets it moreas the operative [number], what one really gets concerned about isbreaking through the top, which I think is more the reality in thissituation. And it looks like not much", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know. There may be no long-rangegrowth in velocity. I don't discard that hypothesis entirely in thepresent world, in which case this is going to be too low and we willjust have to say that. We don't have the evidence to make that caseright now", "MR. GUFFEY. I would like to raise a question again about M2.Why narrow the range of M2. What's the impact and what's the purposeof that", "MR. GUFFEY. Sure. Keep the 3 percentage point range. Wehave narrowed the M1 range; however, we come out to a 3 point range.Why then would we take one additional step and narrow the M2 range.It makes no sense to me", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think Roger has a point. Wewouldn't want M3 to come in at 6 percent. I don't know; I guess itdepends on what you place more importance. I assume people are notgoing to be looking at the bottom of the range in this recoveryperiod, although it might become important at the end of 1985", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

MEEK. [Statement--see Appendix", "MR. MARTIN. What is your evaluation of, let's say, theintermediate-term strength of the fears and the difficulties withregard to bank CDs, bank soundness, interbank market availability andso forth. Is it a passing phase associated with Continental,Argentina, and so forth. Or is something going on here that's likelyto be a malaise going forward. What's your feel for it", "MR. ROBERTS. One should give some consideration to the factthat banks have been expanding CDs very rapidly in recent months,however.

But I think most banks will want to get morecomfortably above the new ratio than they are at the moment, sothere's a degree of pressure there.Looking at the rest of the financial climate: We referred abit to the problems abroad. I don't have anything to add to what Isaid earlier about the problems of the developed countries. Let mejust say a word about the LDC problem. I don't think there is anyquestion that the general psychological attitude in LDCs hasdeteriorated in terms of the determination to adjust and pay theirdebts. The focus of that, of course, is in Argentina. It's a littlehard to tell what is happening in Argentina now. It's rather at animpasse. But that feeling has affected other countries, even thoughwe can show objectively that countries like Mexico and Venezuela andBrazil are doing better than expected. It is not just an economicproblem but an increasingly difficult political problem. This lastincrease in the prime rate coming one day after the Cartagena meetingconvened, when there was a great effort to restrain the radicals inLatin America, hit our friends like a kick in the solar plexus interms of keeping the political situation under control. I'm notsaying, certainly not economically, that some further increase ininterest rates in the United States follows like night after day. Butthat situation falls apart. I don't think that is true economicallybut politically I think we are increasingly close to margins of-56-7/16-17/84tolerance. The significance of that, of course, is partly that itfeeds back into our domestic credit situation and the confidence inour own banking system. Now we have that whole set of problems. It'sa set of problems we have not seen the likes of, in my opinion, sincethe early 1930s or late 1920s. One of the reasons we have the problemis that it has been so long since we've had it that no bankers couldimagine it was going to happen again. So they went out perfectlyhappily and got rid of all their liquidity and filled up the balancesheet with less-than-strong loans.When you look at the real side of the economy, as I saidyesterday and I guess the view is widely shared around here, there isjust a lot of plain forward momentum. I see very little [slowing],except possibly in housing, and that's not clear. We get a housingstarts figure tomorrow. I did see a builder survey yesterday thatshows a further decline in sales; it was an attitudinal thing--traffic, sales prospects, and all the rest, which continues the trendthat started two or three months ago in a fairly decided way. Butthat's a limited piece of evidence. Generally, I think the momentumis very strong in the domestic economy and is propelled by a lot offactors. If I were just sitting here looking at that without any ofthe financial problems, I wouldn't have much doubt about what I woulddo within the limits of monetary policy. I would be more restrictivebecause, just looking at that, I think that's where the risks lie.When I look at the financial system, I get quite a different pictureof what maneuverability we have. To put it another way, I do think wehave something of a knife's edge problem. If we are too easy, thenthis momentum in the economy will be excessive and will materialize inmore strength than we'd like to see. If we are too tight, it mightpull out the rug from the whole thing in a rather sudden way due tothe financial concerns. I hope the knife has a dull edge rather thana sharp edge, but dull or sharp, it's not very easy to keep on aknife's edge. In a sense, I think we're coming close to running outof maneuvering room in terms of monetary policy alone. I don'tconclude from this, as I guess I implied, that any kind of easingsignal is justified or appropriate. But I do conclude, giveneverything we know at the moment, including that for the moment themonetary aggregates look reasonably quiescent, that it's not time totake a strong initiative in the restraining direction. So, thatreduces the choices, in my mind, to a fairly narrow range. I am notsaying that there is no room for some tightening down the road if themomentum of the economy continues and the aggregates move high and allthe rest. I'm not saying [we wouldn't ease]--although I find thispretty far-fetched--if something happens that makes the economy on itsown look considerably weaker. I really don't expect that. I do notdiscount the possibility of more financial stringency and difficultiesthat could arise from any number of directions, most likely from theLDC side. But it could arise from purely domestic or even developedcountry concerns. All of this leads me in terms of specifics tosomething like not doing very much right now, but remaining poised totighten a little if we have to in terms of what happens down the roadin the coming weeks. I guess I'll stop right there", "-59-7/16-17/84MR. AXILROD. Yes", "MR. ROBERTS. I think of that as a \"B+.\" I note that thequarterly average under \"B,\" in fact, accelerates to 7.7 percent. And7/16-17/84I think we ought to be raising the borrowing target modestly to, say,$1-1/4 billion, so that there is less opportunity to spill overinadvertently into a rapid growth in money as we maintain a borrowingtarget and provide reserves to get used and transferred into money. Ithink the momentum of the economy fully justifies this and I think themarket has probably already significantly discounted something likethis together with an increase in the discount rate", "MR. GRAMLEY. I agree with Tony's and Henry's version of \"B\":Use the specs of \"B\" and if, in fact, we see some different attitudesof borrowing develop, inch up on the borrowing number rather than letinterest rates go down. I do think, from a macro standpoint, that our-61-7/16-17/84real concern is that this slowdown in economic activity which thestaff foresees, and which I could foresee also, may or may not happen.It is still primarily a forecast. The concrete signs of that areprecious and slim at this point. We have to keep hoping that it willoccur. And if it doesn't occur and we have upward pressure oninterest rates, then we're going to have some very, very seriousproblems about what we should do. Henry is right: The choice for theshort run is either more inflation or a financial debacle. I thinkthe best we can do about this is not to let inflation happen, but justto hold to a rather steady, sensible policy. And if we don't get somebudget restraint, then there's going to be no way to avoid this", "MR. GUFFEY. I also would go with what Jerry justcharacterized as the Solomon/Gramley version. I have a concern aboutthe uncertainty with respect to the $1 billion borrowing and itsrelationship to the current interest rate levels of 11 to 11-1/4percent. Because of that uncertainty, then, I would focus more uponthat [funds rate] itself, whether that's fine-tuning--Chuck'sterminology--or not. We haven't had good evidence of a slowing of the[growth in the] economy yet, which I think all of us would like tosee. The market essentially has taken us there, but for policypurposes it would seem to me more appropriate to focus on a federalfunds rate because of that uncertainty in the period ahead. In otherwords, I would not let it go up or let it go down below the 11 percentlevel. It also says to me that if that's the general consensus, thereshould not be a movement in the discount rate, which is on the tablebefore the Board. That's simply because if we follow the usualprocedures, a 1/2 percentage point increase--if that were the number--would imply a 1/2 point increase in the funds rate level, which Ithink would be quite inappropriate", "MR. PARTEE. I couldn't support asymmetrical. No, I thinkthat's the wrong thing to do. And I think it was very widelymisinterpreted in December when it finally came out", "MR. MARTIN. I could not support an asymmetrical directive.I don't know whether implicit in such a directive and not enunciatedbecause of the sensitivity of it would be an understanding that ifthere began to be trouble in financial markets, we would move in theother direction.

Well, what Steve was suggesting when Iraised this question with him was to add a sentence immediatelyfollowing the one on the ranges saying \"It was anticipated that debtand M3 would increase at rates somewhat above their upper limits,reflecting in considerable part a rise in debt and the decline inequity financing related to recent merger activities.\" Maybe weshould put a \"however\" in there. I scribbled down something, which Iwasn't very happy with. In effect, it says that while this wasanticipated the Committee felt that these [recent] rates wereexcessive in the longer-term perspective--excessive as a benchmark forevaluating the appropriate trend for credit and M3 growth.

You are projecting, as you just said, 1percentage point higher inflation in '85 compared to '84. But if Iunderstood correctly your analysis 6 weeks ago, you are projectingabout a 1 percentage point rise in unit labor costs. Now, that alonecould account for a 1 point rise in inflation but on top of thatyou're also factoring in a 10 or 15 percent reduction in the exchangerate, and presumably you'll get some some increase in utilization ofcapacity. I don't see how, based on your assumptions, you end up withonly a 1 percentage point increase in inflation in '85 over '84", "MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I could follow onthis with a similar question. I generally agree with the staffforecast but, if I understand your analysis correctly, you haverevised your growth forecast upward and you have revised the inflationnumber downward for 1985, whereas the unemployment rate associatedwith both of those is unchanged.

I think we have much less room here forinflation to get going as it did then because of the level of interestrates.

And I don't think there'sthat much room between where we are now and what it would take to tripthe economy into a recession. So, I think it would take less of achange in inflationary expectations now than it did then to get theimpact on interest rates that would give us the slowdown", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. This brings up something that I wantto check with Jim Kichline on. My people project that even by the endof 1985, assuming these growth figures that we more or less are inagreement on--let's say 3 percent real GNP in 1985--that utilizationof capacity should not exceed 85 percent because they believe thatcapacity will be growing in 1985 at about the same rate. Therefore,even though we're up now to the 83-84 percent area--I don't knowexactly where in there--we probably will not see 85 percent even bythe end of 1985. Is that correct. Is that your assumption", "MR. PARTEE. Of course, we do have the New York Savings Banksyet to deal with. Following FCA, we will have to go East and therewill be something in New York City with two or three of them", "MR. KEEHN. They are", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to yourquestion \"Is there more pessimism.\" I'd say things perhaps are morepessimistic in the Tenth District. It's a very unbalanced recovery inthe sense that in manufacturing, particularly auto assembly, aircraft,and other manufacturing, together with construction, things are goingvery well. I don't know that there's been any damping of thosesectors of the economy. On the other hand, I'd just note that thegood projection for inflation in the period ahead is tied largely tothe energy and agricultural food sectors, which will have an effect oflowering the outlook for inflation. In each of those cases--in theenergy sector, for example, the dropping of oil prices and thedropping of natural gas prices will impact the discovery andextraction of petroleum products in the Tenth District ratherdramatically. There has been no increase in rig counts in the mostrecent time; it's fairly level and some ten to thirteen percent higherthan it was April of '83, which was a low point in the rig count. Ifenergy prices fall further, we're quite likely to see that sector turndown again, and it's already in trouble. At the same time, as all ofyou know and as has been recited around this table, the agriculturalsector is in trouble and there is no prospect in the sense of exportsor other factors that will raise commodity prices. That's thesalvation and the hope, [but] there is nothing out there. As a matterof fact, there is a good crop assured at this point and that has acontinuing depressing effect. The one tangible number that I canrecite to you is out of a survey of farm land prices; they havedecreased another 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter of 1984. Thathas an impact, obviously, that rolls back into the financial systemthat we quite likely will see around the first quarter of 1985. Ithink we're talking about the thrifts, for example, and potentially asegment of our financial industry that supports the agriculturalsector that could be in really serious trouble late this year or inthe first quarter of 1985. Again, I don't think the interest rates inand of themselves hold out much hope. Lower interest rates wouldhelp, to be sure, but that isn't what will extract the agriculturalsector; it will be commodity prices, and nobody has any real hope thatthat will come to pass", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll take some brief questions now andmaybe have coffee. Before that, let me just say that when I look atthis directive I'm a little hard pressed to see why we're runningbelow [the specifications for the aggregates]. I know we're runningbelow the track a bit on M1; that's fine. I don't know why. Thequestion that occurred to me right off is: Why reduce the target forM1 for the quarter when we're running a little low--or reduce it somuch, anyway. Then, if it went back up and we got the target we werelooking for before, we'd have to tighten. That's a little odd to me", "MR. AXILROD. If we do get a 6 to 7 percent growth in Augustand September, the monetary aggregates--according to our always shakyequations--will be running about as we expected based on the quarterlymodel; on our monthly model, not quite. The quarterly model wouldhave predicted for given interest rates and GNP enough money demand tocreate this much money growth without much different interest rates.So, that wouldn't be far off. What is far off, as you're suggesting,is the credit growth. I had in my head two reasons that I haven'tquite been able to demonstrate statistically. One is that with thegovernment being such a large element in borrowing--when thegovernment is spending more than it's taking in--it has no real optionto reduce assets. It really has to borrow. So, I think its borrowingpropensity is [virtually] one for any amount of deficit spending.Whereas if other sectors are spending in excess of what they're takingin, they have the option of cutting down on assets, which doesn't getreflected in our credit figures. So, I have a feeling that the largepersistent role of the government is raising credit relative to GNP.Also, and I think Governor Gramley mentioned this at a discussionearlier here, we're in a period where we have much more freedom forcredit to flow at any price relative to earlier periods; there is morederegulation. And that may then be permitting a greater flow ofcredit at the high [rates], and the higher interest rates are exertingthe pressure more than the restricted availability. Those are theonly two factors I have, particularly", "MR. MORRIS. No, without specifying exactly why, I thinkthat's a good idea. On the other hand, I think it would be a mistaketo lower the borrowing guideline because the market has now caught onto how we are running policy. If in following a $1 billion borrowingguideline we were to see interest rates drift down to where we thoughtthey would be at the last meeting, then I think the market wouldunderstand that we were not pushing rates down but that rates weregoing down because of the smaller rate of growth in the economy--ifthat eventuates.

CORRIGAN. I too would like to stay where we are in termsof the borrowing level, money market conditions, and so on. I'd liketo take the shortfall in M1 and to some extent the other Ms in Julyand put it in the bank and save it for a rainy day. I like the ideaof not changing the darn aggregate specifications at the mid-quartermeeting. I don't know exactly how to get this directive language tosatisfy that objective while satisfying the larger objective ofstaying where we are. But I assume we could figure out a way to dothat", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciated Lyle's briefanalysis of the difficulties of estimating productivity. He does wellto remind us of the errors we've all made in the past. Maybe thestaff has made fewer than the rest of us; I don't know. I think we'remaking a corresponding error today: We are underestimating. The 1-1/4 percent trend line is not the trend line; it's more like 2percent. I think we're returning to the trend line, but I have adifferent trend line, Jim. My reason is that we're a services andinformation workers society now, not manufacturing. Yet we are--maybenot overly obsessed, but--overly concerned with manufacturing output.Finally, I think that software works. Finally, an ordinary humanbeing, not a wizard, can work a personal computer or a terminal orsomething like that. And that has permeated the services side of oureconomy--the sector from which people said we could not getproductivity increases just as they used to say about restaurantsbefore McDonald's came along and showed productivity in that area.This will be the surprise on the productivity side of our society--therising output in services. I'm not saying the services are going tobe anything we really need, but I think we're going to have a lot moreof them, however you measure that. So, I believe that will keepinflation at the staff's [projected] level or even a touch better.The other factor that is going to contribute to lessinflation is one that I deplore, and that is the impact on thefinancial system of failing thrift institutions against a backdrop, ofa government institution--namely the Federal Savings & Loan InsuranceCorporation--that is too small. Whatever has to be done about that asinstitutions fail--whatever receivership or conservatorship pattern wewill suffer through in the next few years from that side of theeconomy and maybe some additional failing banks, given the rate atwhich banks are failing--will change the consumers' outlook. I don'tthink the American public is prepared for the kind of questioning thatwill result from these failures. And it may well result fromsubstantial volumes of uninsured deposits at one or more institutionshaving to be paid back at less than 100 cents on the dollar out ofasset administration which takes many years. If it is thriftinstitutions, these tend to be long-term assets and the payout periodis long and the interest is lost. I believe this is going to be amaterial factor in the thinking of the American public with regard totheir own finances and their own consumption function, if you will,over the next few years. I think that will affect inflation in apositive direction now, though it's unfortunate that it's coming fromthat side.To translate that into policy, I would go along with theChairman's suggestion, which he says he didn't want to make toofirmly, to keep policy where it is in terms of the directive of a fewweeks ago with the exception that I would join my esteemed colleague,Governor Partee, in favoring $800 million in borrowing. I would leavethe range on fed funds alone and would prefer the $800 million onborrowing to give us more flexibility--not only because of theaforementioned change or possible change in the commercial banks'attitude toward excess reserves, but because I feel that the financialfailures will not only affect the attitude of consumers toward savingand spending, but will affect the attitude of commercial banks and-298/21/84other institutions with regard to borrowing from their respectivecentral banks", "MR. BOEHNE. I came in to this meeting with some bias toward\"B,\" but as I listen to the discussion, I agree that there is somevirtue in keeping the quarterly specifications where they were inJuly. But I think those specifications are inconsistent with abillion dollar borrowing figure. There is no great virtue inconsistency but I think there is that problem. My own sense is thatthere is something to this business with reserves. As to how much weshould want to adjust for it, I don't think we should do it in anyspecified way but we ought to at least have a bias that attempts tocorrect for it. My bias would be for borrowings of less than $1billion; I think $800-$900 million makes some sense. We have let thefunds rate drift up over the last several months; we start outthinking where it's going to be and it ends up being higher. So, Idon't think there would be any disaster to the economy or expectationsabout what we're doing if it had some downward drift; in fact, thatwould be my bias. I would keep the funds range at 8 to 12 percent andI would have a symmetrical directive", "MS. HORN.

Putting my point differently: If the staff iscorrect, a specification of $1 billion in borrowing to start with--andholding to that with the kind of federal funds rate which would beimplied if the current demands for borrowing relative to that fundsrate prevail--would not give you 5 percent growth. It would give yousomething more like 4 percent. So, if you were aiming for 5 percent,in fact, what you would do is proceed to lower levels of borrowing,lower levels of the funds rate, and more increase in the aggregatesover time.

One is that the information that we had at the time of theAugust meeting generally is weaker today with data revisions. When wehad the August meeting, retail sales in July were reported to be down0.9 percent. With the revised data, they are now reported to be down2 percent. So, it is true that new information available for Augusthas been weaker, but I'd say the past also looks weaker forconsumption, residential construction, business-fixed investment, aswell as for the merchandise trade area. It has been very broadlybased. I think my briefing did not avoid the issue", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm just raising a question. You areamplifying what I am saying. The statistics are quite a lot weakerthan you anticipated six weeks ago. We started the summer on a highnote and we surely ended it on a low note.

The survey is [still] fragmentary; we don't know how tomake a lot of sense out of it, but it is indeed a weak number", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This is all accompanied by a great surgein imports, which certainly is eating into U.S. production. Thehowever many percent increase in the exchange rate recently can't helpthat situation in the future; there was an enormous surge in theexchange rate. I don't know what consumption is going to do but itwasn't very good over the summer. The auto sales look all right. Butthat's the only thing that looks pretty good.

Well, in the words of one of my associates: \"TheMiddle West has dropped out of the economic expansion.\" But as I hearthe comments, maybe we aren't the only ones to have dropped out. Ithink it's now clear that overall economic activity in the Middle Westhas been at least leveling off since the early part of the summer.Steel production is down and down significantly. Imports are taking avery much larger part of that market. The heavy capital goods sectorcontinues to be relatively weak. One part of that sector, indeed, hasturned around: Orders for large trucks, which had been very strong,have now turned around and are on the way down. Residentialconstruction is down, the result of high interest rates. Our gains inemployment rates have slowed down. Our unemployment rate is down, butit's probably more a factor of people just dropping out of the workforce and not the result of higher employment numbers. Retail salesare uneven. There was a pickup during the back-to-school period.Nonetheless, the September numbers, according to what we're hearing,are again on the soft side. In the agricultural sector, the outlookcontinues to be relatively poor and the land values are continuing togo down. The outlook for farm incomes is not positive and that isbacked up even more in the farm equipment sector where production isbeing further curtailed. Some major manufacturers are continuing tolay off workers. Broadly, the news is a bit more modest. I would notsuggest by any of this that we are heading back into a recession. Ithink it would be far too early to suggest that. But certainly, atleast in our area, the expansion has faded. And I think we are goingto have to watch the numbers pretty carefully in the upcoming period", "MS. HORN. As for business conditions in our District, theanecdotes would support an economy that is levelling off but notdeclining. And we would view that as basically a good development. Iwould like to comment on inflation. A couple of speakers havecommented on it and, in my opinion, it is an ongoing problem. Thereis, of course, a good side of this. We hear a number of anecdotes onproductivity as well in our District--that it may be increasing andthere may be some significant changes. On the negative side, leavingoff fiscal policy from the discussion and turning to the exchangerate, I think there is a genuine concern that if the exchange ratewere to be reduced significantly, that would show through to pricesvery quickly. In the Cleveland District we have a large number of thetypes of firms that are finding themselves subject to importsubstitution. And it's that pressure that has kept their margins inan area where they are just completely uncomfortable with them. Theyare just waiting for the moment to move [prices higher]. We hearmany, many stories of these types of firms being poised to move theinstant they can. So, that adds to my concern about inflation as thelonger-term problem", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It seems to me that we ought tomaintain the present borrowing level of $750 million. I do think it'sworth commenting here, though, that I've been surprised that you havebrought borrowings down from $1 billion to $750 million without anyconsultation with the Committee. Even though I think that was thecorrect thing to do and a certain amount of discretion is indicated inthe directive, it seems to me that at some point you would want tocheck with the Committee to make sure that others share that view onhow to use that discretion. The question could arise again, possibly,over the next few weeks: If we were to start with a borrowing level,let's say, of $750 million, at what point would you feel that youshould check with the Committee if both money and the real economyturn out weaker and, therefore, you were reducing the borrowing levelor increasing the nonborrowed reserve path.Turning to the decision for today, I'd start from theassumption that even though there may be weakness in the fourthquarter, that just does not mean an incipient recession. It seems tome that we already have been perceived in the markets as being fairlyaggressive in easing and I think we ought to be somewhat cautious,particularly between now and the election period. Unless there arevery clear economic reasons to do otherwise, we ought to continue to-23-10/2/84be fairly cautious rather than move toward a pronounced easing. Asfar as the targets go, alternative B strikes me as fine. I wouldleave the funds rate range where it is. There is one last point:It's not too likely, but if we were to get a restoration of confidencein the banking system in a way whereby the management of these banksbegan to follow a somewhat less cautious policy in reserve management,then with a borrowing level of $750 million, we might find fed fundsdropping to as [low] as, say, 10-1/4 percent. And a question I thinkthe Committee ought to consider is: Do we want that much of a drop.If this contingency were to arise--though I don't think it will--wouldwe want to see that much of a drop. There could be an understandingthat the Chairman would be in touch with the rest of the Committee atthat point", "MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I would support alternativeB with the understanding, as during the last period, that theborrowing limit could be lowered if the aggregates come in extremelyweak. But I think an 8 to 12 percent fed funds range is no longerappropriate. When interest rates were moving up, the lower end of thefunds range didn't have much relevance. When they start moving down,then it seems to me the lower limit becomes the more relevant one.And to me an 8 percent lower limit is simply too low, certainly atthis juncture. I would hate to see us make the sort of mistake we didin 1981 of pursuing vigorously an M1 that was showing some weaknessand pushing rates down and getting an enormous surge of response fromthe economy again. I think that would be very unfortunate. It seemsto me that we need to probe down on interest rates and not let themmove down too sharply", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I think that the growth in M1 andthe growth in M2 over the last 4 months or so deserve some underlininghere. The lack of growth in the monetary aggregates and the flatconfiguration of the curve of reserve growth argue, as one of ourcolleagues here indicated, for probing in the direction of restoringM1 and M2 to a somewhat higher configuration over the next weeks. Italso seems to me that the slowing of the economy's rate of growth andthe uncertainty with regard to nondefense capital spending suggest aprobing in that direction. I would join Governor Gramley in hisassertion that a 25 percent annual rate of growth of capital spendingis not appropriate at this stage of the cycle, but I would also pointout that we've had some minus figures in the nondefense capital areafor two months and that the purchasing agents indicate strongly thatthis continued for a third month in September. I'm not sanguine thatthe consumers are going to come back that quickly. On top of therationale stemming from the aggregates and from the reserve growthpattern you add the high uncertainties with regard to a possiblegrowth recession--whatever that is--in the fourth quarter or the firstquarter or both. We can certainly have two quarters of very, very lowgrowth with the implication that says to the Congress when they comeback--after all, we're talking about policies that will have someimpact four or six or eight months from now just at the time when theCongress is back--and the question of taking some responsibility forfiscal policy is in the offing. If we have 1 or 2 percent real growthat that time, what prospect is there for some degree of responsibilityfor fiscal policy.And finally, it seems to me that the behavior pattern thatSteve described with regard to borrowing, with regard to fed fundsprovision, and with regard to excess reserve positions on the part ofthe banking community will probably be reinforced. This aberrantbehavior, if you will, that has kept the fed funds rate where it isdespite almost daily intervention by us, despite the reserve position,and the borrowing position of the banking community, is going to bereinforced by the bad news that's going to come out of commercialbanks and thrift institutions instance after instance. And we knowthis bad news is coming and that it is certainly not going to buildconfidence. It seems to me we should probe from the current level of$750 million of borrowing, from the current 11 to 11-1/2 percent level-25-10/2/84of fed funds, and from the current level of excess reserves carefullydown toward the levels specified in \"A.\" In other words, I recommendwe start at the current levels and move very carefully toward \"A,\"consulting as you will with this Committee, Mr. Chairman. But,certainly, a $600 million level of borrowing is not out of thequestion; and if it takes a $500 million level of borrowing to get tothat 10 to 10-1/2 percent range for fed funds, then so be it. A thirdreason for probing and moving in that direction is, of course, thedollar situation, which has been thoroughly discussed here and whichis giving our central banker colleagues in Europe and Japandifficulties. To me, the aggregates, the economy, and the dollarargue for a careful probing movement in the direction of whatever ittakes to bring the rate down in the direction of the level specifiedin \"A", "MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Tony Solomon hasstated a position that I would like to join, with just a modest changefor maybe different reasons. Rather than adopting \"B\" as proposed inthe Bluebook at a 6 percent M1 level--and I'm not talking about eitherM2 or M3 or the federal funds range--I would prefer that the Committeeadopt a shading toward \"C,\" to the 5-1/2 percent level, the same levelwe adopted for the third quarter. In other words, as the record ispublished it would reflect that there has been no change in theobjective of the Committee with respect to money growth. Thedifference, obviously, is that we did not achieve 5-1/2 percent growthin the third quarter, but only 2 percent on a quarterly basis. Itwould give us the latitude to move down. My concern is, much as whathas already been expressed, that the fed funds rate range have someflexibility in it but that within the next six weeks there not be anymajor move to a lower level. I think the chance of moving to lowerinterest rate levels is quite likely consistent with the comments thatI made earlier in that I don't believe that the economy is going to bequite as strong as the staff is forecasting for the fourth quarter. Ithink we'll see some easing. But for the record I would like to seeus re-adopt the same money targets that we had in the third quarterand try to achieve that 5-1/2 percent growth for M1", " Please remember this is Tuesday and borrowingon Wednesday--MR. PARTEE. Well, I know. That's why you're proposingWednesday meetings, which is a very good reason for Wednesdaymeetings. But I am remembering that it looks as if we are going tohave a shortfall [in M1] and it might carry through into M2 also; Idon't know. I've been a little unhappy about an initial borrowinglevel as high as $750 million and it strengthens my view that we oughtto cut it to $650 million to start with. I see nothing wrong with a10 percent funds rate, although I guess I would have to agree that ifit goes significantly below 10 percent for a period of time, thatsignals something new and I would want to talk about it before it gotbelow 10 percent. But if reducing the initial borrowing number to$650 million happened to give us [a funds rate] moving down toward 10percent, I wouldn't be at all concerned about it. Maybe that's theproblem we're going to have, Mr. Chairman: that we all will choosealternative B but we all will have different ideas as to where [thatmay lead]", "MR. FORRESTAL. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Looking at the GNPI'm a bit more optimistic than some of the comments that I have heard.I think the third quarter may very well wind up stronger than the 2.7percent that the staff has projected and that the fourth quarter, andindeed most of 1985, will be a little stronger as well. Also, I thinkthe money supply is about where we want it, notwithstanding some ofthe recent weakness. There, too, I think we will have a bit of arebound, as suggested by the Bluebook. So, the policy considerationthat flows from those hypotheses would indicate to me that a statusquo policy is appropriate, and for that reason I would opt foralternative B with a borrowing level at $750 million. I think itwould be appropriate for consultation to occur if the fed funds ratewere to drop below 10 percent. I have some sympathy with the remarksthat were made earlier about the range of the fed funds rate. Ireally don't know what 8 percent means except for public relationspurposes, but it doesn't seem to me to be very relevant in thisenvironment. If the dollar were to surge again, I would assume thatthat would cause a different policy direction, and again perhaps aconsultation would be appropriate.10/2/84Mr. Chairman, the question that I raised earlier about thedollar in terms of any significant deviation upward or downward reallywent beyond consideration of policy at this meeting. I have a concernthat we're all expecting at some point some decline in the dollar--andhopefully it would not be a precipitous decline--but nobody reallyknows and nobody knows when it's going to come down. I suppose wecould say we'll have a winner one day--that it probably is going tocome down. The question in my mind is: Is anyone looking at what ourresponse should be if there is a precipitous decline or do we dealwith this on an ad hoc basis. Maybe some planning is going on thatI'm unaware of, but I raise the question of whether there is acontingency plan and, if not, should we be looking at some kind ofcontingency plan", " I don't know what the--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Neither do I. That's the problem", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Prices--except for that last consumerprice index number. That was the only fly in the ointment. But theproducer price index and everything else seemed to fit exactly in acontingency that we considered and discussed at some length at themeeting as to how we would react under those circumstances. The onething that was really surprising and added a little edge to the way weoperated was the exchange rate. One could have argued that we shouldhave been a little more aggressive in our monetary policy [response].At least that's my thinking. In any event, that's behind us.-33-10/2/84We seem to have votes for \"B,\" which I interpret as includingboth the funds rate range and the aggregates. There are somedifferences of opinion on how that is to be dealt with. I wouldremind you of what Si Keehn just said. We meet again in 5 weeks; it'sa relatively short period of time. I didn't hear anybody talkingabout a higher borrowings number. Some people were talking about alower one and a number of people were talking explicitly or implicitlyabout not being too slow to move lower, if the evidence suggests that.Someplace in this area we ought to be able to reach some kind ofconsensus operationally. I don't like the directive as Mr. Sternlightand Mr. Axilrod wrote it, I must say. It starts out by saying policyis unchanged. I'll be more correct in my words; it says the\"implementation of policy has been unchanged\" when it obviously waschanged in the last month. If we were to read all of our directivesin succession, they would never say anything was changed, although infact they were changed", "MR. GRAMLEY. I for one would repeat my own concern aboutmoving too far too fast because I don't think we know when the economyis going to start picking up again. I thought I heard a fair numberof people share that concern; maybe not. There were a number ofpeople who were worried, as I am, about the possibility that ifinterest rates come down too much and if the economy then recoversrates would go bouncing back up again. And that's not a desirabledevelopment, in my judgment", "MR. GRAMLEY. If the funds rate were to get down into the10-1/4 to 10-1/2 percent range, I wouldn't be acutely uncomfortable.If it gets down to 10 percent, having been up to 11-1/2 percent only afew weeks ago, that just seems to me to be too big a move", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

Well, I think it's a mistake not to havesomething on both sides. We can achieve the purpose you want bysimply revising the existing sentence and putting the easier restraintfirst and then leaving the rest of the directive exactly as it is.So, it would read: \"Somewhat lesser reserve restraint would beacceptable in the context of significantly slower growth of theaggregates or somewhat greater restraint would be acceptable in theevent of more substantial growth. In either case...\" and so on.

But the Octoberlevel of production is still below what we saw in the summer. Thereare many what I would view as conflicting indicators of what ishappening", "MR. KICHLINE. The bulk of it. I think industrial productionis related [more] to the manufacturing employment. But for somereason, people are going out and hiring lots of new employees inservices and trades", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. To unload the imports and sell them", "MR. MARTIN. It's above the runway but perhaps without anywheels. At any rate, your comment with regard to oil prices, foodprices, and other indications of inflation out there in the future isreassuring. Imports are still soaring--I'm tying onto the Chairman'scomments as usual here--but those imports are having employment andincome effects in U.S. firms. We know that. It seems to me thatthere is a risk of a growth recession in the first and second quartersof next year. I too have talked to retailers who feel they will getthrough the holiday selling season well and then have very quiet firstand second quarters. And I see the risk of a growth recession, withrising unemployment and very low real growth taking off from that 1.7or 1.5 percent. I saw one model's output that had 1.2 percent for thethird quarter, which I don't believe, but it begins to get yourattention, I think. The consumer comes into the first and secondquarters with all those new cars bought on credit and all those otherconsumer durables and is paying the kinds of real interest rates onepays today, and I don't know whether that adds up to a snapback ornot. It doesn't to me. I think that the risk is so high that weshould be very concerned about it. If we get your [projected] 3.5percent real [GNP] for the fourth quarter and run along at about 3 or3-1/2 percent for 1985--given the margin of error, no disrespectintended--it seems to me that again gets to be a precarious positionto be in with a substantial downside risk. If we get one or twoexogenous factors in there when the economy is hovering around a 3percent level, unemployment can get started up again. The foreigncompetitor is still cutting into those employment rolls. So, I thinkthe margin of error is substantial. I would hate to see the Congresscome back into this town, this font of all the wisdom in the universe,facing a 1 percent real growth figure and rising unemployment. Wewould just get some dandy decisions in the fiscal area in thatcircumstance. I think we are facing an increasing downside risk", "MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman, Governor Martin said a good part ofwhat I had in mind except that I don't expect a growth recession inthe first half of next year. I don't have any major argument with thestaff forecast. But I am more comfortable with the longer-term partof the forecast than I am with the forecast for the current quarter.As was pointed out in the briefing, the performance of the currentquarter is very sensitive to the increase in consumer expenditures; wehave to get a substantial increase--on the order of 5 percent plus inthis quarter--in order to get the projected growth for this quarter.In addition, even if we get this substantial increase in consumptionexpenditures, the stimulus to GNP depends on the distribution of theseconsumer expenditures between imports and the rundown of inventory.So, the net stimulus to real GNP may not be as strong as projected.On the other hand, it may well work out that output does increase inthe range of 3-1/2 percent. My only point is that for this quarter weshould be prepared to see an increase in real GNP of significantlyless than 3-1/2 percent", "MR. KEEHN. Perhaps in line with previous comments, I'mbeginning to sense what I think is quite a different tone in our areathan what I reported at the previous meeting. I have suggested in thepast that the Middle West has not participated very fully in therecovery and expansion, and that continues to be the case. But somethings may be developing that signal broader problems. The badbusiness has continued to be bad. The backlogs of orders are runningdown. But those businesses that have done better than others arebeginning to feel the slowdown. One CEO that I talked with who workswith what he calls pressure curves, which are some kind of regressionanalysis on the rate of incoming orders, says those are beginning toindicate to him that we are heading into a downturn. Specifically:The appliance business is noticeably weaker; heavy trucks, which were11/7/84very strong early in the year, are now turning down; and the trucktrailer business market was up because of a legislative change but isclearly turning around and slowing down", "MR. KEEHN. We had a meeting of [local] economists a week orso ago and their representative, who had been quite optimistic aboutthe Christmas outlook, is now a lot less optimistic", "MR. KEEHN. They are expressing some doubts about the outlookfor retail sales. This suggests that while we thought the softlanding--or the reduction from the very high first and secondquarters--was a welcome thing, it may be something a bit morefundamental. I'm beginning to wonder about that. I don't disagreewith the staff forecast, but it tends to be a little on the high side,to me at least. The GNP numbers look high both for this quarter andfor next year. Housing starts and auto sales look a little high. So,consistent with [the views of] Governor Rice and Governor Martin, Ithink there is an increasing risk of low or perhaps even negativegrowth rates.I just can't let the moment go by without commenting thatconditions in the agricultural sector are continuing to deteriorate.What has been a very difficult situation has only gotten worse withthe passage of time. The rains are now complicating the harvestseason; commodity prices are down; meat prices are down; and landvalues are continuing to decline. [The latter] is particularly truein Iowa where admittedly they have come down from pretty high levels,but they are in a decline that's very significant. This is beginningto back up even more with regard to nonperforming loans in theagricultural banks. The banks keep saying that their problems aremanageable; nonetheless, these are the kinds of things that can turnaround pretty rapidly. Based on the calendar we are at a time of theyear when for the next few months things [should] only get better.They ought to be better now than they are. And the fact that they arebad would indicate that in the next few months things are going to get11/7/84worse. Agricultural equipment manufacturers are continuing to gothrough just a very dismal period. The outlook is poor and they arepulling down their production schedules very significantly. There isplenty of tractor and combine equipment at the retail level, soproduction is going to be very weak well into 1985. Our agriculturaleconomist, who is a pretty conservative guy not given to extremes,said that in his view we are facing the worst set of circumstances inthis area that he has known in his whole experience at the Bank. Idon't think that we are at a turning point here, but I would certainlythink that the odds have changed significantly and that theprobability of going into a period of lower rates of growth than wethought in the past is increasing. It is certainly higher than it wasat the past meeting or two", "MR. BOEHNE. In my District if you talk to people who arerunning companies, they still have fairly good expectations for 1985but are less sure. Some doubts are beginning to creep in and I thinkwe're in a period where expectations could change. The currentresults are quite mixed. Manufacturing tends to be flatter. Inretailing, I find that we talk to one retailer and things look good inOctober and we talk to another retailer and things were pretty flat.So, the current indicators are rather mixed. I do think, however,that if we continue to get these mixed current indicators, the longer-term expectations are going to shift. If you start out with reallygood feelings about 1985, I think uncertainty tends to undermine them.So I think, as has been said around the table starting with GovernorMartin, that there has been a change. I don't think it is a definiteturning point but it's a period of increasing doubts. And if we don'tbegin to see some pickup very soon, attitudes about 1985 will shiftsignificantly. If you felt strongly a month ago that we were having asnapback, you have to be a lot less sure about that now. If lastmonth you were leaning toward [an expectation of] a growth recession,you have to be leaning more in that direction. My own view is thatI'm fairly uncertain. There is a high degree of uncertainly aboutwhere things are going, but I think the risks have shifted toward aslower economy than I, at least, would have thought a month ago", "MR. BLACK. Well, the staff's projection for the fourthquarter is about in line with what most private forecasters have beensaying; it's certainly plausible and maybe even the most likelyforecast. But I have to agree with Preston Martin and Emmett Rice andEd Boehne and Si Keehn: I believe the risk has shifted to the lowside since we last met. As Jim Kichline pointed out, there arecertainly some statistics that suggest that growth picked up inSeptember--the employment figures and the figures on retail sales.But I think we have to bear in mind that given the export/importpicture, even if final demand strengthens, that doesn't necessarilymean that we are going to have equivalent strength in domesticemployment and demand. People may, as you said, Mr. Chairman, belining up to unload those imports. Moreover, the lack of growth in M1since midyear certainly makes it less likely that there will be anysustained resumption in growth any time soon. In short, I see someserious risks in the near-term economic future and I think we ought tokeep those in mind as we address policy today", "MR. WALLICH. When unemployment rises but GNP still rises--inother words, growth below potential. If we had that and it werereversed subsequently, that to me would be a less ominous thing than anew real recession. And that might well be a choice because thethings one would have to do in order to make sure that there is nogrowth recession may very well generate imbalances or maladjustmentsand set in motion [forces] that a year or two later might produce areal recession. They might also, of course, get us back intoinflation. Starting from 5 percent inflation, it seems to me oneought to use special caution in dealing with that prospect. It's notas though we were starting from close to zero", "MR. GRAMLEY. We're now looking at a period of rising autoproduction--increasing availability of models instead of the reversethat was going on in the summer. The last figures on housing startsand new home sales were up in contrast to earlier weakness. TheOctober employment data were considerably stronger than the datacoming in during the summer; indeed, we had a turnaround inmanufacturing employment from a rather sizable decline in September toan increase in October. In a period like this there is bound to beuncertainty. As Henry mentioned, you can list a dozen factors on the-10-11/7/84positive side and a dozen on the negative side, and there is room fordoubt among reasonable people as to where things are going. We'vebeen through this sort of pause many, many times in periods ofeconomic expansion. If you asked what basic factors were driving theeconomy during the first six quarters of recovery--strong fiscalstimulus, a lot of consumer confidence, low inflation, the technologydriving business fixed investment--I think those factors are stillthere. And I'm about 75 percent certain, personally, that theincoming figures a month and two months from now will show a morepositive trend. I do not worry about the possibility that third-quarter GNP growth will be revised downward. I don't doubt that atall. That is what happened in the past. Indeed, if it turns out thatthe downward revision reflects a lower rate of inventory investment,that would be on balance a plus and not a minus. I agree with thestaff forecast. I think we will see some strengthening in activity.I don't know whether it is going to be in the fourth quarter and Idon't really care. It's a question of whether or not it comes alongsoon enough, as I think it will, to generate the kind of growth thatthe staff is forecasting for 1985. And I think they are about righton the button", "MS. HORN. The situation from the vantage point of theCleveland District isn't much different from what has been expressedby a number of people around the table. The Fourth District'sdifficulties are probably due to a [concurrence] of circumstances.First, there are the ongoing structural problems and the intenseimport competition, which we feel so strongly, together with the pausein economic activity. Most of our capital goods industries, excludingmachine tools, have noted a flattening in orders and shipments. Insteel we've had a few more furnace shutdowns. Housing in the Districthas been flat at best for several months and our bankers continue tocomment on the difficult income situation that farmers find themselvesin and the problems they will have servicing their debts. The result,as has been pointed out, is increased uncertainty about the outlookfor next year. In our District we still have the basic view that theconsumer will lift the economy into growth next year; around theDistrict a strong Christmas is widely expected. Expectations are alsofor a continued thrust from business investment, although presumablyat a slower pace. We have a basically positive outlook but a lot ofconcern is expressed; I think the concerns of many people arise inpart because of how discouraged they are with the very strong importcompetition. Others focus on the long-term problems of the economy:the need for fiscal policy changes, the inflation problems, and soforth. Also, expectations are generally damped by the pause that wesee. Although expectations are for growth next year, they are veryshaky, and sometimes I wonder if they are held with enough confidenceto get us over a few disappointments that we might see in the comingmonths", "MS. SEGER. I have been somewhat concerned about slowingbusiness conditions for several months and I still am. I won't repeatall the signs; I heard them earlier and you have also. I will just-13-11/7/84add two things that I haven't heard mentioned so far. One is that intalking with a number of business economist friends who are neitherkooks nor politicians I sense a big change in their attitudes in thelast six weeks or so. In general their confidence in their forecastsfor next year seems to have diminished. Frankly, if I had to point myfinger at one factor that is responsible for this, it would be thesignals that we have been sending from this building. They arelooking at the slower monetary growth in the last four months and as agroup are not interpreting that as poor marksmanship or the inabilityto hit our targets. They are interpreting these numbers as an actualtightening, particularly when they saw the fed funds rate shoot backup in August. So, I think that has led to some of the changes inattitude. Secondly, I was talking to a top economist for one of theBig Three auto companies who said that when they were doing theirmodeling and trying to forecast auto sales for next year they lookedat the usual relationships among employment, income growth, creditavailability and all the things that they know influence auto sales.They came up with a particular forecast, yet because of their lack offaith in that number, they peeled off about 300 to 400 thousand unitsfrom that because in the pit of their stomachs they didn't think theycould hit the number that came out of their model. I am mentioningthis to suggest that if there is a risk, I think it is that thesenumbers [forecast] for the fourth quarter and for 1985 will be toohigh rather than too low. I am not saying that there is a recessionaround the corner; I am not that good a forecaster. But I think thereis the risk", "MR. PARTEE. One thing that worries a person who looks at thebusiness statistics all the time is a situation that can't very wellbe explained on the basis of past experience. And I can't very wellexplain why business is as weak as it has been in the last few months.That makes for considerable discomfort in a professional economist. Iam very nervous at the present time. I felt confident that therewould be a resurgence in the economy this fall because, like Lyle, Ithought that we had just a temporary spell of reduced consumption. Ithought the economy would come along in the fall because incomes andexpectations and confidence and the real financial value of assetswere all there to support strong consumer spending. I guess I stillfeel that. I am closer in view to the guy from than I am tothe guy from in thinking that we're going to have a goodChristmas. Nevertheless, there is no real indication of such aresurgence in attitudes of manufacturers and business peoplegenerally. The one thing that I have never dealt with is the problemof a steadily rising proportion of total markets being taken up withimports. Because we haven't had that in the 35 years that I have beenan economist, it does occur to me that it's possible that retail salescan look good and strong and that plant and equipment spending canlook good and strong and it won't do anything for the domestic economyif an important increment of that demand is going into imported goods.Therefore, it is quite possible that we could have strength in theindicators of the kind that Bob Forrestal talked about--retail salesand so forth--but weakness in the underlying performance of theeconomy. I think that's a big change from the past, and it seems tobe a trend that is still persisting.-14-11/7/84The other thing that may have occurred--and it's very, veryhard to know--is that, in fact, inflation expectations may havesubsided over the last six months. We are getting some indications ofthat from these horseback surveys that people do on inflation. But Idon't think they are much good; they really just reflect what hashappened most recently. But it may be that we've had a period of lowincreases in wages and low increases in profit margins for a longenough time that people are now beginning to believe that by gollyinflation isn't going to go back to 7 or 8 or 9 percent. You mayremember in the spring that it wasn't hard to find outliers likeMilton Friedman who thought that inflation would be at double digitsby the end of this year. That has disappeared entirely. That also issomething that could affect attitudes and the speed with which plansare put in place in order to beat price increases, because now peopledon't expect the price to increase whereas before they did.I would point out that the staff forecast is nothing to writehome about in terms of great strength. The forecast is for a littleover 3 percent real growth over the next five quarters. That's not ahigh number. I would also point out to you that there is an importantpresumption in that forecast and that is that real imports go nohigher than they are now--that the whole import thrust is behind us.In the Greenbook, if you look at constant dollar net imports on a GNPbasis, there has been a deterioration of $35 billion over the pastfour quarters. Over the next four quarters there will be nonewhatsoever, if that forecast is accurate. And that goes into the GNPforecast. If you don't believe that the import surge has ended, thenyou can't really believe a forecast as strong as the one the staff hasshown. I don't know what you think, but I think that imports arestill rising pretty darn rapidly and that the growth in imports willnot be over until we can change the terms of trade in which the UnitedStates deals. So, the forecast of a little over 3 percent assumesthat net imports stopped growing as of the third quarter, which isalready behind us. That's not such a very strong forecast.Henry speaks about inflation. He says a base rate of 5percent; I would say 4 percent. It is [not] zero. But unemploymentisn't zero either. As a matter of fact, we have 7-1/2 percentunemployment; it has been hanging at that number, Henry, and I wouldargue that a 7-1/2 percent unemployment rate gives us room for furthergrowth in the economy in the sense of looking at the performancecompared with some kind of norm--what we would like to see ideally.The unemployment rate is about as distressingly above where it oughtto be as the inflation rate is above what it ought to be. As I seeit, it's a situation in which one can say inflation has done betterthan one would expect based on recent track performance. Unemploymentis worse than it ought to be at this stage of a cyclical recovery.Therefore, although I'm not sure what is going to happen in theimmediate future, I think that the economy is not going to go into agreat resurgence in terms of output and employment and I think thereis room for some more growth than seems in prospect in the numbersthat we have", "MR. TRUMAN. May I just correct one comment on the forecast.I don't want to dispute the basic thrust of your argument, but on theimport side we have identified a couple of areas--textiles and steel--where it is pretty clear that there was a buildup in imports inanticipation of trade policy actions that did occur and are going to,-15-11/7/84at a minimum, put us back toward the trend of where those imports wererelative to GNP. It is partly because we have taken out that smallpiece--$2-1/2 billion in 1972 dollars--which is not trivial in termsof the numbers we are looking at. It's 2 or 2-1/2 percent,essentially, in current dollars. We have taken that piece out andallowed some payback of it so that we get the absolutely flat picturethat you so accurately described. So we do have a continued rise inimports at least to the middle of next year absent that factor, whichtells us the dollar's depreciation, putative depreciation, takeseffect. But the reason you get the picture in the Greenbook islargely because we have that offsetting payback in the short run onimports", "MR. PARTEE. A year ago you had a plus $12 billion; in thethird quarter of this year it's a minus $22.6 billion. That's achange of $34-35 billion", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I tend to assume that thedollar is going to come off more and I assume there will beinflationary pressures that will result from that--although they won'tshow up too immediately, I suppose. And I would be concerned aboutmuch more than a 3 percent growth rate. I think our capacity isgrowing around 3 percent and it may very well be that the structure ofthe economy and our comparative advantage has changed in the world andthat we cannot expect to go back to a level of unemployment as low aswe had in previous recoveries. Also, in those previous recoveries wegot to double-digit inflation so we then tended to overreact the otherway. It seems to me that a steadier, more prudent, balanced, calmerpolicy would be in the direction of easing which does not reflect asmuch concern about the economy as I heard around the table", " That's making a substantial--MR. PARTEE. What if November-December were less than 7percent. If, say, November and December were at 4 percent rather than7 percent, would that have changed the seasonal distribution and inwhich direction", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And it is leading to some moderationthere. But enough was said about that. As I look at the businesspicture, I think we have a rapid rate of inventory accumulation. Thatdidn't look so bad when the economy was rising rapidly, but as soon asthe economy stops rising so rapidly that rate of inventoryaccumulation has to come down. One senses that that's whatbusinessmen feel. And I think the short-run question we have is: Howwill that happen. If retail sales are strong in the next few months,we can get a declining rate of inventory accumulation in a very smoothway and have a good setting for business next year. If retail salesdon't pick up in the next few months, I think we have a quitedifferent kind of problem. The GNP figure for the fourth quarter maynot be a bit different in total but it's going to include moreinventories and less sales, and that has quite different implicationsfor next year. And I don't think we know. Everybody reports ontalking to retailers who seem to change their minds every two weeksabout their feelings about sales--for good reason, I suspect, becausethere is some instability in them. I surely don't know, but if I hadto guess I'd say the retail sales figure in October is probably goingto be weak because autos presumably were down. The explanation thatthere are not enough cars [in dealer inventories] is beginning to weara little thin on me. Maybe it's all true; there is something curiousin that industry. I don't think the industry wants to produce manymore cars. I am beginning to think they get a nice profit marginwhere they are. The dealers like it, manufacturers like it, and solong as they have the Japanese shut off why take on another workerwith all the pension obligations and everything else. Although we'llget some expansion in production there, I guess it will not be verymuch. We are in a period of great uncertainty, particularly aboutwhat retail sales are going to do. I think plant and equipment[spending] is holding up fairly well. I feel more comfortable abouthousing than I did a while ago simply because interest rates are goingdown. I would comment that I don't have any particular quarrel withthe forecast, but I think we ought to put a good deal of uncertaintyaround any forecast. I would point out that the forecast level hasbeen successively lowered in recent meetings at the same time thatinterest rates have been declining fairly precipitously. We have alower forecast now for economic activity for the next year than we hadin August or in previous meetings, with interest rates 2 percentagepoints lower", " It was, but the near term--24-11/7/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But two forecasts ago we had a 5 percentincrease in the third-quarter GNP and we're now going to have 1-1/2 to2 percent. That's a difference of almost 1 percent [in level terms]in the estimate of one quarter's change. I think it was still higherin an earlier estimate", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It has been coming down by whatever theright amount is. In a perverse kind of way, maybe compared to thecomments that I heard from a lot of people earlier, I feel morecomfortable about the forecast this month than I did last month,partly because interest rates are down and I think the housingforecast is better based. We have the exchange rate at least movingin the other direction; we are not under the same pressure. We havehad some--it is so brief it is hard to tell--firming of commodityprices in recent weeks which is quite in contrast to the trend we hadfor several months prior to that. And we do have that surprisinglygood employment figure in services and retail trade in October, whichI don't understand.Last month I saw no danger, frankly, that we could overeasewithin the practical scope of whatever we were going to do. This timeI am not so sure. Beginning at the level of interest rates that wehave and given the feeling I have about the economy, I could conceivethat we would get overly enthusiastic in terms of easing, whereas Ididn't think that was possible last month. In terms of generallyposturing ourselves, I think we are in a far better position for avariety of reasons, given all the risks that exist, to not be too farbehind the curve in easing if that is the way things develop. That'spartly because we have the risks of the dollar; I would hate to haveto do a lot of aggressive easing in a situation where the dollar isalready declining more than one would like to see. I would rather bein a position where, if anything, we have the easing done and are in aposition to tighten up a little if the dollar does get in real troubleat some point. But in terms of our general posture, it's partly--andthe point has been made--that there is room, obviously, for theeconomy to grow more than 3 percent next year. I am talking about theprobabilities.The inflation picture looks under enough control so that Idon't think we have to worry about an explosion on that side apartfrom anything that would develop on the exchange rate end itself. Itis not a current concern but could be a concern almost at any timelooking to the future depending upon how things develop. And giventhe experience we have had, I don't feel any great sense of inabilityto prevent the economy from bursting out on the up side in theforeseeable future. If we had to tighten some down the road, so beit. I don't have the feeling that it would be an impossible job tokeep the economy from an unfortunate and overextended surge ofactivity if we faced that possibility rather than the opposite one ofcumulating excessive weakness in the economy, given all the risks anduncertainties that I see. And one factor I might mention in thatconnection is that in the rest of the world I still do not see manysigns of ebullient economic activity, to say the least. The Europeaneconomy still seems to me to be in a very sluggish phase. I guess thelatest information from Japan is not so bad, but it's on the slowerside rather than on the stronger side. And that has been the one-25-11/7/84economy that has been showing a pretty good rate of advance. Theproblems in the developing world are obvious enough.Where that all leaves us, I don't quite know. But I think wemay have room for a little more formal easing here if that's what youwant to do. But I don't know that we want to go overboard about it.I might say that in view of the monetary developments, I think theonly question in the past few weeks was whether we should have beeneasier and put in more reserves and reduced the borrowing level. Thereason that was not done was simply because I judged that the tone ofthe discussion and the instructions last time clearly reflected someconcern if interest rates--and the federal funds rate in particular--were to go down around the 10 percent level or below and other rateswere declining rapidly. There wasn't much eagerness for being veryaggressive, so we weren't very aggressive. In fact, interest ratesobviously did get to those levels and in those conditions it didn'tseem all that urgent. But I don't know that I personally had thefeeling that the interest rate developments were disastrously rapid interms of lower rates, given all the conditions. And I am not sure Iwould want to conduct a policy that I thought would actively back themup again as a deliberate matter of policy. But with that muchdiscussion, let us proceed", "MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I don't want to put too muchemphasis in our discussion on M1 in a single month, despite themagnitude of that surprise decline of 7 or 7-1/2 percent--I thinkthat's what I heard Steve say--in October. If it carries over intothis month, though, I think it deserves some weight given that thereare so many uncertainties from the real economy that we've all beensharing with one another here. It's so difficult to forecast not onlythe fourth quarter but the first and second quarters of next year whenI think there is a high probability of some difficulties. Yes, eventhe third quarter is still [uncertain]", "MR. ROBERTS. I would like to reinforce what Governor Martinsaid. I think we are testing our luck by having had no growth in M1for five months. And based on our inability to meet our past targetsfor M1 growth, I have no confidence that the projected November andDecember increases will occur unless we refocus our policy on reservegrowth instead of interest rates, which is what I think we should havedone. I think the reason M1 has not expanded is that we have beenwilling through our policy of targeting borrowing to resist thenatural market declines in interest rates that otherwise would haveoccurred. I noticed that the growth in total reserves and M1 from thefourth quarter [of 1983] to October are essentially the same, forexample. But in recent times we have had this precipitous drop inreserves. So my view would be that this is a time to effect asignificant easing and to accomplish a growth in reserves that willresult in a growth in money--without concern about the level of marketrates", " We didn't know how long that reluctance to borrow wouldcontinue and we certainly didn't want to take care of it in thedirective because then we would have ended up [targeting] the fedfunds rate more narrowly than I think--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. After hearing the discussion last month, Iwas almost tempted to raise the question on the agenda: Do you wantto target the federal funds rate. That is what most people seemed towant to do last meeting", "\"MR. MORRIS. Sure. That's precisely the point. If it'scoming from a strong economy and is expected, that's one thing. Ifit's coming from a deviant behavior on the part of the banks, that'sanother thing. It seems to me that our procedures ought to be able todifferentiate these", "MR. RICE. As has been pointed out several times here, we'veseen a good deal of easing since the last meeting. As a matter offact, the easing is just about the amount that I had hoped for at thelast meeting, so what has been taking place in the easing of policy isgetting very close to my comfort level. I think it is important notto allow short-term interest rates to fall too far too fast. In thissense, I share Bob Black's feeling of the need for some caution in therate at which we ease policy. Having said that, I think we have to dobetter than alternative B. I would hope for something between \"A\" and\"B\" and I am not uncomfortable as we move toward \"A.\" I would be veryhappy to go along with Tony Solomon's recommendation of borrowing at$600 million and adjusting the fed funds rate range down to 7 to 11percent and hope that the aggregates show some improvement", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We always got accused of the opposite", "MR. GUFFEY. Yes", "MR. PARTEE. That was why I asked that question. I justwondered whether there would come a point where you would want toclean up and call them off and say the year is over", "MR. PARTEE. My objection to leaving it the way it is isthis: It seems to me that either we make a mockery of having hadtargets or we have to ease an awfully lot more to get growth up to 6percent. How can you reduce it from 6 percent to 2-1/2 percent justbecause you have had a bad month. Paul's way of dealing with that atleast makes it understandable, I think", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. People are going to wonder why", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The critical figure will be the borrowingassumption. There we are dealing with a great deal of uncertainty. Ithink all these comments about the seasonal borrowing are relevant butalso I suppose it's possible that the seasonal borrowing will decreasenow that market rates are so low. We had an experience recently witha big bank waltzing in for a large amount of borrowing for no apparentreason. And if one or two big banks waltz in during a reserve period,that uses up all our borrowing here and we're left in a peculiarposition. We have a full range of proposals here--from $400 or closeto it to $700 million, which averages to $550 million", "MR. PARTEE.

I'm not very enchanted with the idea of solving thisproblem through automaticity. It seems to me that that would be astep backwards toward the kind of interest rate volatility we think wehave gotten away from. But I do think that in a situation where theManager finds that he cannot attain his total reserve path and at thesame time produce the assumed level of borrowings--which is the casewe had this summer--there is an incompatibility in the instructions to12/17-18/84the Manager and it ought to be resolved not in some automatic way butby having a conference call to the Committee. I suspect we may wellhave the opposite case in '85 at some point, with total reservesgrowing faster than the original projection because the Manager isjust pushing in nonborrowed reserves at an increased rate in order tomeet the borrowing projection. I would have the Committee decide--onthe basis of what is happening to interest rates, the economy, themoney supply, the exchange rate, and everything else--how we shoulddeal with this incompatibility in the instructions", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand that question. But I saythat at least once the Committee had a meeting and--for a while,anyway--said no. And the opposite happened this fall", "MR. BALLES. I would like to speak up in favor of some degreeof automatic response, as Steve set forth a good case for it in hispaper. In fact, the whole paper was a badly needed new look at ouroperating procedures in the sense of some general dissatisfaction bymany of us--with the benefit of hindsight now--with how the secondhalf turned out in terms of our money targets and interest rate levelsand similar matters. I would have to say, though, with respect to ourcurrent operating procedure or even the amendment to it that you areproposing, Steve, that I think we're still going to be subject to allthe weaknesses that we found way back in the 1960s with respect tofree reserves. Any given level of borrowing or any given level offree reserves is compatible with a wide range of interest rates, awide range of different economic outcomes, and a wide range ofpossible growth in the monetary aggregates. That's what weexperienced so many years ago. I'm afraid we're still working with atool that has those built-in disadvantages. So, while I personallywould be in favor of going along some sort of semi-automatic route ofthe type Steve described, I think we also ought to consider, as analternative to that, some semi-automatic targeting of nonborrowedreserves, which is after all closer to what we're really trying tocontrol--the monetary aggregates as our intermediate targets. Wedon't need to get back to a full automatic pilot. Even if we were togo back to nonborrowed reserves targeting, we could also introducesome semi-automaticity simply by making judgments as to the degree towhich the nonborrowed reserve path would be varied in response to adeviation of money from path. I'm pretty much convinced at this pointthat that kind of approach would be superior over the longer run thansomething hooked on the borrowing target. [The latter approach] mostrecently, as well as many years ago, has demonstrated the kinds ofweaknesses that concern many of us", "MS. SEGER. I admit to being confused--to make a generalstatement. The second thing that strikes me is that whether or not Ithink M1 is important, there are a lot of Fed watchers who do. So,maybe it's like gold: It isn't the theoretical matter but whether alot of people assume it's important that makes it important. It'shard for me to divorce the slowdown in M1 growth from the verydramatic drop in total reserves. And just hearing Jerry Corrigan'sremarks about the slowdown in the economy--that this is what producedthe M1 slowdown--it is as if the Fed had nothing to do with theslowdown. I think it is pretty hard to argue that either we hadnothing to do with the slowdown in the economy or the slowdown in M1.Also, I heard in the past couple of meetings concern about allowingthe fed funds rate to drop much because then we might have to retracethe steps and jerk the economy around and or jerk the markets around;yet when the funds rate shot up from 10-1/2 percent or so to 11-3/4percent, which did jerk the markets tremendously, I didn't hear thesame kind of concern. So, again, I don't know the answer to this, butsomewhere along the line I think we've got to make some changes", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Everybody is willing to impose judgment,so long as it's their judgment", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [It would] certainly go in that direction,but whether or not it's mechanical--. Who would put primary emphasison Ml", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not very happy with this proposal ofMr. Axilrod's. I'll tell you this: It's Mickey Mouse in my opinion.I don't see anything the matter with it, but it's trivial in a way.Let me give you two reasons why. I would point out that the moneysupply has been steadier when we depressed its importance and theautomatic responses we have given to [the aggregates]. Not so manymonths ago we were being praised by the monetarists for this new waywe had found to keep the money supply steady. I at least amsuspicious that it's not entirely accidental--that any reaction wemake to it of a sharp kind is after the fact and affects things with alag. And it may send things off in another direction. So you getsine curves instead of stability. Nobody has talked much about thefact that we are working with economic projections and I find, just asa pragmatic judgment, that the Committee puts tremendous weight onthem. The economic projections are consistently unreliable in termsof the ex post judgment that's made about what the satisfactoryquarter-to-quarter movement is in the economy. And I think that'sjust a fact of life; it's not that the projections are any worse thananybody else's. You can't project the economy quarter-to-quarter orhalf year-to-half year with a degree of sensitivity that is requiredex post to make everybody happy. That's another way of saying youcan't fine-tune on the basis of economic projections.I find the Axilrod approach--I call it the Axilrod approachthough he was responding to a request--a little narrow because it'sfocusing on whatever M, M1 presumably. Maybe the more relevantquestion, or at least as relevant a question, is whether we shouldn'tbe putting more weight on other indicators of what is happening. Wehave an exchange rate that in my judgment is wildly out of line withthe needs of this economy over a period of time. And it should havebeen telling us something for a long period. We've had commodityprices falling rather sharply for six months now, I guess, during aperiod when economic projections were pointing in quite a differentdirection. Commodity pricing didn't prove to be the worst economicindicator in the world. And it tells you something in that it makes apolicy difference as well. How well you do it in the first[unintelligible]. The only reason I would worry about the Axilrodproposal is that I wonder whether we'd be kidding ourselves by makingthis little automatic rule, if I may call it that, [and if] that wouldinhibit making discretionary changes. It is so minor in and of itselfthat it doesn't do much. And if the Committee sits around and says\"We have this automatic response mechanism so that's all we're goingto do\"--if that's the psychology of it--we may not be responding oftenor fast enough. I don't know whether it would work out that way, butI'd be a little suspicious", "MR. AXILROD. Yes", " But I don't think it wouldhurt a lot if we did have it in the federal funds rate--MR. CORRIGAN. Well, in the abstract that might be right.But on the basis of experience I see nothing that suggests that onecan disentangle the behavior of the federal funds rate from theseother short- and long-term rates. Now, in theory, they should be ableto be disentangled", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, yes. I'm by no means ruling out thatwith a monetary policy as ideal as any human brain can conceive, givenour knowledge, that we're still going to have variations in economicactivity. There's just no way that I could buy the argument that themain reason why we had this dramatic slowdown in the economy wasbecause of high interest rates in the spring. I just don't believethat for a moment. Some of it is; the decline in housing surely is.But [with] the increase in the saving rate of 1/2 percentage point or-23-12/17-18/84so in the third quarter, why would you so argue when consumer creditcontinues to grow. This tremendous drop in net exports surely can'tbe assigned primarily to the rise in interest rates in the spring.It's a much broader phenomenon there. We can't provide a perfectmonetary policy. There's no way", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We can provide a perfect monetary policyif you say we just can't provide a perfect economy", " I don't claim to--MR. BOEHNE. On the one hand, this is somewhat Mickey Mouseand, on the other hand, it takes us all the way back to 1979. I havea feeling that it's probably a little more than Mickey Mouse and notquite as dramatic as going back to '79. Whether one is for this oragainst it, it seems to me we're talking in extremes here", "]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One of the questions that arises [with]the kind of outlook you forecast for next year--whatever thereliability of that may be--is where the risks lie. And is itsatisfactory or does it itself imply that one ought to be going for ahigher or theoretically lower [outcome]. Where do you lean on policywith a forecast of that sort, if you believe it. It doesn't tell mewhat the risks are on one side or the other", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. The $6 billion increasescorporate profit", " I understand that, but Ihaven't heard a--MR. KICHLINE. No, we're agnostic in the forecast. Wehaven't taken a position. If you believed something were going tohappen along the lines of the Administration's proposal, I think therewould be an incentive to accelerate equipment purchases to get thefavorable depreciation and the tax credit. It's a bit risky on thestructures side. If you were into a standard tax shelter partnershiptrying to turn over commercial buildings, I don't know that you'd wantto touch that at all. Basically, it can cut either way. I would saythe overriding feature is a healthy dose of uncertainty. And that israther unhealthy in this environment. There is a lot of uncertainty", "MR. KICHLINE. That's what the Administration has said: thatthere would be liberal transition rules. Their own numbers, at least[based on] talking to them, [suggest] that in the aggregate theirproposals would raise the cost of capital about 10 to 12 percent overthe life of an investment. So, it's a substantial potential change", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But I think the people who are sayingthis have an ax to grind", "MR. KICHLINE. Well, it is very confusing. For example, Ibelieve the Administration's proposal is that [a taxpayer] couldn'tdeduct more than $5,000 above investment income for interest chargeson something other than a primary residence. What that really does isto induce people to take out big loans on their primary residence.And there are other incentives in terms of tax-adjusted returns, butthe proposal doesn't adjust the interest paid on a primary residence.In effect, that gives a primary residence preferential treatment andwill build in incentives to leverage highly that part of the market", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Coming back to the more basicquestion that I guess you asked: If you assume [3] percent realgrowth in '85, you said that the risks of deviating either on the downside or the up side are about even in your opinion. Isn't it truethat if there were a major change in the dollar, that would heavilyweight the risks on the down side", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. December will turn out to be lower unlessit's higher. That's about what that projection is worth", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just be clear. When you say you'recomfortable with the forecast, that means you're comfortable with itas a forecast. And is it also desirable", "MR. RICE. Although there are good reasons for expecting a 3percent rate of expansion next year, again unlike Frank and Jerry, Idon't see anything in the economy that's going to spark an expansionat a rate beyond 3 percent. It may be, as Frank suggested a momentago, that the recent decline in interest rates has been of such amagnitude as to stimulate further expansion. The decline of thefederal funds rate to around 7 percent, as we had today, is somethingI had not anticipated. And I'm sure the staff forecast is not basedon interest rates at these levels. So, one question is whether thefunds rate and other short-term rates should stay in the 7 percentarea or not. With rates in that area Frank may well have a good pointabout sparking a faster rate of expansion. But if they don't stayaround that level--if funds rates go back up to where they were a fewweeks ago or to the 8-3/4 percent rate recorded two days ago and theshort-term market rates associated with that go to 9 percent, I reallydon't see what is going to spark a faster rate of expansion. I don'tsee it in consumer expenditures; I don't see it in the variouscomponents of investment; I don't see it in net exports. I don't knowwhere it would come from.As the Chairman put it, if the staff forecast is about right,the question arises as to whether that is satisfactory. And my answeris that if that is absolutely the best we can do without inflation,yes, I would settle for a 3 percent rate of expansion. However, I'mnot sure that that is the highest rate of growth that is consistentwith low inflation. I'm not at all sure. My own inclination is totry for a higher rate. I'm not at all sure that 4 percent is a ratethat is consistent with low inflation; 4 percent growth may be toohigh and may result in capacity or resource pressures. But I think weought to try to pull for the highest rate of growth that is consistentwith low inflation and keeping the risks of igniting inflationaryexpectations very low. I think we're in a good position to do thatright now because the Federal Reserve has an unusual amount ofcredibility. And I think it's a time that we could use some of thecredibility in the interest of getting some further growth. To put itsimply: We can play it safe or we can take some risks toward moregrowth. I don't think the risks will be high. As a matter of fact,as I've already suggested, the moment we see some danger of capacityor resource pressures or wage/price pressures developing or the moment12/17-18/84we see some ignition of inflationary expectations we can and shouldpull back. Now, let me say that I'm simply trying to suggest anattitude we might take. How does this translate into policy. As Isaid earlier, interest rates have come down much more in recent weeksthan I had thought they would. I'm perfectly prepared, with interestrates at this level, to sit back and wait and see what happens and notpush them any further", "MR. PARTEE. Well, there are a lot of things out there in '85that are going to happen that we don't have any notion of today. It'slooking pretty far ahead and I think all we can do is go on the basisof central tendencies and realize that there will be many surprises towhich we'll have to react as the year goes on. I would say that as wego through the third year of expansion, I would have a presumptionthat the risks are on the side of falling short rather than going overthe rate of growth. As the expansion gets older it gets a little moredubious, a little more treacherous to continue to project that we willfollow along those lines. In particular, there are two things thatbother me about the outlook. The first--and I somewhat tentativelysubmit it to you--is that there has been a considerable incomeredistribution in the country both because of the tax changes andbecause of interest rates. As a result, I'm not sure that we cancount on the personal saving rate dropping as it does in theprojection. The staff didn't know why it went up, so they are puttingit back down again. But if I look around for a reason why it mightnot go down, it would be that this is becoming a society that is verydivided in terms of income results and wealth effects and that kind ofthing, and I would expect a higher saving rate because of the factthat a lot of people are prosperous. Now, that doesn't necessarilymean more consumer credit because I would submit that the people whoborrow are usually not the ones who have the wealth. They are theones who need to do the spending. And that makes me somewhatsympathetic to Preston's point that maybe housing won't do so well andmaybe automobiles won't do so well as the year goes on.The second and even more disturbing thing to me is the effectof net imports on the economy that we've seen this past year. Itreally has sapped the strength of the economic expansion as this yearhas progressed. The projection says net imports aren't going to go upmuch more and it could be right, but I really can't see that thesituation has changed. It seems to me that the rising tide of importsis just not in the process [of stopping] unless something happens tostop it; it's going to grow and grow more and that's going to sap thestrength of the economy as the year goes on. So my inclination,without having a specific forecast, would be to say that the chancesare, if anything, that we'll end up on the low side rather than on thehigh side of an inadequate forecast. The growth rate specified forthe year is inadequate. It's inadequate in terms of capacityutilization, which doesn't do a thing as the year goes on; it stays at-39-12/17-18/8482 or a little below 82, as I recall. And it's inadequate in terms ofthe kinds of stimuli we need in order to get increasing capitalspending. Profits aren't going to be doing much according to theforecast; markets aren't going to be improving. We're almost certainto have a gradual shutting off in the business investment expansionwith this kind of forecast. So, I think we ought to have in mind 4percent. I would have said 4-1/2 percent real growth from the fourthquarter to the fourth quarter. I think this kind of forecast is toopoor to come forward with, especially when we recognize that we mayfall short.I don't know about interest rates. I've given up forecastinginterest rates or even saying what they ought to be because there areso many variables in the equations. For example, someone commented--Ithink it was Jerry--that maybe inflationary expectations have changed.If they have, these interest rates aren't going to stimulate anything.We are going to [need] lower interest rates because [the currentrates] just won't bring forth the demand for credit to spend if peoplehave a lower expectation for inflation and, therefore, a loweranticipation of what they will realize in terms of profit payoffs orappreciation payoffs on the investments they have made. Therefore, Ijust don't know where interest rates ought to be. I've had thatfeeling now for some while and it has grown as the years go on. Thatreinforces my view that we really have to look at the monetaryaggregates, not interest rates, as what we hope to control. I'mtrying to remember to answer the Chairman's questions, although he'sleft the room. My view is that M1 ought to have primary importanceamong the monetary aggregates. That has been my view and there is nochange in it. I must say it was strengthened a little by Steve'sanalysis yesterday but I have felt that for some time and I continueto feel it. I don't know, but I suppose we have selective memories.Lyle can remember the times when M1 didn't tell us anything", "MR. PARTEE. --and somehow the latter times strike me asbeing more important. But we always have to be very careful in usingM1 because there can be--as there was, I think, in 1982--shifts in thedemand for money and we have to be sensitive to that. We don't wantto ride our money supply target without regard to what is happening inother elements of the economy or in other aggregates or credit or inmarket conditions. But among the aggregates I think it is the mostreliable and the one that we ought to put the most confidence in. Iagree with Pres that we ought to reconsider the long-range targets for1985. I'm inclined to think that we ought to put M1 growth back to 4to 8 percent as it was for this year both because we have room for 4to 4-1/2 percent real growth in the economy and because we've fallen alittle short. One way to make the adjustment for the base drift wouldbe to say \"All right, we had growth a little lower than we expectedthis year and we'll take a little higher growth next year if necessaryto bring about this 4 to 4-1/2 percent real expansion in the economy.I think that makes a lot of sense. And I don't think in that contextthat it would be taken as a backing away from our inflation fightingattitude; I think it would be quite acceptable.I also agree, and I've never said this before in a meeting,that we ought to pay considerable attention to the exchange rate and12/17-18/84we ought to do what we can to bring the exchange rate down. That alsowould suggest, other things equal, that when we can we ought to dothings in the money sector that are apt to produce somewhat lowerinterest rates. By \"other things equal\" I mean if lowering ratesisn't producing some kind of a calamitous result internally. I don'tknow whether it's going to bring the dollar down; certainly, it hasn'tso far. But I suppose the weight of the evidence over time is thatlower interest rates in this country might tend to do that. Iwouldn't say we should make the exchange rate the target of policy[unintelligible] or something like that, but I'm very disturbed aboutthis import situation. I think it's just going to have to be dealtwith. If the exchange rate does come down--remembering also that acharacteristic later on in periods of expansion is that we start toget more inflationary pressures--with lower exchange rates goingthrough the third year of expansion, it seems to me that prices mightbe on the high side of the staff forecast. I guess I'd be prepared tomake some price concession for getting the exchange rate down becauseI think it's that important a problem. I think I've answered all thequestions, so I'll end at that point", "MS. HORN. I believe the staff forecast represents what isprobably the most likely outcome. I'm still uneasy about the outlook,particularly for the next couple of quarters. The pause or the growthslowdown has been greater than I expected and greater than a lot of usexpected. In analyzing that, I came up with a couple of events thatin retrospect maybe weren't so surprising to me and a couple of eventsthat caused me to focus anew on some existing issues in the economy.The ones I put in the class of maybe being more [surprises of] timingrather than real surprises would be consumer spending and thedeterioration in the trade accounts. Those may well smooth out overtime. A couple [of developments] lead me to a new focus on oldissues. One is that I really do find surprising the extent to whichthe slowing in the national growth rate is represented in a stallingout of the economic recovery in the Midwest. To use the Ohio statenumbers as representative of the Fourth District, employment in Ohiohasn't risen all year and unemployment is now beginning to inchupward. If you look at business in our area, particularly heavymanufacturing, you see the marking down of expectations. They stillthink the national recovery is going on but they don't think it'sgoing to be reflected in their business, particularly in thetraditional capital goods area. So, they're focusing instead onexpansion of cost cutting and survival now.The second set of issues, which I find particularlyworrisome, are those surrounding the situation in the farming, mining,and energy sectors. I really see little in recent developments tosuggest the end of the income squeeze in these areas. Of course, notsurprisingly in that respect--because really only time will deal withthose problems--I think the time [will come] to write down some of theinflated asset prices from some of the decisions that were taken undera different set of economic [conditions]. But this remains a problemin many small towns and even some large ones in that we really don'tsee the spillover, if you will, of the national recovery even if we doexpect it to continue on at about the 3 percent rate.-41-12/17-18/84I have two comments specifically on whether I think the 3percent rate is adequate or not. I'd like to comment on both 1985 andthen a bit beyond that. I think probably there is room for more than3 percent growth in 1985; I might say 3 to 4 percent. But as we lookat the long-term trend of the economy and, therefore, at whatproductivity increases are likely to be, I'm one of those people whoare very impressed by some of the productivity stories I hear. Someof the remarkable cost-cutting stories and productivity changes thatwe have seen in our District are really very exciting. But they dotake time to have their effect and I think they take more investmentin order to have their effect, and the time periods can be significantbefore we really reap the full benefit of this. So, as I look beyond1985, I wouldn't like to place too heavy a bet on a really significantchange in the productivity numbers. For that reason, if we're talkingpublicly about something bigger than 3 percent next year, I'd like tobe sure we don't put ourselves in the position where that sounds likemore than 3 percent forevermore, because the forevermore numbers Itend to be more comfortable with are in the 2 to 3 percent range. Ithink if we get involved in more than the 2 to 3 percent range longterm, we're counting on a faster quickening of some of theproductivity improvements or we're counting on continued enormousnumbers of imports to mop up the large demand, and I wouldn't like tobe betting on those too far into the future. As far as the longer-term ranges, particularly the M1 range, as I look at them now they arenot unreasonable in line with what I just discussed", "MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I think the Board staff forecast isabout right in terms of the level of economic activity, but I wouldside very much with Pres and Chuck and Emmett on the risks on that,particularly concerning Chuck's last point. I am fearful that theforeign trade deficit is going to take a bigger bite out of ourproduction and employment than we probably have assumed. If there'sany risk, this strength of the dollar in the face of the narrowinginterest rate differentials has impressed me a lot and that's where Iwould think the main risk lies. I think Jerry made a very importantpoint on the inflation side in saying we ought not to be complacentabout an inflation rate of 4 percent. I remember that in 1971 whenPresident Nixon put on the wage and price controls that [level ofinflation] was serious enough to be a national calamity. By the sametoken, I think we can pretty well count in our own productive capacitythat which is abroad since we have such an open economy now that we'renot apt to hit bottlenecks quite as quickly; I think the threat offoreign competition and actual foreign foreign competition have beenone of the key reasons why inflation has not risen as much in thisupswing as some of us thought earlier that it would. Jim said aboutthe risk of inflation that he thought it would be less next year; Iwould guess it would be roughly about the same, but certainly lessthan I earlier thought it would be at this stage.On the long-run targets, I would come out about where Karendid and would leave those ranges unchanged. So far as the aggregatesare concerned, I'll take a page from Orwell's Animal Farm and say thatall aggregates are created equal but some are more equal than othersand I would emphasize M1 since I think it really, despite itslimitations, conveys more information than all the others do andcertainly more than any one of them does. To your fourth question-42-12/17-18/84about whether 2.9 or 3 percent growth is satisfactory or not, I thinkEmmett gave the appropriate answer when he said that that's fine ifthat's all we can get without inflation. Historically, our long-rungrowth rate has been around 3-1/2 percent and 3 percent would not bethat unusual at this stage of a recovery. But in the peculiarcircumstances in which we have found ourselves, I believe that weprobably could stand a little more than that. But anything muchbeyond 3-1/2 percent or so I think would spell problems for us downthe road.And to your final question about how this fits into the worldsituation: If we don't provide the impetus for expanding world trade,who is going to do it. I suppose that foreign economies look a littlebetter now than they did the last time we met but they still don'tlook very strong. So, I would expect we're going to have to carry thebrunt of that burden; and for that reason I would agree with Chuckthat we ought to take a little harder look at exchange rates this timethan we've traditionally done around this table", "MR. BOEHNE. Based on very recent information, it seems to methat, at least in my District, the retail situation looks a littlebetter. It's nothing to write home about but I suspect December mightturn out to be a touch better than November. The more interestingpoint, as we go out into 1985, is that I believe the risks are on thedown side from the staff forecast for two broad reasons: One is justthe anatomy of a recovery and the second is the level of interestrates. The point has been made in several different ways, but thereis an anatomy to a recovery; there is a rhythm to it. That rhythm isnot constant from one recovery to another, but it usually starts withhousing and moves into consumption and then it gets a kick frominventories and then investment and so on. To count on a big boostcoming from consumption in the third year of a recovery it seems to meis at odds with that usual anatomy and that usual rhythm. It might12/17-18/84happen, but I don't think it's a good bet. In the second area,interest rates, I think most of us around the table say that we've hada drop in interest rates, we've eased and we feel good, so why don'twe just wait. It takes a little time; we know there are lags here. Idon't think we have lowered interest rates as much as we think we havein terms of the impact on the economy. I think we have seen a biggerdrop in nominal rates than we have in real rates. I think we areseeing a downward adjustment in inflationary expectations and I thinkinterest rates are still very high. There is nothing about an 8percent Treasury bill rate or a little more that is particularly low.And if you look at long-term rates, [they are up] there too. So, interms of interest rates, I think we still have fairly restrictiverestraint on the economy.So, for both those reasons--the anatomy of a recovery andinterest rates--the odds favor a weaker economy than the staff hasforecast. I think those kinds of risks are unacceptable, and I thinkthe forecast that the staff has put together is unacceptable. I don'tthink 3 percent, or 2.9 percent, is acceptable to us. I have a hardtime selling myself on it. I think it would be even more difficult tosell that to the public or the Congress or to our friends overseas.So, it seems to me, we have a forecast that is unacceptable. Therisks are unacceptable and the policy implication is to try to have asomewhat more stimulative monetary policy to at least move us in adirection that we find more acceptable. I have trouble pinpointing anumber but with all the hazards it seems to me something closer to 4percent or a little over in terms of real growth would be a much moresalable outlook and policy target.As far as the other questions: On the long-term ranges, Imust say that my doubts about the ranges that we agreed to last Julyare on the rise. I'm not at this point prepared in an outright way toadvocate raising them, but I think at a minimum we should indicatethat growth would be at the upper end and perhaps exceed the ranges,particularly in the first part of the year when we get into theparallel lines and the cone business. But between now and February, Imay very well change my mind and come down on the side of raising theupper limit both as a way of handling the undershoot and as a way ofproviding some breathing room to deal with the risks. As far as theweighting of the aggregates, I have never loved nor hated M1. I don'thave any particular loyalty to it; I'm very agnostic about it. But itdoes seem to me that it has looked a little better recently. Theseweekly gyrations are certainly funny, but it seems to me that the casethat M1 is better than it was a few months ago is a convincing case,so I would put it first among equals. I would give it an extra bowcompared to the other aggregates. I, too, think--and I don't thinkI've even ever thought this let alone said it, Chuck--that theexchange rates and the commodity prices are telling us something. Idon't know what kind of weight to assign to this but when so manysignals in the economy are going one way or another and the aggregatesto some extent are giving mixed signals, it seems to me that in aworld with that kind of uncertainty there is information to be gleanedfrom the exchange markets and from commodity prices. And I think bothof them tell us that our interest rates are too high.As far as the operating procedures are concerned, I'm muchhappier with the way we have been conducting ourselves in recentmonths than we were a couple of years ago when we were in a much more-47-12/17-18/84mechanistic mold. It does seem to me that while we ought to carry onmore or less as we have been with some equal to primary importance toMl and looking at borrowings, I would not keep both eyes on borrowing.I would look over at reserve growth and if we get ourselves in asituation where reserve growth either shoots way up or begins to falloff, it seems to me that, too, would be telling us something. I'm notfor any formal modification, but I think we've got to look at bothsides of how we get at this--both reserve growth as well as borrowing.I think that's everything, or at least all you want to hear", "MR. GRAMLEY. If I were to write down a forecast today, itwould look very much like the staff's with about 3 percent growth.And I would agree with the staff's judgment that the risks are roughlybalanced as to whether or not growth would exceed that or fall short.So, I don't agree with Frank or Jerry in that respect. My thinkinghas changed over the past several months and I hope it's not becausethe news has been coming in rather poorly. I think the worst way toforecast is to assume that tomorrow will be just like today. We allknow that we can do a lot better than that. But some things have beenhappening that have affected my own judgments. The most important isthe fact that the drag from the international sector is turning out tobe a lot larger, a lot more pervasive, and a lot more persistent thanI had anticipated. And the second is the evidence coming in over aseries of months suggesting that the process of very rapid growth inbusiness fixed investment is behind us.Turning to the desirability of this forecast, I certainlywould agree with those who say that it would be much more desirablefor growth to come out on the plus side of 3 percent than on the minusside. And I say this less for domestic reasons than internationalones. Growth of 3 percent is still above my estimate of potential.It's also above the staff's estimate, which is why we make furtherprogress in reducing unemployment with this forecast in 1985 accordingto the staff. But I don't think a 3 percent growth rate issatisfactory from the standpoint of the international economy. Thereis just no evidence of any developing dynamism or cumulation of therecovery in Western Europe. And if our economy grows at 3 percent orless, I think the risks increase that maybe the international economygenerally is going to begin to stall, with consequences that I thinkare quite serious. Let me just say a word or two about the exchangerates. I think all of us want to see a lower exchange rate and Iassume we all mean a lower real exchange rate. We all know that it'svery, very easy to produce a lower nominal exchange rate. All we haveto do is dump out money in buckets and gin up double digit inflationand the exchange rate will fall. All we would have to do is signalthat we intend to do that and we would get some anticipatorymovements, I'm sure. But what else we could do from the standpoint ofmonetary policy to bring the real exchange rate down, I don't know.If we foster more growth in the U.S. economy, will that raise or lowerthe exchange rate. I'm not sure. We're told that one of the reasonsthe exchange rate is as high as it is is because the investmentprospects look so much better here than they do in Western Europe. Ifwe lower interest rates in the short run, will that do the trick.Well, we've done that in recent weeks, and lo and behold the exchangerate turns around and goes back up again--according to some arguments,at least, because holders of dollars figure that interest rates have-48-12/17-18/84reached a temporary floor and may turn around and go back up again.I'd like to know what to do to bring the exchange rate down, and Ithink there is a way to do it, but the policy lever is not in ourhands. It's in the hands of those who set fiscal policy. What do wedo about the desire for more growth than 3 percent. If I may take apage out of your book, Mr. Chairman, let me remind us all thatforecasts are often inaccurate. It may happen that we will get moregrowth than that 3 percent", "MR. BALLES. Is 3 percent enough. Probably not. Is 3percent likely to be what we achieve. I think my staff would agreethat that's probably the best we can hope for, given the presentcircumstances. The reason I take that view is that we do have some-52-12/17-18/84barriers to getting higher than 3 percent in growth. Just yesterdaywhen the huge current account deficit of--what was it.--$32 billionfor the third quarter was announced, the Secretary of Commerce againpointed out, to his credit, that the real cause of this strong dollaragainst the huge trade deficit was the federal budget deficit. Unlessor until something is done about that, I'm afraid we're pretty limitedin our ability to bring down exchange rates and to eliminate thatgreat source of distortion in our whole economy. I continue to feelthat we're not capturing what the whole problem of the U.S. economy isby simply distinguishing between a 3 percent versus a 4 percenteconomic growth rate for next year. There are sectors of the economy--and we're all aware of them--that simply haven't participated in theupsurge of 1983 and 1984 and prospectively for 1985. That's true ofmany kinds of agriculture--as has already been observed around thetable--most parts of the mining industry, and the whole forestproducts industry. And many types of manufacturing that eithercompete against imported goods or that rely heavily on export marketshaven't participated in this prosperity; they wonder where theprosperity is. There's so much I'd like to see done in the U.S.economy, but as several people have already observed--Lyle Gramleyamong others--we simply don't have all the variables under ourcontrol. And those variables have to do with the huge size of thefederal budget deficit for starters. That has been exacerbatedfurther, I'm sorry to see, by the tax reform proposal, which has nowplaced an additional element of uncertainty out there in the businesscommunity. I keep hearing, quite recently now from our own board ofdirectors, that greater uncertainty hangs over the outlook forbusiness capital spending and for certain parts of the housingindustry, especially second homes which, if this tax reform goesthrough, would lose some of the present tax benefits in terms ofdeductibility of interest. It's frustrating in other words, Mr.Chairman, to want to do better and to think we could do better than 3percent but to realize--which is where I come out--that we don't haveour arms around all the problems in the sense of having the controlsat our fingertips.In terms of what we ought to do on the ranges for next year,I am a strong believer in M1, as I think you all know, and because ofthe undershoot in M1 we've seen thus far this year I think there is apossible case for rebasing even though it has been very unpopulararound this table so far. Simply put, it would permit us to bringdown the ostensible range of monetary growth for next year becausewe'd be taking off from a higher base. That is, a 4 to 7 percentrange would be appropriate in my view only if we were to rebase. I'mconcerned by the fact that I think the drop in interest rates, which Iwelcome, will have the effect of reducing the velocity of money in1985. Unless we're prepared to offset that, we could have anunintentionally restrictive effect on the economy, as was the case toa much larger extent in 1982 when we were too slow to recognize whatwas going on in the very sharp drop in the velocity of money thatyear. So, if we were to stick with the fourth quarter as the base forranges for next year's monetary growth, I would certainly hope thatyou would make it clear in your testimony that we would aim for theupper part, if not the upper end, of that 4 to 7 percent range. Iwould be a little happier if we could rebase and have a higher takeoffpoint for the 4 to 7 percent. If we don't do that and we're going touse the fourth quarter of this year as the base, which now seems-53-12/17-18/84likely given the views already expressed, then I too would favor, assome others have, moving to a 4 to 8 percent range.With respect to the world economy, I just don't know how muchfurther we can go than we have already in encouraging strong economicactivity abroad [through] this tremendous surge of imports we've hadin the United States. That has been good for other countries; it hasbeen perfectly bad for a lot of our own industries. And I for one amgoing to start worrying more about the health of our economy at homein 1985, in view of at least the four major depressed sectors I'vealready talked about. I think there's a real limit on our ability todo something about bringing down those exchange rates and interestrates without some major risks of over-expansion on the monetary side.Coming back to what Jerry Corrigan and some others have said: That 4percent inflation outlook is not exactly the best of all possibleworlds; I'd like to see the inflation rate somewhat lower than thatover a period of several years ahead. I come out, bottom line, thatwhile I recognize all of these things I'd like to do, I'm afraid thatuntil federal finances get straightened out we're pretty much limitedin our ability to do what many of us would otherwise like to do", "MR. GARBARINI. Mr. Chairman, with regard to the forecast,the Board staff's analysis may very well be what we'll see next year.However, I believe the odds are somewhat more on the side of ashortfall. Why do I say that. Well, I guess we all have a tendencyto be parochial as well as having biases and in our District, althoughsignals are certainly mixed and this could be considered just a pause,I think we're seeing what was a relatively nice growth in employmentslowing considerably and at least two states have seen unemploymentbegin to rise. Also, while the tax proposal could easily cut bothways, in the short run it probably will have a tendency to causeuncertainty. And from our discussions with business people, theuncertainty is certainly leading to some inaction. With regard to thesatisfactoriness of 2.9 percent, I don't see it. I would prefer thatall my colleagues who think that it might be higher be correct. Ithink the 3 percent level is still not satisfactory.I am particularly interested in commenting on the operatingtechniques. I would certainly like to see M1 on an equal footing andwould have to say that I'd like to see it on the podium where it couldtalk to us. However, I would not leave it on that podium and let ittalk without paying attention to other things. In that regard, if Imay paraphrase the Chairman, I do not think it would be appropriate togive a Mickey Mouse signal by going to absolute weight on M1, if thatis not what is going to be done. And I don't hear around this tablethat that would be the case. I would say again that I believe itshould give us some great information.I share the concerns about the exchange rate and commodityprices, perhaps again [reflecting] parochial considerations in theMidwest. However, I am not sure that this body is in a position toeffect any real changes in that regard and any psychological changesthat we might see, if they were at the risk of inflation, I would notdo", "[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I may, I will make some preliminarycomments in reaction to the go-around this morning. Really, I justhave two. One is that I heard a lot of talk about getting the dollardown and there was a certain amount of talk that that may not be theeasiest thing to do. It worries me a little to talk too casuallyabout getting the dollar down, and I do think that we may have moredifficulties in the future than we have now with the dollar beginningto go down too fast. We have this basic dilemma of how to get thebudget financed, and we're going to have a big current account deficitno matter what happens for the next 12 months. Maybe to put it toostarkly, if we have a lack of confidence in the dollar, we're going tohave a real picnic in maintaining a decent level of interest rates ora degree of confidence in the inflation outlook in the next year. Ido think we have a problem internationally and much of it is of ourown making; and we have the disequilibrium in the budget. Perhaps thebest thing that can happen is along the lines of what Ms. Seger hassuggested: If there is a tendency for the dollar to decline, Isuspect that other countries will ease; and given that they haveenough room to ease, that might be healthy not only in their owncontext but if they expand a little more and have a little moreconfidence in their own currencies, that might over a period of timehelp to relieve the pressure on our trade position through greaterexpansion abroad and the dollar may come down in a healthieratmosphere. I simply am a bit sensitive to saying that it's anobjective of policy to get the dollar down regardless; I don't thinkthat puts us in a very good posture. I have no problem at all withthe view--and in fact I strongly believe--that the strength in the-57-12/17-18/84dollar gives us room to ease, all other things equal. And that oughtto be a factor in our considerations. In listening to most people, Iget the feeling there's more concern that growth will turn out alittle less than the staff has projected than a little more. Combinethat with a view that it would not be totally satisfactory even ifgrowth ended up precisely where the staff projected it, and it seemsto me that gives you a bias toward some degree of further easing.We've spent a long time discussing all these general problemsthis morning. Let me try to shorten the process now and see whetherI'm successful in that by suggesting something like alternative B sofar as those numbers are concerned. But I certainly wouldn't mindrounding them off, given a healthy skepticism as to whether we'regoing to meet any of these numbers anyway and how precisely we'regoing to meet them. Consistent with that--or maybe inconsistent withit as now written but I will assert consistent with that, particularlyif we're willing to see some greater growth than what we provide forhere, which I assume the directive will say--I would ease thepressures on reserve positions to the point of almost no pressure.Borrowing would be, let's say, on the order of $250 million. And I'dbe inclined to put down a federal funds rate range [of 6 to 10percent, which is] consistent with alternative A, since the currentrate is about halfway in between [the \"A\" and \"B\" ranges] now and I'mnot sure I'd want to contemplate the rate going up to 11 percent. Interms of the directive, without getting into the precise language, I'massuming some sentence along the lines of what we have in there now tothe effect that because of the shortfalls we've had, more rapid growthin M1--or we could say somewhat more rapid growth in the aggregatesgenerally--would be acceptable, particularly in the absence ofevidence of a strong rebound in economic activity and in view of thestrength of the dollar in the exchange markets. It would saysomething to the effect that we would accept more rapid [monetary]growth unless we saw the economy moving ahead more strongly--distinctly more strongly--than the projections suggest now, as long asthe dollar remains reasonably strong in the exchange markets. So, ingeneral terms, that would be a proposal to shoot at", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My argument is very simple. We've had aconstant shortfall all through the fall; we've consistently missed therelationship. And I didn't detect any ebullience about the economy inlistening to the discussion around the table, and people would rathersee it grow a bit faster than the projection rather than slower", "MR. BOEHNE. Either you have to give more attention to thereserve growth or you have to lower the discount rate to have anyadditional downward leeway, or both", "MR. AXILROD. Well, the fundamental [issue], I think, isone's view of the basic strength of demand for goods and services andinflationary expectations. Among the staff, views differ very widelyon that. If you view our judgmental projections and compare them withstraight model projections, things will differ. Our forecast implied,essentially, as Governor Gramley mentioned, velocity of about 1-1/2percent for M1 next year. That is something like trend, probably.Taken literally, that would mean very little change in interest ratesover the course of the year--maybe up a little or maybe down a little.If your view of inflationary expectations and demand for goods andservices is even weaker than the staff forecast, then I would thinkinterest rates, in a sense, would be lower than that. It seems to mevery difficult to come to a judgment at this point on whether they aregoing to go up or down", "MR. PARTEE. I would like to argue for 6-1/2 percent, Pres,because I do think that [7 percent] implies too much for January andFebruary. Unless something really happens here, we're going to have 4or 5 percent [M1 growth] in December, and if we say 7 percent for the3-month period, that implies something in the very high single digitsfor January and February and I think that's pressing too hard", "MR. BOEHNE. I think we need to push the ease button againand I think your approach is reasonable. However, procedurally, Iwould prefer our easing to be accompanied by a drop in the discountrate. While I think in this period we need to pay a little moreattention to growth in reserves, I think not to change the discountrate would shift the emphasis too dramatically. So, I would prefer tosee it accompanied with a drop in the discount rate just on proceduralgrounds and I would prefer rounding M1 up to 7 percent. It doesn'toffend me if December M1 growth comes out at 4 percent to have 8percent in January and February. That doesn't strike me as too muchmoney growth in light of where we've been", "MR. CORRIGAN. The way he was suggesting putting it in theoperative sentence was different. I thought you were saying, Mr.Chairman, put it in the sentence that is in capital letters on page12", "MR. AXILROD. Just as a technical comment, Mr. Chairman, noneof us is an expert on what the market is thinking, but it is not atall clear to me, under current market conditions--the way they werethe last two days--that a drop in the discount rate of 1/4 pointwouldn't be followed by some backup in market rates. It would beviewed as a disappointment relative to market expectations. I am notcertain where this complex of interest rates and borrowing would endup, but I would think it is possible that it could be 8 percent or ashade higher, depending a bit on how operations are conducted, as wellas the 8 percent or a shade lower that you suggested. It's just nottotally clear to me", " My point is simply that this factor is not anawful lot different than it was the last time and to insert the word\"substantially\" now when the forecast has been revised down from agrowth rate of 7-1/2 percent to 6 percent in real terms sounds likenot quite--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Use \"significantly\"", " I think if we say current information orinformation for current outlays and take out \"plans\"--12/17-18/84MR. PARTEE. It's the \"spending plans\" that's reallyconfusing", "MR. MARTIN. But what we're leaving out of the housingdiscussion is the considerable pressure by the central bank againstgrowth in mortgages and against savings and loan participation injoint ventures for builders--reserves and net worth requirementsagainst rates of growth. We've left that out entirely. The fundingis going to be a lot more difficult for the builder", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, next I want to say that I thought we weresupposed to be giving equal weight to M1 and M2 and I don't thinkwe're giving any weight to M2. In fact, the M2 path for the fourthquarter is substantially above what we decided it was going to be inSeptember and we're just throwing that out. Nobody is even talkingabout the fact that we had been expecting 7-1/2 percent growth and nowit's 11 percent plus. We ought to think about that. I think we oughtto ask ourselves whether or not some of the effects of the ease we'veput in are showing up in M2 instead of M1 and if that isn't just asgood in terms of what it does for easing conditions in credit markets.I don't think we have to go back to 8-3/4 percent on the funds ratebut I would like us to aim for somewhere around the 8 to 8-1/4 percentrange on the fed funds rate. I don't want to take back a lot of theease that's been put in, but I don't want to ease further. And Idon't know what borrowing number that would be associated with, but myguess is it would be around $325 million or thereabouts--maybe alittle less. That would be my prescription for policy now", "MR. GUFFEY. I don't know whether it's a contribution or not:I have no quarrel with your prescription on the aggregates but I doshare the concern about the $250 million borrowing level. To acceptit, one must accept the premise of the staff that $250 million is ator above the frictional borrowing level. I'm not at all convinced, inview of the extent of the seasonal credit provisions, that thatnecessarily is above the frictional borrowing level. If it is not, wecertainly will be establishing a federal funds rate, it seems to me,and I would accept Lyle's prescription that 8 to 8-1/4 percent isabout the correct range. I would like to have some assurance thatthat's what we're looking at if we're going to adopt the $250 millionborrowing level because I have a concern that if that level is belowthe frictional level, we'll essentially turn loose any control otherthan establishing the federal funds rate. In that connection, I'vejust observed that everybody is talking about a fourth-quarter growthrate in M1 that's very low. But if you are willing to believe that aseasonal adjustment factor might put as much as an additional 2percent in the second half, that together with some benchmarkrevisions could bring growth up in the 4 to 5 percent range for thefourth quarter, which would be quite acceptable. We may be pushingthe ease button a little before we have all of that knowledge. As aresult, I would prefer to see a discount rate decrease by the Board ofGovernors and then to establish a borrowing level at least above the$300 million range with the target being a federal funds rate in therange of 8 to 8-1/4 percent", "MR. GRAMLEY. Well, I don't want the fed funds rate to goanywhere near that level. I think we're going way too fast", "MR. PARTEE. That's the disagreement. It's really morefundamental, I think", "\"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I'm wondering whether that kind oflanguage wouldn't be less misleading somehow. \"The Committee seeks tomaintain the recently reduced pressures on..", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. \"...relative to the Committee'sexpectations at the beginning of the period, particularly in theabsence of evidence of a strong rebound in the economy and in view ofthe strength of the dollar in exchange markets.\" It would be moreparallel if we said \"particularly in the absence of evidence ofcontinued strength and--. It's the reverse; it's not the absence ofthe strength", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think the question remains whetherwe need either of the next sentences", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What are you suggesting here. That'scorrect. You haven't solved the next one. Mr. Axilrod has suggestedthat we combine the first two sentences. Go back to \"In theimplementation of policy in the short run, the Committee seeks toreduce pressures on reserve positions consistent with growth\" etc.That says, whatever figure we stick in there, we can go further if thegrowth isn't up to it. We haven't got much further to go. And wedon't need either of the [next two sentences]. Well, we could leavein the greater restraint sentence. We certainly don't need thesentence on lesser restraint; we've already said that", "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I can give you simpler wording for this:\"Somewhat more rapid growth would be acceptable in the light of...,provided economic growth remains sluggish and the dollar remainsstrong in the exchange markets.

Under 3", "VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.

That fact that there's nothing in thedollar situation that would prevent us from easing is one thing.Carrying an implication that we would tighten monetary policy if thedollar began to come off is another", "MR.
