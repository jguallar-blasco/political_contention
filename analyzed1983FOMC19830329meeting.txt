Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement stated in the passage. It simply explains how the Subcommittee typically operates and refers to the whole Committee for proposed changes.


Passage number 22.
MR. PARTEE. I was questioned recently by a CongressionalCommittee on this, in the environment of discussing the possibilitiesof bailouts of foreign countries. And I reassured them that weweren't going to bail out any foreign countries through the operationsof the Federal Open Market Committee. So, I wanted to be sure thatthere wasn't anything here that really would permit us suddenly tomove in and buy the Yugoslavian currency or the Chilean currency oreven the Brazilian currency--currencies that are not named on ourlist.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 23.
MR. TRUMAN. I think the answer to your question, GovernorPartee, is that an addition to that list of 14 currencies has to beauthorized by the full Committee. To the extent that the proceduralinstructions, which relate to the day-to-day operations of the Desk,[address this], there are some provisions such that if the fullCommittee can't be consulted there's a way of continuing to dobusiness. But I think, as common sense would suggest, that would beonly in cases in which we had ongoing operations and not somethingthat we were starting fresh.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing an explanation and expressing agreement with the idea that additional currencies need to be authorized by the full Committee.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a topic of conversation without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 28.
MR. GUFFEY. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not have any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement.


Passage number 29.
MR. PARTEE. Although the two happen to be the same listright now, I think. It's not exactly coincidental, but it'saccidental in the sense that there could be a different list.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their belief that the two lists are the same, but acknowledges that it is not necessarily intentional.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a requirement for prior authorization for activating a swap agreement.


Passage number 31.
MR. TRUMAN. No. The procedural instructions call foractivation of the swap by the Subcommittee if it's [less than] 15percent of the arrangement or $200 million. So, as a matter of theCommittee's procedures, that's what is called for. In most recentcases that I remember when the foreign country was activating theswap, as a matter of practice, the full Committee has been consulted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply explains the procedural instructions and past practices of the Committee.

Passage number 33.
MR. PARTEE. I just wanted to probe a little for the recordto see whether I got general agreement from people here that there'snothing to worry about. I think it's true also, Roger, that among theproblem countries the only one we have a swap line with is Mexico.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not exhibit any contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee is seeking confirmation or agreement from others regarding a specific topic.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the following passage without the passage being provided.


Passage number 51.
MR. BERNARD. My list may be a little out of date. When theinformal limit was $4-1/4 billion, at any rate, [the breakdown] was$2-3/4 billion in German marks, $1 billion in Japanese yen, and $500million in all other currencies. I don't know if that $4-1/4 billionwas increased or not.

MR. CROSS. It was increased to $5 billion last year and theGerman mark portion of that was increased to $3-1/2 billion. Now weare getting close to that $3-1/2 billion limit.

That limit is $5 billion, with the sublimits of $3.5billion in marks, $1 billion in yen, and $500 million in all othercurrencies.

MR. PARTEE. Well, the only reason these would be working upis because of earnings.

MR. CROSS. Yes, interest earnings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement made by Mr. Cross.


Passage number 62.
MR. PARTEE. I must say that in reviewing the material thiscame to my attention and I don't recall it ever being discussed by theCommittee. One could have presumed that when we received the earningson our foreign investments we would liquidate the earnings--that is,convert them into dollars. But instead, apparently we have neverconverted any of these earnings to dollars; we leave them in theforeign currencies. Is there some reason for that, Sam.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of observation and questioning without a confrontational tone.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 63.

Passage number 72.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do I have a motion on these.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply asking if there is a motion on a particular subject. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in the statement.

Passage number 79.
MR. TRUMAN. Mr. Chairman, the remainder being warehoused isentirely in marks and it's just under $1.1 billion. The timing ofthat warehousing agreement is such that it will be used to pay offremaining Carter notes--Governor Teeters, this is where the Carternotes come in--in May and June.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any specific contentions, disagreements, or conflicting views. It simply states the months of May and July.


Passage number 81.
MR. TRUMAN. May and July of this year. And then we wouldhave no more [foreign currency holdings] actively warehoused with theTreasury. On the other hand, it seemed to us and the Treasury, giventheir activities in other currencies--ones we'd just as soon not hold--and the fact that they do hold a certain amount of marks and Swissfrancs and yen in addition to what they've already warehoused, that tothe extent the Exchange Stabilization Fund might get into a liquiditybind it made sense to maintain this facility for that purpose.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage shows agreement as the speaker expresses their support and sees no reason for discontinuing the warehousing fallback as it is helpful for the liquidity of the ESF and has prevented potential problems for the Treasury.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a clarification question and does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 119.
MR. TRUMAN. As I remember, the report is agnostic orsomewhat ambivalent on this point [as is] the U.S. government itself.I was amused to hear President Solomon's response to that because Ithink when he was once [wearing] another hat he argued--and we didtoo--that interest on dollars that foreigners accumulate should be putinto the markets. Now, I think you can argue the economics of theissue on either side. Likewise, the question of whether it'sintervention can be argued on either side. My purist colleagues wouldsay that that is indeed intervention since the interest changes thenet asset position in foreign currencies.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing an update and asking if there are any objections or further comments.


Passage number 127.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I'd just remind the Committee that the lastchange in that standard authorization was made in 1974, when theCommittee raised it from $2 to $3 billion. I think the recommendationis logical. It seems to me, with longer intervals between meetingsand larger dollar volume changes in the typical factors affectingreserves, such as seasonal currency flows, that a change is in order.And I think this proposed change would reduce the frequency ofoccasions for going back to the Committee for intermeeting changes ofthe leeway but would still call the Committee's attention to reallylarge needs for change. In the past two years, for example, therewere 8 occasions when we came to the Committee for a change in theleeway. Had the leeway been $4 rather than $3 billion, there wouldhave been just 3, rather than 8, such occasions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is presenting their viewpoint and supporting it with logical arguments and examples.

Passage number 149.
 I don't know that they would--MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I don't see why under presentprocedures they wouldn't be able to settle a cash management bill thesame day. If I can just elaborate on this first point: This rulingfrom a lawyer sounds very open ended, but it has to be judged aninadvertent overdraft--something that arose despite prudent and properplanning.

Passage number 157.
MR. AXILROD. Mr. Sternlight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 158.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I think I speak for both Mr. Axilrod andmyself when I say I see this as a fairly close judgment call. Theactivity is of some use in implementing reserve objectives, althoughit's not really so critical that we could not get on without it. Atthe same time, we see the financial risks of continuing the activityas fairly low. By doing RPs only in paper regarded as "prime" by themarket and engaging only in short-term transactions with reputabledealers who are obliged to buy the paper back in a few days, theSystem incurs little risk in our view. Perhaps a more likely sourceof difficulty, though, is the possibility that we would be presentedwith paper that we had some reason to question. It could be awkwardto turn down a name that had previously been regarded as prime, lestthat very refusal escalate the questions being raised.If we were not now involved in doing RPs in BAs, I don'tthink I would suggest getting into the activity even if it did help ussomewhat in meeting reserve objectives. At the same time, given thatwe are occasionally involved, one must weigh the impact of withdrawalat a time when confidence in the national and worldwide banking systemis still fairly tender--though less so than last summer and fall.Withdrawal could be taken as a sign of lack of confidence in thebanking system and not merely a judgment that the activity was notessential in meeting reserve objectives or showing support to the BAmarket. On balance--acknowledging that it's a narrow rather than anoverwhelming balance--I'd favor retaining the authorization and sorecommend to the Committee. It should be recognized, though, thatunder a continued authorization, it may well be deemed expedient undercertain circumstances to continue accepting names that may be startingto come under some question, lest our refusal aggravate doubtfulsituations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of personal opinion and analysis by Mr. Sternlight.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 159.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have great doubt myself whether weshould continue this for a more underlying reason than anyonementioned: I think the bankers acceptance market has developed farbeyond what was technically thought of as a bankers acceptance in theyear [Congress] put in the Federal Reserve Act that we can deal inbankers acceptances. And I'm not sure we want to give this kind ofofficial endorsement to the market anymore. I don't feel stronglythat it should be done now. I think there's something to the pointthat withdrawal at the moment would raise questions in a rather tendersituation in the market internationally. So, I don't feel stronglyabout that. But I do think we probably ought to take an earlyopportunity to get out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses doubt and uncertainty about whether to continue endorsing the bankers acceptance market. They mention that the market has evolved beyond its initial purpose and questions the need for official endorsement. While they don't strongly feel it should be stopped immediately, they do suggest taking an early opportunity to withdraw from it. This indicates a lack of consensus or clear agreement on the matter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 160.
MR. GRAMLEY. How often do we engage in RPs in the BA market.Is this once a week, once a month. Is it with the kind of frequencythat if we were out for any significant length of time there would becommentary on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker is asking a question and expressing uncertainty about the frequency of engaging in RPs in the BA market.


Passage number 161.
MR. STERNLIGHT. We normally do it in conjunction with doingRPs on behalf of the System. When we have some temporary reserves toinject, we have the choice of whether to engage in RPs on behalf ofthe System or to just pass through to the market some of the foreign-10-3/28-29/83account temporary investment orders. It is done largely on the basisof the size of the need we have to put reserves into the market. Ifit's a fairly sizable need or we're going to do multi-day RPs, then wedo them on behalf of the System and we normally do them on acceptancesas well as Treasury and agency securities. I would say it works outon an average to be a few times, maybe two or three times, a month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward explanation of how temporary reserves are injected into the market.


Passage number 162.
MS. HORN. Would it be noticed if you did it half as much inthe future as you do now. Would that be commented on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Horn, is simply asking a question and there is no indication of any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 163.
MR. STERNLIGHT. It would be noticed if we did fail toinclude acceptances when we were doing RPs on behalf of the System.If we reverted to just leaning more often on passing through thecustomer RPs and less often on our own RPs--a modest change in thatdirection--I don't think it would attract great attention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing their perspective on a potential change in strategy and does not present any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 164.
MR. PARTEE. I want to agree with the Chairman. We have hadjust a massive increase in the issuance of acceptances relative to thecapital of the banks, which would be an occasion for saying: Allright, if this is going to be such a big market, it can operate on itsown without our doing RPs in it. In addition, we have the problem,which is not quite yet disposed of, of the risk participationacceptance. Now, that'll depend on the Board's definitions of terms,if I understand the matter correctly, and the Board has not yetdefined the terms on risk participation. But it makes it at leastpossible, depending on what the Board does, that we can have an awfullot of acceptances out with a bank's name with the indirect guaranteeof secondary banks. And I think we might get in a situation where,although we wouldn't ordinarily have any problem with the bank--let'sjust take for example Chase Manhattan--that if there were three timesthat many acceptances circulating with Chase's name because they haveparticipated out with banks like that one in Oklahoma City and others,the risk might indeed begin to cause us trouble. So, I can see thepossibility of an embarrassment, looking ahead, particularly with thisrisk participation question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with the Chairman and discussing potential concerns and challenges related to the increase in acceptances and risk participation.


Passage number 165.
MR. ROBERTS. Isn't the practical consequence, though, thatunder those circumstances the bank would come to the discount windowand give us the same asset and we would accept it for discounting andwe would still have the asset.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a hypothetical scenario and its practical consequence.


Passage number 166.
MR. PARTEE. That might well be, but in that case we have theadministrative possibilities of counseling with them that we don'thave when they do an acceptance in the RP market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply discusses administrative possibilities in different scenarios.


Passage number 167.
MR. ROBERTS. It seems to me that, psychologically, it's apoor time to [make a] break. At the moment it's still a high qualityasset and it gives us flexibility. I'd be for retaining theflexibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Roberts expresses his opinion and argues for retaining the asset for its flexibility. However, there is no opposing viewpoint presented in the given passage.


Passage number 168.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm for retaining it for the timebeing but it's not clear to me, aside from waiting until there's muchmore confidence in the banking system, [when and how to get out]. Ifyou were requested, Peter, to figure out a scenario to get out of thiswithin a year, what kind of strategy and what kind of rationale wouldyou adopt, assuming you knew you had a very healthy period of time inwhich to work your way out of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing different perspectives and seeking advice on how to proceed.


Passage number 169.
-11-3/28-29/83MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I'd probably suggest just announcing afuture date beyond which we would cease that activity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is making a suggestion without opposing or contradicting any previous statement or viewpoint.


Passage number 170.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What explanation would you give--thatthe market had developed enough that it didn't need this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "the market had developed enough that it didn't need this" is providing a possible explanation for a certain situation. It does not suggest any debate or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 171.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, I'd say that the market has matured tothe point that it doesn't warrant any vestige of Federal Reserveparticipation in it as a supporting arm and that it's of such modestusefulness in open market operations that that reason for staying withthe activity has distinctly diminished. And to provide an adjustmentperiod for the market, we can announce a date X months ahead beyondwhich we would not do it. I don't see a way to phase it out in step-by-step procedures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Sternlight, is expressing his personal opinion that the market has matured and no longer requires Federal Reserve participation. He suggests announcing a specific date in the future to stop the activity, rather than phasing it out gradually. The passage does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 172.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If we gave a substantial delay--Idon't mean a time limit of one month but, let's say, 6 or 9 or 12months--do you think there would also be some market feeling that wewere leery of this stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 176.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. My main concern is not that I'm leery ofthem but that they are not what they purport to be. They're no longerself-liquidating pieces of paper. Well, I am perfectly [willing] toput this off, given the surrounding circumstances. I think we oughtto come back to it in 6 months or so as one way of dealing with it.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is a disagreement in the passage. This can be inferred from the use of the word "feasible," which suggests that there is a difference in opinion regarding whether it is possible or practical to remove the two firms from the regular government securities dealer roster.


Passage number 180.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, we've been thinking about that, as thememorandum noted. My inclination is that as long as we're satisfied,as we have been, with the financial strength and so forth of thosefirms, I don't think I'd recommend discontinuing activity with them.But I think we would be very reluctant at this point to take up withany new firms that were active only in acceptances and not in thewhole range of government securities.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Sternlight's inclination and opinion on the matter.

MR. CROSS. [Statement--see Appendix.]Mr. Chairman, I would also like to get back to the questionof the possible increase in the limits on the currencies we hold. Thepresent limit is now $5 billion overall of which $3-1/2 billionrepresents maximum holdings of German marks. We are now at about$3.450 billion marks--in other words, $50 million below the DM limit.We're not going to run against that limit immediately, but with thecontinued receipt of interest earnings it would be appropriate toprovide some additional room for these earnings to accumulate. Iwould like to recommend that the Committee consider an increase from$5 billion to $5-1/2 billion for the overall limit and an increasefrom $3-1/2 billion to $4 billion for the DM portion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply recommending an increase in the limits on the currencies held.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That includes the second [renewals], Isuppose. Without objection that will be approved. Now, let me add to-13-3/28-29/83what Mr. Cross said. I think there is some possibility here with theweakening of the mark and a potential weakening of the yen--there'sconsiderable nervousness about the level of the yen and has been forsome time--of more willingness perhaps to intervene should that weakenfurther. I think we have a $500 million limit on the yen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their thoughts on the possibility of intervention in response to the weakening yen.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting ideas or opposing viewpoints. It appears to be a simple statement without any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 200.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think we have much leeway ineither of these currencies. Obviously, we have very little in themark. I think the yen is the more likely candidate for earlyintervention simply because [the Japanese] would not be surprised if[it did weaken]. I know they want to use their money; they don't useit because they're afraid of renewing the pressures on the yen. Andit's possible that we might want to intervene, if they did, if the yenin fact did weaken.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their thoughts and insights about the limited flexibility in both currencies and the possibility of intervention if the yen were to weaken.

MR. PARTEE. We want a stronger yen. All right. I got itreversed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement by Mr. Partee expressing a desire for a stronger yen.


Passage number 206.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This always gets confusing. It's weakerin number. We would like a yen that had a smaller number attached toit. So, I think this is a relevant question. I didn't realize wewere as close to the limit as we are in terms of marks but it'spotentially relevant with respect to the yen as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It appears to be a statement expressing confusion and a desire for a yen with a smaller number attached to it. The last sentence indicates the relevance of the topic to the speaker.


Passage number 207.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It still doesn't make any sense to meto take the marks that we get as interest and turn around and sellthem. Therefore, I don't see why it's relevant to his proposal, whichis to raise the limit in order to accommodate the interest that we'llbe getting in marks.

Passage number 211.
-14-3/28-29/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. All right. And I'm saying that weought to raise the limit because it doesn't make any sense to sellthem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it consists of a mathematical expression and a statement without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting arguments.

Passage number 216.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I understand the yen part but I'm not sureI understand the mark part. That's been pretty weak too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This is a statement of personal uncertainty and lack of understanding, rather than expressing disagreement or contention.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states a personal opinion and observation.

Passage number 249.
MR. CROSS. It has changed over the course of the day. Therehave been a number of days when these exchange rates have moved by,say, 1 percent. The mark got down to over 2.43 today. It closed at2.42-1/4 on Friday. The dollar in terms of DM got down below 2.433/28-29/83again. There have been a substantial number of occasions where the DMhas moved a couple of pfennigs or even more and the yen has moved by acomparable amount. So, a 1 percent movement in these rates is by nomeans unusual. And there have been a lot of periods when there havebeen substantially higher pressures. Throughout this period there hasbeen a considerable amount of volatility in these rates and aconsiderable amount of nervousness and unsettlement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating facts about the exchange rates and volatility in the market.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 250.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Under what circumstances would youencourage the foreign exchange Desk, Mr. Chairman, to make to you andthe Treasury a recommendation that intervention seems appropriate tous. Earlier we made that recommendation a few times when there hadbeen a very substantial weakening in a key foreign currency and theTreasury would then say: Well, let's wait a while and watch. And sothe opportunity would be missed. [Their] reaction might have beenthat if there's a further weakening, yes, we'll do something. But bythen there had already been a 1 percent or a 1/2 percent move and thenthere wasn't any further weakening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests disagreement between the foreign exchange desk and the Treasury regarding when intervention in the foreign exchange market is appropriate. The foreign exchange desk believes that intervention is necessary when there is substantial weakening in a foreign currency, while the Treasury wants to wait and watch. This disagreement has caused missed opportunities in the past.


Passage number 251.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That has been the story of our liferecently. It moves and we're ready and then it moves the other way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply describes the dynamic nature of the story of the speaker's life, which constantly changes direction.


Passage number 252.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But it would seem to me that we couldhave a prior understanding and a presumption that, if it were to movemore than, say, 1/2 point in 3 hours or more than a point in 4 or 5hours or overnight, we wouldn't wait for a further significantweakening--that only a few basis points move after that would besufficient to trigger it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is offering their opinion on a particular situation.


Passage number 253.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have a long history of trying to reduceit to arithmetic and I'm not sure at this stage that we can.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the possibility of reducing something to arithmetic, but there is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting statement mentioned.


Passage number 254.
MR. PARTEE. We don't know in advance what kind of news wouldhave brought that about. We wouldn't know what the news is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement expressing uncertainty about the kind of news that would result in a particular outcome.


Passage number 255.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In any event, we have a recommendation for$500 million, which I would support. I think the yen is moreproblematical. We could do $250 million as a gesture or we could donothing now and wait and see what is needed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing different options and expressing their personal thoughts on the matter.


Passage number 256.
MS. TEETERS. How long will the $500 million last you. Itdoesn't sound as if it would be a whole year even.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement seeking clarification about the duration of $500 million.


Passage number 257.
MR. CROSS. It would not be a large amount if our policy wereone in which there were more intervention; $500 million is not a largeamount if we're intervening with very much activity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that $500 million would not be a large amount if there were more intervention and a significant level of activity.


Passage number 258.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Certainly, it can last you. I don't thinkwe're going to become that aggressive all of a sudden. It presumablywill last you for a few days at the very least.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statements reinforce each other, expressing certainty that something can last for a few days or longer.


Passage number 259.
MR. CROSS. Oh, yes. And that would be time enough toconvene the Subcommittee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there would be enough time to convene the Subcommittee.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 280.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I could never figure out a formula forwhether it should be 1 percent more or less in a day. I have no doubtat all in my own mind that the yen at 270, or wherever the heck it gotto a few months ago, was too low and was greatly damaging to our3/28-29/83interest and theirs. I have no hesitation at all in pronouncing that.I thought so at the time and I think so now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The author states their belief that the yen being at 270 was too low and damaging, but there could be disagreement on whether this is the case or not.

 We're not talking about trying to set ayen/dollar relationship; we're talking about smoothing a movement inthe market so that we could--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.

The mention of "problemsof protectionism and a larger current account deficit" suggests that there are differing opinions on the potential effects of the mentioned process.

Passage number 284.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me hasten to say that I don't thinkwe're going to cure the basic problem by a little intervention. Butit's a gesture.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that a small intervention will not solve the basic problem, but still believes that it is worth doing as a gesture.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 285.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. [If you are] testing the tone of theCommittee's thinking, obviously, I would be in favor of raising it.But I didn't think that $250 million had very much meaning. There isa real need to move on the deutschemark because we're getting near thelimit with the interest earnings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating that they would be in favor of raising the tone of the Committee's thinking, but they do not believe that $250 million has much significance.

Passage number 286.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Although $250 million is not all thatmuch, Mr. Truman is correct that what we're basically talking about interms of intervention is $1-1/2 billion of leeway and that is morethan I suspect we will need in any short period of time.

Passage number 288.
MR. TRUMAN. Yes, I think that's what the Chairman'sarithmetic was. The $500 million plus [$250] million is $750 millionand times two it's $1-1/2 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply affirming that the Chairman's arithmetic is correct.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 289.
MR. PARTEE. How do we get times two.SEVERAL. Treasury.

Well, what is the overwhelming sentiment one way or another.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage.

MR. PARTEE. I would prefer not to until we can review thewhole question of intervention at the international level, which Ithink is going on, if I understand it. Am I right in thinking thatthere is still such a study.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.

Passage number 294.
3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. There is still such a study, whichwill be discussed in Williamsburg. What I'm saying is not apart fromthat in the sense that that's part of the background. But it couldwell arise before Williamsburg--like tomorrow.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 297.
MR. PARTEE. Well, my thought was that I didn't get a clearanswer to [my question on] this disorderly market test. It sounds asif maybe we're changing the test some on why we would intervene, inwhich case it seems to me we really ought to consider what the issuesare and to what extent it ought to be the Federal Reserve and to whatextent the government ought to be directly the intervener [under] adifferent policy. I just don't feel very comfortable with it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: cannot attend the meeting tomorrow due to a scheduling conflict.

 Yes, there's not very much--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We had a full-dress debate on this in1980 and we continued the policies that we had been following jointly--the Treasury and the Fed--in terms of trying to slow theappreciation of the dollar. And we got up to $8 or $9 billion inforeign currency holdings by the time the current Administration camein and [intervention] was brought to an abrupt halt. Even thoughthere had been some incidental comments on that at various meetings, Iguess we haven't had a full-dress discussion. In deference to Chuck'sview, why not schedule one for the next meeting.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests a logical time to have a discussion and proposes moving on to another topic in the meantime.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 319.
MR. PARTEE. If we're going to be talking about doingsomething considerably larger here, which seems to be in the wind, I'minterested in the question of how much we could reasonably do withoutusing these foreign currencies to collateralize Federal Reserve notes.That's an ancillary issue that I'd like to have investigated becausethere must be some limit. We've collateralized, as it happens, ourcurrency with foreign currency something like 138 times. And thatneeds to be examined too so that we know what we're getting into if weconsiderably expand our effort in this sphere.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 323.
 You uncovered anoverpowering interest--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I have a premature question. If thefed funds rate continues at around 8-3/4 percent, am I correct inassuming that it's rather unlikely that the prime rate would move upbut that if it were to go to 9 percent the prime is likely to move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement followed by a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 324.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, as I mentioned, that spread betweenthe prime rate and the rate on CDs or other things that I think theprime tends to take its cue from has gotten relatively narrow. Ithink it's at the point that would very likely call for a move.Obviously, as the funds rate moves up and other short-term rates moveup, at some point a prime rate move would very likely be kicked off.I think the whole set of public policy considerations that banks willlook at will play a role here. I'm just guessing, but if funds got upto around 9 percent or somewhere in that area--maybe more toward 9-1/4or 9-1/2 percent--there probably would be very strong pressures forthe prime rate to move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing their opinion on the likelihood of a prime rate move based on the spread between the prime rate and other rates.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 327.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where is the CD rate now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply poses a question about the current CD rate without expressing any disagreement or contention.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker is asking for clarification about a decision without expressing any disagreement or opposition.


Passage number 332.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I think that was part of the background.I'd say this came about just in the day-to-day implementation when wehad discussions on our morning conference calls or with senior Boardstaff. I don't know whether Mr. Axilrod wants to add any comments onthat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 333.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I will speak for myself to the extent thatI was involved. Yes, because of a stronger business picture andstrong aggregates [I had the view that] if we were going to make amistake, it'd be better to make it on that side than the other side.Also, I think in terms of free reserves we were overshooting on theliberal side earlier--inadvertently, but there it was. We need amotion to ratify the transactions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their own perspective and reasoning for their decision. They mention their view and their belief regarding overshooting on the liberal side, but there is no indication of any opposing viewpoints or arguments.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage is a statement and a question asked out of curiosity. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this passage.


Passage number 343.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Zeisel, would you like to respond tothat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a question asking Mr. Zeisel if he would like to respond to something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 344.
MR. ZEISEL. CCC has had a tendency in the last 3 yearsapproximately to rise very, very sharply toward year-end, much morerapidly than it had historically. And that's one of the problems inthe sense that if it had been going on long enough it would be in theseasonals and it would be damped. But as it stands, we have tended toget these huge payouts in the fourth quarter and then a smaller rateof payout in the first quarter for the last couple of years, and thishas tended to distort the numbers. This will be less of a factor nextyear. But for the time being, it really does distort.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is pointing out a problem or issue with CCC's tendency to rise sharply toward year-end, which has distorted the numbers. This indicates a disagreement or contention with the current situation.


Passage number 345.
MR. ROBERTS. Would it be fair, therefore, to conclude thatfinal sales weren't really as strong in the fourth quarter and aren'tas weak in the first quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is asking for a fair conclusion based on the given information.


Passage number 346.
MR. ZEISEL. They've been running about 3 to 3-1/4 percent inboth quarters. So, it's fairly moderate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply provides a factual observation about the growth rate being moderate.


Passage number 347.
 It suggests that--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do you mean final sales have been running3 to 3-1/4 percent leaving out this factor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply asking for clarification and confirmation about the meaning of a statement.


Passage number 348.
MR. ZEISEL. Leaving out CCC.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Zeisel, is simply stating that something is being left out.


Passage number 349.
MS. TEETERS. What about the next quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply introduces the topic of the next quarter without expressing any conflicting opinions or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 350.
MR. ZEISEL. Leaving in other components of government,however--just taking out CCC.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Zeisel, suggests the removal of the CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) while leaving other components of the government in place. This implies a differing viewpoint or disagreement with the idea of keeping the CCC.


Passage number 351.
-23-3/28-29/83MS. TEETERS. But didn't you say this morning that there weresome influences on that final sales number from net exports also.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states a statement made by someone in a conversation.


Passage number 352.
MR. ZEISEL. Oh, there are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 353.
MR. TRUMAN. Not between the two quarters, though.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that there is no disagreement between the two quarters, indicating agreement or consensus.


Passage number 354.
MR. ZEISEL. Well, it changes the pattern. If you excludenet exports, you'd get a slightly larger deceleration, but it doesn'tchange the fundamental picture. Excuse me, final sales excluding netexports were about 4 percent in the fourth quarter and about 3-1/4percent in the first. So, it's in the same ballpark, I suppose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact and providing some additional information.


Passage number 355.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you're right [that] it is clearlya distorting factor in trying to trace final sales. Any otherquestions or broader comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage shows agreement and acknowledges the validity of the previous statement.


Passage number 356.
MS. TEETERS. At this point you have just the month ofJanuary on inventories, don't you. So, you really have no feel yetfor what February and March are doing on inventory liquidation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact about the lack of information on February and March inventory liquidation, there is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 357.
MR. ZEISEL. No, we don't really. This is a forecast andit's a forecast based upon the fact that the inventory level in realterms has been reduced to at least, or actually below, pre-recessionlevels; it's extremely low. The inventory/sales ratios have beenbrought down considerably. There are indications in some very keysectors, such as automobiles and steel, that the end of liquidation isat hand and they're beginning to build a little. And these factorsare sufficient to indicate that we've just about run the course on ourinventory liquidation. We have some liquidation actually in the totalcontinuing for the next several months, but the rate of liquidationdecelerates considerably and by the end of the second quarter is nolonger a factor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and making a statement based on their analysis of inventory levels and trends in specific sectors.


Passage number 358.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What assumptions with regard to thetrade deficit and the current account deficit underlie yourprojection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a question asking for the assumptions underlying a projection. It does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 359.
MR. TRUMAN. We are assuming that the trade deficit thisyear, Mr. Solomon, will be on the order of $35 billion dollars.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement simply presents an assumption regarding the trade deficit for the year. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 360.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's the current account.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "That's the current account" is simply stating a fact and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 361.
MR. TRUMAN. Excuse me. The current account is $35 billionand the trade deficit--that's a wrong number here--is about $65billion. They are rising by $20 billion approximately next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply correcting a wrong number and providing information about the expected increase in the current account and trade deficit.


Passage number 362.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Both.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 363.
MR. TRUMAN. Both.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Truman has expressed agreement with both sides or perspectives of a certain issue.


Passage number 364.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The only way that you factor theextent of recovery abroad into your domestic projection is through thetrade account.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 365.
MR. TRUMAN. I'm not sure what else you would have in mind.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 366.
-24-3/28-29/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, I'm not sure myself. I wasjust wondering.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty and wondering about the given numerical expression.


Passage number 367.
MR. TRUMAN. As far as GNP, that's largely it--well, theexchange rate too, and prices. Price is more generally ininternational trade prices.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a list of factors that affect international trade prices.


Passage number 368.
MR. ZEISEL. Well, the exchange rate too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about contention or disagreement regarding the exchange rate. It is a simple statement without any conflicting views.


Passage number 369.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What are other people forecasting for thetrade balance.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply asking about the forecasts of other people for the trade balance. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 370.
MR. TRUMAN. Most outside forecasts, although there are somein the range that we're in, tend to be in the $20 billion range forthe current account. I misspoke again, excuse me. The [trade]account forecasts tend to be in the $20 billion range. There are somethat are as high as ours.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker acknowledges that there is contention or disagreement among the forecasts for the trade account.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 371.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's fair to say--you can correctme if I'm wrong--that your depressed outlook for the current [account]has not been matched by developments so far. You were predicting abigger deficit than materialized in the fourth quarter and potentiallyin the first quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that they may be corrected, implying that there is a differing viewpoint or interpretation of the data.


Passage number 372.
MR. TRUMAN. Well, the fourth quarter in fact was a $24billion current account deficit; we had forecast somewhat higher, Ithink, but not more than $2 or $3 billion dollars higher than that forthe fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Truman, is providing information about the fourth-quarter current account deficit.


Passage number 373.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It was $34 billion in the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement of fact regarding the amount of money in the fourth quarter.


Passage number 374.
MR. TRUMAN. It was $24 billion in the fourth quarter of lastyear, at an annual rate. At one point we had forecast somewhathigher--I think $25 or $26 billion--for the fourth quarter of lastyear. The figure that came out was a bit lower. What came out was alittle higher than even we had forecast at the last meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is just providing information about the forecasted and actual figures for the fourth quarter of last year. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 375.
MR. KEEHN. Could I ask about capital goods. I think youindicated that as we get further into recovery you expect animprovement. But with the level of capacity utilization where it iscurrently, when would you expect this to occur. Is it an '83 event orare you thinking about later.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is asking a question about a specific topic and seeking clarification. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 376.
MR. ZEISEL. It's an '83 event. Breaking it down intoequipment versus construction--that's important because they arereally in different phases--we expect a recovery in purchases ofbusiness equipment to start very shortly, within the next quarterroughly. Looking back at past relationships between purchases ofbusiness equipment and production, there tends to be something like aone-quarter lag there. Typically, it starts with purchases of trucks,cars, office equipment--off-the-shelf kinds of items. But we have arather moderate turnaround occurring. On the nonresidentialconstruction end of things, we expect weakness to continue throughout'83 and then relative stability in '84.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting a perspective on the expected recovery in purchases of business equipment and the projected weakness in nonresidential construction.


Passage number 377.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do the figures show weakness currently incommercial building--not the new orders figures, the actualexpenditure figures. Are they coming down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply asking a question and seeking clarification on the figures related to commercial building expenditure.


Passage number 378.
3/28-29/83MR. ZEISEL.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage appears to be a date and a name, without including any statements or arguments that could suggest contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 379.
 Well, there was a one-month jump in January--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The phrase "Well, there was a one-month jump in January" suggests a contradictory or unexpected change in the given situation, leading to possible disagreement or discussion.


Passage number 380.
MR. ZEISEL. Up. But the vacancy rates on commercialbuildings have been rising and are quite high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states a fact about rising vacancy rates on commercial buildings. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 381.
 And we feel thatthere's a fairly long digestion time involved, given--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. There's no evidence yet in the actualspending figures of a downturn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It presents a statement about the digestion time involved in a downturn, and mentions that there is currently no evidence of it in the spending figures.


Passage number 382.
MR. ZEISEL. Well, the January spending figure was up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the January spending figure being up.


Passage number 383.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, it was up. Were there any previousmonths that were down appreciably.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "Yes, it was up" is a direct answer to a question and does not involve any opposing viewpoints. The second part of the passage is not provided, so it cannot be determined if there is any disagreement present.


Passage number 384.
MR. ZEISEL. There was a flattening out, an indication thatthey were weakening. But there was not a sharp decline, no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement made by Mr. Zeisel does not contradict or challenge any previous information or statements.


Passage number 385.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How would you change this forecast if thetax cut were rescinded or if there were another more or lessequivalent tax increase before the end of the year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is asking for a hypothetical scenario to consider, but it does not express or imply any disagreements or contentions.


Passage number 386.
MR. ZEISEL. I think the initial response might well be inconsumer expenditures, in terms of the effect on disposable income,[which might tend] to damp the growth somewhat. The longer-termresponse is, of course, a function of changes in attitudes and marketperceptions of the implications of these changes. I think they wouldbe positive over the longer run, but I do think the first responsewould be to slow down the recovery somewhat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the initial response to changes in consumer expenditures and the longer-term effects. They acknowledge that the initial response might be to slow down the recovery somewhat, but they also believe that the longer-term response will be positive. There is no conflicting viewpoint or disagreement expressed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 387.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Stop the recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is likely to be contention or disagreement in the statement "Stop the recovery." This phrase suggests that there is a disagreement about the ongoing recovery process and whether it should be halted. Without further context, it is unclear what "recovery" is referring to, but based on the statement alone, it implies opposing viewpoints and potential conflict.


Passage number 388.
MR. ZEISEL.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to answer yes or no as the given passage "MR. ZEISEL" does not provide any information or context to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 389.
 Well, that would depend on how large--MR. TRUMAN. [If the] third stage is dropped.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is conditional and open to interpretation.


Passage number 390.
MR. ZEISEL. Oh, the third stage alone. No, I don't thinkso. The third stage is not really that big. As it stands now we'retalking about something in the neighborhood of a net effect of about$30 billion at an annual rate for Q3 from that alone. I don't thinkthat would undermine the growth momentum overly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Zeisel is expressing his opinion about the size of the third stage, but there is no clear opposition or conflicting viewpoint stated.


Passage number 391.
MS. TEETERS. The jobs bill that just passed will show upwhere--in state and local purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 392.
MR. ZEISEL. That would be mostly in the form of transfersand, therefore, will show up in state and local purchases.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply states what will mostly show up in state and local purchases.


Passage number 393.
MS. TEETERS. And is the new increase in the gas tax devotedexclusively, as in the past, to highway construction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the gas tax being used for highway construction.


Passage number 394.
MR. ZEISEL. Well, that gets a bit obscure; I think there isa promise that a good deal of it is so dedicated, but I don't know ifall of it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Zeisel is expressing uncertainty or lack of knowledge about whether all of "it" (the thing being discussed) is dedicated.


Passage number 395.
MR. PARTEE. Mass transit takes some of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is not contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a simple statement made by Mr. Partee about mass transit.


Passage number 396.
-26-3/28-29/83MR. ZEISEL. Mass transit, yes. It's not a big item in anyevent. Wait a minute. No, I'm sorry that's the bill that's[unintelligible]; the jobs bill is not so big.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker first states "Mass transit, yes." indicating agreement with the concept of mass transit. Then, they correct themselves and say "No, I'm sorry that's the bill that's [unintelligible]; the jobs bill is not so big." This statement does not express disagreement, but rather provides clarification about the size of the bill.


Passage number 397.
MS. TEETERS. But between the two of them it's $10 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that between two unspecified individuals, the amount is $10 billion.


Passage number 398.
MR. ZEISEL. The jobs bill is $4.6 billion over a 3-yearperiod: it reaches a maximum in 1984 of about $3 billion ofexpenditures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement merely presents the information about the cost and timeline of the jobs bill without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 399.
MR. BOEHNE. How sensitive is your forecast to interestrates. The underlying assumption, I gather, is about constant orperhaps a slightly downward drift in rates. How much of a backup inrates do you think this forecast could stand before the cumulativemomentum would be affected seriously.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question and explanation about the sensitivity of a forecast to interest rates.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 400.
MR. ZEISEL. That's an interesting question. We don't have avery vigorous forecast and it's already in a sense damped byhistorically high interest rates, particularly in real terms, whateverthat means. Further movement in that direction could well have asignificant effect on attitudes; it depends on the degree, I think.It's one of those extremely difficult questions to answer becausebusiness attitudes are likely to be very sensitive at this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that it is an interesting question and difficult to answer because business attitudes are likely to be very sensitive at this time. This suggests that there may be differing opinions or uncertainty regarding the effect of further movement in interest rates on attitudes.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 401.
MR. BOEHNE. Well, just an observation on that: Thereclearly is a recovery and attitudes are clearly improved, but it'smore because people have seen business go downhill or be completelystalled for so long that even a modest lift from the very deep holethat they're in makes them feel a good bit better. But I think thisincreased optimism is very sensitive to interest rates. It seems tome that it wouldn't take much of a backup before this optimism couldturn around rather sharply and even turn to some pessimism.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that there is a recovery and improved attitudes, but also expresses concern that this optimism is dependent on interest rates and could quickly turn to pessimism if interest rates rise.


Passage number 402.
MR. PARTEE. There's nothing mild, Ed, about the increase inresidential construction and the turnover of used properties, both ofwhich have increased much more sharply than we would have expected--[more than in] previous recoveries, I think the staff has said. Itmight be that that would be shut off by a point rise in interestrates. I don't know. But that has been a very strong recovery tothis point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and uncertainty about the potential impact of a point rise in interest rates on the strong recovery in residential construction and property turnover.


Passage number 403.
MR. ROBERTS. Of course, that's financed by long-term money.The best way to hold that rate down is to avoid changing inflationaryexpectations and that gets to our discussion, I'm sure, of the rate ofincrease in money. Mr. Chairman, I'd like to go back, if I may, to apoint you were making about the July tax cut. An area I'm curiousabout is what is happening at the state and local level with regard totax increases. I keep reading that state after state is raising taxesbecause of deficits, so I guess a big deficit there is changing to alower deficit, which is going to take something out of the spendingstream. Have we any figures on that from the staff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing information and requesting figures from the staff.


Passage number 404.
MR. PRELL. I don't think we have. There is a cumulative taxincrease of note going on. It's probably several billion dollars thisyear in total, which doesn't loom large necessarily against the kindof tax cut that's going to occur at the federal level, but it issubstantial. Clearly, many state governments have run through all ofthe surplus funds they had and are having a drain in spending as well-27-3/28-29/83as an increase in their taxes, so that we're getting an unusually weakcyclical contribution from the state and local sector in thisforecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the cumulative tax increase and the impact it has on state and local sectors.


Passage number 405.
MR. CORRIGAN. The state and local [situation] is even worsethan the numbers suggest because, for example, a large number ofstates don't even have their state pension plans anywhere near fullyfunded. They've been living off that to the tune of billions ofdollars. And at some point they not only have to raise taxes but oneway or another have to replenish those pension arrangements, and Iwould imagine for the 50 states as a group we're talking about anenormous sum of money there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 406.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Do we have any overall information aboutwhat is going on in state and local government employee compensationtrends.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a question without any opposing viewpoints being presented.


Passage number 407.
MR. ZEISEL. On wage rates do you mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The person is simply asking for clarification on the topic of wage rates.


Passage number 408.
MR. MARTIN. Well, we have some information from the resultsof the surveys that we do for the setting of compensation levels inthe Federal Reserve Banks. In some of those surveys state and localcompensation is included.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage simply states that there is information from surveys that include state and local compensation. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 409.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's pretty fragmentary.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "That's pretty fragmentary" does not express any sort of contention or disagreement. It simply describes something as being incomplete or lacking in coherence.


Passage number 410.
MR. MARTIN. That's pretty fragmentary, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin is simply stating that the information provided is fragmented or incomplete.


Passage number 411.
MR. ZEISEL. The BLS does collect state and local data--witha fair lag, but still the data are available. Unfortunately, I'm notreally familiar with what they've been showing recently.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating that the BLS collects state and local data, although they are not familiar with what the data has been showing recently.


Passage number 412.
MR. MARTIN. Back on interest rates: I noted in that fairlynew survey of commercial bank pricing of their various deposits a 25basis point backing up in the rate on money market deposit accounts.Is that unexpected. Is there some particular factor that caused thatturnaround in the pricing of that instrument.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question about the unexpected change in interest rates on money market deposit accounts.


Passage number 413.
MR. PRELL. This is news to me, I must confess. It couldsimply be sampling errors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges that the information is new to them but also considers the possibility that the issue could be attributed to sampling errors.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 414.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What's this--a higher rate on money marketaccounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is likely contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of the phrases "What's this" and "higher rate" suggests that the speaker is expressing surprise or questioning the situation, indicating a potential disagreement with the idea of a higher rate on money market accounts.


Passage number 415.
MR. MARTIN. It's up 25 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage is a direct statement of a fact and does not involve any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 416.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I see that some [depository institutions]in New York are getting more aggressive again. They're paying 9.50percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is simply stating an observation about certain depository institutions in New York becoming more aggressive in their payment rate.


Passage number 417.
MR. MARTIN. Why is it a sampling error when it goes up andit's just good information when it goes down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a straightforward question asking for an explanation of why something is considered a sampling error when it increases, while being seen as good information when it decreases.


Passage number 418.
MR. PRELL. A 25 basis point change might not be somethingsignificant in terms of the aggregate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a neutral fact about a potential change and its significance in terms of aggregate.


Passage number 419.
3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it seems to be going up according tothe newspapers in New York. Is there any sense that it's going upelsewhere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating information from the newspapers and asking if there is any additional information or confirmation from elsewhere.


Passage number 420.
MR. MARTIN. Yes, the national survey, which is a very largesample stratified by bank size, had a 25 basis point backup. That isthe reason I'm questioning it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is simply stating a fact about the national survey and expressing his reason for questioning it.


Passage number 421.
MR. PRELL. Is this our survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and does not involve differing opinions or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 422.
MR. MARTIN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 423.
 No, the Money Market Monitor, or whatever thatnew commercial--MR. BOEHNE. It has it by sections of the country.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The mention of "or whatever that new commercial" implies that the speaker is unsure or dismissive of the Money Market Monitor.


Passage number 424.
MR. MARTIN. It has it by sections of the country. Itdoesn't look like very hard data but, anyway, it did go up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Martin is simply making an observation about the data without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 425.
MR. MARTIN. You've seen that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting or opposing ideas.


Passage number 426.
MR. BOEHNE. Yes, I've seen it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Boehne is simply stating that he has seen something.


Passage number 427.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It has pretty good figures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is subjective and does not suggest any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 428.
MR. MARTIN. Yes, it's up 25 points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Yes, it's up 25 points" does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a simple agreement or affirmation.


Passage number 429.
MR. PARTEE. It's a rather large sample, as a matter of fact.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the sample size.


Passage number 430.
MR. MARTIN. It's a large sample.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement about the sample being large.


Passage number 431.
MR. STERNLIGHT. They're doing it keyed to something likewhat the money funds pay; that has crept up a bit as market rates havecome up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Sternlight, is simply stating a fact about how the interest rates have increased.


Passage number 432.
MR. BOYKIN. We're looking at 7-3/4 percent versus 7-1/4 or7-1/2 percent a couple of weeks ago. But it's not close to 10percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states different interest rates without any conflicting opinions or statements that indicate disagreement.


Passage number 433.
MR. BOEHNE. For the money market accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
This passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It is a statement by Mr. Boehne about money market accounts.


Passage number 434.

Passage number 435.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But it's up a little.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a neutral statement.


Passage number 436.
MR. ZEISEL.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Unable to determine without further context.


Passage number 437.
 The question is--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but your question is not complete. Could you please provide the full passage you would like me to analyze for contention or disagreement?


Passage number 438.
]MR. PRELL. That would be less than market rates in general.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the rate mentioned would be less than general market rates.


Passage number 439.
MR. ZEISEL. Yes, rates in the market have been moving up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that rates in the market have been moving up.


Passage number 440.
MR. BOYKIN. Either that or I'm in the wrong bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Boykin is simply stating that if something is not as he expects it to be, then he must be in the wrong place.


Passage number 441.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, who has a case they want to make fora markedly different business forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.   This passage is simply asking if anyone has a different business forecast. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 442.
MR. CORRIGAN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: cannot seem to make up his mind about which car to purchase. One day he is set on getting a practical and fuel-efficient sedan, and the next day he is convinced that he needs a flashy and sporty convertible.


Passage number 443.
 I won't make the case, but---29-3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, wait minute. Mr Guffey was ahead ofyou.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 444.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, I'm not sure I'm going to respond to that;I don't want to make a markedly different case. I just would like toobserve perhaps the obvious that has already been touched on. What wehave seen and have described as a recovery is largely driven by thetwo interest-sensitive sectors of our economy, autos and housing. Andto the extent that interest rates move up appreciably from this level,that quite likely could kill off the recovery. In other words, therecovery that's being projected is very fragile. I just note that oneof the comments made concerning the outlook was that [the staff]expects business spending on equipment and exports to increase tosustain this recovery, and each of those areas is as fragile or asuncertain as anything we can tie it to. I really think this is a veryfragile recovery. There's no question of recovery, but [in] autos andhousing it's the rundown of inventories that has made the numbers lookpretty good in the last 2 months or perhaps 3 months. That can goaway pretty quickly with any increase in rates--maybe even to thelevels that we're now experiencing. The reported increase in the fedfunds rate, for example, and the upward pressure that may exert--theprime could go up--could be very devastating in my view to thisrecovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Guffey, argues that the recovery is fragile and could be killed off if interest rates increase. He expresses disagreement with the idea that the recovery is secure and highlights the uncertainty and fragility of the business spending on equipment and exports sectors.


Passage number 445.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 446.
MR. CORRIGAN. I'm not about to make the case myself but Iwill at least report that at our board of directors meeting last weekI think I can fairly say that our directors were more bullish thanthey have been at any point since I've been at the Bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply reporting the sentiment of the board of directors at a recent meeting.


Passage number 447.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's not a--SPEAKER(.). 2-1/2 years.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact.


Passage number 448.
MR. BLACK. It's been pretty bad the whole time you've beenthere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply reflects the speaker's observation or opinion about a situation without expressing any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 449.
MR. CORRIGAN. Clearly, their comments [conveyed] atremendously different atmosphere. Some of that does reflect what Mr.Boehne spoke about--just the fact that it was so bad that if thingsbegin to look at all better it sounds a lot better than that. But Ithink housing has an awful lot to do with it. The thinness ofinventories in the retail sector in particular is something thatpeople cite, and to some extent there's a little glimmer of hope inthe agricultural sector because livestock prices are a little betterand people are feeling a lot better because of the PIC program, eventhough it's recognized that that's not going to mean much until welldown the road. The other thing that is more or less compatible withthat is that a significant body of my colleagues in my researchdepartment also take the view that the economy is in fact a lotstronger than some of the numbers now suggest at current interestrates. I think they pretty much take the view that if long-terminterest rates in particular were to go up at all, the fragility thatMr. Guffey speaks of could be manifested in a hurry. But in theframework of current long-term interest rates, a number of thosepeople are really quite bullish. I myself have not quite bought intoall of that yet, but I do think in the framework of roughly the-30-3/28-29/83current level of rates that the prospects for the economy performingalong the lines of the staff's forecast or maybe even a little aboveit are quite good. But, again, I certainly would agree that anynumber of things could unravel that in a hurry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 450.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: This question cannot be answered as there is no passage or context provided.


Passage number 451.
MR. GRAMLEY. I don't know that I would want to argue that myown thinking is radically different from that of the staff's, but Ithink the time has come when we have to wonder whether or not thisrecovery might not be gathering more steam than we've realized up tothis point. I can make a case for a significantly higher rate ofincrease in GNP, I think, along lines like this. If we look back atthe past two quarters, in the fourth quarter to the first quarter wesee an increase of private final purchases on the order of 3-1/2percent at an annual rate--a little less in the first than in thefourth quarter--and this is just in the process of going intorecovery. That's what we are getting before we have the effects ofthe tax cut hitting in the second half of the year and before we havethe beginnings of a pickup in business fixed investment, which we allexpect to happen at some point or other. Now, the staff forecastdoesn't have a sustaining of the recent pace of advance in privatefinal purchases, partly because it's expected that we're going to geta big drop in net exports in real terms and also because residentialconstruction is not going to contribute as much as it has in therecent past. The staff may be right. But there is a tendency, Ithink, for final sales to gain momentum as a recovery proceeds; andthat could happen again.The second fact is that I'm very, very much uncertain aboutwhat we ought to be forecasting for inventory acceleration during thecourse of this year. When I talk to people out in the field they tellme: Boy, those shelves are just bare so that if you get a dollar'sworth of orders at the consumer level it just goes right back throughto an order for a manufactured good because there's nothing [on theshelf] to sell. In fact, if you look at the statistics, you'll findthat in real terms we've had the biggest drop absolutely ininventories in this recession than in any since 1949. And that tendsto confirm the bareness of the shelves argument that we hear fromqualitative comments. We don't have what I would consider a normativeratio of inventory investment to GNP in real terms until we get out toabout the end or the middle of 1984, when we get inventory investmentup to about 1 percent of GNP. It could happen sooner than that. Wecould easily get an increase of as much as 1 percentage point in realterms above what the staff is forecasting at present levels ofinterest rates for 1983. If that happened, the momentum is going tobuild still further. I don't know whether this is really going tohappen or not, but my guess would be--and we talked about this at theBoard meeting this morning--that the risks at this juncture are moreon the high side than they are on the low side of our staff forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present an explicit disagreement or contention. It describes the speaker's thoughts and uncertainties about the current and potential future state of the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 452.
MR. MORRIS. Mr. Chairman, I think it's a little too early tohave any convictions as to how strong this expansion is going to be.We have two sets of numbers, January and February. The Januarynumbers at face value looked very good, but probably the seasonalfactors made them look better than they were. The February numbers ingeneral were quite disappointing. If we're talking about triggeringorder books, they weren't triggered in February; the orders numbers in3/28-29/83February were really quite disappointing. Again, that may reflect thefact that the January numbers were inflated. But certainly, the rangeof numbers for February on retail sales, on personal income, and onnew orders would have to be viewed as on the disappointing side. Ithink we need another month of data to shake this out; I'd like to seea little more of that inadequate inventory phenomenon showing throughin the orders. It's not there yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Morris, presents a cautious view on the strength of the expansion based on the January and February numbers, suggesting that the January numbers may have been inflated and that the February numbers were disappointing. He advocates for waiting for more data to form a clearer picture. This differing perspective from the prevailing optimism is a source of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 453.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: cannot coordinate economic planning because he lacks the necessary expertise in economics and finance.


Passage number 454.
MR. WALLICH. It seems to me that fragility is almostinherent in this kind of expansion and one should not be too surprisedto see that. The sectors that can move up at a time like thistypically are interest-sensitive; that is, housing and automobilestypically start up at this time since they've become very much amatter of interest rates. So, to find that those are the areas thathave been moving the economy more strongly than others is notsurprising. It doesn't seem to me to suggest that it is fragile inany sense other than that other previous expansions have been fragile.If we had all the other factors moving right now--if consumption weremoving forward on a broad base, if we weren't losing from exports, andif inventories were turning around strongly--we would have a verybooming situation and that wouldn't be conducive to sustainability.So I think as far as we've gone, with rather limited impulses, we'vedone quite well. We should be concerned about the possibility ofexcess [spending] as well as the possibility that it might weaken. Idon't think fragility is a particular warning at this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply offers their perspective on the current state of the economy and does not cite any opposing viewpoints or engage in debate.


Passage number 455.
MR. MORRIS. Certainly, Henry, in terms of the financialstructure, we have a greater fragility than we've ever had before.That is one area, and a very important area, where we have morevulnerability built into the system than we've had before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Morris, acknowledges that there is greater fragility and vulnerability in the financial structure than before.


Passage number 456.
MR. GRAMLEY. Are you talking about the thrifts or theinternational situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely asking for clarification on whether the conversation is about thrifts or the international situation.


Passage number 457.
MR. MORRIS. I'm talking about the quality of debt, domesticand international. If we do abort this recovery, I think we would endup with financial strains of a sort that we would find very difficultto handle.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Morris is discussing the potential consequences of aborting the recovery, but there is no mention of differing opinions or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 458.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I might just assert, on that point, that Idon't think the international strains are getting any less and theyare a little more disguised. They will get worse. Basically, thereare more countries unable to pay--I'm looking for a polite term. Andthe ones that have been attempting adjustment for some period of time--I think with the exception potentially of Mexico which has now beenhit by the oil situation--have not yet shown a turnaround. There isno confidence returning to that picture in a basic sense. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion about international strains and the financial situations of certain countries.


Passage number 459.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I always feel very uncomfortablewhen I make a forecast on anything. This whole Committee ought tofeel uncomfortable because I think if you look at our Humphrey-Hawkinstestimonies, most of the time the majority has been wrong.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Black, is expressing his personal discomfort with making forecasts and suggesting that the entire committee should feel the same way. He supports his statement by referring to past instances where the majority has been wrong in their testimonies. However, he does not directly challenge or contradict anyone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 460.
 There isusually somebody who is right each time, but--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You managed to get right outside the rangea good part of the time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there is usually somebody who is right each time, implying that someone manages to be correct most of the time.


Passage number 461.
-32-3/28-29/83MR. BLACK. --the one who is right usually differs frommeeting to meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Since the passage does not discuss any specific topic or issue, there is no contention or disagreement apparent.


Passage number 462.
MR. PARTEE. That's the trouble.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a single statement made by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 463.
MR. BLACK. That's right. And that's why I feel veryuncomfortable. I hasten to add that that is why I have less and lesssympathy for discretionary monetary policy too, but that's anotherissue. But I'm very much in sympathy with the points that Lyle made;my guess would be that this is going to be front-end loaded a littlemore than the staff has projected. It does follow a deep recession,and historically deep recessions usually have been followed byrelatively fast recoveries. We've also put out a lot of liquidity inthe economy. It's also at this stage historically that most peoplehave underpredicted the amount of economic growth. And I think theswing toward optimism, though certainly it may well be fragile, hasbeen the most abrupt swing that I can remember. It may be becausepeople were so fearful it wouldn't come at all, but it seems to me tohave been more abrupt than it has been in the past. I thinkbusinesses are unusually lean now and if we do get any kind of pickup,profits ought to rise more rapidly than most people think and againought to help the outlook. So, my guess would be that growth is goingto be a little faster. Like Lyle, I think the error may be on theside of [the staff forecast] being slightly lower than what reallywill occur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the points made by Lyle and expresses their own beliefs and opinions on the projected economic growth.


Passage number 464.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context or information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 465.
MR. KEEHN. I can even report a better attitude on the partof the Chicago directors at our meeting about 10 days ago. They weremore positive in their outlook than they've been since I've beenthere, and it's really a very surprising change. A lot of it comesfrom the agricultural side through the PIC program, in which theparticipation is becoming very heavy. I think that has changed theattitude in the agricultural sector very dramatically.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that there has been a positive change in the attitude of the Chicago directors, particularly in the agricultural sector.


Passage number 466.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A little inflation makes people feelbetter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "A little inflation makes people feel better" is presented as a general observation or assertion without any opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 467.
MR. KEEHN. In fact, whereas our original guess was that thePIC program wouldn't have any effect [until] 1984, we now have thefeeling that we will see some effect from PIC this year. On thecautionary side, though, it may be darkest before the dawn but thepeople I talked to still say that the capital goods side is very, verysick and they don't see any near-term outlook for an improvement.That is why I asked the question about capital goods. On theinflation side, I have just a word of caution there: We are beginningto see increases in prices of some of the basic commodities like steeland nonferrous building materials. It's not so much that the pricesthemselves are going up, but the discounts that had been offered verybroadly as we were going through a difficult period are beginning tobe eliminated. So, I think we can expect to see some increase on theprice front as we get into this recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing their updated thoughts and observations on the PIC program, the capital goods side, and inflation. They offer some cautionary notes and potential concerns but do not express any disagreement or contention with others.


Passage number 468.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This is because the phrase "Governor Partee" does not provide enough context to determine any contention or disagreement. Without more information, it is not possible to determine if there is any disagreement regarding Governor Partee.


Passage number 469.
MR. PARTEE. I want to make a case for the staff forecast asa good working premise for the Committee. I think it's possible, as3/28-29/83Lyle suggests, that we could have a little stronger recovery, probablyled by housing. That could give us maybe a half point or even a pointmore in the real GNP increase, but it's still certainly well withinmanageable territory. But I also am impressed that it could be alittle weaker than the staff forecast because the financial fragilityis really pretty deep and it could affect our export numbers if infact the Latin Americans buy very little from us in the course of thisnext year. It also could affect, more adversely than the staff hasforecast, the commercial construction projection because I do thinkthere's a very serious overbuilding problem occurring, particularly inoffice buildings, but to some extent in shopping center andhotel/motel complexes and things of that sort too. Now, the thingabout office buildings and big commercial centers that they share incommon with foreign situations is that they involve an awful lot ofdebt; and in both cases an awful lot of the debt is held by banks. Itseems to me that we may have a very conservative lending attitude onthe part of financial institutions for more forthcoming deals for thenext year or so and that could hold back the recovery some. So, Icould see the outcome being below the staff projection by as much as apoint and I can see it being above the staff projection by as much asa point. Therefore, I think the staff projection is a good workingdocument.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 470.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How much are our exports to Mexico downpercentage wise in the past year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply presenting a question and seeking a factual answer; there is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 471.
MR. TRUMAN. Oh, it's more than 100 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Truman is simply stating a fact, expressing that the situation is more significant than initially thought.


Passage number 472.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It can't be down more than 100 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "It can't be down more than 100 percent" is a fact and can be universally agreed upon.


Passage number 473.
MR. TRUMAN. It depends on which number I use as a base.Exports to Mexico in the fourth quarter of last year were at an annualrate of $6.8 billion dollars and in the fourth quarter of 1981 theywere at an annual rate of $17.6 billion. So it's more than $10billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage provides information about the increase in exports to Mexico over a specific time period. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 474.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Two-thirds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "Two-thirds" does not express any disagreement or contention. It is a factual representation of a fraction.


Passage number 475.
MR. TRUMAN. More than one-half.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any sign of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 476.
MR. PARTEE. That's a lot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contradictory or conflicting statements. It is a simple statement by Mr. Partee without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 477.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I was talking to a Mexican centralbanker and I was beginning to think I didn't hear him correctly. Hesaid their exports in the first quarter were 15 percent of what theywere a year ago.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 478.
MR. TRUMAN. That is possible, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply acknowledging the possibility of something.


Passage number 479.
MS. TEETERS. Exports or imports.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 480.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Imports. I'm sorry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage because it is a simple statement expressing an apology for something related to imports.


Passage number 481.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I began thinking afterwards that he hadsaid 50 but maybe he did say 15.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a personal reflection where the speaker is unsure about what someone else may have said.


Passage number 482.
MR. BLACK. Is that from us, Mr. Chairman, or all imports.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage provided does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply contains a question posed by Mr. Black to the Chairman.


Passage number 483.
-34-3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is because it only includes the name and title of a person, Chairman Volcker, without any additional information or statements that could indicate disagreement or contention.


Passage number 484.
 It's their total imports, but they get abig--MR. TRUMAN. I was thinking that probably the right number is50 percent of the imports of a year ago. The first quarter a year agoour exports to Mexico were $15 billion. So, something on the order of$7-1/2 billion at annual rate is probably right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is rather a statement and an estimation of the right number.


Passage number 485.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That says, though, that it went up from[the fourth quarter].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is simply stating a fact about something increasing from the fourth quarter without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 486.
MR. TRUMAN. Slightly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any form of contention or disagreement. The word "slightly" suggests a minor or negligible difference, which does not imply any conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 487.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's not possible, I wouldn't think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing their opinion or belief that something is not possible, which does not necessarily indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 488.
MR. TRUMAN. Well, the fourth quarter had October, November,and December in it. I'm almost surprised that they were in[unintelligible] in the fourth quarter of last year.SPEAKER(.). Financed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and there is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 489.
MR. TRUMAN. We financed $700 million in that quarter; halfof it would have been CCC-related in the fourth quarter of last year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement of fact.


Passage number 490.
MS. TEETERS. What about other South American countries, Ted.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I cannot answer yes or no to this question as the passage provided does not include any information about contention or disagreement regarding other South American countries.


Passage number 491.
MR. TRUMAN. I don't have that with me here as such, but forother developing countries our exports dropped by $3 billion on thesame fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement of a fact or statistic.


Passage number 492.
MR. CORRIGAN. How many billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement or question asking for a quantity.


Passage number 493.
MR. TRUMAN. $3 billion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states "MR. TRUMAN. $3 billion" without providing any additional context or details.


Passage number 494.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't think any of them have tightenedup the way Mexico has in this time period. That may still lie aheadbut they haven't done it yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal belief that Mexico has made more progress in tightening up compared to other countries in the given time period. They also mention that there may be more progress to come in the future, indicating a possibility rather than disagreement.


Passage number 495.
MR. TRUMAN. Exports to Mexico were essentially financiallyconstrained; they weren't letting in anything in that period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply presents a fact about exports to Mexico during a specific period, without any conflicting viewpoints or opinions.


Passage number 496.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They weren't in the first quarter either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage because it simply states a fact about a previous time (the first quarter) without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 497.
MR. TRUMAN. They probably were somewhat more in the firstquarter than they were in the fourth quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement of fact about the increase in something during different quarters.


Passage number 498.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, the passage you provided is incomplete. Could you please provide the full passage so that I can determine if there is contention or disagreement?


Passage number 499.
MR. MARTIN. I'm not surprised at the numerous positivecomments in the Redbook or those that we've been sharing with eachother. As far as the businessman's attitude is concerned, I think weneed to separate his or her little burst of optimism here from theprobabilities of their obtaining the results they're talking about.Partly their attitudes are those of survivors. And as survivorsthey're looking at ways to increase their market share over thecompetition and they have good probabilities of doing that. I thinkwe may be discounting a little in the forecast the shape of the curvethat we have reviewed with regard to profitability. The increase in3/28-29/83profitability projected a few quarters from now and for next year isvery great indeed and that, of course, not only affects the externalfinancing of the business sector but gets good old Keynesian animalspirits going again. And once the profits begin to come rolling inwith some modest recovery, with the middle management cutbacks and thelayoffs and so forth that have trimmed some of these organizationsdown, you get a positive effect on inventories, you finally get apositive effect on the computer-related or so-called tech kind ofpurchases in the equipment area. But I think we have to keep our eyeon the probability of these attitudes not materializing. In housing,I am at a point of eating my words. I was hopeful that the mortgagelending institutions of our world, particularly the thriftinstitutions, finally would have learned something and as the MMDAscame in they would not put virtually all of it out in fixed rate long-term mortgages. I eat those words. I admit being overly influencedby the representatives we have on the Thrift Institutions AdvisoryCouncil; those people aren't doing that, but it looks as if everybodyelse is. And it's a small advisory group.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct contention or disagreement. It is primarily an individual's opinion and reflection on various aspects of the business sector and housing market.


Passage number 500.
MR. PARTEE. I even wonder about them sometimes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement or thought expressed by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 501.
MR. MARTIN. So here comes this flood of fixed rate long-termfunds. It meets the demand of the first time home buyers. They areinfluenced by an improvement in their tax position and are willing toundertake these obligations. The thrift institutions are not payingoff the Home Loan Banks, as we found out today. They've made realprogress; they've gone from $65 billion in debt there to $62 billion.Given the flood of funds coming in, they likewise have not paid offtheir friendly commercial bank. So, they're carrying that credit.They didn't do that with the money market deposit funds either. Onthe other hand, I separate the positive implications of home buyersfrom the probability that it will occur in the future. Namely, theseare people who despite the after tax implications of income tax[savings] are sensitive to the interest rate. These are small youngfamilies in which two people are working. They can wait if theinterest rates move up some; they'll simply postpone the purchase andwe could have a good deal of that impetus disappear. So, again, Iseparate the positive nature of profitability and equipment purchasesaround the corner from home-buying--in terms of the sensitivity theseareas have to the interest rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different factors related to the housing market and interest rates, but there is no disagreement or conflicting viewpoints presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 502.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. One aspect that Governor Martin did notmention, except by implication, is that unfortunately the savings andloans have gotten themselves more and more sensitive to changes ininterest rates on the liability side of the balance sheet and they areeven less in a position to take an increase in interest rates now thanthey were before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "unfortunately the savings and loans have gotten themselves more and more sensitive to changes in interest rates on the liability side of the balance sheet" implies that Governor Martin believes it is unfortunate that savings and loans institutions have become more vulnerable to changes in interest rates. This implies disagreement with the actions or decision-making of the savings and loans institutions.


Passage number 503.
MR. MARTIN. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Martin simply agrees with the statement made by someone else.


Passage number 504.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 505.
MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, we have revised our own forecastup just slightly. We tend to line up much as Governor Gramley and Mr.Black did. On balance, I rather like Governor Partee's position thatthe staff forecast presents a pretty good working document. We dohave developments in our District that are causing some concern--certainly the energy situation and the implication that has for our3/28-29/83banks down there. This past week most of our major bank holdingcompanies have been making their public announcements about decreasedearnings and increases in loan loss reserves. And unemployment pickedup in February from 8.2 to 8.8 percent, which by our standards atleast seems awfully high. In Houston, where nothing can go wrong,unemployment went from 9.1 up to 9.7 percent in February.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It mainly discusses revised forecasts and expressing concerns about the energy situation and unemployment rates.


Passage number 506.
MR. MARTIN. Those people are all from Michigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that those people are from Michigan without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 507.
MR. BOYKIN. That doesn't sound too high by nationalstandards, but if you remember it was just half that a year ago. Iwas told last week that in Houston there are 30 million square feet ofoffice space in commercial real estate construction that either iscompleted or is in the process of starting. I'm also told by one ofthe large developers that an estimated 65 percent of the office spacein Houston is energy-related in some way. So, with what is happeningin energy, that raises a question. We have an overbuilt situation inDallas for commercial office buildings. We just started a 70-storybuilding last week to cure that. The people in the energy businesswho feel that they're in it to stay, and we find fewer of those, saythat stability in price is probably more important than the actualprice level--that is, within a reasonable [range] of, say, somewherebetween $25 and $29 per barrel. They would not get overly upset if itjust stabilized, because [the instability] causes them difficulties indoing their planning. We know that the supervisory and regulatorygroups are quite concerned about energy portfolios. There are somespecial [examinations] going on, as I understand it, in the majorenergy-lending banks just to take a look at the energy portfolio. So,being that close to what is a drag [on the economy] tends to color mythinking somewhat. But we still have some positives in areas thathave already been mentioned, such as housing. On balance, for theeconomy as a whole I feel relatively optimistic that growth will besomewhere in the 4 to 5 percent range. That sounds reasonable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 508.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On the [energy industry] forecast, can yoube more specific. Suppose the energy price stayed close to where itis now. Would the number of rigs hold up. Would you continue to getthe current amount of drilling.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for more specific information and making a hypothetical scenario based on the energy price staying the same.


Passage number 509.
MR. BOYKIN. I don't think we would, Mr. Chairman. I wouldnot anticipate a great deal of added activity. There are thoseengaged in that business who say that we will probably see drillingpick up again in the latter half of the year. Some of it is for taxpurposes if for no other reason. I was talking to a pipe supplier tothe energy business who says he basically is not doing anything but intalking to the majors--and these are the people he supplies primarily--they tell him just to hold still and that come summer and on intothe rest of the year they have their budgets planned and they willspend that; he will get the orders. At that same meeting there was anindependent oil man who has a pretty big business and he said that isthe difference between the independents and the majors. Theindependents are not going to be going in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply sharing information and opinions from different individuals involved in the energy business.


Passage number 510.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a lot cheaper to drill now, isn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply questioning the current cost of drilling.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 511.
MR. BOYKIN. Oh, yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The phrase "Oh, yes" suggests agreement or confirmation, rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 512.
3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It must be more cheap to drill than thereduction in the oil price.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement that suggests disagreement or contention. It simply states a premise regarding the cost of drilling compared to the reduction in oil prices.


Passage number 513.
MR. BOYKIN. It is; it's a lot cheaper to drill. But alsothe price is lower and there are a lot of rigs laid over. There is aquestion of whether one wants to wear that rig out right now onrelatively cheap oil because some think that this may turn around nextyear. So, they're hedging their bet and figure they are better offkeeping the rig down rather than pulling it up and wearing it out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not have any contention or disagreement. It discusses the cost-effectiveness of drilling and the decision to keep the rig down rather than pulling it up. There is no indication of conflicting opinions or contradictory statements.


Passage number 514.
MS. TEETERS. It's cheaper to drill because the interestrates are down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states a fact about drilling being cheaper due to lower interest rates. There is no indication of any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 515.
MR. BOYKIN. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The word "Yes" indicates that there is disagreement or contention. However, without additional context, it is not clear what exactly the disagreement is about or who is involved in the conflict.


Passage number 516.
 The cost of labor and all of the costcomponents are substantially--MR. CORRIGAN. The cost of the rigs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating a fact about the cost of labor and other cost components being substantial, with no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 517.
MR. BOYKIN. Yes, you can get a rig at a really cheap price.I might even have one or two before too long.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that it is possible to get a rig at a cheap price. The mention of having one or two in the future does not indicate any disagreement but rather suggests the potential availability of additional rigs.


Passage number 518.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If you don't have one now, you soon will.Mr. Ford.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or claims that could be disputed or disagreed with. It is a general statement about a future event that is not open to interpretation or debate.


Passage number 519.
MR. FORD. My next door neighbor is one of those independentswho is a millionaire a number of times over. He told me there hasnever been a better time to buy rigs and leases--that right now is thetime to get in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a statement made by Mr. Ford's neighbor about the opportune time to buy rigs and leases. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 520.
 I always wondered--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is he buying them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement expressing a personal wondering or curiosity about someone's actions.


Passage number 521.
MR. FORD. He's doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of disagreement or contention. It simply states that Mr. Ford is doing something without providing any conflicting perspectives or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 522.
MR. BOYKIN. If I could just tack on, Bill, I got a reportfrom one of our major banks that they are seriously putting a grouptogether to bring up some REITs in the not too distant future.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply giving additional information about a report from a major bank.


Passage number 523.
MR. FORD. What's that--a rig equity investment trust.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question being asked by Mr. Ford.


Passage number 524.
MR. BOYKIN. Not in rigs, but in office buildings--theybelieve that there are some really good deals out there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there are good deals in office buildings.


Passage number 525.
MR. FORD. Mr. Chairman, on the general economic outlook thatwe've been talking about, I come down on the side of Lyle Gramley andPreston Martin. When you look at the major sectors of the economy,the only thing I see to worry about is the one that has been noted;export growth is likely to be weak for the reasons we're all aware of,namely, that the buyers abroad are financially strapped and can'tafford to buy. But if you take all the other sectors of the economy,in government spending, for example, the surge is just starting to hitin our part of the country and spending is going to come down likemanna from heaven as far as the military buildup and the other sectorsof government are concerned. It looks as if federal spending is juststarting to surge through as a stimulant to the economy. I agree thatthere will be a sharp inventory turnaround; there almost has to be.All of the businessmen I've talked with in our area are saying thatthe [inventory] pipelines are dry. The orders are starting to pick upin our area. It's also showing up, as was noted, in sensitive-38-3/28-29/83commodity prices; virtually everything except oil and precious metalsis surging. The BLS 22 commodity spot market index has been up 14weeks in a row. Scrap steel, lumber, aluminum, wheat, corn, soy bean,cattle, cotton--everything--is going up and going up fast, which is afurther indicator that the pipelines are rather dry as prices get bidup.The big thing that we have to watch for, though, which willdetermine which of these polar forecasts is right, is exactly what theconsumer does. When you look at the consumer's potential, theconsumer really hasn't hit the market at all and he's in excellentcondition to do it. The only thing that consumers are buying is newhomes; and there's a little more resale house business. We haven'tyet seen it feed through to the related industries in the consumerdurables sector other than autos. I think that's bound to come withthe employment picture brightening; the consumer's balance sheetcertainly allows it. Then there is the profits surge that allowsbusiness to finance the inventory buildup. So, when you go throughthe different sectors--and the internal arguments we have at theAtlanta Fed have been on how vigorous and how quickly the surge iscoming and so far I'm ahead--I think it's going to be a vigorousspring and summer for us. And I'm worried about what will happen atthe end of the year and early next year--whether it's sustainable,given what we're doing with the monetary aggregates while this deficitspending is going on. I'm worried that we'll have a vigorous recoveryand a drop through the floor about a year from now or maybe sooner.That's where I come out on it. I'm not worried about the next fewmonths.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and analysis of the economic outlook, but there is no evidence of opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 526.
 I think we're going to be--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Where does this drop through the floorcome from against that background.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses uncertainty or surprise about a sudden change in circumstances.


Passage number 527.
MR. FORD. I think what is going to happen is that when we doraise the rates, and I think we are going to raise the rates within ayear for the reasons others have given, we're going to put the economyback in the tank. And it will come when we finally pay for all themonetary expansion that has been going on. We are going to have topay for what we're doing now; we can't put off the day of reckoningforever. We can put it off for another 6 to 9 months and then we willpay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Ford, is expressing his opinion and making a prediction about what will happen when interest rates are raised. There is no direct opposition or disagreement from others in the passage.


Passage number 528.
 One way or another--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What do you mean we will pay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "One way or another" indicates that there is determination or commitment to finding a solution or ensuring that the payment will be made.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 529.
MR. FORD. We will pay when all this borrowing in the privatesector that has to come in order to continue the expansion much beyonda few months comes into conflict with government [borrowing]. Then weare going to have to blow the whistle on it. And when we do, we'regoing to drive up rates and put the economy back down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Ford is indicating that there will be conflict between borrowing in the private sector and government borrowing, which will result in driving up interest rates and negatively impacting the economy.


Passage number 530.
MR. PARTEE. You really do have a different pattern, Bill.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply stating that Bill's pattern is different.


Passage number 531.
MR. FORD. Yes, I see a vigorous recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Ford simply expresses his observation of a vigorous recovery.


Passage number 532.
MR. PARTEE. You have a pretty aggressive recovery and then aturn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a straightforward statement.


Passage number 533.
MR. FORD. Another surge and then a drop-off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states the pattern of a surge followed by a drop-off without any conflicting ideas or opposing opinions.


Passage number 534.
-39-3/28-29/83MR. ROBERTS(.). He has a boom/bust.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage appears to be a numerical expression or equation, rather than a statement or argument that can involve contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 535.
MR. FORD. That's my forecast: boom/bust.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of the terms "boom/bust" suggests conflicting predictions about the future state of the economy. One person may be forecasting a boom, while another person may be predicting a bust.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 536.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Because private credit demands arecolliding with government credit demands.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "private credit demands are colliding with government credit demands" suggests that there is a conflict or disagreement between the private sector and the government regarding credit allocation.


Passage number 537.
MR. FORD. Yes. So far it has been rather moderate as far asthe private sector tapping the market. But it has to come, don't youthink.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Ford is simply expressing his belief that the private sector will eventually tap into the market.


Passage number 538.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I can see that very clearly. Idon't see the connection quite so clearly with the money supply. Itseems to me you said we'd avoid this by getting a much lower privatecredit expansion now.SPEAKER(.). Get if off now.SPEAKER(.). Have a lower economy now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their understanding and confusion about the connection between certain factors, but there is no explicit disagreement or conflict with another person.


Passage number 539.
MR. PARTEE. Have no boom.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement made by Mr. Partee without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 540.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only mentions Chairman Volcker without providing any information or context that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 541.
 I don't--MR. FORD. What I'm suggesting is that the thing to do is tothink in terms of moderating a boom now so that we don't have to comedown as heavily about 9 months to a year from now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 542.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage as only a name, "Mr. Roberts," is provided.


Passage number 543.
MR. ROBERTS. I have just a couple of comments. Our staffhas consistently been optimistic and is looking for about a 5 percentfourth-quarter real growth and we think that the first quarter isprobably running ahead of expectations in terms of the numbers thatwill come out. I went around to all my branches recently, as part ofan introductory thing, and I met with the boards and heard theirsummaries of what they thought about the economy. I would say inreference to what someone said earlier that they're not euphoric atall. If anything, it's a reluctant optimism; but there's definitelyunanimity of optimism. In the wood products area, for example, onefellow was cautioning about interpreting the February seasonallyadjusted number and yet he concluded that [business is] really boomingand prices are up 60 percent from the bottom. He said his lumberprices are still below his costs, but that with the sharply risingprices we had to look out in terms of what that would do to housing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 544.
But there was a reluctant optimism--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That was lumber you said was up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions a reluctant optimism without any conflicting opinions or conflicting information.


Passage number 545.
MR. ROBERTS. Lumber was up 60 percent since October.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is presenting a factual information about the increase in lumber prices since October.


Passage number 546.
MR. PARTEE. Lumber or some [wood] products.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement mentioning the possibility of using lumber or wood products.


Passage number 547.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The figures don't show that generally, butthey're up sharply; there's no question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that the figures are up sharply without presenting any opposing viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 548.
MR. ROBERTS. This chap heads the-40-3/28-29/83and he said prices had really taken off and he was gettingsimilar reports from people on the West Coast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that Mr. Roberts mentioned that prices had taken off and he was receiving similar reports from people on the West Coast. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement.


Passage number 549.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They have gone up sharply in price.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The statement "They have gone up sharply in price" is a statement of fact that does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the price of something has increased significantly.


Passage number 550.
MR. ROBERTS. My attitude is colored a little by the factthat I just contracted to buy a house in the weak St. Louis marketwhere I found the seller is very, very firm and the price is not weakat all. Housing is very strong, has a largeconsumer oriented company--shoes and recreational products and so on--and he said he's seeing expansion in unit sales across the countryfor the first time; the expansion is concealed a little by the lowerprices. But he really is doing better than when he had higher pricesand the units weren't moving.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating the speaker's personal attitude and observations about the housing market and a specific seller.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 551.
 So, all in all--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Now he can convince a few other people ofthat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage suggests that there may be contention or disagreement as it mentions the individual's ability to convince others of something. This implies that there may be differing opinions or beliefs that would need to be addressed or overcome in order to convince others.


Passage number 552.
MR. ROBERTS. I might add that his profits are up verysubstantially with this type of development, so it's veryconstructive. All in all, there is pretty solid and widespreadoptimism but nothing in terms of a soaring economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that there is solid and widespread optimism but nothing in terms of a soaring economy. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 553.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What is your staff projecting inregard to inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply asking for a projection or forecast regarding inflation from the staff. It does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 554.
MR. ROBERTS. On inflation I believe we had 5 percent. Myown feeling is that we're probably overestimating inflation. With thegood control over compensation per manhour, the good productivityfigures, I think a low increase in prices is in the bag for '83. I'mmore concerned about '84 in terms of this sharp buildup in liquidity.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no clear contention or disagreement. Mr. Roberts expresses his belief about the inflation rate and his concerns about the sharp buildup in liquidity for '84, but there is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 555.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have run through my list. Does anybodyelse want to say anything. I think at this stage we might as wellwait and begin with Mr. Axilrod first thing tomorrow morning. Howlong do you plan to talk, Mr. Axilrod. If people want to stay 5minutes and get this introduction tonight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting that they wait and begin with Mr. Axilrod's introduction the next day.


Passage number 556.
 I'm at your--MR. FORD. He said 10 minutes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a simple statement indicating that "He" said 10 minutes.


Passage number 557.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Would you rather stay or go.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a simple question asking for a preference between two options.


Passage number 558.
MR. PARTEE. How about doing half of it.SPEAKER(.). Can't do it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident from the straightforward responses and lack of opposing statements or conflicting opinions. Both speakers are agreeing on the fact that the task cannot be completed.


Passage number 559.
MR. GRAMLEY. To facilitate discussion, I think it's betterif it is fresh in our minds.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement by MR. GRAMLEY is simply suggesting a method to improve the discussion. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 560.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Okay. You'd rather have it fresh in yourminds than think about it. That shows you something, Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement or observation made by the speaker about someone's preference.


Passage number 561.
[Meeting recessed]-41-3/28-29/83March 29, 1983--Morning SessionMR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 562.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] given a lot of room. Whowould like to comment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage as it is unintelligible.


Passage number 563.
MR. RICE. Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage simply states that someone named Mr. Rice is speaking to the chairman. There is no contention or disagreement evident in this statement.


Passage number 564.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Rice.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement involving Governor Rice.


Passage number 565.
MR. RICE. I'd first like to compliment Steve on what I thinkwas an unusually clear analysis of the kinds of issues we face. Thepolicy preference course today seems to depend more than usually onhow one sees the current performance of the economy and how one seesthe economy developing in the near term. If one sees the economy asfragile and the economic recovery as vulnerable and much weaker thanusual--and, of course, sees the inflation rate very low and,therefore, not a major concern--one obviously then would be pushed inthe direction of alternative A and perhaps even a further relaxation.On the other hand, if one sees that the economy is strengtheningrapidly and indeed appears to have a boom momentum and there is astrong fear of the uncertainties of inflation, then obviously onemight be pushed in the direction of alternative C or even morerestraint. I would agree with Governor Partee's statement yesterdayin support of the staff analysis and the staff forecast, which hefound to be in the middle. And I would agree when he says that overthe rest of the year the real GNP could come in 1 percent higher or 1percent lower. But the staff forecast is in the middle.I would agree also with Frank Morris when he says that weneed more data and a little more time before we can be confident aboutthe nature of this recovery. Readily accepting that inventories arelean, that shelves are bare, and that defense spending is strong andrising, it seems to me that one must make some heroic assumptions withregard to consumer expenditures and consumers' willingness to take ondebt in large quantities, given the level of real interest rates.Also [it takes] some expansive assumptions with respect to residentialconstruction in order to see that the economy is recovering stronglyand in danger of causing a boom. I think the worry that the economyis strengthening too quickly would ignore what is best [not]minimized. There are drags on the economy at the present time: thedrag effects of capital spending and the probable composition of thatspending when it turns around and begins to expand, and the drageffects of state and local expenditures as well. While I would agree,as I said, that we need more time and more data to feel confidentabout the nature of the recovery, at this point I'm persuaded that theeconomy still needs nurturing and at the very least does not need anyrestraining influence resulting from a more restrictive monetarypolicy. Now, I would agree that there may have been considerablestimulation in the sense that the underlying rate of growth of theaggregates may well have been very strong. But I think that we haveto see stimulation in relative terms, and we have to see thatstimulation in a situation when real interest rates are negative [and]not quite as sensitive as stimulation in the context of highlypositive real rates of interest. So, I would come out in favor of aposition somewhat between alternative A and alternative B--that is,somewhat of a holding position until the economic picture becomes3/28-29/83clear. And instead of sending up interest rates, I would tend to errslightly on the side of a downward [nudge]. I think that's what theoutlook calls for at the present time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is a disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Rice, is discussing different policy preferences based on how one sees the current performance of the economy. He presents alternative A as a more relaxed approach and alternative C as a more restrained approach. Mr. Rice then states that he agrees with Governor Partee's statement, which supports the staff analysis and forecast, placing it in the middle. He also agrees with Frank Morris that more data and time are needed to be confident about the nature of the recovery. However, Mr. Rice ultimately argues for a holding position and slightly downward nudge in interest rates, disagreeing with the possibility of a more restrictive monetary policy.


Passage number 566.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 567.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think that a strong case can bemade for continuing with a money market directive for the time being.I'm not sure but that it'd be premature to return to targeting even M2and M3 in the short run of the intermeeting period. With a moneymarket directive we could implement an extremely modest tightening,which I think would be indicated under the situation for reasonsEmmett talked about; I doubt that we would respond in a mechanisticway to the short-run targets. So, therefore, we could achieve thesame substantive effect anyway with a money market directive. I'm notsaying that there won't be a point when we would want to return totargeting the aggregates, but at the moment I have an instinct, and Ithink that's all I can actually call it, that a strong case could bemade that it's somewhat premature to do so. It could put us back inthat situation we were in earlier. I'm a little concerned about themarket impression of our going in that direction. Paul made onecasual remark in one sentence in answering a question about Ml growth,namely that it was looking strong, and the market very stronglyoverreacted and people were looking at Ml for quite a few weeks. Ifthey see us now moving back to monetary aggregates targeting, then Ithink they might draw more conclusions from that than would bejustified. I don't think that they would recognize the heavy degreeof judgmental decision components that I assume will go into ourpolicy moves. Even though it may make some sense to target M2 and M3--although I think M3 would be more reliable for the next period andwe might consider just targeting M3 for this short period while we'restill seeing the substantial movement of funds going on--I still thinka case can be made for a money market directive being continued.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their opinion and making a case for continuing with a money market directive, but there is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 568.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage merely states Governor Wallich's name without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 569.
MR. WALLICH. I think that Steve has posed the issue verycorrectly. We have the evidence of a very strong monetary expansion.On the other side is a high real interest rate. Which of the two iswhat really drives the economy. Now, if I were to follow through themonetary implications of the recent monetary upsurge, I would have tosay that the monetarist view is that half a year later the real sectorwould begin to move strongly. If that were to be the case, then we'dsee something stirring now and certainly have very strong second andthird quarters, which we don't seem to expect, and a couple of yearslater prices would begin to expand. This is an empirical finding.There is no logical reason why that should happen unless over twoyears we reach a level of unemployment at which prices do begin toreact to a continued monetary expansion. So, the analysis of whatthis bulge in the money supply is likely to do does not seem to me tobe very plausible at the present time. We don't see the real sectoreffect before us now. And the price effect farther down the roadwould occur, it seems to me, if by that time unemployment had comedown to an inflationary level. But that is not very likely, even overtwo years. So the bulge in the money supply to me seems to be lesspersuasive as a predictor of what is going to happen than is the levelof real interest rates. The level of real interest rates does seem tobe high. It may not be as high as present indexes indicate. I think-43-3/28-29/83people like to think of long-term inflation as well above 5 percent,maybe 6 or maybe 7 percent. That seems to be the findings of theBache-Prudential survey. So, real rates may not be as high as theyseem on the basis of present indexes, but they are still substantial.And that, I think, is what dominates the situation and is giving usprobably a moderate recovery.Why it is that we're experiencing these great increases inthe aggregates is something I don't understand. [I don't know] whythe model predicts so differently what shifts may be taking place.But it doesn't seem to me to be the kind of thing that is likely togenerate the usual future consequences of high money growth. So, Idon't see an immediate need to bring down the growth of the aggregatessharply to within their ranges. On the other hand, I like the idea ofgoing back to a money supply target even though I recognize we can doexactly the same thing with an interest rate target. We can have amoney supply target if we qualify the money supply target adequately.The way the [staff's draft wording] is formulated in the squarebrackets does seem to qualify the money supply targets in a verycomplete form. That is to say: If we undershoot, resist that; if weovershoot, let it run. One could not be more accommodative than Iinterpret that formulation. But I would prefer going back to theaggregates because I feel very uneasy with interest rate pegging juston general principles. It has been an unfortunate thing in the past.Tony may have confidence that we can shift gears in a timely way--andI take it that that's your ultimate intention--but interest ratetargeting has had a bad history. It will not look good in the recordand is I think in the long run surely inflationary. So, I'd ratherget away from it as soon as I can.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, does not express any disagreement or contention in this passage. He is presenting his views and preferences on monetary policy, but there is no disagreement with other speakers or a conflicting viewpoint being presented.


Passage number 570.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible] I'm not sure. At leastyou can make a plausible explanation, which Steve touched upon, as towhat is going on in the broader aggregates. I'm not sure you can inthe narrow ones. But it's a fairly straightforward story, if Iunderstand it and if the figures are right, which they may not be. Ifthe credit figure is as low as the estimators now think it is, andthat's subject to considerable uncertainty, we have no great creditexpansion: this figure is about in line with nominal GNP, which iswhat one would expect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and acknowledging the possibility of incorrect figures, but they are not presenting any conflicting viewpoints or arguing against any particular idea.


Passage number 571.
MR. AXILROD. It seems to be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any indication of disagreement or contention. The statement is presented as a straightforward observation or remark made by Mr. Axilrod.


Passage number 572.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. What we have is a lot more intermediationthrough depository institutions when they are aggressively payinghigher rates relative to credit market instruments, which is I guesswhat one would expect of that. The amount of deposit growth amongindividuals is very large in the first quarter and the amount ofcredit market instrument growth is very small relative to what it hasbeen; that's consistent at least with different pricing. Now, thatdoesn't explain Ml, but it's a reasonably consistent story for M2 andM3, to the extent that M3 is high at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining a phenomenon and stating that it is consistent with the pricing of different financial instruments.


Passage number 573.
MR. AXILROD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I can't generate a response without context.


Passage number 574.
 For the depository institutions, we don't putthe money funds in there, so--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Partee.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Governor Partee is simply providing information or clarification about the topic.


Passage number 575.
-44-3/28-29/83MR. PARTEE. Well, I think you put the right slant on it justnow, Paul. It's a situation where the broader the aggregate the lessegregious the situation looks; that's the result. But apparentlytotal bank credit is well within--in fact, slightly below--the rangewe've specified and well within expectations or even on the weak sideso far, if the figures are at all right. Growth of M3 shown here onpage 2 of the Bluebook for the fourth to the first quarter is 9.8percent; for the fourth quarter to March it is 9.7 percent. And[that's about] the way it has been running for some considerableperiod of time. M2 is very large because of the shifts to MMDAsprincipally, I think, but there could be a little more underlyingstrength in there. M1 is impossible to explain. Ml is justextraordinarily strong and has been for a considerable amount of time.And rather than trailing off, it got stronger in February and March.That's the one, of course, that the market is beginning to look at,even though we haven't targeted it as one of our principal variables.And that's the one that gives us all kinds of difficulty. I don'tknow; it may be that one component after all now pays 5-1/4 percent--the NOW accounts. That's about 3 points below the market but 3 pointson an after-tax basis is not much and might lead people to keep excessliquidity in NOW accounts. The other component, Super NOWs, ispresumably right on the market if one allows for the cost of handlingthe transactions activity in an account. And there is no reason atall, assuming that you have a reasonable deal and need some money fortransactions, not to keep your money there rather than in the market.Perhaps that's much of the explanation. I might remind the Committeethat this is also a very volatile series and that we sometimes haveperiods of very large increases and then we have periods of smallincreases or declines. It may be that we're getting here some kind ofa bump in this and that it subsequently will have a low rate ofgrowth. In fact, I'm inclined to think that's what is going tohappen. So, I guess I agree with Emmett: I don't see anything in theeconomy nor in the credit picture nor in the inflation picture to leadone to say that we need to react with great alarm because of theseaggregates. And, therefore, we should not do so. I don't think it'sa time to return [to the old operating technique]. I don't quiteunderstand this discussion of money market versus aggregates. Afterall, we do target the aggregates. If we stop targeting them, we'vegot to tell Congress we are going to stop targeting them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It consists mostly of observations and opinions about the state of credit and monetary aggregates. There is some discussion of differing views on the importance of certain components of the aggregates, but overall there is no strong disagreement.


Passage number 576.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We didn't target them at the lastmeeting in terms of the short-run targeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply explains that the speaker did not target "them" in terms of short-run targeting at the last meeting.


Passage number 577.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 578.
 Yes, but we specified target rates of growth forM2 and M3, bank credit and--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Only indirectly in the last [directive].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states that target rates of growth were set for M2 and M3, bank credit, and mentions that this was indirectly addressed in the last directive.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 579.
MR. PARTEE. I don't think we should say we're going to stoptargeting these things. On the other hand, I don't agree with Henrythat we ought to run our policy on the basis of a presumed pathrelative to targets. I think we ought to continue to do about whatwe've been doing because I don't think, Henry, that we should changeback to proximate targeting on the aggregates when we still have thisinexplicable decline in velocity. It seems to me that as soon as wecan see something in terms of a move to a more normative relationship,then we ought to return strictly to monetary targeting, but not now.We have no more reason now than we had last time or in the fourth3/28-29/83quarter, since we're still getting sizable declines in velocity by allevidence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee disagrees with Henry's suggestion of running the policy based on a presumed path relative to targets. He believes they should continue with their current approach and not switch back to proximate targeting. He argues that they should only return strictly to monetary targeting when they can see a move to a more normative relationship.


Passage number 580.
 I don't think that we have to go back to the nonborrowedreserve path targeting that we had before; rather we ought to staywith the presumption of a net reserve--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 581.
 Let me try to develop the semantics--MR. PARTEE. No, I got a little confused there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply admits to getting a little confused while explaining something.


Passage number 582.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --in an acceptable manner. We have twoalternatives here. There obviously are more alternatives, but we havetwo in front of us, which some of the comments have been directed to.I don't think the first alternative has no targets in it but they aredepressed a bit. It says "paths implied by the long-term ranges;" ithas some coloration of a short-term mechanistic following of thetargets, I think. But the only reference to targeting is to thelonger-range paths. The second one is set out in more traditionalquarterly targets. But I don't read that as necessarily implying asmuch as you were suggesting, Chuck, that it is necessarily returningto the operating technique [of recent years]. And I'm not sure Henrywas suggesting that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is discussing different alternatives and offering their own interpretation of them, but there is no clear disagreement or argument taking place.


Passage number 583.
MR. WALLICH. That's right. We have flexibility.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "we have flexibility."


Passage number 584.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only mentions Chairman Volcker without indicating any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 585.
 I think these do reflect to some extentdifferent degrees of emphasis, but I--MR. PARTEE. Well, I misunderstood Henry. I wanted to argueagainst returning to the operating technique.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating their opinion and acknowledging that there may be different degrees of emphasis in their point of view. However, another person (Henry) has a different opinion and the speaker is indicating that they misunderstood Henry's perspective. The speaker then mentions that they wanted to argue against returning to the operating technique, suggesting a difference in opinion but not directly engaging in contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 586.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's a substantive issue. But Idon't read alternative II as necessarily implying that. Nor doesalternative I imply that we don't look at the targets at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear indication of contention or disagreement. Both alternative II and alternative I are being discussed separately without any conflicting viewpoints presented.


Passage number 587.
MR. PARTEE. I see. Well, I come out that we ought to holdabout where we are again for a period, until we can get some ofFrank's new numbers and get some sense of what is occurring andperhaps understand the aggregates a little better than we do now. So,I don't feel that because of market sensitivity we are justified inpushing rates down. I think that would cause considerable alarm atthis point. Nor do I think we ought to return to the old operatingtechnique. I guess that's about alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is expressing his own opinion and preference in terms of holding the current position and not pushing rates down. He does not argue or disagree with any other individual or viewpoint.


Passage number 588.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm anxious to get to Mr. Morris' newnumbers. I don't know what they are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses their eagerness to know Mr. Morris' new numbers while admitting their lack of knowledge about them.


Passage number 589.
MR. PARTEE. I meant new monthly numbers. He said we didn'thave enough information yet to know where the economy is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Both parties appear to be discussing the availability of information about the current state of the economy.


Passage number 590.
MR. RICE. The numbers that will come out next month.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 591.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, okay. I thought I was missingsomething again. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a sense of confusion or uncertainty, but there is no indication of disagreement or argument.


Passage number 592.
MR. CORRIGAN. Mr. Chairman, let me start by making a coupleof observations about Ml, because I do think in the eyes of thefinancial markets that Ml is the aggregate that is causing the mostproblems in terms of expectations right now. We've done a little look-46-3/28-29/83behind some of the numbers and I must say it leads me to the view thatthe shifting phenomenon as it relates to Super NOW accounts inparticular is having an impact that I think at this point clearlyworks in the direction of overstating Ml. We looked at a sample ofabout 20 banks outside of the Twin Cities in terms of what is going onwith Super NOW accounts, and it's rather revealing because we findthat the average balance in household Super NOW accounts runs in therange of $15,000 to $20,000, which is 3 or 4 times the balance inconventional NOW accounts. In addition, we have found a number ofinstances that involve very, very sizable Super NOW account balances--balances associated with institutions, state and local governments,hospitals, and so on. This is a very limited sample, of course, butin some cases we have seen average balances in individual institutionsas high as several hundred thousand dollars in Super NOW accounts.And we're led to believe from some limited discussions that thosebalances, in particular, were not M1 balances before. Both of thosephenomena, to the extent that they represent anything close to apattern--and obviously I can't draw that conclusion from 20 banks--do suggest to me that the measured growth of Ml may be more affectedthan perhaps we've been thinking. I'm not saying this is rightanalytically, but if you assume that the difference in the averagebalance size in the Super NOW household account as opposed to aconventional NOW account, is a proxy for the additional savingscomponent that's reflected in these NOW accounts and you make any kindof adjustment for the measured growth rate in M1 over the firstquarter for that, it's not very hard to find yourself looking at asituation where shift-adjusted growth in M1 is in fact within theranges that we're talking about for the year. But again, that ishighly speculative and based on a very limited sample. In any event,I am persuaded from this limited exercise that we may have more of aproblem in terms of what Ml is really doing than perhaps we haverecognized up until now. Obviously, to the extent that is right, itcould have quite a bearing in terms of market psychology itself.Just one other quick point on money: I mentioned yesterdayin the context of some of our directors' comments about the economybeing pretty strong that one of the very interesting things that theyreported was a tremendous increase in the use of currency forfinancing retail transactions in size--not toothpaste transactions,but fairly sizable transactions being paid for with the currency ofthe realm.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their own observations and views, but there is no explicit disagreement with another party.


Passage number 593.
 Surprisingly, one person brought it up and several othersimmediately said that they--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. These were bankers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 594.
MR. PARTEE. The trade people.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 595.
MR. CORRIGAN. It was both bankers and trade people, as Irecall. But it was interesting because once one person mentioned itseveral others chimed right in and said that they had seen exactly thesame thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply recounting an interesting observation where multiple people shared the same experience.


Passage number 596.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Did they have an explanation for that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is a simple question asking if "they" had an explanation.


Passage number 597.
MR. CORRIGAN. Nope.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any indication of contention or disagreement. The speaker simply responds with a brief answer.


Passage number 598.
MS. TEETERS. Currency or checks, Jerry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Ms. Teeters is simply asking Jerry to choose between currency or checks as a form of payment.


Passage number 599.
-47-3/28-29/83MR. CORRIGAN. Currency.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply presenting a mathematical expression involving currency.


Passage number 600.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just interject here, for anybodywho has not been observing the figures, that we have three months in arow of very high currency growth figures. I think if you go back 20years you can't find another three months like this. It seems to bequite general and nobody has an explanation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply stating a fact about the high currency growth figures and acknowledging that there is no explanation for it.


Passage number 601.
MR. CORRIGAN. I was really astonished by these comments. AsI said, they were seeing currency being used to pay for retailtransactions of size. Again, I'm not talking about a tube oftoothpaste or a can of peas.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own astonishment at the comments they heard.


Passage number 602.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Have we ever gotten down how muchcurrency is going to Latin American countries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage is simply asking a question about whether there has been any progress in determining the amount of currency that is going to Latin American countries. It does not present any opposing views or conflicting information that would indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 603.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've looked to see whether there isanything unusual for which we have any specific evidence. They tellme we have no evidence. Now, that doesn't tell us how many LatinAmericans may be holding money in the United States in a safe depositvault, but we haven't any evidence of it flowing in. Maybe it is, butwe have no evidence. It's a very surprising development. I don'tknow why it would go in that direction; I can understand LatinAmericans buying dollars, but we haven't any specific evidence ofthat. I don't know why they should be doing what Mr. Corrigan says.All I know is that the [currency growth] figures show a big bulge.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

In this passage, the speaker is discussing the lack of evidence regarding a specific situation - whether Latin Americans are holding money in safe deposit vaults in the United States. While the speaker expresses surprise and uncertainty about this development, there is no explicit disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 604.
MR. RICE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I cannot determine the answer without the passage you are referring to. Can you please provide the passage or quote in question?


Passage number 605.
 Maybe the recovery in the underground economy isstronger than--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A very radical difference.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting ideas or opinions. It simply presents a possibility or speculation about the strength of the recovery in the underground economy.


Passage number 606.
MR. GRAMLEY. That won't even show up in Frank's statistics.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 607.
MR. FORD. Just thinking about it in terms of a priori logic,with real interest rates coming down, I don't see that the cost ofholding cash has changed that much in favor of using more cash. Sothat wouldn't be a [reason].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Ford is simply stating his thoughts and observations regarding the cost of holding cash.


Passage number 608.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's not low relative to what it hasbeen in the past when currency wasn't going up this rapidly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or arguments. It simply states a comparison to a past situation without expressing disagreement or contention.


Passage number 609.
MR. FORD. One thing we have noticed in Miami is the cashflowing into the Miami branch. We had a big surplus of cash flowingin versus payouts, on the order of a $6 billion differential in '81.I forget [the exact amount]--I wish I had brought the figures--but Idid notice in reviewing the [more recent] Miami currency report thatwe're getting a slower inflow and Miami is less of a net cashgenerator for our big branch down there. Paul, one possibleexplanation would be that Venezuela, for example, has just put onexchange controls. France is putting on limits as to how much cashone can carry out and Mexico is putting on limits. I'm just thinkingaloud: Could it be that to the extent that dollars show up in theseeconomies through the underground economy, or however they used toremit them back when there was no limit on carrying money in and outof Venezuela, they're stashing more cash down there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply discussing a decrease in cash flow into the Miami branch and suggesting possible explanations for it. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 610.
3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it is conceivable. But we don'tfind any evidence of real cash shipments down there. You would thinkit might be tied in with this international financial and economicdisturbance, but we just can't find direct evidence for it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges a possibility but states that they have not found any evidence to support it.


Passage number 611.
MR. FORD. Yes, but if you buy the fact that the cash hasbeen flowing that way--for example, into Columbia and Venezuela as aresult of the black market--the cash was going in and then it wouldcome back and end up in our banks and end up in the Miami branch.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not include any contention or disagreement as it is a statement of fact about the movement of cash between different countries and banks.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 612.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It might be. I don't say you're wrong; Ijust don't know how to find it directly. That kind of explanationsounds more plausible to me than Mr. Corrigan's, but the other thingis that it seems to be happening all over the country. You read thatFederal Reserve notes in all the Federal Reserve Banks are going up.It's a strange phenomenon and I don't know how to approach findingmore information. Just in line with Mr. Corrigan's earlier comments,I think it's worth scratching our heads harder and expending someresources in trying to work on what's going on in Ml in general interms of behavior patterns, particularly Super NOWs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that they don't know how to find the explanation directly but find it more plausible than Mr. Corrigan's. However, they also mention that it seems to be happening all over the country and express uncertainty about finding more information. This suggests a lack of agreement or consensus on the issue.


Passage number 613.
MR. MORRIS. One idea we had--I don't know that it has anymerit or not--is that with the new discounts for cash payment ingasoline stations people are having a tendency to pay in cash ratherthan using a credit card and may be carrying higher balances than theyused to in order to get the discount.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely relaying an idea without taking a stance on its merit.


Passage number 614.
MS. TEETERS. Frank, I have a son who works in a gas station.They net between $20 and $40 a day because people don't pick up theircash discount.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating a fact about the earnings of employees at a gas station due to customers not picking up their cash discount. There is no contention or disagreement expressed.


Passage number 615.
MR. PARTEE. You mean they charge it still.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any form of contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question and statement.


Passage number 616.
MS. TEETERS. They are charged the credit price and payingcash and [the attendants] have to figure out what the discount is, andpeople don't wait to get it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement of a situation where people are charged the credit price but pay in cash, resulting in attendants needing to calculate the discount.


Passage number 617.
MR. GUFFEY. I don't know what the credit card growth is, butanother possible explanation is that the credit card companies all arecharging on a day-of-purchase basis an interest rate something between18 and 22 percent: that makes the cost of holding cash much less atthese current interest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply offering another possible explanation for the growth of credit card usage.


Passage number 618.
MR. CORRIGAN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about Mr. Corrigan's perspective or actions that could suggest contention or disagreement.


Passage number 619.
 If you look at it that way, using cash--MR. GUFFEY. You're just substituting cash for credit cardpurchasing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply presents an idea or perspective without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 620.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we're not going to resolve it at thetable this morning, but I think we ought to devote some furtherimagination to trying to figure out what is going on there. But Idon't think you were finished, Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 621.
MR. CORRIGAN. On policy itself, for reasons that havealready been stated, I would come out somewhere along the lines ofalternative B in the Bluebook. I do have a preference for thealternative II language in the directive as well, for the reasons-49-3/28-29/83cited by both Governor Partee and Governor Wallich. I think they weresaying the same thing; if they were. I agree with both of them.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker Mr. Corrigan agrees with both Governor Partee and Governor Wallich.


Passage number 622.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Chuck was saying stay with theexisting language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Chuck was suggesting to stay with the existing language.


Passage number 623.
MR. PARTEE. I thought I was a little closer to Tony,actually, than to Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's perception of their relationship with two individuals.


Passage number 624.
MR. GRAMLEY. Are you talking about alternative I or II.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 625.
MR. CORRIGAN. I'm talking about alternative B in thedirective language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely referring to a specific alternative (B) in the directive language.


Passage number 626.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes, but I mean in terms of alternative[wording].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not seem to contain any contention or disagreement. It appears to be a simple clarification or request for clarification.


Passage number 627.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're talking about directive II.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This statement is a neutral statement that simply acknowledges and refers to a specific directive, without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 628.
MR. BLACK. Alternative II, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Black is simply expressing his opinion about a topic, there is no opposing viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 629.
MR. CORRIGAN. Yes, right. Well, in the Bluebook it'salternatives I and II and in the draft that was handed out it'salternatives A and B. I'm talking about the second one. The case forstaying more or less where we are in policy both tactically andoperationally makes a lot of sense to me. The only other point Iwould add is that, looking out from where we are, it really doesstrike me that we're approaching a situation where analytically eachof these money supply measures is just a horse of a totally differentcolor. I must say I am not at all sure what that is going to mean forthe evolution of monetary policy over a long period of time both interms of operating procedures, definitions, and all the rest. I thinkthe day may be at hand when the Committee and the staff have to startto explore some of these questions on a more fundamental basis becausethe point will come when we're going to have to have a better mousetrap. And I just don't know what it's going to be at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is the speaker expressing their thoughts and uncertainty about the future of monetary policy.


Passage number 630.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 631.
MR. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, we continue to be concerned aboutthe growth of Ml. It seems clear to us that the reported growth hasnot been inflated. Jerry raised some interesting points. If we lookat the money market deposit accounts, in our analysis that provides abig offset, which suggests the shift-adjusted figure is really bigger.And Steve's group has suggested that it's probably largely unaffected,which is probably the most reasonable of all because I'm sure they'velooked at it much more extensively than the rest of us have. If therehas been this upward shift in the demand for money, it seems likely tome that we've pretty well accommodated, if not more than accommodated,the overshoots that we've had. I continue to have a lot of difficultyin understanding why we're placing our main emphasis on M2, which isthe aggregate that seems to be most distorted by these new accountsand one over which we have very little control while Ml in contrast isnow generally thought to be the one least affected. And it's the onethat's most controllable. All the empirical studies to me suggestthat Ml has the best past record for predicting inflation and nominalGNP. Of course, that may change; it certainly is a differentinstrument now. But my feeling would be that the burden of proof3/28-29/83ought to be on those who think it's going to change that much, thoughI realize it certainly can.So, with these points in mind, I feel very strongly that weought to move back toward the old operating procedures, as far as wecan persuade the Committee to do so, that we were using before lastOctober. And in particular, I think we ought to allow the borrowedreserve target and the federal funds rate to vary in reaction to anyovershoots or undershoots above or below the stated path that we have.Now, it might well cause the federal funds rate to rise a little inthe short run, but I think it's unlikely that a moderate increase ofthat sort would seriously undermine the recovery since it seems to meto be pretty firmly [entrenched]. The real issue, as I see it, isthat if we fail to act now, we may have to take a lot stronger actionlater when business confidence and the bond markets may be a lotweaker. And they may be weaker because I think we'll have a revivalof the inflationary expectations--even more so than we have now. So,I lean toward the C alternative and, for obvious reasons, prefer thelanguage of alternative II as shown in the Bluebook and alternative Bas shown in the handout. I would like to eliminate the wording inthat first bracket there; I think that's really unnecessary. And,obviously, I would like equal if not more importance attached to M1.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Black expresses his concerns and opinions about the growth of M1 and the importance of using M1 as a measure of inflation and nominal GNP. He also suggests moving back to old operating procedures and allowing the borrowed reserve target and federal funds rate to vary. While there is a difference of opinion between Mr. Black and some other members of the group, there is no explicit contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 632.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage "Governor Gramley." The passage is simply stating the name of the governor without any conflicting opinions or conflicting information.


Passage number 633.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, Mr. Chairman, we're getting someindications of a divergence of views among the Committee members as towhere the economy is going, and I think that's understandable. Thisis, after all, a recovery that's only just beginning. The evidence onwhere we're going is still fragmentary. And each of us, I think,tends to seize upon a particular number that tends to support his ownview. Not by way of singling out Frank, but Frank for examplementioned that durable goods orders had fallen in February and thatwas disappointing. I could come back and say, yes, now we only have a34 percent annual rate of rise in durable goods orders from the fourthquarter to February. You can take either side of this issue and makesomething of it if you want. I think we ought to recognize that thereare a lot of uncertainties and that means to me among other thingsthat we ought to be cautious. Whatever we do we don't want to go backto a situation in which inadvertently we either let interest ratesdrop a ton or increase a ton. If they move in either direction, we'relikely to find ourselves far from where we want to.The second thing I want to say is that I agree entirely withJerry Corrigan, not just on Ml, but on the Ms generally. I just don'tknow what they mean. Now, it is true that M1 in the past has provento be our faithful friend--more predictable in terms of itsrelationship with GNP and maybe more controllable. I also would wantto remind everybody that since the fourth quarter of 1981 the growthof M1 has just baffled us. We've had a movement of velocity we do notunderstand. In mid to late 1981 and early in 1982 I think we reactedin an overly restrictive direction to the growth of OCDs. We got aneconomy that was a lot sicker in 1982 as a consequence thereof. Tosay that somehow these recent increases in Ml. despite five quartersof very, very puzzling velocity, are going to generate inflation rightaround the corner is a very, very dangerous line of thinking. For themoment, I think we ought to try to look at other things. I agree withBob that we need to start positioning ourselves for where we want to-51-3/28-29/83be in the future. I have come to the conclusion that real interestrates may well need to be moved up to keep this recovery fromstrengthening [too much]. I'm very much impressed by the fact thatthe cost of capital, if you take into account the rise of stockprices, has dropped a lot. And we've added a half a trillion dollarsof wealth. Now, this affects consumption spending, through the costof capital, as well as the outlook for business fixed investment. ButI would want to proceed very slowly and very gradually. I'm inclined,therefore, to think that we ought to go somewhere between "B" and "C."I'm not quite sure what I want by way of initial borrowing, but Iwouldn't mind at all if the federal funds rate were nudged up to 9percent or maybe a little over. As to the alternatives, I don'treally care whether we go with I or II. I'd feel a bit morecomfortable if we begin moving back in the direction of somethingother than a strict money market directive. But I can go with eitherone of those.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is the speaker's own reflections and opinions on various economic indicators and policy options.


Passage number 634.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Ms. Teeters.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 635.
MS. TEETERS. I guess I will counterpoint Lyle. I think itwould be a disaster for interest rates to go up. We are at 68-1/2percent capacity utilization and we have 10.4 percent unemployment.We have just the beginnings--at most three months--of signs ofrecovery. If we abort it, we will have major problems not only interms of what it will do to the economy because rising interest ratescan only force capacity utilization lower and the unemployment ratehigher--I think the economic consequences of starting to tighten fromthat particular position are too severe--but I think the politicalconsequences are even worse. If you look at the structure of both ourdomestic and international institutions, again, rising interest ratescould be very difficult to cope with and could only exacerbateproblems that are out there. I've noticed that we have eleveninstitutions on extended borrowing. That's the highest number that Iremember seeing; it may have been higher at other times.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and providing reasons for it, rather than engaging in a debate or argument.


Passage number 636.
MR. PARTEE. They are all banks too, aren't they.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee is simply making a statement and asking for confirmation that the mentioned institutions are all banks.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 637.
MS. TEETERS. Yes, they are all banks. We're going toincrease the strains in the economy by increasing interest rates.And, if anything, I think we ought to be aiming to lower them. Infact, I am very much against this. If snugging went on--however thatterm got into the public press--I am opposed to it. I think therates, if anything, should have been drifting lower and not higherover the intermeeting period. And [the funds rate] certainly shouldnot have been above the discount rate. I also am cautious. I wantmore information. We're running on highly seasonally adjusted numbersat this point and sometimes [the final numbers] don't turn out thatway. I think we do have a backlog in housing and we're probablycatching up on it. But we could destroy any recovery in housing ifthe mortgage rate goes up above 13 percent again. So, I would be withEmmett. I would like to see the [funds] rate come back down to atleast 8-1/2 percent and, if anything, fluctuate between 8 and 8-1/2percent rather than between 8-1/2 and 9 percent. The real interestrate is extraordinarily high. And I don't think that we can get asustained recovery, particularly with the high interest rates thatwe're dealing with at the present time. On the other hand, I realizethat there is still a booming federal deficit out there. And I thinkthere is some movement in Congress to do something about it. But if-52-3/28-29/83we give up too soon, they won't do it. So, I would like to wait formore information. I certainly am opposed to any increase in rates andwould like to see them return to where they were at the time of thelast meeting. I would go for "A" or "B" and I don't think thelanguage makes a lot of difference. If I had to be pushed one way orthe other, I'd go for alternative I, but I don't think that's whatwe're operating on, frankly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Ms. Teeters expresses disagreement with the decision to increase interest rates, stating that she thinks they should be lowered instead. She also expresses caution and the need for more information before making a decision. Ms. Teeters disagrees with the idea of "snugging" and believes rates should not have been above the discount rate. She also disagrees with the high interest rates and believes they could harm the housing recovery. However, she acknowledges the issue of the federal deficit and the need for action from Congress. Overall, there is contention and disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 638.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mrs. Horn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The given passage only mentions "Mrs. Horn," but does not provide any information or context that indicates contention or disagreement.


Passage number 639.
MS. HORN. I would like eventually to get back to targetingthe aggregates and to the previous operating procedures. The way I'dlike to do that is in some long-run sense--saying that by year-endwe'd like to be at such and such a point relative to the ranges. AndI'd like to be able to say that with regard to M1 particularly becauseof its controllability and its historic relationship with GNP. I'muncomfortable with the rate of growth in M1. I am interested inpursuing your analysis further, Jerry, but with the information I hadcoming into the meeting I am uncomfortable with the growth rates inM1. However, two problems I see as being very severe at this meetingare: (1) the velocity problems of Ml; and (2) the great uncertaintiesin the economic outlook. I agree with the staff forecast on theeconomy but I see a lot of downside risks. Of course, in the FourthFederal Reserve District we continue to have pretty dreary reports.So, I'm not ready to argue today for a return to the operatingtechniques that were previously used. I come out for alternative Bbecause of the tremendous uncertainties. I come out for directivelanguage II because I think it's one step toward returning at what Ihope would be an early date to the old operating procedures or to somemodification of the operating procedures. That would cause, perhaps,a slower adjustment to the long-run paths, but I do see that as verydefinitely the direction that we need to go and hopefully will be ableto go sooner rather than later. I'd like to end with a question toPeter, if I might, with regard to the term structure of interestrates. Could you just elaborate on the remarks you made in a coupleof sentences yesterday about short rates versus long rates and soforth. Could you elaborate on how you feel the market might react to,say, a slight increase in the fed funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any explicit disagreement or contention. The speaker is expressing their discomfort with the growth rates in M1 and highlighting some concerns about the velocity problems and economic outlook. However, they ultimately support alternative B and directivelanguage II as steps towards returning to previous operating procedures. There is no argument or disagreement presented.


Passage number 640.
MR. STERNLIGHT. What I said yesterday, President Horn, isthat I sense a great feeling of uncertainty in the market. As to whatkind of reaction there would be, on some occasions I've gotten thesense that the intermediate and longer end of the market would takequite comfortably--in some cases even welcome--a firming in shortrates as evidence that the Fed was still actively concerned withinflation and wanting to put a lid on monetary growth. But there alsohave been other occasions when the whole market has reacted. LastFriday when Kaufman's report came out--and maybe it was a littleexaggerated when it hit the ticker--the whole rate structure moved abit, both short and long rates. In the preceding week there had beena rather different picture, with short rates edging up but nothing atall happening on the longer rates. I think there was a sense amongsome people who took a somewhat longer, broader view that the highershort rates would not have to impact, even temporarily, on the longerend. So, I'm left in a bit of a quandary on just how the market isreacting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply describing different reactions and opinions in the market.


Passage number 641.
-53-3/28-29/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Isn't there some basis forreconciling the two different reactions in terms of the fact thatKaufman was talking about a very substantial move in short-term rateswhereas the earlier impression in the market was that it was just whatthey called a snugging up--20 to 30 basis points. I think that mayaccount for part of the difference in the reaction in the long end ofthe markets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is stating that there may be a basis for reconciling two different reactions in the market based on the understanding that Kaufman was discussing a significant move in short-term rates, while earlier impressions were that it would be a smaller adjustment.


Passage number 642.
MR. STERNLIGHT. That could be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple statement without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 643.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or statements that would indicate contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 644.
MR. KEEHN. I certainly am in agreement that the recovery isin place but I tend to be much more on the cautious side than otherpeople as to just how strong a literal recovery we have. It seems tome that so far the growth has been entirely on the interest sensitiveside of the economy and so far it has been uneven. The capital goodssector continues to be very weak and, therefore, at this point I thinkwe just couldn't run the risk of having rates go up significantly. Bythat I mean that I think the upper end of the fed funds range inalternative C would be unacceptably high. I think we can continue tosustain the recovery if we have fed funds broadly in the area of wherethey are now, in the 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent area or something likethat. On the other side, I do think there's an awful lot of noise,and I'm suitably confused by the level of noise in the aggregatenumbers. But there is rather compelling evidence that we have beenthrough a period of pretty rapid expansion and I think we have tobegin to set the stage to react to that at some point lest we let itget out of control. So, I think we ought to become a little moredirected in our language as to what we're going to do. I would be infavor of alternative II. Having said that, though, with regard to thedirective under alternative II, I'd leave in both parentheticalexpressions. I would be in favor of [the specifications of]alternative B, but I would tend to let the initial borrowing level goup to, say, $300 million, or broadly about where it is now. Thatseems to me to be an acceptable course given the circumstances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Keehn expresses caution and disagreement with others regarding the strength of the recovery and the potential risk of raising rates. He also mentions being confused by the noise in the aggregate numbers. However, he does agree that some action needs to be taken to avoid letting the situation get out of control.


Passage number 645.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot determine without the passage.


Passage number 646.
MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It probably will notcome as any surprise that I would join those who would not want to seeinterest rates rise any further. For clarity purposes, because of thestatement I made yesterday, I would agree generally with the staff'sforecast. Then turning to the percentage chance that it's right orwrong, I think the risk is on the down side rather than on the upside. That's particularly true in view of the experience we've hadwith two recessions in the last 3 years. I think we would be taking avery great risk if we [slow] this recovery down so that thepsychological impact on the public is such as to perhaps push us intoanother recession. So, I think the risk is on the down side. Thus, Iwould opt for a policy that would ensure that we would not increaseinterest rates above the present level. Just as a guide, I wouldthink that anything in the range of 9 percent or over in the federalfunds rate increases that risk very measurably and we should not takethat risk. I should also say that if you believe in the staff'sforecast in the Bluebook, for those who are interested in returning tothe targeted ranges of the aggregates that were established for theyear as a whole, you will find that alternative B would return both M2-54-3/28-29/83and M3 to within those ranges by midyear. And for M3 I bet it wouldbe before that. I think that's a pretty good track record,considering the uncertainty that we're facing today. With regard tothe directive, I would like to move back to the targeting of theaggregates sometime in the future. And I would just observe that whatwe're doing today is setting policy for the second quarter as a wholeand that this directive will not become public until after the nextmeeting. As a result, it seems to me that alternative II as adirective would be an appropriate policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 647.
MR. MORRIS. Inappropriate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the statement "MR. MORRIS. Inappropriate."


Passage number 648.
MR. GUFFEY. It would be an appropriate policy. I would optfor alternative B--for aggregate targeting and a move to alternativeII. I would keep the first parenthetical phrase. To emphasize myfeeling about interest rates and that they not move up, I would evenopt for a 5 to 9 percent federal funds rate range to ensure that therate doesn't go above 9 percent, although I don't think that'snecessary if there's some reasonable agreement around the table as towhat policy should be with respect to interest rates going up. On thepoint about how the market will react to higher interest rates, itseems to me that the earlier episode in which the market reacted to alittle snugging up if you will, in which long rates came down andshort rates went up, reestablished the Fed's credibility with regardto inflation. I don't think we ought to do it again. [Laughter] So,I would opt for alternative B with a borrowing level at $200 to $250million, simply based upon the history of the last 5 weeks ofborrowing. A level of $200 million would be acceptable; $250 millionwould be acceptable. To go above that, I think we would be holdingthe funds rate in the 8-3/4 percent or above range, and I'd feeluncomfortable about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and preference for a certain policy option and borrowing level. They also make a joke about the previous episode but it does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 649.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not provide any information or statement that suggests contention or disagreement.


Passage number 650.
MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I agree with Roger that themajor risk in the present situation is on the down side. It's a riskof possibly aborting the expansion, and the risk of reigniting double-digit inflation is considerably farther down the road. I think thebroader aggregates do not confirm the proposition that our currentpolicy is too expansionary. They suggest that it ought to be adequateto a produce a sustained upturn, but they are not indicating anexcessively expansionary policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Morris, agrees with Roger's statement about the major risk being on the downside and suggests that the current policy is not excessively expansionary according to the broader aggregates.


Passage number 651.
 I've been persuaded by JimDuesenberry that the very rapid rate of M1 growth can be explained bythe very sharp reduction in short-term money rates--that is, the costof holding money in the form of a NOW account is now relatively lowwhereas a year or so ago it was extremely high and, therefore--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You say you've been persuaded by Mr.Duesenberry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker states that they have been persuaded by Jim Duesenberry's argument, implying agreement with his view on the relationship between M1 growth and short-term money rates.


Passage number 652.
MR. MORRIS. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The response "yes" indicates that there is contention or disagreement in the passage. However, without the actual passage, it is difficult to provide further analysis.


Passage number 653.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I have to ask what equation Mr.Duesenberry has; our equation doesn't show it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 654.
MR. MORRIS. Well, I think it does. Doesn't our equationindicate that you would expect that, given the sharp decline in rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any conflicting viewpoints or opinions. It simply introduces Mr. Morris stating his belief without any opposing views or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 655.
And one other thing---55-3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states the name of a chairman without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 656.
 It goes in that direction, but it justdoesn't go above--MR. AXILROD. It doesn't have as big an effect. If it wereto explain what happened, the rate effect would have to be bigger thanin fact is built into the equation at the present time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that the rate effect is not as large as it should be in the equation.


Passage number 657.
MR. MORRIS. But I wonder about the equation since it wasbased on historical relationships. We've never had such a majordecline in rates before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Morris is expressing curiosity and questioning the accuracy of an equation based on historical relationships due to the unusual and significant decline in rates.


Passage number 658.
MR. AXILROD. The deficiency in our equations, or the onesthat fit through 1974, is rather obvious. The staff experimentallyhas been dealing with one fit through 1981, which tries to track OCDsseparately. So far we haven't been able to get a variable in therethat reflects the saving behavior very much. It has a sort oftechnical assumption that it behaves like a transaction account and Idon't think it's working quite right. I have some sympathy for whatyou're saying. Our equation doesn't quite give that result yet; maybeit should, but it doesn't yet. So, we have to explain this as ademand shift.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges the deficiencies in their equations and expresses sympathy for the other person's statements. They also mention that their equation does not accurately reflect the desired result yet, indicating a willingness to consider different perspectives.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 659.
MR. MORRIS. Well, so much for Ml. I'm still uncomfortablewith having an M2 target at this juncture because the second-quartertargets here are based on assumptions as to how rapidly the adjustmentto the money market demand account is going to be completed. Theassumption may be good or it may not be good. It seems to me that inthis period of transition the case for having an M2 target is not verystrong any more. It seems to me we'd be better off with simply an M3target, as Tony has suggested I think. Until we get some furtherevidence to tell us how strong the expansion is going to be--and weshould get that in the next couple of weeks when we get Marchemployment numbers, which ought to be a pretty good indicator--itseems reasonable to hold to the present level of interest rates. ButI would agree with Nancy in the sense that I would urge the Manager,when he has to make a choice, to err on the side of a little moreease. Lately we seem to have be erring on the side of a little morerestraint, which I don't think is particularly appropriate at thisjuncture. I would keep the existing directive language. I don'tthink we're ready yet to move to a strict aggregates targetingapproach.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Morris expresses discomfort with having an M2 target and suggests an M3 target instead. He also disagrees with the current stance of monetary policy and urges for more ease.


Passage number 660.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We've run out of volunteers. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a fact that they have run out of volunteers. There is no contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 661.
MR. BOYKIN. Well, Mr. Chairman, I certainly share all of theuncertainties about trying to decipher what information we have. Butemotionally, in giving my view of the economic forecast, I tend toagree with Lyle Gramley and Bob Black that somewhere between "B" and"C" is the more appropriate posture to be in. I recognize the risksthat have been pointed out, but what we have done over the lastseveral weeks seems appropriate. If I were going to err, I would erra bit on the restraint side at this point. So, "B" or somewherebetween "B" and "C" is where I would come out. On the directive, Iwould go to Roman numeral II or alternative B, primarily as anindication, as Karen would say, that we are trying to move back inthat direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses personal agreement with the views of others and acknowledges the risks but ultimately agrees with a certain approach.


Passage number 662.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I cannot determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage as you did not provide any text to analyze. Please provide the relevant passage so I can assist you better.


Passage number 663.
-56-3/28-29/83MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I would join those who areweighing the downside risks more heavily than pleasant surprises. Ido not believe the consumer has returned to the counter, except to thecounter in the commercial bank branch to obtain currency. And,therefore, until he or she does return to the retailer's counter, Ithink the fragility of the financial system, domestic andinternational, and the flow of bad news that is going to makefootprints through the reports of commercial banks--[unintelligible]Mexico, and the report of International Harvester, and the series ofbad news that has not yet shown through--are not going to add to theconfidence of the consumer or the depositor.On the other hand, in terms of the operating procedures, Iwould leave the language alone. There's enough confusion out there inthe financial markets for us--in the Chairman's speeches or in the expost review of directives--to look as though we have deemphasized M2at this meeting, just as the rate of growth of that aggregate beginsto come down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 664.
 I would not favor--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure what you mean by leave thelanguage unchanged; we need more than that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker states that they do not favor leaving the language unchanged, but they express confusion or skepticism about the idea of leaving it unchanged without further clarification or elaboration.


Passage number 665.
MR. MARTIN. I would leave the directive language, sir.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage as Mr. Martin is simply stating his suggestion to leave the directive language.


Passage number 666.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Meaning alternative I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "meaning alternative" denotes that there are different possible interpretations or understandings of something, but it does not indicate any disagreement or contention between those interpretations.


Passage number 667.
MR. MARTIN. Yes. I would join Governor Wallich in terms ofthe passthrough, if you will, from large growth rates in M1 and evenM2 through the employment effects and prices. I think the good oldlead/lag relationship of a year or two from the Ms to prices is highlycomplicated now because unemployment is not a function of [lax]aggregate demand, but rather reflects very significantly thestructural changes in our economy, the more effective internationalcompetition, and the changing demographics. I think there are a lotof reasons why the good old correlation is going to have a wider band[of uncertainty] around it now.On these bases, I think alternative C is too dangerous. Iremind the Committee again that the sample of 200 banks shows the MMDArate actually rising 25 basis points to 8.47 percent on a nationalbasis. There's no geographic difference; it's across the country thatthere is a firming of rates on that instrument. It's across sizeclasses; it doesn't matter how big or how small the banks are. Thesample--admittedly it's only 200--shows a firming of those rates. Itshows the Super NOW rate at 7.30 percent. Also, this is occurringsimultaneously with the reduction in [the rate on] Merrill Lynch's CMAaccount, which is a transaction account, of over 50 basis points.Back to the consumer: I don't think the consumer believes that theSocial Security system is safe any more. We all have reviewed thetechnicalities and the funding and assumptions there and have reachedone conclusion; I don't think the ordinary consumer believes it. Iconcede that it might be useful in terms of fiscal policy for us tofirm rates further, because in my conversations with a few people inthe Congress, both in the Senate and the House, it looks as thoughthere's a good deal of pessimism as to any short-run action by theCongress now that the so-called Social Security restructuring hastaken place. It might be useful for us to firm rates and, therefore,put pressure on Congress, but I don't think that's appropriate in3/28-29/83terms of the downside risk that is out there; the price is too high ona benefits/costs basis. I would go, therefore, for alternative B andhaving a good deal of flexibility, which it shows, in the fed fundsrate. There may be times when we want to put a little upward pressureon rates, but not such as to threaten this fragile recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, is expressing his agreement with Governor Wallich's viewpoint on the relationship between M1 and M2 growth rates, employment effects, and prices. He also discusses his concerns about the complications of the lead/lag relationship between the Ms and prices and the structural changes in the economy. He argues against alternative C and suggests alternative B as his preferred option. Throughout the passage, Mr. Martin is presenting his thoughts and opinions without any disagreement with others.


Passage number 668.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage as the passage is not provided. Please provide the passage for further analysis.


Passage number 669.
MR. ROBERTS. Mr. Chairman, first, I have 3 comments--ondistortion, velocity, and real rates. My staff looked at thereference to the Board's survey on the effects of MMDAs, which wasreported in The Wall Street Journal, that said 3 percent came from Mlcomponents and 25 percent of the Super NOWS came from nontransactionbalances. And taking just nonseasonally adjusted measures, weconclude from that that the effect--if there has been any distortionat all, it's very modest--has been to increase the rate of growth inMl, either measured from July to February or from December toFebruary. I don't think the distortion is significant on Ml.Secondly, with respect to velocity, I think a question we ought to askourselves is: What is the rapid growth of money having to do with thecollapse of velocity and will that be corrected by a slowing in therate of growth. As to real rates, I think Steve made the point thatreal rates are a function of what prices people are looking at:historical, current, and prospective. And someone made the point thatprospective rates in the minds of the public were still pretty high,so maybe real rates aren't really that high. I don't know what theywill turn out to be eventually, but I believe we've had long periodsof time when real rates were high and economic recovery and expansionoccurred. The 1920s is an example. I've always thought the goal ofthe System is having sustainable economic expansion without undueinflation. And I think that's what we ought to try to do rather thancontrol interest rates. Interest rates often go down in an economicexpansion and it's not unusual that they will fluctuate in theprocess.I believe the economic recovery is well under way and isspreading. I saw an excellent indication of confidence in yesterday'spaper where I noted that a bankrupt company, Chrysler, in a highlycyclical mature industry, sold $400 million worth of stock. Thatseems to me to indicate there is some confidence around. I think thebig risk is a resumption of inflation. And if we keep money growingat the pace that it's growing now, particularly as measured by Ml, weare certain--not in '83 but in '84 and '85--to have excessive priceinflation. And if we're really interested in holding interest ratesdown, the way to do that is to avoid the expansion in money that willlead to higher prices and that will lead to higher mortgage rates andlong-term bond rates. So, my view would be that we need to startslowing the growth of the monetary aggregates, particularly Ml sincethat's the one that's least distorted and most related, with respectto its predictive value, to the economy. I think we have the [growth]rates so high that it would be wrong to jerk them down to a low rate;my view would be that we ought to move gradually to the middle of our4 to 8 percent [Ml] target by the fourth quarter. I would like to seeus move to about a 7 percent level for this quarter and come on downgradually from there over the balance of the year. I'd like to seelanguage in the directive showing a return to emphasis on Ml. And Ithink we should, by all means, avoid interest rate targeting or justsomething called judgment with no standards, because that I think will3/28-29/83create a situation in the market that would be the reverse of what wewould like to have.

Passage number 670.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Which alternative would that put youon, "B plus".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The question is asking for a choice or preference, rather than presenting conflicting arguments or opposing views.


Passage number 671.
MR. ROBERTS. "A.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Roberts, is quoted without any conflicting opinions or contrasting views expressed.


Passage number 672.
"MR. PARTEE. You're looking for something around 7 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they are looking for something around 7 percent.


Passage number 673.
MR. ROBERTS. Right, but for the quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simple statement where Mr. Roberts agrees with the previous speaker. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 674.
MR. PARTEE. I'm not sure that does it, but that's March toJune at 7-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement expressing uncertainty and a personal opinion.


Passage number 675.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Which one would give you 7 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The question is straightforward and does not introduce any conflicting viewpoints or opinions.


Passage number 676.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, "A" is indicated at 7-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that "A" is indicated at 7-1/2 percent.


Passage number 677.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You're talking about March to June, I takeit, when you say the quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is asking for clarification about a specific time period mentioned (March to June) and does not involve any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 678.
MR. ROBERTS. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 679.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boehne.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or statements that suggest contention or disagreement. It only mentions Mr. Boehne without any conflicting views or debates.


Passage number 680.
MR. BOEHNE. Someone--it may have been Lyle--said that inthis kind of environment one can find evidence to support almost anyposition, and I think that's right. That always happens in periods ofuncertainty. People rely on their basic instincts when there is a lotof uncertainty and in this specific situation I think it comes down tohow much faith one has in Ml--how comfortable one is with judgmentoverriding the rules that have served us reasonably well. It seems tome that if there ever was a strong case for using judgment inoverriding these Ml rules, it's now. All the reasons have been tickedoff: the massive redistribution of funds; the almost unprecedentedcontinuous decline in velocity--on the broader aggregates, the broaderone goes the less of a problem one sees--the high real costs; and thevery moderate recovery. So, it seems to me that judgment leads onerather persuasively for not tightening. On the other hand, there is agreat deal of sensitivity in the market. I think that argues for notloosening. So, I fall into the group that comes out for about nochange. It does seem to me that the snugging up did prove a point.But I would prefer to see the Desk make these decisions a little moreevenhandedly in the coming period and not bias them on the side oftightening up. I would not want to see the funds rate rise to 9percent. I think a rate somewhere in a range of 8-1/2 to 8-3/4percent would be satisfactory. On the wording of the directive, Idon't have strong feelings between I and II; I could live with eitherone. I have some preference for alternative I at this point, largelybecause I think that we're heading into a period where ultimatelywe're going to have to wean the markets from their devotion to Ml.Jerry's comment that we need a new mouse trap is an apt one. I thinkwe're moving into a period when we do need that and I would not wantto make that job more difficult. That would lean me towardalternative I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing their own thoughts and preferences, but there is no indication of disagreement or debate with others.


Passage number 681.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Ford.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 682.
MR. ROBERTS. Steve, a question: These March-to-June ratesare annual rates, are they not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement and a question for clarification.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 683.
MR. AXILROD. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. 

Explanation: The presence of the word "Yes" indicates that there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 684.
MR. ROBERTS. So M1 at 7-1/2 percent is an annual rate ofgrowth during the quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about M1 growth rate during the quarter.


Passage number 685.
MR. AXILROD. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod simply affirms that the previous statement is correct.


Passage number 686.
MR. ROBERTS. So, that would be dropping from 24 percent inFebruary or from 6 months of growth at 14 or 15 percent, which wouldbe a very substantial decline in the rate of growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of facts and a hypothetical scenario.


Passage number 687.
MR. AXILROD. That's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Axilrod simply agrees with the previous statement.


Passage number 688.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think we have some coffee out there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement is a simple observation or statement of fact, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 689.
[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we've been all over in the variouscomments. I'm not sure anybody is suggesting anything all thatradical, but we've certainly explored every side of the issue. My ownfeeling is that this is not the time for anything too radical oranything radical at all pending a little [more] evidence, as somepeople have said, both about the aggregates and about the economy. Wehave a set of projections; I don't know what weight you put on them--not too much, I guess. The projections for the aggregates lookbeautiful, but they often look more beautiful than the reality. Ijust don't know what weight to give them, but if it all came outwithin the ranges of any of these projections we'd be looking not toobad so far as the aggregates are concerned. It would be interestingto know what will happen on some of the latest economic data. I'msure it always is interesting, but it may be a little more so thanusual. I come away with a rather strong feeling that whatever we do,3/28-29/83we probably ought to be meeting again before May 24th. I would planto have a telephone meeting or something, anyway. Maybe we won't doanything, but at least 3 or 4 weeks from now perhaps we shouldreexamine the situation against the context of, I presume, not doinganything very striking right now. But if we got a combination, let'ssay, of high aggregates and a strong economy, maybe we would have tobe a little more decisive than anything I have heard discussed thismorning. We could have the aggregates coming out as projected and theeconomy not doing much, and then it would look quite different. So, Iwould assume that we can meet again before too long, presumably viathe telephone.I do not think we're in any position--and only one or twopeople suggested it--to go back to a more rigid operating techniqueright now. I think there are a few more fundamental questions for thefuture if these aggregates don't straighten themselves out relative tobusiness activity in the coming months. But we're not going toresolve that question this morning. In the preliminary comments wehad a perfect split, as near as I can see, between those who likealternative I and alternative II as a matter of presentation. Therewere about the same number in favor of one as the other, with somestraddling in the middle. But if one looks at the central tendency ofthe comments, assuming we use alternative II--I don't want toforeclose that question [unintelligible]--something like alternative Bseems to come closest to the center of gravity. There may be a bit ofshading on the up side, depending upon whether you look at the [viewsof] Committee members or the others. There was a feeling that was notunanimous, nor did everybody comment on it--. To put it in a slightlydifferent form, there was a reluctance to precipitate a general changein interest rates, including the prime rate and everything else.Well, we're on the margin of that right now, I suppose. So, leaving abit open the question of which way to phrase it in the directive--although I would assume that maybe a little more straightforward wayis to use the alternative II formulation--let me suggest, whicheverformulation, something like alternative B with the same federal fundsrate range that we've been using and, just to throw out a number, aborrowings figure around $250 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 690.
MS. TEETERS. We had $200 million in the last one, didn't we.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any sign of contention or disagreement. It is a simple question asking for confirmation about a previous amount mentioned.


Passage number 691.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, but in fact we've been running aboveit. We've been running above that partly because the excess reservesare much larger than I at least was assuming at the time of the lastmeeting. I assumed that $200 million borrowing level with $300 or$300 plus million excess reserves and implied small free reserves.That's what we were talking about at the last meeting. In fact, wehad a higher borrowing level but also a higher free reserve level thanI assumed we were talking about. How those two things balance out,I'm not quite sure. I think it's fair to say that in the last fewweeks, anyway, we've been a little more concerned about supplying toomany reserves rather than supplying too few, particularly given theexcess reserves we had earlier in the period. That can be changed,but that's the way I think it's fair to say we were leaning to makethe errors--not to aim for errors but to have more assurance againstexcessive excess reserves than the reverse.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply explaining the situation and the speaker's understanding of it.


Passage number 692.
62-3/28-29/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Nancy, the $250 million borrowingassumption is more likely to result in the present 8-3/4 percent[funds rate] than 8-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a statement about the likelihood of the borrowing assumption resulting in a specific funds rate.


Passage number 693.
MS. TEETERS. That's what I realized. I would much prefer a$175 to $200 million figure in free reserves and then on the basis ofthat take account of the excess as we're doing it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by Ms. Teeters about her preference for a specific figure in free reserves.


Passage number 694.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. $175 to $200 million in free reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states a range of free reserves without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting information.


Passage number 695.
MS. TEETERS. No, it would be a negative free reserve figureof $175 to $200 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states a fact or a statement without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 696.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You don't want a negative figure there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement is straightforward and does not involve any disagreement or opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 697.
MS. TEETERS. No, I don't want a negative figure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply states that they do not want a negative figure.


Passage number 698.
MR. WALLICH. I don't think we want [to target on] freereserves in principle, whether positive or negative, because theyreally reach far back into the Federal Reserve's past and areassociated with some outstanding misconceptions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses their opinion that they do not think targeting on free reserves is desirable, stating it is associated with some misconceptions.


Passage number 699.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It wasn't too bad of a past: 4 percentreal growth and little inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage presents a positive assessment of the past, mentioning a 4 percent real growth rate and little inflation. There is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 700.
MR. PARTEE. Back in the good old days.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any conflicting or opposing viewpoints. It appears to be a general statement or reminiscence about a past time period.


Passage number 701.
MR. RICE. [I would prefer] whatever level of reserves isconsistent with an 8-1/2 percent funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Rice, expresses his preference for a specific level of reserves, but there is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement mentioned.


Passage number 702.
MS. TEETERS. I take $250 million to be reaffirming an 8-3/4to 9 percent funds rate and I think that's too tight.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It only presents the opinion of Ms. Teeters regarding the funds rate being too tight.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 703.
MR. AXILROD. Governor Teeters, if I may: I don't know ifMr. Sternlight agrees or not, but I would assume given our pastexperience that if $250 million were attained, and assuming excessreserves came in on a somewhat normal track, that it is more likelythan not that the funds rate would edge back down from this recentlevel. It might not get below 8-1/2 percent, but I would think it'dbe more likely to be edging to an 8-1/2 to 8-3/4 percent range orsomewhere in there. I don't think that would tend to confirm recentexperience as much as, say, $300 to $350 million would. Maybe Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The quote from Mr. Sternlight implies that he may not agree with Mr. Axilrod's assumption regarding the potential decrease in the funds rate if $250 million is attained.


Passage number 704.
Sternlight can--MR. STERNLIGHT. I'd say just about that: that $250 millionin borrowing would tend to give you a funds rate of 8-1/2 to 8-3/4percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 705.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it depends again on what one looksat. If you look at the last 4 weeks, we had borrowings of $415, $331,$568, and $295 million; we've been above, as I said, all along. Butwe've also been above on the excess reserve side by an even moresubstantial margin. So we had significant free reserves during allthat period except one week when we made a mistake--we didn't make amistake but on the last day of the week we had a big shortfall. Wehad practically zero free reserves last week: they were minus one. Itwas the week that we had the shortfall [unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information about the borrowing and excess reserve levels over a specific period of time.


Passage number 706.
-63-3/28-29/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The only plausible explanation I'veheard for the high level of excess reserves is that some banks arebeing slow to adjust their planning and their operations to takeaccount of the fact that some of their funds, such as the MMDAs, movedto their reserve free situation. And then there have been otherchanges in reserve requirements. Some banks are slower than others.If that's true, then over a period of time we ought to see a trendingdownward of this tendency toward large excess reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not feature any contention or disagreement. It simply presents an explanation for the high level of excess reserves and suggests that some banks may be slower than others in adjusting their operations. There is no conflicting opinion or conflicting viewpoint expressed.


Passage number 707.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, last week they were just about $300million, which somehow I have in my mind is normal; it hasn't beenvery normal recently. If you go back to February, there were a coupleof weeks that it was $300 million. Well, how satisfactory orunsatisfactory is that.

Passage number 710.
 We have to figure outthe wording of the directive and any modification of the--MS. TEETERS. Well, I think that $250 million is confirmingthe snugging. It means that we've added 25 and perhaps 50 basispoints to the federal funds rate [and it is] above the discount ratenow. I am opposed to that and I think we should be easing slightly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opposition to the current situation and stating their preference for easing policy slightly.


Passage number 711.
MR. GRAMLEY. I think that level of borrowing is quite allright. I would note particularly that, although short-term rates area little higher than they were at the time of the last FOMC meeting,longer-term rates--the important ones--are in fact down. So, I thinkwe've not had any additional tightening in any meaningful sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of opinion by Mr. Gramley stating that the level of borrowing is acceptable and noting the decrease in longer-term rates.


Passage number 712.
MR. ROBERTS. Is the assumption that, if the borrowing levelis maintained at that level and credit demands rise, we simplyaccommodate them to hold the interest rates and expand reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is a statement or inquiry about a hypothetical scenario.


Passage number 713.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That depends upon how much they rise. Itmight be. If the aggregates were running decisively high, obviously,there is some implication that we're going to snug up--to use thatterm. But we don't use an absolutely mechanical formula to do it. Ifthey were lower, with probably some lapse--if it continued to beconfirmed over a few weeks--we would move lower. We would takeaccount of all other evidence we had in that process and, as I said,we will meet again in a month or so. We wouldn't be terribly quick tochange but, yes, we would change though not be mechanical about it.We wouldn't change next week because they were high for one week.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 714.
MR. MARTIN. But you would avoid a 9 percent funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement by Mr. Martin does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement reflecting a suggested course of action.


Passage number 715.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, you say avoid it. It could comealong with this. I don't think it would probably stay there, butagain, if we were absolutely at this borrowing number and if we raisedit because the aggregates were coming in high and the economy wasstrong, it would certainly be there. But it might be there for days,or a week or something. I would not think that that would be likelyin the short run, but I can't say it absolutely wouldn't happen. Iwould think more like Steve: that, if anything, it would come down to8-1/2 percent or a little higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining their thoughts and opinions on a certain situation, but there is no contradiction or disagreement present.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not mention any interpretation or qualifications.


Passage number 717.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that's not really my interpretationof that sentence. I'm not saying that at this point. I don't knowwhat those continuing distortions would be right now. We can alwayshave an unusual demand for liquidity. But I would say, yes, we wouldexpect M2 to run higher than any of these numbers that we're talkingabout if this new money market deposit account continued to grow at agreat rate of speed--significantly beyond what we're projecting now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is presenting their own interpretation and uncertainties about certain numbers, but there is no indication of disagreement with anyone else.

I think this sentence was carried over from a period when there weremore distortions than now and I'm not sure it's quite as--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker suggests that the sentence may no longer be accurate and questions its relevance.


Passage number 719.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion and suggesting the use of qualitative words to show that they are not mechanically following a certain target.


Passage number 720.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Maybe you ought to have a show ofhands on alternative I versus alternative II because I thinkalternative I avoids certain of these problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It simply suggests having a show of hands to consider different alternatives to solve certain problems.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 721.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm afraid the show of hands as to sheerpreference would show an even split, unless somebody has changed hismind. I don't know if anybody who has expressed a preference one wayor the other feels strongly about it, because I think it's a questionof how strongly people feel. If somebody feels strongly about eitheralternative I or II and wants to reiterate a position or change aposition, they ought to say it. Unless people have changed theirminds the sheer preference will be 5, 5, and 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that the show of hands would show an even split, indicating that there is disagreement among the group. Additionally, the speaker mentions the possibility of someone changing their mind or expressing a strong preference, further suggesting contention.

MR. PARTEE. What you've described sounds a lot more likealternative A than it does alternative B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion that the described scenario aligns more closely with alternative A rather than alternative B.


Passage number 723.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Alternative I.

-65-3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That makes them virtually the same exceptit puts in the "existing degree of" words. It tells you whatrestraint there is a little more explicitly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply provides additional clarification or explanation about the similarity between two things.


Passage number 731.
MR. PARTEE. To me alternative B sounds as if it's beingdriven by growth of M2 and M3 and alternative A sounds as if it'sgoing on regardless of Ml, M2 or M3. This says that we have anexpectation. It means we start off with the existing reserveconditions and have an expectation--which may be wrong--that therewill be this performance in M2 and M3. And then if we're wrong aboutthe expectation, it seems to me there would be a basis forreconsidering.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no direct contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply expressing his interpretation and understanding of the alternatives presented. He is suggesting that alternative B seems to be influenced by the growth of M2 and M3, while alternative A seems to be independent of M1, M2, or M3. He also mentions the possibility of the expectation being wrong, which could lead to reconsideration. However, this does not indicate a strong disagreement or contention.


Passage number 732.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That is true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the statement "That is true." The statement simply agrees with or affirms the truth of something without expressing any conflicting views or opinions.

Passage number 735.
MR. WALLICH.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage since the given text fragment "MR. WALLICH" does not provide any information or context to indicate disagreement or contention. It appears to be a standalone reference to someone's name or title.

Passage number 739.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't see anything the matterparticularly with saying the existing degree of reserve restraintwould be appropriate. "The Committee seeks to maintain the existingdegree of restraint"--or roughly the existing degree of restraint orgenerally maybe--"anticipating that restraint would be consistent witha slowing in the growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of ___ and ___percent, respectively. The Committee also anticipates that Mlgrowth...." It's a rather straightforward blending of the two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is describing a straightforward blending of two ideas, without conflicting or contradictory elements.


Passage number 740.
MR. ROBERTS. And would those rates, Paul, be the rates outof alternatives A and B and so on.

Passage number 743.
MR. MARTIN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough context to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 744.
 "A" and "B" or--MR. PARTEE. They'd be 9, 8, and 6 percent, I guess, for "B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states the different percentages that "A" and "B" would be.


Passage number 745.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that depends upon what you want toput down, whether it's "B" or some blending of "A" and "B" or someblending of "B" and "C." Other people want some blending of "B" and"C," which seems too low to me. Why do we say "for the more immediatefuture".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage is expressing different possibilities or options ("blending of A and B" or "blending of B and C") and discussing personal opinions on those options ("seems too low to me").

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply states that there are two possible ways to do something.


Passage number 756.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let's put anticipating in here;anticipating is a little stronger word. "...anticipating that wouldbe consistent with a slowing from March to June in growth of M2 and M3to annual rates of 9 and 8 percent, respectively" is what "B" says.Then "The Committee expects that Ml growth at an annual rate of aboutpercent would be consistent with its objectives....
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply explains that the Committee anticipates a slowing in the growth of M2 and M3, while also stating the Committee's expectation for M1 growth. There is no conflicting or contradictory information provided.


Passage number 757.
"MR. AXILROD. Do you want to use the word "objectives" there.

CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm reading the second sentence inalternative I as it's written.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 797.
MR. RICE. It's the same as this part; that's in theparenthesis in alternative II.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 798.
MR. PARTEE. A narrative sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage consists of a statement by Mr. Partee, which does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 799.
MR. GRAMLEY. If you take the sentence from alternative IIinstead, you don't have to worry about it because it says "a morepronounced slowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating a fact or providing an alternative option.


Passage number 800.
"VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. More pronounced than projected.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that something is "more pronounced than projected," without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 801.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, what about the second part. Irather like leaving the "relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges." I don't think it has any substance, as opposed to theother wording, but it ties it back to the long-term ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal preference for leaving a certain phrase, but acknowledges that it still ties back to the long-term ranges mentioned earlier. There is no conflicting opinion or disagreement between parties.


Passage number 802.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Instead of saying "appreciableslowing" why not take the "more pronounced slowing".
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The suggestion to use "more pronounced slowing" instead of "appreciable slowing" is merely a suggestion or alternative phrase and does not imply any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 803.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, put "Lesser restraint would beacceptable in the context of more pronounced slowing of growth in themonetary aggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-termranges." We could put "or indications of a weakening in the pace ofeconomic recovery," as somebody suggested to me at one point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It is simply conveying a suggestion that alternative language could be used to express a similar idea.


Passage number 804.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Very common sense.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "very common sense" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It implies that something is logical or widely understood, without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 805.
MR. PARTEE. We're not going to have much evidence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. In this passage, Mr. Partee is simply stating a fact or opinion without opposing or conflicting views being presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 806.
 It willbe mixed, and depending on which figure one likes to emphasize--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The more we put in, the more likelywe'll be wrong. That's why I don't like short-term targets thereassociated with operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a disagreement regarding whether or not short-term targets should be associated with operations. One perspective is that it will be mixed and there is a likelihood of being wrong if more is put in. The other perspective is that the speaker does not like short-term targets associated with operations.


Passage number 807.
 We're more likely--3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me leave aside the borrowing level atthe moment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is discussing a specific topic without taking a specific stance or presenting conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 808.
MS. TEETERS. I'm not sure I know where you are on thelanguage.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Ms. Teeters is unsure of the person's stance on language.


Passage number 809.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let me just repeat where I am on thelanguage: "For the short run, the Committee seeks to maintaingenerally the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions,anticipating that would consistent with a slowing from March to Junein growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of about 9 and 8 percent,respectively. The Committee expects that M1 growth at an annual rateof about 6 to 7 percent would be consistent with its objectives forthe broader aggregates. Lesser restraint would be acceptable in thecontext of more pronounced slowing of growth in the monetaryaggregates relative to the paths implied by the long-term ranges(taking account of the distortions relating to the introduction of newaccounts), or indications of a weakening in the pace of economicrecovery." And then the last sentence remains as it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information about their position on language and monetary policy.


Passage number 810.
MS. TEETERS. Would you read the first sentence over again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any statement or indication of contention or disagreement. It is a simple request to have the first sentence re-read.


Passage number 811.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "For the short run the Committee seeks tomaintain generally the existing degree of restraint on reservepositions, anticipating that would be consistent with a slowing fromMarch to June in growth of M2 and M3 to annual rates of about 9 and 8percent, respectively.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is stating the Committee's goal of maintaining the existing degree of restraint on reserve positions in order to slow down the growth of M2 and M3. There is no contention or disagreement present.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 812.
"MR. GUFFEY. You have discarded the first parentheticalsentence in alternative II and you have tried to incorporate anadditional sentence. But wouldn't it be better to keep that firstparenthetical sentence simply to maintain flexibility because of theuncertainty we're looking at in the aggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker is expressing disagreement with discarding the first parenthetical sentence and suggests keeping it for flexibility.


Passage number 813.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, just looking at the structure ofthis, I think we would have to make the point in the discussion thatthese projections of 9 and 8 percent, and indeed the Ml projection,assume relatively little distortion--basically none in Ml and whateverwe're assuming for M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their thought and suggesting a point that needs to be made during a discussion.


Passage number 814.
MR. AXILROD. Only about 1 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is providing a fact or statistic without expressing any disagreement or debate.


Passage number 815.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. So, it would be clear that if indeed thatassumption were wrong--let's say particularly for M2--and we had somereasonably clear evidence that it was wrong, the 9 percent wouldn't berelevant. It would have to be adjusted; that's implied by thesentence I left in, instead of on the other side. We can make a morecomplicated sentence by saying that would be consistent with a slowingfrom March to June in growth of M2 and M3 to these figures and assumesthat the distortions aren't going to be very great. We could add asentence on there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is expressing a hypothetical scenario and discussing the implications of that scenario. There is no clear contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 816.
MR. GUFFEY. That brings it up and highlights the uncertaintyand grants to the Committee and to the Desk the flexibility that wemay need in this period, which is a full quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing his opinion and stating the flexibility that may be needed without any conflicting views being presented.


Passage number 817.
MR. PARTEE. Of course, the first thing we're doing, Roger,is specifying the degree of reserve restraint. That's the basic-703/28-29/83instruction, as I see it, to the Desk. Then it says we expect thatthat's going to be consistent with those M2 and M3 numbers. But ourexpectations could wrong. They could be wrong in part because westill haven't allowed for the distortions. So it seems to me that atthat point we could say we haven't allowed for the distortions; eventhough they are high, we're not going to change this direction to theManager.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing the process of specifying reserve restraint and acknowledging that their expectations could be wrong due to potential distortions.


Passage number 818.
MR. GUFFEY. The fact of the matter is that the only realpurpose this directive is going to serve is for public consumption.If I understand what the Chairman said earlier, we're not going tochange our operating regime in the intermeeting period and I thinkthat's appropriate. This is going to become public on May 25 or somesuch date. And to the extent that we have done something thatdeviated from what we think we're doing today and from what we hopewill happen in the period ahead, then the flexibility that's builtinto the statement requires less explanation after it becomes public.That's my only point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is an explanation or clarification of a statement made by the Chairman.


Passage number 819.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think you're right about the operatingtechnique in a narrow sense. But I would assume by putting this inthe directive that, if these aggregates came in significantly higherwithout a clear explanation in terms of distortions, the first part ofthe first sentence might well be overridden.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the other person's point about the operating technique, but adds an additional assumption or condition that could override it in certain circumstances.


Passage number 820.
MR. PARTEE. I think that's right if there is no explanation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 821.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If that amounts to anything, I assume wewould have a Committee meeting. But we are expressing a presumptionhere that with a Committee consultation presumably, if [the growth ofthe aggregates] were significantly above or at all pronounced, our[general] inclination would be to go in that direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, there is no clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply stating their assumption and expressing their inclination if certain conditions are met.


Passage number 822.
MS. TEETERS. Regardless of what is going on elsewhere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage because the speaker, Ms. Teeters, is expressing a statement without any conflicting opinions or opposing views mentioned.


Passage number 823.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, as I say, with a Committeeconsultation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that there was a committee consultation.


Passage number 824.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Basically you're scrapping the[notion of] unusual demands for liquidity, which gives us completeflexibility on anything. That comes with every possible situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply explaining that by scrapping unusual demands for liquidity, they have complete flexibility in any situation.


Passage number 825.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think Chuck is right: that the firstpart of the sentence is "maintain generally the existing degree ofrestraint," so we wouldn't change it very much without a consultation.But the whole indication is that we would change with a consultationif growth were appreciably above. It can always be overridden later,but that's the bias on it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No
Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement with Chuck's interpretation of the sentence and discussing the potential for change with consultation. The statement about being overridden later also indicates a bias, but there is no explicit disagreement presented.


Passage number 826.
MR. PARTEE. Or appreciably below.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement made by Mr. Partee.


Passage number 827.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if it's below, we'd need lessconsultation, I suppose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is expressing a conditional situation and there is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement presented.


Passage number 828.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, I think that's right: Less consultation ifwe had some news that it's lower and that the economy is suddenlyweakening or something.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is a statement in agreement with the previous statement or suggestion.


Passage number 829.
3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's a much easier decision, I suspect.If it's really low and the economy is low, we're going to move.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 830.
MR. WALLICH. I would favor something that points in thedirection of consultation rather than automaticity if the case arises.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply states Mr. Wallich's preference for favoring consultation over automaticity in a certain situation.


Passage number 831.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. This does, implicitly, doesn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is a statement that implies something without explicitly stating it. Without further context, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning or intention of the statement.


Passage number 832.
MR. WALLICH. Yes. That's what it does and why I favor it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Wallich, expresses his agreement and support for something without any opposing viewpoint presented.


Passage number 833.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Then we can put some language in thepolicy record write up. Is this generally acceptable. Do I interpretthe silence in that direction. If the language is all right, let'scome back to the numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting adding language to a policy record and questioning whether the silence indicates acceptance. The second sentence is a rhetorical question, not expressing disagreement. The last sentence suggests revisiting the numbers, but does not indicate any disagreement about them.


Passage number 834.
MR. ROBERTS. This language would include the sentence on fedfunds at the bottom.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It appears to be a statement made by Mr. Roberts without any conflicting views or arguments presented.


Passage number 835.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, that's just standard language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply stating that the language being used is standard and does not indicate any conflicting or opposing views.


Passage number 836.
MR. ROBERTS. That would be 6 to 10 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple statement of an estimated percentage.


Passage number 837.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, the clear implication is that itwould be 6 to 10 percent. Is that right. Let me check what I assumeis the easy number first; 6 to 10 percent is what we've had. But westill have to decide what numbers to put in there for M2 and M3 andfor M1 and decide on the borrowing assumption. Basically, if weoperated off alternative B, it's going to be 9 and 8 percent and 6 to7 percent, as we just discussed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that they need to determine the specific numbers to use for M2 and M3, and decide on the borrowing assumption. They mention the possibility of using alternative B, which would result in different percentages, but there is no disagreement or argument present.


Passage number 838.
MR. CORRIGAN. Put 6 to 7 percent for Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Corrigan suggests putting 6 to 7 percent for Ml.


Passage number 839.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Is that all right. It's 9, 8, and 6 to 7percent. We're down to the borrowing number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information about interest rates without any indication of disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 840.
MR. PARTEE. I find $250 million acceptable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, expresses acceptance of a certain amount of money, $250 million.


Passage number 841.
MR. RICE. I could live with $250 million, but I would preferto err in the direction 8-1/4 percent rather than 8-3/4 percent on thefunds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rice is expressing his preference for a lower interest rate (8-1/4 percent) rather than a higher one (8-3/4 percent), but there is no indication of conflict or disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 842.
MS. TEETERS. I would be in the same position.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement from Ms. Teeters about her position.


Passage number 843.
MR. GRAMLEY. I would go the other direction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement simply expresses a different perspective or alternative approach without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 844.
MR. ROBERTS. So would I.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts agrees with the previous statement.


Passage number 845.
MR. WALLICH. We've been at about $250 million for a longtime, so it doesn't hurt much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there does not appear to be any contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the amount of money, without expressing any disagreement or conflicting points of view.


Passage number 846.
MR. RICE. I know, but we've also been pushing 8-3/4 and8-7/8 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that they have been pushing for certain percentages, without any indication of conflict or disagreement among the parties involved.


Passage number 847.
MR. ROBERTS. The problem with $250 million is that unlessone makes an assumption that there has been a distortion that's beenpushing the growth of the aggregates--and that doesn't appear to bethe case with M1--$250 million does not come anywhere near the growthpath that we're talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Roberts is simply stating a fact about the problem with $250 million not being sufficient for the growth path that is being discussed.


Passage number 848.
-72-3/28-29/83CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, according to the staff projection itdoes. It's an entirely different question what weight you put on thestaff projection. The staff projection says $200 million will come inwith that growth path. Let me refine it a bit: If we have to have anassumption, let me presume the assumption is roughly $250 million.But I will tell you, when you're sitting there [and have to make adecision], the mechanical assumption is sometimes not as helpful as itmight be because you have to guess where the errors might be orwhether you should delay today or go ahead tomorrow. It seems to methe obvious point is that--if we said $250 million, for instance, andit was running a little high--consistent with no consultation oranything else, as these figures come out we'd err on the side of itbeing a little more than $250 million. If [money] is coming in low,we'd err on the side of it being below $250 million. The "erring onthe side of" doesn't say that's where it's going to come out. You canget two errors. But in calculating how the Desk leans to minimizebeing off course, the Manager leans a bit toward being slightlytighter if the figure is coming in high and slightly lower if it'scoming in low. And that's all encompassed by the words "generallymaintain the existing degree of restraint.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is offering their perspective and explaining the approach they take in making decisions. There is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 849.
"MR. ROBERTS. But the focus is how they're coming in and noton the level of interest rates per se.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that the focus is on how something is happening rather than on the level of interest rates.


Passage number 850.
MS. TEETERS. Well, I would like to focus on the level ofinterest rates per se. I don't want to see them go up. And if wefocus on $200 million in borrowing, I think there's less chance thatwe'll have rising short-term interest rates than falling short-terminterest rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Teeters expresses a personal preference and states her belief that focusing on $200 million in borrowing will have a lower chance of causing rising short-term interest rates compared to falling short-term interest rates.


Passage number 851.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But in reality I think it is fair tosay that the fed funds rate gives us a bit of a clue as to whether ourguesses on the reserve situation are erring in one direction or theother. It's one sign of how tight the situation is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a perspective on the significance of the fed funds rate as a clue regarding the reserve situation.


Passage number 852.
MR. ROBERTS. It's a sign, but also if we accommodate a levelregardless--if we keep the borrowings down--we'll provide more money.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Roberts about the potential benefits of keeping borrowings down.


Passage number 853.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're stuck in the short run with the factthat in implementing this from week-to-week the federal funds rate hasa life of its own. It goes where the market expects that it might go.In the space of 3 weeks or something like that we can change that; butif the market is in the mood to fear that it's going to go up, it willgo up. And if they're anticipating it will go down, it's going to godown. I would say right now it's in the mood of thinking the risk isthat it's going to go up, which is why it's where it is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining that the federal funds rate can change based on market expectations and that currently, the market is expecting it to go up. There is no opposing viewpoint or disagreement presented.


Passage number 854.
MR. ROBERTS. And if the prime moves up here shortly, weprobably shouldn't try to prevent the funds rate from moving up alittle also.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts is simply suggesting that if the prime moves up, it would be appropriate for the funds rate to also increase.


Passage number 855.
MR. MARTIN(.). It's your [unintelligible] they'll average.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 856.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, my modification is that we'resomewhere between $200 and $300 million, depending basically on howstrong the aggregates are coming in and whatever qualitative evidencewe have. That's a relatively big range but, in fact, we've been allaround that range in the recent past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing a financial estimation and is acknowledging that the range is relatively broad.


Passage number 857.
-73-3/28-29/83VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think $250 million is a reasonablecompromise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement expresses a personal opinion, suggesting that the amount of $250 million is seen as a reasonable compromise.


Passage number 858.
MR. GUFFEY. I agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker explicitly mentions agreeing with something, indicating harmony of opinion.


Passage number 859.
MR. GRAMLEY. Me too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses agreement with a previous statement or sentiment.


Passage number 860.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. With that kind of gloss I put on it.SPEAKER(.). You're talking $200 to $300 million; I wouldsupport $250 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is stating their support for allocating $250 million, which aligns with their previous explanation of a potential cost range of $200 to $300 million.


Passage number 861.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does anybody else have any comments. Inthe absence thereof, do we know what we're voting on. If so, we'regoing to vote. Should I read it again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for comments and clarification before proceeding with a vote.


Passage number 862.
MR. WALLICH. I would like to hear at least the previouslybracketed sentences.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement by Mr. Wallich is a request to hear specific sentences, indicating a desire for more information or clarity, but it does not express disagreement or contention.


Passage number 863.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The previously bracketed sentences. I'massuming this is a change in alternative I and am working from there.What I have there now, just to repeat that sentence is: "Lesserrestraint would be acceptable in the context of more pronouncedslowing of growth in the monetary aggregates relative to the pathsimplied by the long-term ranges (taking account of the distortionsrelating to the introduction of new accounts), or indications of aweakening in the pace of economic recovery.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is discussing a potential change in alternative I and assessing the conditions under which less restraint would be acceptable. There is no conflicting viewpoint or disagreement presented in this passage.


Passage number 864.
"MS. TEETERS. Is the economic recovery part within theparentheses.
