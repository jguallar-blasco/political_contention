{"2016FOMC20160127meeting.txt": [" MS. GEORGE.  Madam Chair, I support what you\u2019ve proposed here, but I noted in the strikeouts that the previous version, at some level, offered consultation with the president of the relevant Reserve Bank in the event of a breach.  And if the breach emanated from a Reserve Bank, I just wondered, as a practical matter, even though you\u2019re striking through that in favor of this stronger process, whether there would be such consultation. CHAIR YELLEN.  I think there could be such consultation.  I do think our default response should be that any material breach will be referred to the inspector general", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As some of you have probably noticed, I have abstained from voting on this statement since it was introduced in January 2012 in part, as I have stated for the record in each of the past four years, on the ground that it really didn\u2019t communicate much that gave useful insight into how the FOMC would approach its policy decisions.  In part, though, I abstained because certain expectations I had been given regarding language that would be included in the original statement were confounded at that time.  Experience over those four years hasn\u2019t really changed my mind as to how useful the statement is in communicating how we go about making our policy decisions.  As I anticipated at the time, in actual decisionmaking, everybody pretty much, I think, takes his or her own reading or interpretation of the statement. However, it is not a bad thing to have even a high-level expression of consensus as to the FOMC\u2019s longer-range goals, and there does come a point when it is probably not too productive to continue to abstain.  This seems to me such a point, particularly in light of the helpful changes that Chair Yellen, Governors Fischer and Powell, and Presidents Mester and Williams have worked out.  And although this change is not directed at the issue that was in play back in late 2011, I think it is noteworthy, in light of recent experience and current circumstances.  So I will vote for the statement today. I now want to add one thought, though.  We don\u2019t have a lot of expressions of agreement on the Committee.  The statement expresses, albeit at a very high level, an agreement, despite some nontrivial differences that lie beneath it.  President Williams, captured this well in his introductory remarks.  I think it is institutionally important for us to project an ability to agree, even if only at a fairly high level, and that is why I abstained rather than dissented over each of the past several years.  And that is why I have gone out of my way in the past four years not to highlight publicly my points of difference with the statement. I also appreciate the fact that so far as I am aware, none of you has tried to argue publicly that the statement compels or justifies a particular policy outcome.  There is plenty of room to interpret the statement in a variety of ways, as we have de facto done in our policymaking.  And I suspect many of you, like me, would be happier if it were drafted somewhat differently.  Indeed, I am not sure the language being added is exactly the way I would have phrased the point.  The problem, of course, is that we would differ on what those differences should be.  I think we should recognize the compromises that are inevitable, salute the work the subcommittee has done, endorse the statement, and then refrain from trying to highlight the differences rather than the admittedly high level of agreement.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Bullard", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I\u2019m opposed to this portion of the changes to the Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  My opposition centers on the extra sentence being added to the statement, which reads, \u201cThe Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below this objective.\u201d  In my view, this sentence is inappropriately backward looking.  A basic tenet of modern inflation targeting is that it is the inflation forecast that is critically important, not recent misses of inflation from target that were caused by unpredictable shocks that hit the economy.  Because this is a statement of longer-run goals, this sentence should appropriately reflect this basic tenet of inflation targeting.  A rewrite that would accomplish this would be simple:  \u201cThe Committee would be concerned if inflation were expected to run persistently above or below this objective.\u201d I communicated my concerns to the communications subcommittee, but I was unable to persuade the subcommittee to change the language.  Because I regard this as a matter of fundamental importance for this Committee, I\u2019m dissenting on the adoption of this statement as written.  Part of my concern is that this statement of longer-run goals is quasi-constitutional in nature and that language introduced today will likely be very persistent into the future.  I therefore think that it is even more important to get this language correct than it is for other Committee statements. I want to now point out three areas in which I see this new sentence as inconsistent with Committee statements and actual practice.  One is in the staff\u2019s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.  A second is in the current Committee communication regarding the inflation outlook and future policy decisions.  And the third is in past Committee behavior during an era in which inflation was persistently higher than desired. Let me begin with the staff\u2019s characterizations of optimal monetary policy.  The current version of Tealbook B, page 8, provides the Committee with results of an optimal control exercise that projects inflation through 2021.  The optimal control projections for inflation are below our 2 percent target until 2020; in addition, actual inflation has been below target for several years in the past.  Yet, at least under the assumptions behind the optimal control exercise, this is the very best policy that can be pursued by this Committee.  If the Committee adopted this approach to policy, then it would not be particularly concerned that inflation had been below target in the past.  That outcome would be chalked up to shocks that hit the economy in the past, and the Committee would take the effects of those shocks on board and map out a strategy to move inflation back to target over several years.  To me, this type of optimal policy calculation lays out a dichotomy compared with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals. Let me now turn to the current Committee communication.  The Committee\u2019s official statements on monetary policy in recent quarters have stressed the idea that the Committee needs to be reasonably confident that inflation will return to target over the forecast horizon.  This is a forward-looking criterion that I think contrasts with the backward-looking sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals. Finally, let me turn to the past behavior of the Committee.  During the period from 2003 to 2008, inflation routinely ran in excess of 2 percent.  Naturally, the Committee and the Chair at the time were constantly asked about this situation.  My general characterization of the response is that the Committee stressed that the factors that were keeping inflation relatively high were likely temporary, and that, under the policy in place at the time, the Committee expected inflation to return to lower, more normal levels.  Again, this was a forward-looking argument.  In the event, inflation did not continue to rise but instead moved lower, and an era of inflation misses on the high side ended.  This historical experience suggests to me behavior of the Committee that would be difficult to reconcile with the new sentence being proposed for the statement of longer-run goals. In summary, putting the new sentence in the statement of longer-run goals this way will, in my opinion, put a burden on the Committee\u2019s future communication as financial market participants seek to reconcile the new language with the reality that it must be the inflation forecast that really matters for the future direction of monetary policy. Let me stress before concluding that I support the remainder of the statement as written.  As many of you know, I worked closely with many of my colleagues on the Committee to help craft this statement during 2011 for adoption in January 2012.  This established an official inflation target for the United States, a longtime goal of former Chairman Bernanke.  I still very much support that goal as well as the statement other than the new sentence.  In particular, I support the addition of the word \u201csymmetric,\u201d because I have always felt that misses on either side of the inflation target are equally important.  My qualms today are solely about preserving the forward-looking nature of inflation targeting in the United States.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I don\u2019t see a pressing need to modify the consensus statement, but I don\u2019t have strong objections to the changes being proposed.  I would reiterate a point I\u2019ve made in the past, which is that to serve the purpose of the statement in anchoring expectations regarding the conduct of monetary policy, the statement should not be frequently amended.  It should be seen as a statement of timeless principles.  I think somebody used the word \u201cconstitutional.\u201d  I think that\u2019s right.  In particular, we should avoid the appearance of opportunistic editing into driving policy expectations in one particular direction or another in the short run.  My limited enthusiasm for this change stems in part from the extent to which this verges on appearing that way. Another reason my enthusiasm is limited is that I don\u2019t know of an economic model in which our implied objective function is symmetric, mathematically speaking, without taking a linear quadratic approximation, which essentially imposes symmetry, or without imposing symmetry a priori on a loss function that a policymaker is posited to have, as opposed to having the objective function derived from the utility function of the agency model.  Many of the reasons we view inflation above 2 percent as detrimental to the well-being of our country and our economy are distinct from the reasons we view inflation below 2 percent as detrimental to the economy, and there\u2019s good reason to believe that inflation dynamics could be different above and below 2 percent.  So I\u2019m not a big fan of the notion that our objectives are, strictly speaking, symmetric. I can live with the statement, however.  The sentence that\u2019s inserted, by itself, doesn\u2019t say our concerns are of equal magnitude on either side, and I prefer to think of the symmetry as a symmetry with respect to the sign of the concern on either side.  But as I said, I have no objection to the changes being proposed. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the revised statement.  The statement makes it clear that our loss function is symmetric with regard to the 2 percent goal, not necessarily in every particular case, but on an ex ante basis.  Thus, 2 percent is not a ceiling, but a target.  Now, there is a more subtle question, that of how the statement will be read with respect to the so-called bygones issue.  Does \u201csymmetric\u201d mean we will want to make up for past shortfalls with offsetting or symmetric overruns.  I don\u2019t think the statement speaks directly to that, and I don\u2019t read the statement that way.  Symmetry to me is about the loss function, not a goal or a commitment to make up for past shortfalls. My own view is that we continue to run a bygones policy rather than a price-level targeting policy.  We\u2019re not deliberately seeking to push inflation above 2 percent to offset for the years that we spent below 2 percent, but at the same time, we might have to run above 2 percent for a time if that\u2019s what is required to push inflation expectations back up to our 2 percent objective.  And we would do that, of course, so we could better achieve our 2 percent objective over the longer run.  There\u2019s that little subtlety that the statement doesn\u2019t get at, and I think it\u2019s just useful to restate this in terms of our still continuing to follow a bygones policy. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Let me add my own support for the proposed changes to the statement.  I always viewed our inflation objective as symmetric and considered 2 percent to be our target and not a ceiling, and I think the new language makes this clear.  As others have noted, it\u2019s also consistent with previous communications and serves as a meaningful clarification of the FOMC\u2019s views. Now, I\u2019d like to proceed, as we have in the past, to first take a straw poll of the views of the entire Committee so that the minutes can record the strength of support for the statement among all participants.  But we will also need a formal vote by the members of the Committee to adopt the statement.  So let me start with a straw poll, and I would ask any of the participants to raise your hand if you support the statement.  [Show of hands]  Anyone opposed.  [Show of hands]  Okay.  One opposed.  Now we\u2019re going to take a formal vote of the members to adopt the statement.  So, members only, all in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  And opposed.  [One aye] Okay.  As Stan noted, we will release the revised Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy tomorrow at the same time as our policy statement.  This marks a departure from our typical practice of releasing the statement with the minutes.  An advantage of our typical approach is that the minutes can provide important context and rationale for any changes and thereby reduce the possibility that the revisions will be misinterpreted by the public.  This year, though, my monetary policy testimony before the Congress will occur earlier than normal and before the release of the minutes for this meeting.  Because the consensus statement appears in the Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, we need to accelerate its release.  But I do want to warn everyone that this timing will pose some communications challenges, particularly in light of the fact that we have the dissent that will be reported tomorrow. Some of you may want to discuss the consensus statement in public, or you may be asked about it by members of the press.  So I just want to remind everybody that, as always, you are free to share your own views.  But let me emphasize that you should not characterize the views of other participants or the Committee as a whole as reflected in this meeting\u2019s discussion or other confidential interactions, and that doing so would be a violation of our program for security of FOMC information and our policy on external communications.  And on this particular topic, I do think that staying in line with our policies may prove to be quite tricky, as discussing your view could very naturally lead to contrasting your view with the views of others.  So I mention this because I would like you to consider your communications on this topic very carefully. With that, let\u2019s go on to our next item, item 7", " MR. KAPLAN.  I\u2019ll ask a question that I\u2019m sure is out of order, but I will ask anyhow, and I\u2019ll direct this maybe to President Bullard and the group.  I take it that there\u2019s been enough conversation back and forth by everyone else around the table indicating that we do mean this to be forward looking.  That\u2019s not enough to sway your thinking.  I normally wouldn\u2019t ask, but I just want to ask because it strikes me that this coming out with a dissent is going to be very confusing to people.  I wouldn\u2019t mind if we took a few extra minutes here, if you\u2019re willing, to debate it or discuss it a little bit more.  It might be healthy\u2014unless that\u2019s going too far and it\u2019s already been done. CHAIR YELLEN.  I agree with you.  But we have had some conversations about this.  President Bullard", " MR. BULLARD.  You know, I do feel very strongly about this.  I think it\u2019s a constitutional document.  I think we could have said that if inflation is expected to go back to target, the Committee would be comfortable.  I gave examples of when we\u2019ve done that in the past.  I gave examples taken from our own communications.  So my concern is that what we\u2019re doing is setting up, inside a constitutional document, a challenge for future communication because I think, for instance, our rhetoric about being comfortable that inflation is going to return to target is going to be at odds with what\u2019s now in the longer-run statement, which says that we\u2019re uncomfortable if inflation has been below target persistently for a while. So I\u2019m trying to highlight this.  I think what will happen is that, as you all have done here at the meeting, you\u2019ll talk a lot about how you\u2019re interpreting the phrase as forward looking, which is the way I think it needs to be interpreted. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer", " MR. POTTER.  I view our job as trying to report on what\u2019s happened in markets and the expectations that market participants have.  One of the quandaries we had for some time was that there was quite a big difference between the market path and some of the expectations we were getting back from the people that we surveyed.  So one of the things we did was, we tried to change our questions to give them events to think about.  And that was to try to get at the notion we had had in our heads that some of the reasons that the market path looks different from the modal path or some of the other numbers we get back from them had something to do with the effective lower bound.  And what we found by changing the questions is that it was much easier to reconcile the market pricing with the expectations regarding the federal funds rate path that market participants have, but it leaves a big gap to try to explain how their modal path and the economic forecast that they show could support those expectations regarding the federal funds rate.  And, in my view, which I expressed, it\u2019s something more to do with the rest of the world.  The other possibility is that markets have sensed a weakening that we can\u2019t see in the data, and that\u2019s in the financial market, and they\u2019re basically giving a signal that U.S. growth will be much weaker in the first half of the year", " MR. FISCHER.  The concern I have is that as you draw them out, you\u2019re guiding them.  I have a slightly uneasy feeling that we\u2019re getting these torrents of information about what the market participants believe, and we\u2019re not getting torrents about what the staff believes, although we have the very valuable Tealbooks to use.  And I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s healthy that we concentrate our briefings on what the markets are telling us rather than what we believe economic forces are pushing us to.  That\u2019s not to ask you not to present this, but it\u2019s to ask whether the deeper and deeper and the more complicated questionnaires you\u2019re preparing are helping us do what we need to do in making our decisions", " MR. FISCHER.  Could I ask Simon and Lorie\u2014you have this hint on page 2 of your very clear paper, which I\u2019ll read to you, and perhaps you can explain it:  \u201cThe very elevated setting of the cap may have also conveyed the sense that the Committee is willing to do what it takes to control interest rates\u201d\u2014this in a context in which you\u2019re explaining the importance of the cap.  And then it continues:  \u201cArguably, this effect could be achieved through other means.\u201d  What are the other means", " MR. FISCHER.  But some of that is in option 2, isn\u2019t it", " MR. LACKER.  To go back to your question, Governor Tarullo, this isn\u2019t about market functioning, it\u2019s a distributional issue\u2014it\u2019s who pays for the privilege of investing cash at quarter-end.  You\u2019ve got a lot of cash around.  You can make a lot every other day of the quarter, but at quarter-end, you don\u2019t have relationships.  You\u2019ve set up relationships with foreign banks that are doing the arbitrage to IOER.  Part of what you pay for doing that is that on quarter-end, you don\u2019t have relationships elsewhere to invest the cash.  To some extent, for us to defray that cost, for us to reduce the cost of having nowhere to invest your cash on quarter-end, we\u2019re just making it easier for the foreign banks to do this arbitrage.  We\u2019re just shifting costs around these players.  It\u2019s less market functioning than just a distributional question", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But we first have to answer the question, what is the experiment generating in terms of information.  And will that information change your behavior in terms of how you use it.  If you decide that the cost of the experiment is high and it\u2019s unlikely to change how you run the facilities, then it\u2019s probably not worth running the experiment.  It might be if you decide that the cost to run the experiment is pretty low\u2014in other words, that the staff can come up with a way of doing the experiment that\u2019s not really hard to communicate to markets, and we don\u2019t confuse people about what our intentions are or about how we\u2019re ranking monetary control versus footprint versus financial stability.  That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.  I\u2019m not arguing against running the experiment.  I think we also need to think about the question, what are you going to gain from running the experiment, and how is it going to affect your behavior", " MR. WILCOX.  Right", " MR. LOCKHART.  One commentator, I thought, had a very interesting analysis.  He said that we\u2019re experiencing an enormous margin call", " MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Since our decision to begin normalizing interest rates in December, the news from the labor and output markets has continued to arrive in a familiar pattern:  a very strong labor market with disappointing real spending.  That pattern, which remains difficult to explain, has been complicated by the volatility in financial markets and by the continuing decline in the price of oil.  Thus, I am somewhat more uncertain about the trajectory of real economic activity and the inflation rate than I would be if all of the data were aligned.  This meeting is a time for watchful waiting to see how the uncertainties of the current situation resolve themselves over the coming months.  Although we should recognize that they may neither resolve themselves nor resolve themselves in a manner that reduces uncertainty about future inflation and growth. The news from the financial markets, both domestic and international, has been unsettling.  My sense is that this bout of volatility will subside as the volatility in August did and allow us to proceed more or less\u2014probably a bit less\u2014on the path I had predicted when filling in the December SEP, which was three increases in the federal funds rate in 2016.  However, there is more uncertainty and downside risk associated with that prediction than there was only six weeks ago.  That uncertainty arises from the possibility that the current asset market instability presages deeper weakness to come.  The inability so far of the Chinese authorities to clarify and communicate their exchange rate policies is one source of uncertainty\u2014uncertainty that, in the case of China, is strengthened by concerns that economic growth may slow more sharply than the anticipated gradual decline from the vicinity of 7 percent to a somewhat lower rate over the next five years or so.  And there are some foreign economies whose growth performance has been better than expected.  That includes India and, to a lesser extent, some countries in the euro zone. There is another factor that has begun to receive attention, and we started talking about it in connection with the work on financial stability an hour or so ago:  the expected effect on asset prices of the beginning of the unwinding of the extremely accommodative monetary policies that central banks have put in place during the last seven to eight years.  Those policies were put in place in the expectation that doing so would lower interest rates and increase asset values, Tobin\u2019s q in particular.  The lower interest rates and the increase in wealth would increase both investment and consumption through intertemporal substitution and wealth effects, and thereby increase aggregate demand. Well, the effect of the low interest rates on asset prices, especially equity prices, happened, but there was less effect on investment, in part because the housing market did not recover as rapidly as expected.  Markets have reason to believe that the period of extraordinary accommodation is now beginning to end, even though we have indicated that we will raise rates at a pace that is likely to be gradual.  The beginning of the slow process of normalization has increased the probability that equity prices, too, will begin to normalize, which means that the very high q will likely decline.  That is a reasonable expectation, especially because the economy has not grown as fast as markets must have expected when the Great Recession began. The outlook for inflation remains a concern.  I retain my belief that the basic logic of the Phillips curve will, in the medium term, assert itself.  And, indeed, the rate of compensation increase has moved up somewhat.  But we have continued to see further decreases in inflation, resulting from the continuing fall in oil prices and the ongoing effects of the appreciation of the dollar.  I continue to believe that the ongoing declines in oil prices and in the appreciation of the dollar are temporary, and that when they stop, we will, after a while, see actual inflation rising to our target rate of 2 percent.  But the recent behavior of the price of oil and the weaknesses in many foreign economies have further delayed the beginnings of that return.  This further delay in the increase in inflation, in conjunction with the increase in downside risks to both output and inflation, have increased my uncertainty about the outlook and led me to the view that the trajectory of rate increases may be flatter than I had expected in December. But there appear to be elements of herd behavior in the financial markets.  Steve Kamin referred to that in his presentation.  And we could see a stabilization or change in direction of those markets before the March meeting.  Of course, our views will also be informed by the rate at which employment increases.  Thus, the signal we will send by and following our decision tomorrow will be extremely important.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think I\u2019m number 10, and I\u2019m beginning to feel the pain that some of the Governors have talked about before, listening to so many people.  [Laughter]  Much has been said already, but still, I\u2019ll try to spice it up and be nimble. In spite of the strong labor market data that we received, I continued to hear mostly downbeat assessments from my business contacts.  Also, the incoming data on spending have been disappointing.  My view is that GDP growth for the fourth quarter will come in close to the Tealbook\u2019s meager projection of \u00bd percent, and financial market developments will add some further restraint to the economy.  These crosscurrents increase uncertainty over the outlooks for economic growth and inflation, and they make me nervous.  Nevertheless, I think it would be a mistake to overreact today to the softer spending data and financial volatility.  After all, last August and September, we found ourselves facing volatile financial markets and a disappointing slowing in job growth.  We responded with a well-timed pause in our policy plans and monitored how the uncertainty would play out.  Financial markets soon settled down, and the labor market improved markedly, giving the Committee the confidence necessary to take our first move toward normalization.  I see us in a similar situation today.  While uncertainty and the downside risks have risen in recent weeks, in my opinion, there\u2019s not enough evidence yet to adjust the basic contours of the outlook, although I admit that December\u2019s forecast does now seem a bit optimistic in light of intermeeting developments. With this as background, it\u2019s not surprising that I heard a mixture of views from my business contacts and directors.  Along the same lines as President Lockhart\u2019s comments, manufacturers with significant international exposures continue to face a very tough business environment.  Some are talking about a recession in manufacturing, notably those in steel and heavy machinery, and they see little relief in sight.  In contrast, the attendees at our December 30 manufacturing roundtable were somewhat more optimistic.  While they acknowledged that late 2015 was dismal, most were hopeful and expecting growth to pick up over the next 6 to 12 months.  They and other contacts pointed to domestic strength in autos, aerospace, consumer-facing product markets, and labor markets in general.  In light of these mixed views, I think we will just have to wait and see how it all plays out.  But the international headwinds are strong.  Even if the dollar stabilizes, as Governor Brainard was touching on, the trade-weighted dollar has risen 25 percent since the summer of 2014, and that\u2019s a heavy lift for tradable goods sectors. One thing that seems clear is that financial conditions have tightened.  Both Discover Financial and Ford said it has become more difficult to sell asset-backed securities.  Financing is still available, but spreads are higher and market volatility makes the timing of deals problematic.  Other contacts noted that new issuance of high-yield debt has essentially shut down.  They report a similar contraction in the supply of leveraged loans.  Our contact at PayNet, a small business credit bureau, also noted that there was an abrupt pullback in small business lending in October and November.  He attributed this mostly to increased caution on the part of borrowers as opposed to supply-side developments.  The bottom line is that the credit environment has tightened by more than simply our 25 basis point move.  It is unclear how these conditions will weigh on cap-ex and other spending, but it seems difficult to imagine that business confidence has been unaffected.  These developments bear watching, but if the essential intent of our renormalization is to tighten financial conditions, then I think we\u2019re ahead of schedule\u2014and Governor Powell\u2019s comments regarding federal funds equivalent increases seem relevant on this point. The news on inflation also suggests caution.  Our December statement indicated confidence that inflation would rise to target over the medium term.  Our communications have also pointed to developments that we are looking for to support that confidence, and I think the staff\u2019s inflation dashboard ought to help us get at assessing those developments, too.  And I agree with Governor Tarullo\u2019s comments there.  Stabilization in energy and import prices are prominent on the list, but both oil prices and the dollar have again moved in the wrong direction. We\u2019ve also cited anchored expectations as a key inflation support.  I\u2019ve been uncomfortable for a while with the continued low levels of inflation breakevens, and their recent further deterioration has only made matters worse.  The most benign interpretation is that these unusually low readings can be ignored as statistical noise or market anomalies.  Maybe this is right, but other measures, such as the Michigan survey\u2019s longer-term inflation expectations, also are near 25-year lows.  To remain confident about inflation pressures being right around the corner, the Committee will have to continue to look through a lot of uncomfortable data developments. To sum up, my baseline forecast has not changed much since December, but the recent news beyond labor markets has been a sharp reminder that there continue to be large downside risks.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard", " MS. BRAINARD.  The statement", " MS. MESTER.  You could say \u201cbut believed that the statement should more clearly express.\u201d PARTICIPANTS.  Yes. CHAIR YELLEN.  That \u201cit is,\u201d or \u201cthe Committee is\u201d.

BULLARD.  Okay.  And the Tealbook is wildly lower than the other probabilities.  So explain that to me", " MR. BULLARD.  Well, another question would be the unconditional probability of going into recession at any particular date, and FRB/US would seem to have a very low number for that, whereas the other models would have something like 10 or 15 percent all of the time", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  We need more time to assess the direct effect of recent financial market volatility on the economic outlook and inflation and, more important, to determine whether the volatility is signaling underlying weakness that is not yet evident in the data. It is disappointing that the real GDP growth forecast for last quarter has been revised down.  I am concerned that we also may be revising down estimates of first-quarter real GDP growth.  If we are growing slower than potential, then the median path of the federal funds rate in the December SEP may prove to be too steep.  As I highlighted yesterday, I believe the downside risks to the outlook are elevated relative to December.  With consumption being an important component of real GDP that could disappoint. I would also add that if both actual as well as expected inflation are important determinants of actions to be taken in March, it is unlikely that we will have much in the way of evidence of higher core or total PCE inflation by that time.  In light of the recent declines in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar, the Tealbook expects that total PCE inflation for the first quarter of 2016 will be negative, and that core PCE inflation will be 1.2 percent in Q1.  In fact, the Tealbook forecast does not have core inflation showing signs of accelerating until next year.  If this forecast proves correct, the inflation data will not provide evidence of approaching our 2 percent goal for quite some time.  We have plenty of data yet to be received before the next meeting.  Nonetheless, in view of recent events, we should be reinforcing the idea that the median SEP is a forecast, not a promise, and that we remain data dependent. I greatly prefer the new sentence substituted in the second paragraph of alternative B to the previous version of alternative B.  It appropriately highlights that we are monitoring recent events for implications on the outlook and the risks to the outlook.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer", " MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B in the version with the revised wording at the end of the second paragraph.  This gives the right combination of concern over recent developments and calmness in deciding how to appraise them and how to react to them at later meetings.  Although a lot has happened so far in January, this is not the time to change course.  We continue to be faced by the combination of a strong labor market and disappointing real spending, with the recent addition to the mixture of considerable financial market volatility.  We\u2019re not expected to change the federal funds rate at this meeting.  And, at least in this regard, we should not disappoint expectations.  Rather, we should, in the words of alt-B, closely monitor \u201cglobal economic and financial developments\u201d and assess \u201ctheir implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.\u201d Our discussions yesterday and today started from the current combination of a labor market that has performed relatively well and that must be near maximum sustainable employment, and, at the same time, the staff\u2019s forecast of PCE inflation for 2016 that is only 0.7 percent, with even the forecast of the core PCE inflation at 1.3 percent.  The discussion yesterday went on to detail the background to this situation:  the large depreciation of the dollar; the ongoing declines in the price of oil; the recent declines in asset and commodity prices; and the fears, particularly of asset market participants, that China\u2019s economic growth may decline more rapidly than the official predictions, and that the exchange rate of the renminbi may depreciate more than the authority\u2019s pronouncements about it would suggest.  There was concern over Japan, which may want a weaker exchange rate, and the euro zone, which makes no bones about that. Aside from the market volatility, these are not especially new facts.  Nonetheless, like the markets, the FOMC was in a distinctly less optimistic mood yesterday than it had been only six weeks ago.  It was striking that the basic view about inflation that had obtained among many of us until now\u2014that inflation has been held down by temporary factors, especially declines in the price of oil and the appreciation of the dollar\u2014appeared to be losing ground.  Simply put, the view I thought I heard from some of you was that we\u2019ve been surprised too often by low inflation, and that we should accept low inflation as a better description of the underlying state of the economy than the view that inflation is low primarily because of temporary factors. I do not believe that.  True, we have continually been surprised by oil price declines.  So has almost everyone, including the Saudis.  That does not mean that the temporary oil price declines and their consequences are not a major factor underlying the behavior of prices.  Similarly, the appreciation of the dollar has had an influence on even core PCE prices.  Among the consequences of declines in the price of oil is the decline in expected inflation.  Those who worry about inflation losing its expected-inflation anchor need, at present, to look no further than the behavior of the price of oil.  Those who ask why core PCE inflation is 1.3 percent rather than closer to the target of 2 percent will find that a significant share of that 0.7 percent gap is taken up by the influence of oil prices and the appreciating exchange rate on core inflation.  Now, one may well ask why movements in energy prices are correlated with expected inflation and core PCE inflation, and everyone is asking.  There are explanations for both these phenomena, but there is a clear need for further research on these topics.  And I\u2019m sure that WE9, which is Wilcox exhibit 9, marks a good start in getting an answer to that question. Where would we be if we accept, as I do, the view that inflation will gradually rise to its 2 percent target if labor markets continue to be strong, with unemployment remaining close to the natural rate.  We would essentially remain with the forecast we had last month, which is close to this month\u2019s Tealbook forecast.  We would continue with our approach of gradual increases in the federal funds rate at a rate that depends on incoming data and without any commitment to a fixed number of increases per period. What if that view turns out to be wrong and the labor market starts weakening and the unemployment rate moves up in a sustained way.  I think it\u2019s premature to start talking seriously about that possibility now, but it is not premature for the staff to start researching that situation and possible courses of action to deal with it.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I do think we face a tricky communications problem at this meeting.  As I see it, we have four objectives.  First, we want to keep our options open in terms of what we do at the March meeting.  Second, we want to acknowledge the ongoing international financial market developments because they are noteworthy and do, if sustained, have significant implications for the economic outlook and monetary policy.  Third, we don\u2019t want to show so much concern about the outlook that we exacerbate market participants\u2019 fears about the global outlook, making the bad outcome more likely.  Language that showed great anxiety on our part might make households and businesses more skittish.  Fourth, we don\u2019t want to create an impression that monetary policy will necessarily respond to short-term movements in financial asset prices.  In other words, there\u2019s no \u201cFed put.\u201d  At the same time, financial conditions do matter because they do affect the outlook for economic growth and inflation. My own view is that the risks to the outlook may have tilted slightly to the downside, but I think you can make the case that it is premature to reach that conclusion.  We just don\u2019t know whether the tightening of financial market conditions will be sustained and what the effect will be on the economy\u2019s performance.  To me, the alternative B formulation says that we\u2019re mulling it over and we haven\u2019t reached a firm conclusion yet.  March is still open as to whether we will or won\u2019t raise the federal funds rate target.  It depends on the data, broadly defined.  And when I say \u201cbroadly defined,\u201d I mean that it includes global and financial market developments.  So I think alternative B strikes the right balance. That said, I think the March meeting is going to be very consequential.  If we do tighten, it will tend to crystalize the idea that we\u2019re doing four rate hikes this year, and it may contradict our saying we\u2019re data dependent.  People may start to say, \u201cOh, they\u2019re on a mechanical path of every quarter.\u201d  Sitting here, not knowing where we\u2019re going to be in March, I guess my inclination is that the bar to tightening in March is a little high.  I need to see a positive reason to tighten in March, as opposed to a strong reason not to tighten in March.  So the bar there is a little higher than it was before, because it will be quite consequential in terms of how markets would react to a March tightening.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Well, I think we\u2019ve had a good round of discussion", " MR. CLARK.  Do we track that.  I don\u2019t know if we track that. CHAIR YELLEN.  I don\u2019t know that we track it", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I know that a lot of work has preceded this recommendation, so thanks to Todd Clark, Bill English, and others, as well as the subcommittee for your good efforts. I realize that this is not a highly ambitious proposal.  In my mind, it\u2019s one to use pictures to make an already made and simple point to an audience that largely already knows it.  I recently read the claim that more than half of brain activity is processing the visual, so maybe that\u2019s just the reason to go ahead and do this.  Nonetheless, I remain a bit of a skeptic of this communication tool, and let me explain why.  I don\u2019t see how presenting historical error bands derived from both internal and outside forecasts associated with our SEP medians provides useful additional information to our policy communication.  The message that there is substantial inherent uncertainty associated with our forecast is already conveyed in the minutes.  In a world where every FOMC move is scrutinized for profound meaning, there is some risk that the historical forecast accuracy bands will be construed as reflecting how the Committee is viewing the risks to the outlook as of the SEP publication.  And this, of course, isn\u2019t the case. As proposed, the error bands will likely show a nonnegligible chance that the economy will be near or in recession within the time frame of the forecast period.  The error bands will always show a significant chance that inflation will persistently deviate from our 2 percent objective.  This could be interpreted as weak commitment to achieving our inflation target.  If economic growth or inflation was to seem to be on a path that is materially off the median projection path, we know that such a deviation would likely trigger a mitigating policy response. Now, I acknowledge that many of these concerns about interpretation of the error bands are treated in the proposed appendix.  A careful reading of the appendix should clarify what the fan charts say and what they don\u2019t say.  But I\u2019m not sure we should expect a careful reading of the appendix to inform the less familiar reader of the SEP, and the reader who understands the fan charts at first glance already knows what we\u2019re trying to convey.  So I\u2019m not sure I see how emphasizing the inherent uncertainty of economic forecasts, which is a very broad assertion, serves a clear purpose in our communications design.  It seems like a lot of effort to dissuade people from attaching any significance to our forecast. As I said, I know the addition of the fan charts is not intended or expected to be a major communications move, but I\u2019m not sure I see the payoff as greater than the problems that might be caused.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks to Todd, Bill, and others for all of the work that went into this.  I\u2019m also not enormously supportive of this proposal, although I do have sympathy with the underlying spirit of the proposal, which is to remind the public that any forecast is subject to very large uncertainty bands.  But I believe the text that accompanies the SEP already does that. It\u2019s worth noting that people have made a lot of references to other central banks.  The other central banks that do present fan charts when they display their forecasts are generally using either consensus forecasts or staff forecasts.  They\u2019re actual forecasts.  The SEP is quite different; it, obviously, is not a forecast.  It\u2019s a scatterplot of individual member projections.  The median isn\u2019t comparable to a consensus forecast.  I think there is important information content in seeing the range of differences among Committee participants and the median.  And most of the people who care deeply about the SEP put a lot of time and resources into understanding the nature of the information that\u2019s being provided.  By contrast, as I think was said previously, it\u2019s not obvious what additional information content superimposing errors from other forecasts provides. The discomfort is particularly acute with regard to the projected path of the policy rate, due both to the asymmetry associated with the effective lower bound and to the fact that this is a policy instrument over which the Committee has some control rather than an exogenous economic variable.  But I also have concerns even on some of the economic variables.  For instance, if I think about inflation right now and I just read some of the text in the most recent SEP surrounding members\u2019 views about the distribution of uncertainty, I think it would be skewed to the downside, whereas these bands, as I understand it, would be, by construction, symmetric. Again, I do see the value of the underlying desire here to remind everybody how much uncertainty there is regarding our projections.  Perhaps we should spend a bit of time on subjective probabilities.  It does sound like a lot of work, but maybe before going in this direction, we should at least see further work on what that would look like, because it might be a better representation of additional information to provide to the public.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I certainly see some benefit of adding fan charts to the SEP as proposed.  The fan charts would emphasize that the SEP numbers just comprise a modal forecast, one of many possible outcomes.  The charts would also emphasize that at longer time horizons, the level of uncertainty is very high.  So I am willing to go along with this proposal.  That said, I do have some concerns that I want to share with the Committee.  The first one is, because the widths of the fan charts are based on historical experience and are unconditional, they\u2019re not really very informative.  They don\u2019t take into consideration where you actually are on the business cycle and in terms of all of the other factors that are influencing the outcome.  They\u2019re also going to change very slowly over time.  Each quarter, you\u2019re going to publish a fan chart that looks essentially just like the fan chart from the last quarter.  So they don\u2019t really contain a lot of information beyond the first time you put them out. The second concern is that I\u2019m a little bit less convinced than others about this difficulty of doing subjective histograms based on what people think about uncertainty, because we actually do this in our surveys of the primary dealers and the buy-side participants, and they seem able to construct these histograms.  I guess I find it a little odd that we\u2019re asking others to construct histograms, but we say ourselves that we can\u2019t do it.  If you were asked that question at the press conference, Madam Chair, I wonder how you would answer that. The third concern is what President Kashkari raised.  I think when we\u2019re at the effective lower bound and issuing forward guidance with a commitment, I don\u2019t know what the fan chart for the federal funds rate means in that context.  I think it\u2019s very odd to have this wide fan chart for the federal funds rate when we\u2019re actually saying something that contradicts that.  Another issue I have with the fan chart for the federal funds rate is, let\u2019s say we\u2019re at the lower bound, should the fan chart go below zero or not.  That\u2019s actually pretty tricky.  If you think it should go below zero, you\u2019re tacitly conceding that our target federal funds rate could go negative.  If you don\u2019t put it below zero, you\u2019re essentially tacitly communicating that negative interest rates aren\u2019t on the table.  So I feel that where you draw that lower bound on the federal funds rate chart is not completely irrelevant in terms of how we communicate.  Obviously, in the appendix, you can explain why you\u2019ve done it the way you\u2019ve done it, but whether people will read the appendix and fully appreciate that is a question. In terms of the histograms, I feel much more strongly about the federal funds rate projections than those for GDP, unemployment, and inflation.  I think the biggest difficulties with these fan charts lie in the federal funds rate, as opposed to the real economic variables.  I also think the federal funds rate is more germane to us, because this is something we actually actively control.  So I guess I would like to see us try to do a dry run of histograms for the federal funds rate to see what they look like and how they compare with fan charts that were done on the root-mean-squared-error basis.  I\u2019d just like to see what they looked like.  If they were better, then we could move to that approach, and if not, we could discard them. CHAIR YELLEN.  Would anybody else like to comment", " MR. LACKER.  I support the idea of fan charts.  I just want to talk about forward guidance and commitment.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever provided forward guidance with commitment.  We\u2019ve been very careful to word our forward guidance as a prediction about what our future selves will do.  In that instance, I think a fan chart is perfectly appropriate.  In fact, the fan chart would provide a great way to signal when we do choose to provide forward guidance with commitment, because then we would omit the fan. CHAIR YELLEN.  Would anyone\u2014Todd, Stan, or anyone on the subcommittee\u2014like to comment further on the issues", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY", " MS. BRAINARD.  It\u2019s consequential.  Do we really need to add that to the set of decisions. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, I think doing it in two phases is pretty difficult and hard to communicate.  So I do worry about introducing the first three, and then, at some later date, adding the federal funds rate.  But I think the issue of whether the band potentially goes below zero is important.  Did the subcommittee have a strong view that it should not go below zero", " MR. FISCHER.  Bill, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.  You can simply make a statement that there has been no decision on this issue, and they haven\u2019t been used in the past"], "2016FOMC20160316meeting.txt": [" VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an earth- shattering decision.  If we did one or the other, I don\u2019t think we would be putting the republic at risk.  [Laughter]  But all that said, I do favor the option of not doing term RRPs at the end of the quarter for two simple reasons.  One, they\u2019re not necessary, in view of the fact that we don\u2019t have a cap on the overnight RRP facility.  There\u2019s plenty of capacity to accommodate any quarter-end demand. Without a cap, we clearly don\u2019t need them now, so the default should be no term RRP for the time being.  Once we establish a cap on the overnight RRP facility, then we should revisit this issue.  At that time we might decide to have a high cap on the overnight RRP facility.  In that case, we might still expect to have sufficient headroom at quarter-end so we can safely continue to forgo term RRP, or we can decide to have a lower cap on the overnight RRP facility, which might necessitate term RRP to ensure sufficient headroom at quarter-end. A second important reason is that I would prefer that we make the decisions in sequence.  I\u2019d have the decision on the overnight RRP cap made first.  Then, once that decision was made, I would consider the implications for headroom at quarter-end, and that, then, would drive the decision on term RRP. Now, some might view this decision not to do term RRP as inconsistent with past practice, as we\u2019ve done term RRP operations consistently over recent quarter-ends.  I disagree with this.  In terms of communication, I completely agree with the Chair.  I don\u2019t think if we forgo term RRP when we have no cap\u2014I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be difficult to explain to anybody.  We can make it clear why we\u2019re doing so in the minutes.  We simply explain that because we don\u2019t have a cap, we don\u2019t need term RRP right now.   CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker", "  [Laughter] MR. WILCOX.   I am sure.  You hide it well.  [Laughter]  Jewelry prices increased 4 percent in one month, not at an annual rate, but they were flat over 2015.  If I showed you a picture and asked you what piece of data didn\u2019t fit, that would jump out. Now, there is always a danger of making excuses for the pieces of evidence that are inconvenient, and there is a chance that that\u2019s going on here.  The pattern of the past few years is that we have tended to get upside surprises in the first half of the year.  Last year was the first year when we resisted being overly sensitive to those upside surprises in the first half of the year, and that turned out to be the correct judgment.  In the prior years, we revised up our estimate, and, retrospectively, that turned out to be a mistake. Alessandro showed, I thought, quite a striking panel yesterday\u2014I don\u2019t know whether you had a chance to take a look at the briefing\u2014that showed the monthly price increases by month over the past 10 years.  There is really quite a strong pattern that documents the claim of residual seasonality.  Now, you might say, well, if you knew about the residual seasonality going in, you shouldn\u2019t have been surprised ex post.  And that would be true on average, but it turns out that the timing of when it shows up by month is also quite variable.  Last year, I believe, if memory serves, it was the second quarter that was higher than normal.  So it is, at this point, a hypothesis.  It is nothing we can prove that we shouldn\u2019t adjust upward, but it is a hypothesis that is founded on the evidence and the experience of the past few years and supported by the examination of some of these detailed price increases", "  You have a little bit of pickup in\u2014 MR. WILCOX.  I am going to be a little more disagreeable than that and question\u2014the math of what you suggest is absolutely correct.  I think the plausibility of the experiment\u2014it feels to me like an artificial experiment to hypothesize that we would get the same GDP growth with that much lower productivity", " WILLIAMS.  We had four years of productivity growth of essentially zero.  So it doesn\u2019t seem that implausible", " MR. BULLARD.  Well, I\u2019ve complained about this before for this Committee.  I don\u2019t think you should come with a recession probability model to this Committee that hasn\u2019t been vetted.  There\u2019s a lot of ways to do these things.  There\u2019s a lot of ways to cut this data, and this looks like a very scary number", " WILLIAMS.

President Williams", " WILLIAMS.  I even asked myself, if we were to poll ourselves about market expectations, we would probably come up with something similar\u2014so I guess that\u2019s my first comment.  The second question is more substantive, and that is that the SEP rate path is actually quite a bit lower in March than it was in December.  How do you view the market reaction to that.  Do you think that this is going to get a lot of attention, and how do you think about that", " MR. LAUBACH.  There is a question in the dealer survey asking them about their expectations\u2014what the median dot will be\u2014and they\u2019re expecting 25 basis points.  So the 50 basis point shift in the median at the end of 2016 and 2017 will come as a surprise", " WILLIAMS.  So your answer to the question\u2014Do you think that markets will just see this as, kind of, what they expected, or do you think they\u2019ll see it as a softening of the Committee\u2019s views about the future policy rate path beyond what they were already expecting", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  While the real data have been about as I expected, problems with major trading partners and the volatility in financial markets make a tightening at this meeting premature.  I view the global economy as still fragile, which is presumably the source of the volatility we have seen in financial markets.  With many of our trading partners experiencing very low inflation rates and weak economies and, consequently, with regard to untried new monetary policy tools, a risk-management approach to monetary policy indicates that the benefits of waiting dominate the modest cost of not moving at this time. However, my SEP forecast embeds the assumption that we will raise the federal funds rate three times this year.  If wage and price data in the intermeeting period provide more evidence that PCE inflation is likely on its way toward 2 percent, and that labor markets are tightening further, I could imagine it would be appropriate to move as soon as April.  I do not think the current statement sets up that possibility, so if inflation improves and labor markets tighten further, additional communication by the Chair might be necessary. Of course, I could also imagine that problems abroad start to leave more traces in the financial and economic data after this meeting, and it would then be quite appropriate to wait longer before our next move.  Thus, I am comfortable waiting at this meeting, but I do want to encourage the perception that each meeting is \u201clive.\u201d Not moving in January and March already indicates that we are responsive to data and potential risks to the economy.  But many financial market assessments of future FOMC actions suggest that markets remain more pessimistic than many FOMC participants about both the strength of the U.S. economy and our likely path for raising rates.  For the period ahead, we may need to enhance our communications to address this persistent gap in perceptions so as to avoid a significant disruption to markets at the time we choose next to move.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  My December SEP path assumed two funds rate increases later this year, and, after taking a hard look at my outlook, I found no compelling reason to change that assessment.  A basic data-dependence calculation calls for holding steady today, in my opinion.  Inflation is higher, but, as I discussed yesterday, we\u2019re also facing tighter financial conditions than we anticipated in December.  In effect, financial markets have tightened for us.  In addition, I continue to be concerned that inflation expectations have declined or, at the very least, are fragile. The forces holding down inflation expectations are global, and I don\u2019t think it is so easy for us to depart from the rest of the world.  To me, these developments at least offset what could prove to be a short-lived increase in core inflation, but, of course, monitoring the data developments remains important.   A risk-management approach also continues to argue for no change in rates today and a plan for only a couple of increases in 2016.  First, we shouldn\u2019t overreact to the positive news on inflation.  We\u2019ve underrun 2 percent for quite a long time.  Now we\u2019ve seen high first-quarter readings on inflation.  This could turn out to be transitory.  There\u2019s very little cost in waiting a few months to get a better reading on the true underlying trends. Second, on account of the modest pace of growth in our baseline forecast and the considerable uncertainty and downside risks emanating from international economic conditions, I believe that policy should provide strong support to aggregate demand as a buffer against future downside shocks.  Our continued proximity to the effective lower bound leaves us little conventional ammunition to address such shocks, and, despite the excellent staff memos on policy alternatives we could use if the economy were to weaken, I would prefer to be extracautious this year to avoid having to resort to those contingencies. Third, a very gradual path of rate increases helps counter the risk that inflation expectations could be lower.  Any appropriately accommodative policy rate path should provide a strong signal of our commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation target.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo", " MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As inflation remains below target, and that my economic forecast anticipates only a gradual increase in inflation, I support alternative B at this meeting.  It is not crucial that we adjust policy today, but I believe it is important, in view of the underlying strength of the economy and the increasing likelihood that inflation will return to target in the not-too-distant future, that a move in April not be taken off the table at this point. Labor markets continue to improve, and a recent FRBSF Economic Letter\u2014\u201cWhat\u2019s Up with Wage Growth.\u201d\u2014convincingly argues that nominal wage growth is much healthier than usually reported in the numbers that we look at.  There\u2019s been a strong rebound in equity prices, and financial volatility has waned as well.  Inflation has shown signs of firming as oil prices have bottomed and even risen a little bit of late and the dollar has stabilized.  Thus, I am more confident in the economy than I was two months ago and less concerned about the potential for a sustained decrease in inflation or inflation deviating from target for a significant time to come. Monetary policy remains accommodative, and we will still be accommodative in the event of future rate hikes.  I think we need to remain, as we\u2019ve all said, data dependent.  And should the economy evolve somewhat in line with my forecast, a rate hike at the next meeting merits consideration.  Signs of firming in inflation remain an important consideration for the setting of policy.  But with inflation moving toward our objective and the economy at or above full employment, we risk sending confusing signals to the market if we delay normalization for too long.  I worry that we are setting up an uncertainty feedback loop in which we consistently emphasize the risk that inflation will not return to target, and the markets reflect that concern, leading to volatility and lower inflation compensation, causing us to, again, pause normalization, which further worries the market.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the language in alternative B for paragraphs 1 and 2, but I do not agree with its policy prescription.  Since the December meeting, incoming data have largely confirmed my outlook.  We\u2019ve received three strong labor reports as well as data indicating that inflation is moving higher.  Unfortunately, our initiation of removing accommodation has coincided with what appears to me a more vulnerable global economy and a domestic economy that is threatened by markets that seem to be anxious, uncertain, and volatile.  Faced with these dynamics, I recognize that the Committee\u2019s decisions to continue to normalize its policy settings become far more difficult. Risks associated with financial volatility and global concerns have diminished recently, but I would agree with others that there have been no fundamental changes that would preclude more bouts of volatility in the days and even months ahead.  So, in the face of such headwinds and uncertainty, I\u2019m inclined to focus on our longer-run objectives.  With an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent, the economy is near full employment, and the recent upward movements in year-over-year headline PCE inflation and core PCE inflation suggest that the temporary downward pressures associated with falling oil prices and appreciation of the dollar have been dissipating.  In the interest of our mandate to promote long-run sustainable growth with healthy employment and price stability, I believe monetary policy should respond to these developments by slowly removing accommodation. The Committee has acknowledged that the pace of policy adjustments is expected to be more gradual than would be dictated based solely on economic conditions as prescribed by policy rules.  Likewise, a gradual path does offer a risk-management approach as we face various headwinds and risk in the economy.  As described in Tealbook B, the real equilibrium interest rate and policy rules continue to point to settings that are, and will continue to be for some time, very accommodative under the baseline assumption regarding the federal funds rate path.  The current federal funds rate is more than 2 percentage points below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r*, and the only time since 2005 that this gap was larger was immediately prior to the December liftoff. Postponing the removal of accommodation in the wake of improving economic conditions could very well promote risk that would decrease the likelihood of achieving our longer-run objectives.  As we near full employment and price stability, continuation of the current level of accommodation invites further misallocation of capital and labor resources to sectors that are most interest sensitive. My District is experiencing the fallout of a commodity price boom, and concerns are being raised nationwide regarding risk associated with commercial real estate lending.  My concern for some time has been that extending monetary policy too far beyond its scope of capability risks undesirable financial, economic, and political distortions. Waiting may seem costless in the face of benign inflation pressures, and confidence is often expressed that we\u2019ll have the ability to make the necessary or steeper adjustments later.  This argument might be more persuasive if one was confident that the relationship between employment and inflation was reasonably positive.  But most estimates suggest that the Phillips curve is pretty flat.  Under this scenario, the challenges of speeding up inflation now, when it is below target, must be equivalent to future challenges of slowing inflation down, should it move above.  With an output gap that is basically closed, I see costs associated with trying to fine-tune inflation dynamics when the transmission mechanism from unemployment to inflation is relatively weak. So staying the course with a gradual path of policy normalization is warranted, in my view.  A 25 basis point increase at this meeting is consistent with the economy\u2019s fundamentals, keeps policy very accommodative, and does not preclude pausing or responding if downside risks, in fact, materialize.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams"], "2016FOMC20160427meeting.txt": [" MR. FUHRER.  Somehow I knew Eric was going to ask that question.  [Laughter]  I think one word that I didn\u2019t use during my presentation but is essential to keep in mind is \u201chumility,\u201d in that none of us, I will submit, know exactly how macroprudential tools work, whether circumstances might arise in which monetary policy was the best option available, and how that would work during such an episode of financial instability. My imagination is fertile enough that I can imagine circumstances in which either we have chosen not to or are unable to pursue what we call our first choice\u2014that is, use cyclical time-varying macroprudential tools\u2014and yet we have identified what we think are troublesome buildups of financial instability.  And if we are constrained in that way, it is conceivable that we would use monetary policy to address it, with due concern to the issues that are raised in the paper and in the briefing.  First, critically, freighting monetary policy with an additional objective that may be competing with its other objectives\u2014we already have tradeoffs to make within the dual mandate\u2014is not to be done lightly.  And the second is\u2014until research overturns this result, if it is found to do so\u2014the possibility for collateral damage or the possibility that modest movements in monetary policy instruments will have little or no effect on the very strong incentives that build up in a financial boom.  Those considerations are to be taken seriously, but if we are so constrained, I can imagine that that\u2019s a resort\u2014not never, but a last resort", " MR. SIM.  I don\u2019t have completely different views from those of the first two speakers, but I have several points to raise for consideration.  I think it\u2019s possible that the monetary policy interest rate becomes the first, second, or even third resort, but it\u2019s not crystal clear in which direction to use monetary policy to ensure financial stability. Let me remind you that from the second half of 2004 to the second half of 2006, the Federal Reserve increased the policy rate 450 basis points.  Now, there is some empirical evidence that the increase decelerated the expansion of the balance sheet of the commercial banking sector.  However, there is some evidence that the deceleration in the expansion of commercial banks\u2019 balance sheet caused lending activity to migrate to the unregulated shadow banking sector.  So it is not always clear that the use of an increase in the monetary policy rate will always bring financial stability. Another reason to think about the use of monetary policy is that, during the period from 2004 to 2006, the increase in interest rates created huge interest rate differentials between different continents, between Europe and the United States and between Japan and the United States.  That really accelerated capital inflow to the U.S. market.  There may be some situations in which you may want to lower the interest rate to fight carry traders whose behavior may enhance financial stability.  So it is not always one direction. Another point that I want to make is that, in a situation like the current one, raising the interest rate because of financial stability concerns may weaken the credibility of your commitment to the 2 percent inflation target.  That was a substantial concern in Sweden a few years ago. My last point is that there can be a situation in which monetary policy can be an important tool to achieve financial stability.  That is, when the economy reacts to a shock in a history-dependent way\u2014for instance, if the response of the economy to a given size of the shock depends on the credit history of the economy\u2014then there may be a stronger case for leaning-against-the-wind monetary policy to reduce the tail risk.  However, that should be empirically tested before it is brought into the actual policy arena. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Further questions", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Because I might be one of the last speakers between you folks and lunch, I\u2019ll be brief.  I construed the discussion topic as the narrow question of the way in which the setting of monetary policy instruments should vary with the financial stability considerations, or observations of conditions, rather than the broader question of appropriate public policy in relation to financial stability.  I agree that the state of understanding is relatively limited, and so my comments are basically two suggestions for further research. The staff\u2019s focus is almost entirely on the buildup, or boom, phase, in which financial conditions are evolving in a way that might lead to future distress.  I agree with the staff\u2019s memo that highlighted the difficulty of determining whether some observed developments represent inefficient departures from healthy market functioning.  I agree, therefore, that humility should be our watchword.  For me, this is a powerful argument for central banks to stick to their price-stability knitting, because responding to sectoral developments per se runs the risk of entangling us in distributional politics.  Besides, the economic basis for doing so seems not obvious to me in many circumstances. For me, this is also a powerful argument for more research on how we should know, in real time, what the appropriate response should be.  And here I guess I differ from President Bullard about what we knew in 2005 or 2006.  Maybe there was agreement on overvaluation of housing, but exactly how that would play out and exactly how different approaches to monetary policy would affect that were, I think, quite uncertain.  And I contrast this kind of research on how we should know with what I see as the bulk of research that has been cited for us, in which the policymaker is absolutely sure of the model he\u2019s in:  He\u2019s in the model that the modeler wrote down.  As a result, it\u2019s just a matter of deciding what to do about what he knows, as opposed to having to sort through different theories, different models, different estimates, and then different understandings of how to proceed. In the other direction from leaning against booms, there appears to be little controversy that, as one paper put it, \u201cmonetary policy should be used to stabilize the economy and financial markets in the wake of a financial crash\u201d\u2014in other words, respond to a full-blown recession.  But I\u2019d like to suggest that there\u2019s a third case that deserves attention as well:  instances in which financial market turbulence arises but does not end up leading to a full-fledged crash and thus ultimately proves transitory.  Examples would include the stock market break of 1987 and the LTCM\u2013Russian debt default crisis in 1998\u201399.  It\u2019s natural at such times to make monetary policy more accommodative out of concern for the downside risks\u2014that is, the increase in the probability of adverse outcomes for economic growth and inflation.  And I view that as the standard monetary policy response to information about the prospects for the fundamental things we care about\u2014employment and inflation\u2014not an additional reaction to financial stability.  But even if the financial market turbulence settles down without causing a recession, it\u2019s common at times like that for monetary policy to remain more accommodative for some time. Clearly, though, it can\u2019t be optimal for the monetary policy reaction to be permanent in the sense that the policy rate path is forever deflected downward by a one-time ratchet effect in response to every instance of financial market tumult.  Even short of a strictly permanent reaction, I believe what happened in 1998\u201399 illustrates that there\u2019s a very real risk that when monetary policy remains more accommodative for too long and sets off a response, it could leave us substantially \u201cbehind the curve.\u201d  So I think this portion of the monetary policy reaction function to financial-stability considerations deserves attention from researchers as well.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On these issues, I have for some time generally accepted the conventional wisdom that called for macroprudential tools as the primary line of defense and for monetary policy to be used rarely.  But at the same time, I am quite uncomfortable with the implications of that recommendation and whether we really have an understanding of why that is the right approach.  And part of that discomfort is just having been familiar with work by Jeremy Stein and many others, including some of you around the table, which calls those things into question for various reasons.  I would say these excellent memos and today\u2019s discussion have, I hope, moved me closer to clarity, but certainly not all the way there. As these papers and the wider literature illustrate, many of the fundamental questions concerning the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability remain unsettled.  There\u2019s significant uncertainty about our ability to identify threats ex ante and how to think about the tradeoff between type I and type II errors.  The effectiveness of our macroprudential tools is untested.  It\u2019s not clear whether and under what circumstances monetary policy is likely to reduce threats to financial stability without imposing too high a cost.  All of this suggests to me that, as President Mester suggested, the road to achieving an addition to the consensus statement in which we were all agreeing on the relationship between monetary policy and macroprudential and financial stability could well be a long and challenging one. Although I regard the question as somewhat unsettled, my working view is that regulation, including macroprudential policies, should be the primary line of defense against financial instability.  In the United States, increasing the system\u2019s overall resiliency with through-the-cycle policies seems like our best available tool for addressing these risks.  Higher capital ratios, larger holdings of liquid assets, and the near elimination of \u201crunnable\u201d bank debt have made the banking system and our overall financial system safer.  If these measures had been in place before the financial crisis, I feel fairly sure that the consequences would have been much less severe. The efficacy of time-varying tools remains questionable.  CCAR could be used in a targeted and reasonably timely way if financial-stability risks pertain primarily to the banking system.  But the interagency process is slow and will remain so, inadequately addressing problems even in cases in which there is direct authority to do so.  I don\u2019t expect that to change.  There are also important sectors of the financial system in which transparency and the reach of macroprudential tools are limited, and I don\u2019t expect that to change either. All that said, some of the research comes very close to saying that monetary policy is simply the wrong tool and highly unlikely to ever play a constructive role in addressing threats to financial stability.  And I am uncomfortable\u2014like, it sounds, others around the table are\u2014with categorical statements about what one will or will not do in a crisis.  Several have noted that humility is an appropriate watchword here.  I think Mike Tyson actually said it so much more colorfully when he noted that everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.  [Laughter]  In unusual circumstances, therefore, I could be open to using monetary policy to address financial stability threats.  There would be an obvious tension between moving early before the evidence is clear and waiting too long for clarity.  And, of course, the earlier the intervention, the less clear it would be that higher rates would actually reduce the already very low probability of a financial crisis. Despite these challenges, though, there are two key features of the U.S. context that call for keeping one\u2019s mind open and that I don\u2019t think are adequately faced by the literature.  First, as many have mentioned, the U.S. institutional setting is very challenging for macroprudential policy, with our unwieldy regulatory apparatus and vibrant shadow banking sector.  Second, while this is not my baseline, it\u2019s plausible to me that rates will have to remain very low for a very long time to achieve stable prices and full employment, but that such low rates will drive excessive credit growth and create irresistible upward pressure on asset prices, including real estate prices.  I\u2019m thinking of a situation in which a broad range of asset prices are moving up well beyond what fundamentals would justify; where the other tools we have don\u2019t seem to be addressing the problem or have failed to do so; and where low interest rates are pushing up asset prices and driving credit to excessive levels, probably over many years, and thus are a principal cause of the threat.  Recalling that we have had two major real estate blowups in the past 25 years, I would not rule out a policy of leaning against the wind in such a case as one tool among many.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", " MR. DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First, I want to thank the staff for their thoughtful memos.  I thought that how you framed the discussion was great. While I agree that macroprudential policy measures are the primary instruments through which policy \u201cshould,\u201d with quotes around it, promote financial stability, I view the institutional constraints in the United States as making this very difficult to operationalize in practice.  I think that the diffusion of responsibility among many different regulatory agencies and the differences in mandates across these agencies are very important constraints.  In my own experience, a number of regulatory agencies do not seem to give much weight, if any, to broad financial stability objectives.  In particular, they do not appear to place much emphasis on the effect of how the behavior of any particular firm generates externalities that affect other firms and the broader financial system.  Thus, rules and regulations tend to have a microprudential focus and a consumer and investor protection focus rather than being oriented toward mitigating risks to the broader financial system. There\u2019s also a meaningful coordination problem, which suggests that implementing macroprudential tools in a timely way would be very difficult to do in practice.  Yes, we do have the FSOC.  But the reality is that the individual agencies guard their prerogatives, and the fact that the FSOC is chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury\u2014part of the executive branch\u2014can introduce a political element in the pursuit of its responsibilities.  So under the U.S. institutional setup, I think tools that work automatically through-the-cycle might be more effective than those that would have to be implemented on a more discretionary basis.  But such automatic tools are difficult to design and calibrate in a world in which the threats in the future are likely to differ significantly from those in the past.  When you think about the different bubbles we\u2019ve had over the past 30 or 40 years, they\u2019re all very, very different.  And I imagine that one set of tools that would work very well over the cycle for one set of bubbles might not be totally adequate for another. As a result, I don\u2019t view macroprudential policies as being at a level of maturity in the United States that we would likely be able to deploy them very successfully to achieve our financial stability objectives.  That said, I do think a number of policies that have up to now been primarily microprudential in nature, such as CCAR, CLAR, and supervisory guidance, could also be used to achieve macroprudential objectives.  I suspect that having a CCAR stress test include a significant stress to one particular asset class or activity that we were concerned about from a financial stability perspective\u2014take commercial real estate lending as an example\u2014could influence the credit provision to that sector by driving up the shadow price of capital for that activity. This suggests to me that we should do more work in three areas:  First, work with other regulatory agencies to sensitize them to the importance of financial stability and to broaden our collective macroprudential toolkit; second, continue to develop how our microprudential instruments could be adapted to pursue macroprudential objectives; and, third, explore in what circumstances monetary policy might play a role.  Can it be used effectively to fill in the cracks, or are its financial stability effects likely to be very limited relative to the consequences to broad macroeconomic activity.  And what\u2019s the cost-benefit tradeoff here. With respect to monetary policy, I have to admit some skepticism about its efficacy to achieve financial stability objectives.  As I see it, in most cases the benefits of a tighter monetary policy in curbing excess in a particular sector are likely to be outweighed by the costs in terms of greater deviations from the Committee\u2019s medium-term employment and inflation objectives.  But I think this conclusion depends on the particular circumstances.  For example, how big the sector is and how sensitive it is to monetary policy probably matter in terms of that cost-benefit tradeoff.  If the sector that is out of balance is large\u2014think residential housing\u2014and that sector is very sensitive to interest rates, then I would think the benefits of monetary policy would likely be higher. Also, monetary policy might be useful in terms of signaling our concern.  One thing we didn\u2019t talk about very much today was expectations, and I think expectations do matter.  And if the central bank protested against how a sector was evolving, this might result in meaningful changes in behavior beyond those just generated by the change in the prospective path of short-term interest rates.  In monetary policy, we really have a very well developed theory of how these expectations tend to influence behavior.  We don\u2019t really seem to have that same work developed on the macroprudential side yet.  I recall how the Carter Administration\u2019s implementation of credit controls in the spring of 1980\u2014and one could argue that was a macroprudential measure\u2014had a very powerful effect well before the controls actually were binding.  Now, this was not a particularly successful experiment, as it worked a lot more effectively than they imagined.  But it does, I think, underscore the importance of expectations. So the bottom line for me is, I wouldn\u2019t rule out using monetary policy to achieve financial stability objectives, but I certainly would try to use microprudential and macroprudential tools first to the extent that that was feasible.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo", " MR. TARULLO.  It\u2019s maybe a bit unfair to have the first word and then try to have one of the last words, but I did want to make a couple of observations about the tenor of the conversation. First, I guess I don\u2019t agree with those who say that we understand how monetary policy works really well, we just don\u2019t understand how macroprudential policies work.  I\u2019ve spent seven years here being surprised at how much uncertainty there actually is on the transmission mechanisms for monetary policy.  And I keep coming back to our reliance on inflation expectations\u2014something that\u2019s undertheorized, undocumented, and hard to pin down empirically.  So while there\u2019s certainly more work to be done, I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s as radical a distinction as some have suggested. A corollary to that\u2014and this is what I thought Stan and I were trying to get at early on, without success\u2014is, in thinking about the idea, it\u2019s not just popping bubbles.  The popping bubbles thing is an enormous problem.  If you get to the point at which you have the bubble and you\u2019re going to try to use monetary policy to pop it, then the sort of thing Charlie was talking about is absolutely going to ensue.  But, presumably, monetary policy, and how it operates and what effects it has, differs across conditions of countries as well as within particular economies as those economies and their financial systems evolve.  And I think we at least have to be somewhat open to the possibility that the ways in which our economy and financial system have evolved are such that it\u2019s not just a Hippocratic Oath thing in which you can\u2019t use monetary policy to do something about financial stability because you may do harm.  It may be, and I underscore may be, that monetary policy itself is creating some of the problem.  And I think we just, intellectually, need to be a bit more open to that. You know, there are many times in the past two years when I\u2019ve missed having Jeremy on this corridor.  Today is way high up on my list of times when I wish Jeremy were here to give what I regard as his very powerful, somewhat alternative view of the way in which monetary policy operates", " MR. EVANS.  Can I ask you just a clarifying question about what you\u2019re talking about.  Because I thought that the premise of what I was talking about was, you\u2019re about to make a monetary policy decision on the basis of how you think the economy is going, and then all of a sudden somebody says, \u201cWait a minute.  Financial stability is more of a problem.\u201d  Then you do something different, and that\u2019s presumably going to push you away from what you thought you were trying to achieve.  That\u2019s the context", "  The MSCI EM equity index rose 6.8 percent, extending its strong year-to-date performance despite the January financial market volatility.  The global search for yield also benefited EM assets, as illustrated by Argentina\u2019s return to the international bond market after a 15-year absence. Despite the continued stabilization and recovery in risk assets over the period, concerns regarding longer-running global themes persist.  Market contacts continued to question the monetary policy efficacy of the Bank of Japan and, to a lesser extent, the European Central Bank.  Foreign exchange markets continue to send the strongest signal:  Since these two central banks added incremental accommodation in January and March, respectively, both the euro and yen have appreciated notably versus the dollar, as shown in the bottom-left panel.  In fact, despite the combined force of the yen\u2019s recent sharp appreciation, expectations for the BOJ to add accommodation, and mounting expectations for intervention to weaken the currency, net positioning by speculative investors for further yen appreciation has reached its highest level since the 1990s.  For both the BOJ and ECB, market commentary continues to question the ability of available tools to realize their policy objectives.  Indeed, five-year, five-year inflation swap rates in the euro area and Japan have fallen since the two central banks announced their respective large easing measures, and banks have continued to struggle in the low-growth and negative interest rate environment. Elsewhere, a new global risk came into focus\u2014the U.K. referendum vote on European Union membership on June 23.  The outcome is currently seen as a close call by market participants.  As shown in the bottom-right panel, market participants seem to be pricing in substantial event risk in the foreign exchange market:  The relative cost of protection against a large sterling depreciation against the dollar rose discretely as the related option expiration date spanned the referendum date.  More directly relevant to U.S. monetary policy, several market participants have suggested the referendum could present an obstacle to any desire by the FOMC to tighten policy in June, due to the possibility of widespread volatility in European financial markets following a \u201cleave\u201d vote in the referendum and amid a perceived increased responsiveness of monetary policy to global developments", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I just want to say that I applaud the Desk staff for undertaking a rigorous look at how we manage the foreign exchange reserves we find ourselves with.  They\u2019ve grounded their approach in what seems like a reasonably sensible set of principles, and I think that should protect us from undue criticism regarding stewardship of these funds.  I think that\u2019s important. I want to point out, though, that the magnitude of the estimate of the funding needs just highlights what an anachronistic arrangement these funds represent.  I find it hard to believe that anyone believes a $6 billion intervention in the euro-dollar market would make a meaningful difference and would leave some imprint.  This is trivial in relation to the size of U.S. reserve account balances or European reserve account balances.  And under current operating procedures when we set the IOER rate, it\u2019s hard to see how monetary conditions would change in the United States.  So it would be exactly like the old regime in which sterilized foreign exchange interventions were basically meaningless.  Now, the only real effect it could have is if it signaled something about the future course of monetary policy.  But because the Treasury is acknowledged to be in the lead and have the authority over U.S. dollar policy, it\u2019s sort of problematic for the independence of our monetary policy if we\u2019re perceived to be bending future monetary policy at the behest of the Treasury\u2019s desires about dollar policy. In Richmond we\u2019ve complained about these arrangements for a couple of decades now.  We don\u2019t expect a lot of action soon.  [Laughter]  But at some point we need to start educating policymakers and the public about these arrangements, that the operations really are anachronistic and don\u2019t really do any good, and maybe convince them we could eliminate the funds, give the money back to the Treasury, or do something else with them.  Thank you, Madam Chair", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Steve referred to markets as largely having shrugged off Brexit risks.  This is consonant with what I\u2019ve heard directly from some market actors.  But Simon, in his presentation, noted a fairly significant increase in demand for protection against pound depreciation against the dollar, apparently with an eye toward the upcoming referendum.  How do I reconcile those two observations", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Just to follow up on this, I thought that even if they voted to get out, this would trigger a round of negotiations.  Even for financial institutions, at least immediately, their situations would not change for up to two years.  And beyond that, it\u2019s not that clear exactly what their situation would be.  So the market might price in only a small change for Brexit", " MR. WASCHER.  Some of the pickup reflects a technical issue with hours.  I hate to bring this up, but we\u2019ve been surprised on the upside by the strength in the component of hours that isn\u2019t captured by the payroll survey, and that\u2019s been holding productivity down.  We don\u2019t project it being wound back, but we aren\u2019t expecting it to continue, and we get a pickup in productivity growth on that technical reason.  More broadly, our view is that as the economy improves and investment picks up, we\u2019ll start to see some gradual improvement in productivity\u2014only to, maybe, 1\u00bc percent, so it\u2019s certainly not high relative to the post-2005 era.  In fact, I think the average over that 10-year period is about 1\u00bc percent.  So we\u2019re not expecting a huge pickup in productivity. I guess the other thing I would say is that we\u2019re also nervous about it, and we see downside risks.  There was an alternative view box in the Tealbook that I thought made a strong case that we might not see a pickup like we have in the forecast.  And along with that alternative view box, we included a couple of alternative simulations that illustrate how the economy might respond to a weaker productivity path.  So in the baseline forecast, we have retained our assumption that productivity will move back up to a modest 1\u00bc percent pace, but I certainly agree that there are downside risks to that, in light of what we\u2019ve seen over the past five years", " MS. LIANG.  What we can try to look at is, what underwriting standards look like, as opposed to how well they\u2019re using the funds they raise.  This chart reflects the concern we have raised since 2013:  the rise in debt in the high-yield bond market and the leveraged loans, in which we had been starting to see very loose underwriting standards.  I think at this point, with oil prices having fallen and credit growth in the sector having really started to slow, though there are a few defaults, there\u2019s some easing of imbalances.  Our sense is, this debt ratio won\u2019t continue to rise.  But it has risen, and at this point is that the divergence with household is quite unusual", " MS. LIANG.  The earnings per share growth estimates are coming down", " MR. POTTER.  Didn\u2019t you have a box in the Tealbook", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The reports on economic activity from my business contacts were a bit more upbeat than in March.  Notably, no one expressed much concern that the first-quarter weakness in GDP would prove to be more than a transitory soft patch.  In my District, there continues to be a large contrast between conditions in industrial versus consumer-facing businesses.  Those producing industrial capital goods who have heavy international trade exposure are seeing weak demand.  Those facing the U.S. consumer are more positive. Some of the weakness in cap-ex is easy to explain by the strong dollar and low energy prices.  Other anecdotal reports are more challenging to square.  A couple of my directors and other contacts say that even with low interest rates and plenty of cash on hand, firms are choosing not to invest, and we heard that just a minute ago.  These firms clearly say that they are right-sized for the current level of demand, their outlook for continued slow growth, and the potential downside risks.  So it seems there\u2019s another factor beyond the dollar and low commodity prices weighing on capital spending\u2014namely, business caution.  Firms\u2019 baseline sales expectations are modest, and they\u2019re very attentive to what could go wrong. With regard to the economic picture, the first quarter obviously was quite weak.  My staff\u2019s outlook is that economic growth will recover to average around 2\u00bd percent over the rest of the year.  I can\u2019t say that forecast is wrong.  I am not optimistic myself.  But if residual seasonality remains anywhere, it would seem to be in our collective early-year optimism, which is then followed by downward revisions to the outlook in the middle of the year.  I guess that\u2019s seasonality too, isn\u2019t it.  And I could see the same happening with this forecast, as realistically the risks are probably to the downside. With regard to inflation, the incoming data were consistent with our forecast of core PCE at 1.6 percent for the year, although we continue to see some downside risk associated with a potential decline in inflation expectations.  In any event, our Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago forecasts of economic growth and inflation are very similar to the Tealbook\u2019s.  However, we do have a somewhat different view of labor market slack.  We think the labor force participation rate is still somewhat below trend, and this translates into a little more overall slack in labor markets than in the Tealbook. An important factor supporting our forecast is the continuation of the improvement in credit conditions that started in mid-February.  This improvement was a major theme among our financial market contacts this round.  Our contact who tracks small business lending reported a pickup in demand for credit in February after markedly negative reports in three of the previous five months.  Consistent with our real-side anecdotes, small business lending is strongest among consumer-facing firms and firms providing nontradable goods and services.  Our contacts at Ford noted that they received a lot of interest from banks in the renewal of their credit line syndicate, and that the spreads on their commercial paper and other debt were the narrowest in about a year.  Finally, in line with Simon\u2019s report from the dealer survey, a number of financial contacts said that FOMC communication about risk management was a critical factor supporting the recent improvement in financial conditions.  In their opinion, the Fed\u2019s willingness to lean against adverse tail risk has been an important stabilizing force. To sum up, on balance, the domestic fundamentals continue to be good.  My baseline scenario has economic growth recovering from its first-quarter soft patch and the recent improvements of inflation being maintained.  But downside risks remain, and our risk-management approach to guard against those risks continues to be a salient feature of appropriate policy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart", " WILLIAMS.  Yes, let\u2019s be transparent.  [Laughter]  But can I respond", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  It is appropriate to see whether the weakness in spending for the first quarter is reflecting more than a temporary pause in real GDP growth.  My expectation is that the second quarter will be stronger.  If the incoming data between now and the June meeting confirm that real GDP is growing at least as fast as potential GDP and labor markets are continuing to improve, then, in my view, it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points. On account of my expectation that we will not move at this meeting and my assessment that it will be appropriate to move at the next meeting, I do have communications concerns.  My reading of alternative B is that it is unlikely to significantly increase market perceptions of the probability attached to a tightening in June.  If that is correct, the market probably has too low a probability regarding both a tightening in June and our likely policy rate path over the forecast horizon.  The market\u2019s expectation that we may move only 75 basis points through 2018 reflects much more pessimism than I have about the economy and, in my view, risks a taper tantrum response as the market realizes that, while policy will be accommodative from our perspective, it will not be nearly as accommodative as financial markets currently expect.  If the incoming data over the next two months are consistent with the Tealbook forecast\u2014and recognizing that we will not have another SEP to signal policy intentions\u2014we will need to communicate more clearly before the June meeting about the likely path of policy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Let me say that I do have a speech that I\u2019ve scheduled for June 6, which is the very last day before the blackout period.  I know that\u2019s pretty close to the meeting, but I did schedule it in order to be able to communicate reasonably clearly if it becomes utterly evident that there\u2019s a gap between market expectations and our likely behavior.  And I know others also will be speaking", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As always, I found the comparisons in the Tealbook among the various policy rules very helpful.  In particular, the optimal control rule that places greater weight on deviations of inflation from its target than on unemployment running below its assumed natural rate has some intuitive appeal, both because we have some uncertainty about what the natural rate is in the wake of the crisis and because it\u2019s hard to see the welfare costs associated with having unemployment run a bit low temporarily, as distinct, of course, from any possible implications that may have for inflation. I took two lessons from this analysis.  First, even with this policy rule that places greater weight on inflation, we have to work pretty hard to get inflation back up to its target, which it does not reach until 2018.  In fact, interestingly, this is the only policy rule that gets inflation back to 2 percent by 2018.  The slow rise in inflation is due in part to a very flat Phillips curve.  But even assuming nominal wage growth is four times more responsive to the unemployment gap than it currently appears to be\u2014a setting that might be associated with a nonlinearity in the Phillips curve near the natural rate of unemployment\u2014inflation doesn\u2019t get back to 2 percent until 2018, with a policy rate path that is shallower than that in the March SEP. Of course, achieving our target on inflation under these scenarios requires that unemployment will run below what we currently believe to be its natural rate, and that inflation will run about one- to two-tenths above 2 percent from 2019 to 2020.  And, of course, the public would need to believe that the FOMC would tolerate such a modest overshoot due to the symmetry of our inflation target around 2 percent.  I think that\u2019s an important thought exercise\u2014remembering that, in 70 out of the 74 months since the beginning of 2010, the 12-month change in core PCE inflation has been below 2 percent and that we are indeed comfortable with being symmetric around the 2 percent target. Turning to today\u2019s context, I see the intermeeting period as mixed.  On the one hand, financial market conditions have improved notably, but I believe this is in no small part a response to a perceived softening in the expected rate path in the United States and its spillback effects through pressures on China\u2019s currency peg and, through that, to broader emerging market risks.  Oil appears to have reached an inflection point, and China\u2019s stimulus, while it raises some questions about long-term sustainability, appears to be supporting near-term economic growth. Here at home, however, despite ongoing strength in the labor market, domestic spending indicators have disappointed for the second consecutive quarter, and there\u2019s some concern that U.S. consumption may be softening despite important supports coming from income, the behavior of gasoline prices, and sentiment.  Importantly, the data suggest that the earlier improvement in core inflation may have been relatively short lived, and measures of inflation expectations and inflation compensation remain low. Progress in the labor market has continued.  Interestingly, the composition of that progress has changed with a shift toward the participation margin, suggesting a greater elasticity of labor supply than previously thought.  Wages have been subdued, and, as in March, there still appears to be just a little more slack remaining. The broad-based easing in financial markets has brightened the medium-term outlook a bit and made the balance of risks more favorable.  But it\u2019s important to recognize how closely tied this improvement in financial conditions is to recent monetary policy communication, particularly including, I think, the downward shift in the policy rate path implied by the SEP, which has suggested an awareness on the part of this Committee of the risks posed by the global environment and the need to shape policy in accordance with those risks. With realized economic conditions relative to our goals, particularly inflation, little changed since March, and with the medium-term outlook also only modestly changed, especially after taking into account recent monetary policy communication, it seems appropriate to leave the federal funds rate at its current level.  At our next meeting we\u2019ll have received two more labor market reports, two more PCE inflation reports, two estimates of first-quarter GDP growth, and some of the spending data relevant for assessing second-quarter GDP.  These data will be important for me in helping to determine whether the weakness that we\u2019re seeing currently is likely to prove persistent as well as whether we\u2019re seeing any improvement in progress on inflation and on, importantly, inflation expectations. This leaves me very comfortable with the wait-and-see approach that the Committee has adopted and that is captured in alternative B.  My preference is to reserve judgment about possible actions in June and to let the data do the talking.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker", " MR. TARULLO.  But you\u2019re worried that the approach to 2 percent may unanchor inflation expectations, while you weren\u2019t worried that, for a number of years, the failure to reach 2 percent could have unanchored those expectations", " MR. TARULLO.  Yes", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will support alternative B, and I support the statement as written. My base case is that we should proceed with a gradual pace of interest rate increases, including probably two increases this year, provided that the economy continues on its projected path.  As for June, if we have two more months of continued labor market progress and some indication of a brighter picture on spending, then I could support another rate increase as soon as June. I have to say that, sitting here today, the question of whether to move in June strikes me as a particularly tricky one for two reasons.  First, U.S. and global financial conditions are significantly improved since early February, and that is due, in large part, to the perceived shift in U.S. monetary policy, which was validated by the March SEP.  I would like to see things come together for an increase in June.  I\u2019m not at all certain that they will.  And that\u2019s partly because of the data that are incoming, as President Lockhart indicated. The second thing is Brexit.  There was a lot of discussion on it yesterday and some today.  The June meeting ends on June 15, eight days before the Brexit vote.  As of June 15, the result of the Brexit vote may or may not be in serious doubt, and markets may or may not be in turmoil over that.  So I\u2019m just saying I can imagine circumstances in which I would think it risky to proceed with another rate increase, and I can also imagine circumstances in which it might be safe, assuming the data also justify it. I would not want to tighten going into a situation in which it\u2019s highly uncertain what\u2019s going to happen.  I think we don\u2019t need to be in that kind of a hurry.  So I\u2019ll leave it there.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer"], "2016FOMC20160615meeting.txt": [" MR. RUDD.  For 2016", " MR. KAMIN.  Yes", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I was looking at the international forecasts.  You have another disappointment in terms of global growth, yet an environment in which monetary policies around the world are supposedly very accommodative.  How do you square the circle.  What do you think is fundamentally going on.  And there are a couple of completely alternative sort of scenarios.  One scenario would be that monetary policy stimulus isn\u2019t as great as we think it is, and so then we have to come up with an explanation for that.  One possible explanation is maybe monetary policy stimulus becomes attenuated over time, because over time people buy things, it pulls things forward, and that means they don\u2019t buy those things in the future, or maybe household savings reacts to the low level of interest rates by deciding that they have to save more.  That\u2019s one possible explanation.  Another possible explanation is there is a global saving glut.  And it just seems like it would be useful to dive in a little bit more into this issue of why we consistently see global economic weakness in an environment in which monetary policy is super stimulative, supposedly.  I don\u2019t feel like we have a coherent story reconciling those two things", " MR. AHMED.  Yes.  It\u2019s not that we will do better.  As you can see in the forecast, we have a lower trend\u2014period.   And it stays at 2.8 percent", " MR. KAMIN.  All right.  Let me just start by saying \u201ceasy\u201d in the sense of any firm that wants to invest and actually hire people and build a factory can do so for virtually no cost of funds.  So, to me, that suggests clearly that there are huge headwinds on spending itself.  We know that\u2019s true in the corporate investment side, in which corporations are earning far more profits around the world than they are investing, and they are returning that cash to their shareholders via dividends and buybacks.  And then we know that consumption has not been particularly strong. I would say, for starters, it is obvious there are very strong headwinds against spending.  And then, on top of that, whether monetary policy has lost its oomph, I think we could make an argument that certainly marginal policy stimulus has.  But, as I say, I think the fault must lie on the part of the spenders and why they don\u2019t spend.  Clearly, interest rates are now so low that money for investment can be had for nothing", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I wouldn\u2019t necessarily disagree with that.  But I would say that the 25 basis points would give you \u201cX\u201d amount in period 1, but \u201cX minus something\u201d in period 2, and \u201cX minus something greater\u201d in period 3.  In other words, the effect of that cut would peter out over time.  That\u2019s really what I\u2019m suggesting. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Fischer would like to join this debate", " MR. FISCHER.  When the FOMC introduced the large-scale purchases of domestic assets, it was a change in policy.  Furthermore, it hadn\u2019t been anticipated.  When it happened, we got a fairly big reduction in long-term interest rates at the time.  Now, if that expansionary policy stayed in place forever, we would have expected long-term interest rates to rise gradually back up partway as the economy strengthened, until they reached a new level.  However, we had expected, all of us, that that strengthening process would be led by the interest-sensitive sectors, namely residential investment, and to a lesser extent, business investment.  Well, it didn\u2019t happen.  What we were expecting to come in didn\u2019t come in. At the same time, productivity growth seems to be very low.  With productivity and investment both low\u2014what have we got to spur the economy other than continued accommodative monetary policy.  As of now, we haven\u2019t gotten either the productivity growth or investment we might have expected", " MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to go back to a few comments that were made about corporate investment and ask for your thinking on why this has been so low.  One of the things that my staff pointed out to me is that, if you look at a graph of net private nonresidential fixed assets versus nonfarm private employees, we\u2019re well above trend because of the Great Recession\u2014which makes sense, right.  Do you lay a lot of people off.  But you\u2019re starting to see that return to trendline.  So one story is that we will start to see that pick up as firms get back to trend in terms of capital stock relative to employees. Have you looked at that in terms of your forecast.  It\u2019s the one area that I worry about with respect to spending, because consumer spending is robust, it\u2019s strong, but we\u2019re not seeing business investment picking up.  But there may be a reason for that, in that we had a lot of capital, we\u2019re now reaching a trend ratio, and that should start to pick up.  Have you thought about that.  Has that been built into your forecast", " MR. WILCOX.  As Jeremy mentioned, Ekaterina Peneva summarized a variety of hypotheses.  Corporations have expressed some concern about weakness in their profits.  We\u2019ve  wondered about spillover from the drilling and mining collapse into other elements of investment.  A number of outside analysts have pointed to the possibility that uncertainty is unusually high, perhaps related to geopolitical concerns or domestic political concerns. These things have an air of plausibility to them.  They\u2019re very hard to test, empirically, how significant they are.  It\u2019s not more than a sense, but I think I\u2019d agree exactly with the summary that Jeremy gave, which is, our sense is that they probably account for some of the weakness in the past few quarters.  But it\u2019s an inherently volatile series.  We think it\u2019s been puzzlingly weak the last couple of quarters.  It\u2019s an element of concern for us", " MR. FISCHER.  Could you just clarify the numbers you used.  You used this estimate for natural long-run growth.  Assuming that we all live 70 years, which is no longer true, does that mean that income will double in each lifetime", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  My staff and I found connecting the dots for this meeting a bit of a challenge.  What we\u2019re hearing from District contacts is not very consistent with the perspective on the economy and outlook that takes a negative signal from the recent employment report. Overall, businesses reported little change in the economic environment in the most recent cycle compared with earlier in the year.  Our contacts describe an economy on a moderate growth path.  Most contacts are not seeing evidence of weakening, and most remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook.  For the most part, Main Street in my District related \u201csteady as she goes\u201d economic conditions. We continue to question our contacts about the weakness of business investment.  In this case, we got feedback largely in line with the data.  Much of the deployment of new capital is  replacement, not expansion.  At this juncture, we\u2019re not hearing much that would point to improvement in business fixed investment spending in the near term. The feedback from the economic trenches lines up well with the probable growth outcome for the first half.  We are assuming a second-quarter bounceback that\u2014taken with the first quarter, which we expect to be revised up to slightly above 1 percent\u2014produces first-half growth a little below 2 percent.  This conclusion is supported by our GDP tracking estimate for the second quarter.  As of this morning, with the retail sales and inventory numbers included in the computation, our nowcast stands at 2.8 percent for the second quarter. The forecast I submitted for this meeting projects growth on basically a 2 percent path over the forecast horizon.  I expect 2 percent growth to be sufficient to absorb the remaining slack in the labor market and push the inflation trend to target next year.  So 2 percent growth, accompanied by effective achievement of our dual-mandate objectives, is my baseline.  Around that outlook, I currently see somewhat more downside risks than upside.  An important risk question, of course, which many have discussed, is how to interpret the recent employment report and, more generally, how to size up the labor market picture. The labor market picture is more muddled than it\u2019s been for some time.  While I am not taking as much negative signal from the payroll survey as could be taken in isolation, I am not interpreting the household survey\u2014that is, the drop in the unemployment rate particularly\u2014as all positive news.  About one-third of the decline was due to an unusual flow of unemployed persons out of the labor force. The majority of our District interactions with contacts preceded the May jobs report.  However, in the week following the report, we asked a number of contacts, including our directors, how much signal to take from the soft jobs number.  On the whole, our contacts did not  hold perceptions of the labor market consistent with the jobs report.  On the contrary, we heard a number of anecdotal reports of growing tightness in labor markets.  Worker turnover has become a significant problem in some regions and industries.  Also, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta\u2019s contribution to the recent System labor market survey did not reveal a meaningful drop-off in the demand for workers.  Even with mixed information, I am not dismissing the possibility that the slowing trend in employment gains over the past three months signals an incipient growth slowdown. One other comment on downside risk:  Recently my attention has been drawn to the declining trend in corporate profits.  Corporate profits could tell us something about how to interpret both business investment and employment data.  My staff and I have to do more work on how much  weight to give to the profits decline as a causal factor in a possible slowdown.  And we\u2019ll be doing that work in coming weeks. So, in light of my perception of greater uncertainty associated with my forecast and the tilt of risks to the downside, I am comfortable with a wait-and-see stance at this meeting.  More on that tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari", "  You would expect if expectations really did react adaptively that you would probably see more of a reaction to, say, the\u2014 MR. FISCHER.  I would have expected to see more of a reaction, but they knew we were in strange times, and when you said, \u201cThink ahead five years and tell us what you think,\u201d you\u2019re going to get an answer.  We\u2019re beginning to think that these are not strange times, this is the new normal.  They, therefore, are beginning as a group to change their expectations.  Now, that may be right.  It may be a justification for using this, but heaven knows what the standard error is", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I do believe we are moving closer to achieving our dual-mandate objectives regarding unemployment and inflation, and I think I would be comfortable if paragraph 1 maybe reflected that to a greater, more balanced degree. Having said that, I\u2019m also sensitive to the fact that sluggish, longer-term U.S. growth prospects have combined with expanded worldwide demand for safe assets and a weak and uncertain economic and political outlook abroad to put downward pressure on the real federal funds rate.  The implication for me is that monetary policy is less accommodative at a given federal funds rate setting than might have been expected previously.  Global financial integration means that financial market conditions are sensitive to increases in the level of U.S. short-term rates relative to foreign rates.  And as long as the foreign economic outlook remains subdued, I am supportive of a shallower path for U.S. interest rates. What does all of this mean for today\u2019s decision.  I was not, specifically, as much concerned by the weak May employment report as such.  But I am worried about the fact that it was, to me, the third consecutive month of a slowing in job growth, although, I think, within the context of a strong jobs market.  Also, I note the falloff in the ISM nonmanufacturing survey, and I am struck by the fact that, although different than some of the anecdotes given around the room, the anecdotal reports I am getting from business contacts are more mixed.  Obviously, when you overlay on that the potential fallout from the Brexit vote, I certainly agree with being patient before removing accommodation.  And if current policy is only mildly accommodative, I think we can afford to exercise some patience. Beyond this meeting, I will be in a wait-and-see mode regarding upcoming economic data that would reaffirm my GDP forecast and give me confidence in continued improvement in  the jobs market as well as continued progress in reaching our 2 percent medium-term inflation target.  I\u2019m very open that we may, in fact, get that confirming data in the near future. More broadly, though, I would say my assessment of conditions reinforces my view that economic policy aside from monetary policy\u2014that is, structural reforms and fiscal policy\u2014is going to be necessary to address key secular trends we\u2019ve been talking about:  aging demographics; high levels of debt to GDP, which, at a minimum, make fiscal policy more difficult; the impact of globalization; and the growing effects of disruption, which are increasingly creating dislocations across industries.  Examples of actions outside monetary policy include appropriate immigration reform; infrastructure spending; investment in education, particularly with an emphasis on public-private partnerships for vocational training and retraining; and a thorough review and cost-benefit analysis of regulation at the state, local, and national levels.  All of these need to be considered. While paralysis has been prevalent over the past eight years, I believe we are now entering a phase in which policy options must be broadened beyond monetary policy.  And if I take President Bullard\u2019s approach, to break out of this regime, I think we\u2019re going to need actions beyond just monetary policy.  We\u2019re going to need to find ways to increase real GDP growth.   In the meantime, debt is growing faster than nominal GDP, and therefore we are becoming more leveraged in the United States, for sure, and across advanced economies.  This will ultimately have implications for the future.  Actions beyond monetary policy are going to be necessary to fuel improved GDP growth, and I think it\u2019ll be worth noting that increasingly in the future in our public comments.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The discussion today occurs under the long shadow cast by the May employment report.  As I pointed out yesterday, how one interprets the apparent slowdown in employment growth has strong implications for policy and for how our statement should read. I argued yesterday that the evidence favored the view that job growth is being restrained increasingly by binding labor market constraints rather than an undesired slowdown in demand in the face of continued labor market slack.  Accordingly, I think we should use the statement to communicate to the public that somewhat lower future employment growth is likely to be consistent with achieving our mandate for maximum sustainable employment and does not necessarily call for an easier policy rate path.  To the extent that lower employment growth reflects tighter resource constraints, then more rapid increases in the funds rate are going to be warranted. With this in mind, I have some suggestions.  When our policy statement refers to improvement in labor market conditions, as it does in paragraphs 1 and 3 of alternative B, it implies that there is still a meaningful employment gap monetary policy can and should counteract.  But that seems at odds with the SEP, as the median unemployment rate in the SEP is below the median longer-run normal level.  I think it would have been appropriate to back away from this type of language even without the low May employment growth number.  That number makes the issue more urgent, though, because it suggests that further improvement in labor market conditions may not be desirable or even attainable in the near term.  Alternative C contains some constructive changes along these lines.  Paragraph 2 drops the word \u201cstrengthen,\u201d and it states that employment growth \u201cwill expand at moderate rates,\u201d instead of \u201clabor market indicators will continue to strengthen.\u201d  And paragraph 3 of alternative C states that \u201cthe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further strengthening in labor market conditions,\u201d instead of \u201cfurther improvement in labor market conditions.\u201d  The word \u201cstrengthening\u201d is better than \u201cimprovement,\u201d in my mind, but I think both words imply the existence of a gap relative to some normative benchmark.  So, as an alternative to the second sentence in alt-B(3), I\u2019d propose that we say \u201cThe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting a return to 2 percent inflation in the context of stable labor market conditions.\u201d  Or we could say \u201cin the context of continued employment growth.\u201d  This formulation would convey that we no longer view ourselves as closing positive labor resource utilization gaps.  In light of the fact that, for the SEP, all but one participant wrote down longer-run unemployment rates greater than or equal to the current unemployment rate, I think this is a change that almost all of us should support\u2014if not at this meeting, then very soon. More broadly, I think there\u2019s a need to pay heed to our most recent intermeeting experience with communication.  My recollection of our April discussion was that our intention was for the April statement to signal that a June move was clearly on the table, and that it would be appropriate if the data flow was reasonably close to our expectations.  Yet markets came out of that meeting placing very little probability on us moving in June, at least until the release of the April minutes, and my fear is that alternative B as written is likely to have as little effect on market expectations as the April statement and will still leave, again, a sizable gap between market views and the Committee\u2019s expectations.  So I\u2019d favor communicating more forcefully  about our intention to raise rates, as in the language in paragraph 3 of alternative C, which says that \u201ca modest increase in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in coming months.\u201d Alternatively, President Harker\u2019s suggestion is attractive to me.  I recognize Governor Powell\u2019s observation about the decline in the unemployment rate being attributable to a decline in the labor force participation rate.  The other perspective on that confluence is that the upward move in labor force participation in recent months was anomalous itself and we\u2019re back on trend with respect to labor force participation.  This unemployment rate of 4.7 percent is more consistent with that broad movement. I again want to follow up on something President Williams said, this time about the staff\u2019s memo on the new policy rule.  I take it that the economy affects policy via the reaction function, and that policy rules and reaction functions affect the economy.  And outcomes are the joint product of the interaction of the two.  I can understand the staff realigning their assumption about the reaction function and aligning theirs with the Committee\u2019s more closely.  That makes perfect sense. But the staff didn\u2019t alter their forecast.  They made an offsetting change in their implied assessment of the effect of monetary policy on the economy.  I take as a supposition that they provide us with their own best independent assessment of the effects of alternative monetary policy strategies in the economy.  I know the Committee members are smart, but we\u2019re not that smart, and that\u2019s why we need an outstanding professional staff like the one we have.  So I hope that they feel as if they can provide us with their own best judgment rather than adopting our implied assessment of the effects of policy on the economy.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker, would you read again your proposed change in paragraph 3.  \u201cThe stance of monetary policy remains accommodative\u201d\u2014what", " MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with no changes. The mixed data we have in hand to date could plausibly be consistent with very different scenarios for the outlook\u2014one in which resource constraints are binding, one in which we\u2019re seeing the beginning of a downshift in activity, and one in which we continue to make very slow progress.  Each of these scenarios would call for a very different policy response.  I thus want to be sensitive to the consequences if the economy evolves in a way consistent with a different economic scenario than assumed, as well as the risks. In determining appropriate policy, we\u2019re going to need to assess not just what scenario best describes the incoming data, but also what risks are associated with that particular path.  While there are upside risks to inflation in the scenario featuring binding resource constraints, I believe we\u2019re relatively well positioned, relying solely on conventional policy, to deal with this eventuality.  In contrast, I continue to see downside risks to both inflation and activity that would pose greater challenges to sole reliance on conventional policy, due to the asymmetry prevailing near the effective lower bound in the other two scenarios.  Let me spend a moment on each of these. Suppose the outlook turns out to be best described as increasingly subject to binding resource constraints that imply that inflationary pressures in the period ahead are larger than we currently anticipate while labor market improvement slows notably.  Arguably, we have ample room to adjust to such a contingency using conventional tools that are well calibrated, on the basis of ample historical experience.  Especially in view of the depressed global environment, if markets came to expect a steeper policy rate path here than in other countries, this greater divergence in rates would be expected to have a strong effect on the dollar, which would reinforce our policy rate path.  Indeed, the evidence the staff has presented suggests that, over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become considerably greater in response to those kinds of anticipated changes.  As a result, I would expect the policy shift needed to address greater-than-expected inflationary pressures to be relatively moderate.  Even so, a possible danger is that the path of policy needed to respond would be so steep and the policy change so abrupt that it would tip the economy into recession.  But such a scenario would likely occur only if inflation expectations became unanchored or if the rise in inflation was quite rapid.  For a variety of reasons that people have spoken about around this table, that seems pretty unlikely. In contrast, if we think that additional data are likely to validate a downshift in activity or even continued slow progress, when the economy is hit by an adverse shock, such as financial turbulence in response to an unexpected Brexit vote outcome or a reemergence of financial stress associated with China\u2019s exchange rate or financial imbalances, in responding to such events we might need to rely on unconventional policies, which are less tested and themselves likely to be subject to constraints.  In addition, fiscal policy is likely to be constrained.  As a result, the risk the economy faces from negative demand shocks is greater than that faced from positive shocks in the presence of steeply sloped supply curves. My sense of the danger of downside risks is informed by the other side of the cautionary-tale spectrum that President Evans was referring to\u2014in particular, the experience of two other major advanced economies, Japan and the euro area.  Most observers would likely conclude in hindsight that monetary policy should have been more forceful earlier on in counteracting weak  demand.  For a variety of reasons, it didn\u2019t happen.  It could be that some policymakers thought that if the forces holding down demand and inflation were stronger and more persistent than expected, more accommodative policy could be pursued farther down the road.  But perhaps few anticipated how difficult it would be to move inflation back to target in such a contingency. Recently, policymakers in both economic areas have been both determined and creative in their efforts.  Yet many observers, including Board staff, expect inflation in the euro area to fall short of its target throughout the medium term, and that inflation in Japan will not even come close to its target.  Such persistent underperformance not only damages the credibility of inflation targets, but also leaves these economies very vulnerable to adverse demand shocks. On balance, prudent risk management would argue for waiting until the totality of the data provides greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity and there\u2019s greater certainty regarding the Brexit vote, especially because of the amplified feedback loop operating through exchange rate and financial market channels.   In addition, the appropriate path to return monetary policy to a neutral stance looks like it could be even more shallow and gradual in the medium term than we may previously have anticipated, because it increasingly appears likely that the medium-term neutral rate may be quite low.  Earlier in the recovery, it seemed likely that the low level of the neutral rate was largely due to temporary factors that we described as cyclical headwinds, such as tight credit, weak consumer confidence, and the loss in household wealth following the crisis.  However, with the recovery well into its seventh full year, credit in many markets is widely available, and consumer confidence and household net worth are at high levels.  As a result, it appears more likely that much of the decline in the neutral rate is likely to prove quite persistent, consistent with a variety of estimates.  With productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and disinflationary  pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the medium-term neutral rate may be lower and today\u2019s federal funds rate closer to neutral than we previously anticipated.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman", "   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  No.  At some point, you would presumably get to full employment\u2014or somewhat below full employment if you actually wanted to push inflation expectations up.  At that point, you wouldn\u2019t want to see further improvement in labor market conditions.  I think people accept that.  I guess I think that after a very weak employment report, people would scratch their heads and say, \u201cWell, wait a second.  So you\u2019re really saying that you were at full employment a meeting ago.\u201d  I think they would have trouble interpreting it"], "2016FOMC20160727meeting.txt": [" VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a question, and I don\u2019t know that the staff has the answer to it or that I have an answer to it.  The framework objectives basically imply that this is about monetary policy implementation, it\u2019s about financial stability, and it implies that financial stability is important in terms of thinking about what the right framework is.  But then, when we come down to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, a framework should involve holding \u201cno more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.\u201d  So one seems narrower than the other, and I just was wondering how the staff was thinking about that.  Let\u2019s imagine that we have a monetary policy framework that has huge benefits for financial stability but might require somewhat more securities.  Do we think that the policy normalization principles are cast in stone, or could they be potentially modified.  I just would like the staff\u2019s view on this", "  [Laughter] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Let me ask it this way:  Is there a tension between these two things.  They do seem a little bit in opposition to one another.  And I think it would be  interesting, as we discuss this, to decide:  Do we really believe the framework should be broad and include financial-stability objectives, or should it be narrow and just focused on monetary policy implementation", " MR. TARULLO.  Madam Chair.  My recollection, Vice Chairman Dudley, is that when we were talking about that stated principle of normalization, there was a little bit of back-and-forth within the Committee, basically saying that\u2019s an issue that does have some tension in it because you could interpret effective monetary policy as meaning:  You don\u2019t want a monetary policy that creates financial instability, because that would require reactions later.  But my recollection is, we self-consciously tabled the tensions inherent in that issue, and so my sense was that it\u2019s precisely one of the things that this exercise is going to have to address", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have two questions.  One is for Dave Altig.  This has to do with the narrative about the lessons of the crisis.  The paper, I think early, mentions sales of U.S. government securities and the extent to which we resorted to that to sterilize and offset the effect of lending programs on aggregate reserves, in order to avoid driving interest rates down.  Then, later on, the paper seems to drop that option and says we didn\u2019t have any way to do that.  And my sense from the narrative is that we didn\u2019t sell all the securities we could have, and it wasn\u2019t clear why not.  Now, I know some were pledged or lent out in the TSLF, right.  But my sense is, not all of them, but I guess I could look that up.  Did we sell or encumber all of the U.S. Treasury securities we could have.  If we didn\u2019t, why did we stop short of selling U.S. government securities at the time we did", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Right.  Selling bills and short-dated coupon securities is probably not going to have much effect on the Treasury securities market or the Treasury yield curve, but if we had sold a lot of longer-dated Treasur securities, I think there\u2019s a question of what that would do to the market.  It\u2019s a judgment call", " MR. LACKER.  And then in your second sample, we\u2019re not moving interest rates around much at all.  We do it once at the end.  You\u2019re not going to get the federal funds rate target or  some policy rate as being the common factor.  So, you\u2019d expect the fraction of variance explained by the common factor to go down, right, and that would not to really reflect any difference in meaningful linkages or the extent to which market rates would move if we raised rates as much as we did on slide 28.  Is that intuition correct, Beth", " MR. FISCHER.  Well, the question I\u2019m raising is what are we allowed to do. CHAIR YELLEN.  Do you mean what facilities do we have", " MR. BULLARD.  I have a follow-up for President Lacker.  Could you elaborate on what you mean.  Because I took the point of the memos to be that these are not really separable things, and therefore we have to design a system that appropriately balances the ability to provide monetary control and the ability to provide liquidity in a crisis.  And you just said, you could separate these two things.  So, what do you mean", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thank you to the team around the System that worked on this project.  Let me just make a couple of comments that struck me after reading through the papers, understanding these are early days. Regulatory reform, I think, has certainly reduced the probability of financial crises and limited their potential severity.  However, it also probably has reduced incentives for arbitrage in money markets and may introduce some frictions that make money markets work less smoothly, therefore possibly increasing the need for liquidity actions by the Federal Reserve.  A combination of on-the-shelf liquidity facilities and the ON RRP may be needed to ensure future money market functionality and interest rate control in a potential future crisis.  So far, the ON RRP facility has helped limit shortfalls and volatility in money markets, and the risk that it might have exacerbated flights to quality really has not materialized.  For example, we didn\u2019t see it in January and February of this year, and we haven\u2019t seen it following the Brexit vote.   Nevertheless, because crises can hit at unexpected times and in unexpected ways\u2014and, by definition, are surprises that you don\u2019t expect\u2014I do feel strongly that we should do more work on having on-the-shelf liquidity facilities that could help limit the severity of market stress episodes and help address one potential downside of an ON RRP facility.  In my view, in that crisis it may well be necessary to assist, in particular, the money market industry, dealers, and nonbank financials. On slide 13 of the briefing materials, the points 2 and 3 that you made are, to me, a couple of the reasons why I would like to have on-the-shelf facilities.  Number one, I think if there\u2019s clarity about the purpose of such operations, it does reduce stigma.  And, in particular, it\u2019s important to emphasize that this is about the provision of liquidity versus emergency lending to individual firms.  I believe that if our communications are well prepared and explain what those facilities are designed for, we won\u2019t eliminate stigma but should help reduce it.  Also, your point about clarity on when liquidity insurance operations would be used\u2014to limit contagion during stress events\u2014is a very key one and is another reason to have on-the-shelf facilities. I would add two other reasons for having on-the-shelf facilities.  One, it allows you to move quickly, and, two, when you are in a crisis is not the time to be thinking through and making up provisions and mechanisms to deal with the situation.  That is, I\u2019d rather we did this in advance in the cold light of day rather than on the run.  And I think we have the opportunity to do that, so I would encourage you to do more work on this.  I understand the risk that it may appear to create or induce an overreliance on the Fed, and there are some political sensitivities associated with that.  But this work is very, very important, and I think history has shown that we ought to have these facilities in place with our communication well established in advance.  So I encourage you to do more work on this.  Thank you.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  President Evans", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a question on \u201cThe International Outlook\u201d\u2014exhibit 2, box 9, \u201cReal Dollar Indexes.\u201d  You\u2019ve got the dollar appreciating over the forecast horizon.  One question you might ask is:  Wouldn\u2019t markets already have integrated all of the information that\u2019s available, and, therefore, it wouldn\u2019t really be very predictable where the trade-weighted value of the dollar was going to go", " WILLIAMS.  I have a question, diving deep into the Tealbook forecast, and that\u2019s specifically about housing.  You highlight in the Tealbook that the incoming data on residential construction suggest lower growth over the near term, but I\u2019m a little bit puzzled by that.  And, I\u2019m thinking ahead to the wording in the draft statement that residential investment is \u201csoft.\u201d  Real residential investment increased at a rate of more than 15 percent in the first quarter.  Outside commentators would describe housing\u2014and this is how my own staff described it when we discussed it\u2014as a sector in which housing starts, permits, and existing home sales have been  strong and have been in fact above expectations, and that any slowing that we\u2019ve seen in the data may be just some weather effects, which have affected the timing of activity between Q1 and Q2.  So I guess I\u2019m asking for your help in thinking this through:  If you have a really strong Q1, partly boosted by weather, and then a little bit of a takeaway in Q2, how do you view that.  And why would that make your forecast more negative about Q3 and Q4", " WILLIAMS.  I agree with the latter point.  I guess I\u2019m going back to this characterization of residential construction as being soft when it\u2019s been growing, whether there is statistical noise or not.  If it\u2019s been growing very rapidly and it just doesn\u2019t keep growing or it declines a little bit, that just seems a funny way to characterize residential construction", " MR. FOLLETTE.  So the appropriations that they approved last December are for a fiscal year, but those typically get spent out over a period of four or five years\u2014about 60 percent in the first year and the rest after that.  But it\u2019s not always 60 percent\u201455, 65, whatever\u2014so there\u2019s some noise in the series", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The QS report highlights the fact that CRE overvaluation remains a concern.  It concludes that the effects of a sizable decline in CRE  prices on financial stability are likely to be small.  I remain concerned that the financial-stability risks associated with CRE are elevated. Out of the $3.6 trillion total commercial mortgages and multifamily residential mortgages, $1.8 trillion are held by the banking system.  Among asset classes held by leveraged institutions, it is large, although not concentrated in particularly large institutions.  It is also true that a significant decline in the CRE market is unlikely to occur in isolation.  However, if the economy does weaken, I expect that a large decline in CRE collateral value risks significantly reducing access to credit to all but the most creditworthy borrowers.  Such conditions conform well to the classic determinants of financial-stability problems\u2014collateral values fall, and payment streams are interrupted.  Commercial and residential price declines account for most of the significant international financial problems in the postwar period in advanced countries.  Once prices fall, it is obviously too late to act preemptively.  Thus, now is a great time to test the effectiveness of our preventive actions\u2014a time when persistently low interest rates are encouraging \u201creach-for-yield\u201d behavior that may eventually be disruptive. One simple anecdote illustrates my concern.  In the third quarter of 2014, my staff produced a table of banks with the highest ratios of total CRE to risk-based capital.  Among those 50 institutions, 11 have already failed.  My concern is particularly heightened because these banks have been unable to survive despite an improving economy, low interest rates, and generally rising commercial real estate prices.  These 11 banks with high CRE concentration levels represent the preponderance of the total 15 bank failures that have occurred recently.  While failing in the current environment is likely illustrative of problems well beyond just commercial real estate exposure, there would seem to be an exposure level that is sufficiently  high that it reflects poorly on management decisions and results in an unsafe and unsound practice that should be limited.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", " MR. LAUBACH.  But, that said, one interpretation is that there\u2019s no news.  That is certainly what we intended with the striking of the reference to net exports, because there was really nothing new to report. Now, I have to confess that I don\u2019t know exactly when the reference to residential investment was added to the statement.  I would have to look that up.  It\u2019s certainly been in there for a number of rounds, but it hasn\u2019t always been there.  I would think that it will be noticed as a downgrade, because if you no longer say that it\u2019s improving, it seems to imply it\u2019s doing less, and that would be consistent with the recent data flow.  So my guess would be that it would be interpreted as a soft downgrading", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I do not think the normalization process is going well.  We ended QE in the fall of 2014.  We said we would begin normalizing rates in 2015.  We made only one move that year, at the last meeting of the year.  We have made no further moves during 2016.  This is against a backdrop of an economy that has not behaved very differently from forecasts of a few years ago, especially on inflation and unemployment.  Unemployment has tended to surprise to the downside for us, and inflation has actually been very consistent with the forecast that it would remain below 2 percent.  This is in contrast to our narrative for normalization embodied in the Tealbook and in the Summary of Economic Projections.  As I discussed yesterday, the Tealbook narrative suggests that we are on the precipice of a 200-plus basis point increase in the policy rate over the forecast horizon.  This is a little less than once per quarter.  This comes from using the updated Taylor (1999) rule, which also informs many others and has historically informed many judgments among the Committee about the pace of rate increases.  According to the Tealbook, these increases are going to take place against a backdrop of relatively weak economic growth in the near term, an unemployment rate that is just three-tenths lower at the end of 2017 than it is today, and an inflation rate that remains below target.  I do not think that this is a realistic narrative.  I think it forces us to draw on increasingly tenuous excuses as to why we are not following through on our announced plans.  This is hurting our credibility.  Markets discounted this narrative long ago, and our actions this year are ratifying their expectations. The St. Louis Fed\u2019s new narrative improves on this situation.  It suggests a relatively flat policy rate path with some upside risk, depending on how the data evolve.  It does not leave a 200-plus basis point policy move lingering over the market.  It suggests that r\u2020 is minus 140 basis points, which is the ex post real return on one-year Treasury securities over the past three years.  Real returns on short-term government debt are unlikely to switch to higher values any time soon, nor is mean reversion a good prediction.  The best guess is that this situation will simply persist, at least over a period of two to two-and-a-half years.  The St. Louis Federal Reserve narrative realistically suggests that the current slow-growth environment is likely to continue.  It suggests that the labor market is essentially at full employment and perhaps will not improve further, in a situation of relatively slow growth.  It also suggests that inflation does not look set to increase very far above our 2 percent target.  The conclusion is that a relatively low policy rate is consistent with achieving our inflation target and full employment over the next two and a half years.  Adoption of the St. Louis approach would, in my view, improve the alignment of market expectations with the likely future path of policy.  For today, I support alternative B.  The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis approach does call for one more rate increase, and I would be happy to make this move at the September meeting, provided the data cooperate.  I do prefer to move on good news about the economy.  I would also support President Williams\u2019s suggestion on residential investment.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker", " MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  in light of my fairly upbeat outlook for the economy and the slow but persistent march of inflation to target, the language in alternative B seems a bit too equivocal even after the most recent changes. The two matters we talked about yesterday, the two most pressing concerns at our June meeting, have dissolved.  In June, 287,000 net new jobs were added, and financial markets were generally unfazed by the Brexit vote after the initial shock wore off.  I welcome the recent change to paragraph 2 stating that the \u201cnear-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.\u201d  That said, the message in alternative B is only modestly changed from June, and I fear that the reaction will be similar, taking the next meeting off the table.  It could also very well indicate that our policy is insufficiently sensitive to events on the upside.  That insensitivity may, in turn, serve to confuse markets on exactly what types of data will be sufficient for normalization to proceed.  If we are delaying normalization because we need much greater evidence that inflation is indeed trending upward, then perhaps we should make that point more explicitly.  Or if uncertainty over the level of the natural real rate leads to the belief that policy is  not overly accommodative, that point should be articulated.  But whatever is driving the unresponsiveness of policy needs to be stated clearly.  Communicating a very similar message either in the statement or in public comments under what I perceive to be clearly improved economic circumstances does not seem to represent a strategy that will allow a September rate increase to be a realistic option. So what can we do.  While I can live with alternative B as is today, one possible improvement is to add language, like that in alternative C, stating that the near-term risks to the economy are nearly balanced or have become more balanced, instead of saying that they have diminished.  This more positive tone in the language would send a clearer signal that September is a possibility without overpromising that a move would indeed occur.  And on residential investment, I also support President Williams\u2019s view.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B with both proposed amendments by President Williams.  That includes the one on job gains in June versus May for the reasons he articulated.  So I support both of those edits. I do think the case for removing some amount of accommodation has strengthened since June.  First, on the pro side, I believe we are making progress in achieving our dual-mandate objectives.  In particular, the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean as well as other, similar measures of core inflation are gradually moving in a direction that suggests we will reach our inflation target in the medium term.  I think labor market slack is declining and we are moving toward full employment, and I hope that upcoming data will give us an opportunity to confirm this.  Second, I believe excesses are building, although not to the point at which I\u2019m alarmed.  As has been discussed, I am concerned about commercial real estate.  I\u2019m also\u2014I must say, maybe colored by my background\u2014concerned about what I see in stock market valuation.  By my measure\u2014and I\u2019m using a per-share number of $115\u2014 market P/E is getting close to 19 times earnings in a period when corporate earnings are actually declining.  I\u2019m concerned about where the markets are going to go from here.  My experience is, when stock market valuations become excessive, there may be imbalances building up outside the banking system, particularly in the nonbank financial markets, some of which we, at the Federal Reserve, are not able to see.  I\u2019m slightly concerned about the buildup in nonbank financial debt\u2014that is, on the corporate side\u2014although I think that\u2019s still manageable.  And I do worry about distortions in asset allocation\u2014disincentives for savers as the population ages and people tend to live off their incomes\u2014and I\u2019m worried overall about a rise in risk-taking, particularly as we move from here. In terms of the cons, I do believe the market is certainly unprepared today for us to raise rates, as we know, and they seem to be not quite prepared for September, either.  I do think the uncertainties of Brexit as well as China\u2014which, to me, is a significant risk\u2014are unlikely to be resolved any time soon.  Between now and September, though, we\u2019ll get a little bit better clarity on the Italian bank situation, which I do think is worth watching.  And, obviously, we\u2019ll get two additional job reports, which will help in confirming the trend on the labor markets.  We\u2019ll also get a chance to more clearly see if the recent strength in new home sales translates into a pickup in permits for single-family homes. I\u2019m also persuaded by our work and the comments made here regarding the neutral rate that it is lower than widely recognized.  I agree with President Harker that we have not clearly communicated this.  I do think that we are not as accommodative as is widely believed, and, on  the margin, that reduces the urgency for us to move or, to say it another way, allows us to be patient. But in light of all of this, as I said, I favor alternative B as amended, although I am forward leaning in us gradually and patiently moving toward removal of accommodation.  As we approach our September meeting, I would hope that if incoming data warrant, FOMC communication, potentially from the Chair at Jackson Hole or some other venues, will, as has been suggested, begin to signal to the market that we believe removal of some accommodation is warranted in the near future.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Among the people who spoke, yes. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  So I suggest we delete it.  The sentence would read \u201cHousehold spending has been growing strongly, but business fixed investment has been soft.\u201d The second suggestion of President Williams concerned the sentence \u201cJob gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.\u201d  I did hear a little bit of support for President Williams\u2019s proposal to delete that as well as some counterarguments.  I\u2019ll say that, for my own part, normally I don\u2019t like to focus on a lot of up-and-down in the data and prefer instead to focus  on longer-term trends, which are highlighted in the sentence that follows that.  But I agree with the Vice Chairman that, on this particular occasion, we strongly emphasized our concern about the May reading.  And to say that weak reading was completely reversed, essentially, in June is giving a clear sense that we\u2019re now discounting that and taking a stronger view.  On this occasion, I think it\u2019s important, but if I hear a groundswell of sentiment for getting rid of it, I\u2019m open to it.  President Kaplan", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think President Kaplan brings up a good point about revisions.  This could be changed in the future.  And I also think it\u2019s unnecessary.  The next sentence says \u201cOn balance, payrolls . . . ,\u201d and everyone will know exactly what we\u2019re talking about without having to have the \u201cupsey downsey\u201d sentence in there.  So I don\u2019t think it  helps us, I don\u2019t think it does anything for us, and the \u201cOn balance\u201d sentence takes care of it.  So I would agree with President Williams on this. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester"], "2016FOMC20160921meeting.txt": [" MR. WILCOX.  I think it\u2019s a really important question to be investigated.  As I said in the course of the briefing itself, I don\u2019t regard this work as having laid to rest the question.  I\u2019m a little skeptical that differential exposure to cyclical industries\u2014in particular, manufacturing and construction\u2014can account for the high-beta experience of blacks and Hispanics.  My view on that is informed importantly by the results, perhaps most especially those in the lower-right panel in exhibit 16, which show that even for African Americans with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more, this multiplier of 1.8 pertains relative to whites. I haven\u2019t looked at the industry exposure of African Americans and whites with a bachelor\u2019s degree or more, but I\u2019m a little skeptical that the exposure of African Americans with a bachelor\u2019s or more to construction and to manufacturing could be significant enough to account for that.  Industry exposure itself may account for some of this behavior.  I am skeptical that it provides a complete explanation. There are marked differences in the age structure of these racial and ethnic groups.  For example, relatively speaking, the Hispanic population has far fewer elderly than the white population.  So another avenue for investigation is something akin to what I\u2019ve done that would investigate the potential role of differential age structure and account for this sort of situation.  But I think there\u2019s a lot of work to be done not only here inside the Federal Reserve, but by outside researchers as well. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams", " MR. POTTER.  You\u2019re not that young", " WILLIAMS.  Okay.  So the unemployment rate has not gone down to 3\u00bc percent in my lifetime.  I\u2019ll stick with that.  [Laughter]  The question I have is\u2014I think this simulation was done in the FRB/US model\u2014if you thought through that scenario of a really strong economy, in which monetary policy, for whatever reason, is not taming output growth, do you really think the unemployment rate would go down to close to 3 percent.  Or do you think that something else would give in the model. Are we pushing this model outside of the historical norms far enough that maybe labor force participation would pick up, maybe wages would pick up, or something. How do you think about scenarios of an essentially linear model when you\u2019re taking it well outside a historical norm that was estimated", " WILLIAMS.  He\u2019s going to deny my referencing his work", " MR", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. One comment on a point that President Williams raised. A rate of 3.2 percent today would be very different than a rate of 3.2 percent in the late \u201960s because the demographics of the population are quite different.  So while I basically take your point, I think you\u2019d have to adjust for the changes in the demographic structure of the economy. I want to come back to the issue of the black and Hispanic unemployment.  I think there\u2019s no question that discrimination is a factor because we have a lot of evidence on things like long-term unemployment that hurts people in terms of their ability to be hired.  So while we don\u2019t know the proportion, I think discrimination definitely plays a role", " MR. BULLARD. Yes", " MR. KAMIN.  I would just say, because the entire outlook for the U.S. and global economy is conditioned on that assumption, I wanted to make clear that it\u2019s a staff assumption about the future path of the federal funds rate, which is indeed based on Taylor (1999). It\u2019s the comparison of that and one measure of what the market expects, which is the OIS rate path.  And it\u2019s that gap that represents the surprise because the markets, as represented by the OIS rates, expect a much shallower uplift in the federal funds rate than is embedded in the staff forecast", "  MR. LAUBACH.  In a tough spot.  The one thing that I would simply note is that, as time progresses, the median expectations from the primary dealer survey, for example, are for a substantially flatter increase than what the Taylor rule applied to our economic forecast implies. So, by the end of 2019, I think you are looking at a gap on the order of about 1\u00bc percentage points", " WILLIAMS.  Yes.  I want to clarify something, again, for people who may not be following exactly what David said earlier.  You said something about how you may have assumed that it\u2019s impossible to get a soft landing when you have the unemployment rate way below its natural rate.  You didn\u2019t actually say what the fact was, and the fact is, it\u2019s never happened.  So I just wanted everyone to be clear.  That\u2019s the thing that you were talking about that you weren\u2019t convinced by, but I think that does get to President George\u2019s question.  We have not seen an example in the postwar history in which the unemployment rate went up more than \u00bd percentage point that wasn\u2019t associated with a recession.  Now, the reasons for that, which you brought up in the debate about why that is the case, is definitely a live subject. But it is a striking\u2014not even a \u201cstylized\u201d fact but a fact that this hasn\u2019t occurred in the past.  So it is an area in which I worry that, when you have an unemployment rate that low, it is very hard, and historically hard\u2014you have to go way back in history, I think\u2014to find an example of that being successful. I don\u2019t know if that was a legal two-hander [laughter]", " MR. EVANS. This is an important issue.  I\u2019m going to guess that in models you\u2019ve written down, President Williams\u2014I don\u2019t tabulate these things myself\u2014if you simulate them, you probably have a lot of examples in which the unemployment rate has gone up in those simulations without it being what somebody might call a recession.  Andin view of the small number of recessions that we\u2019ve had and some lack of luck during some of these\u2014as we were talking about in Chicago just last week, one of my colleagues pointed out that, well, 1990 and \u201991 could have been a soft landing, but then Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait came about.  And, you   know, things happen during fragile times.  So there\u2019s a small number of observations.  There are some shocks that do that.  If it was as much of a slam dunk as your comment kind of suggests offhand, then your models ought to be reflecting this, and I just don\u2019t think they are.  So it\u2019s worth a lot of discussion because, frankly, I think it is a big deal.  If, in fact, undershooting the natural rate of unemployment is something that is going to lead to a recession, and if we think that the Phillips curve mechanism is going to be important to get inflation up to our target, well, then, we\u2019re probably never going to get it up to target, because we\u2019re going to say, \u201cIf I do this, I\u2019ll have a recession, and that would be worse.\u201d  And then that\u2019s going to ratify that 2 percent as a ceiling.  So I think this is a really important issue for more discussion. CHAIR YELLEN.  I absolutely agree with you", " MR. WILCOX. I agree, President Evans\u2014and President Williams, too. I think that one needs to acknowledge that this is an area in which it is going to be difficult to make solid progress in research. I certainly feel that I can\u2019t speak with great conviction that our nice, tidy linear models describe well the dynamics that take over in a more fragile economy when demand is growing more slowly.  One is struck, for example, by the profile of unemployment over the business cycle.  You see steep increases in the unemployment rate, and you don\u2019t see equivalently steep declines in the unemployment rate.  And in a simple, tidy linear model like the FRB/US model, there probably shouldn\u2019t be that discrepancy in behavior. Now, that said, my impression is that there have been two attempts at a soft landing in the post\u2013World War II era.  And, as President Evans just mentioned, I think there is an easily identifiable event with regard to one of them\u2014namely, the 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq\u2014 that provided a plausible shock of sharp magnitude that disrupted economic processes. I just don\u2019t think you can look to the historical record and get a dispositive answer on that question. And I don\u2019t have a huge amount of confidence in the ability of our models to discriminate, because the kind of model you go to in looking for that answer\u2014that will pretty much give you the answer. If you go to a linear model like the FRB/US model and you rely on that model as the source for your answer, you will decide that it\u2019s feasible that there\u2019s no particular problem here. If you go to a model that incorporates nonlinear dynamics, that will be the answer that you get. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren", " MR. ROSENGREN.  But doesn\u2019t that constrain their ability to actually go more negative.  Presumably, if you\u2019re fixing the 10-year rate at zero, people can go in and out of the 10-year at zero risk as long as that peg is on.  So, as they lower the short end of the market, you\u2019d assume there\u2019d be no trading at the short end.  People would just be buying at the 10-year maturity. Am I missing something", " MR. POTTER.  They haven\u2019t shown that they can actually do it yet.  So that would be part of it", " MR. POTTER.  If it is credible\u2014you\u2019d be taking the capital gains off it. CHAIR YELLEN. Are there any further questions.  [No response]  Okay. If I might, I\u2019d like to start off our policy go-round, and I want to emphasize that today\u2019s decision is not an easy one.  On the basis of the data in hand, one person may reasonably conclude that the economic outlook and associated risks argue for an increase in the target range today, while another looking at the same information reasonably decides that holding off is the better strategy.  In contrast to many of our previous meetings, the appropriate policy decision today is not clear cut.  This ambiguity is reflected in alternatives B and C, which present essentially the same characterization of the incoming data and the economic outlook yet arrive at different conclusions about what action we should take. We may not all agree on today\u2019s decision, but I think, in line with the SEP, that most of us will be inclined to support an increase in the federal funds rate before year-end if the economy  continues along its current trajectory, with economic growth picking up as expected, continued solid employment gains, an absence of notable downside inflation surprises, and the emergence of no significant new risks.  If this assessment is correct, we should be careful not to exaggerate the consequences of raising the federal funds rate now as opposed to in an upcoming meeting. My recommendation for today is not to move and to adopt alternative B, teeing up a likely move in December if things move along their current course.  But why not move now,as the economic consequences of tightening today instead of waiting until December are probably minimal. At our July meeting, after all, I said that raising the target range in September would likely be appropriate if we saw reasonably strong payroll gains in July and August, which we have, and the overall outlook remained favorable, which it has.  And, at the Jackson Hole symposium, I said that the case for tightening had strengthened. Still, despite the generally satisfactory state of current conditions, I recommend that we hold off raising the funds rate for the moment for two reasons.  First, incoming data suggest to me that we have a bit more running room than I\u2019d anticipated, and I see little danger that monetary policy is falling \u201cbehind the curve.\u201d As I said yesterday, some slack still remains in the labor market. Utilization appears to be increasing at a relatively slow pace.  There are few signs of emerging inflationary pressures, and inflation continues to run below our objective.  Under these conditions, we can afford to proceed patiently, and doing so will promote additional labor market improvements and so speed the return to 2 percent inflation.  I think we\u2019ll have ample time to adjust policy in the event the economy shows signs of becoming overheated.  After all, as long as we remain in a low-r* environment, it won\u2019t take very many rate increases to get back to a neutral policy stance.  Furthermore, a moderately tight labor market might also pull more people back into the labor force than we anticipate, and that\u2019s a potential supply-side benefit that we shouldn\u2019t close off prematurely.  Indeed, as I noted yesterday, we have seen solid employment growth over the past year without significant declines in either U-3 or U-6.  Over the past year, the labor market seems to have had more room to improve without creating inflation pressures than I\u2019d expected.  This is an important reason why I\u2019m inclined, in the words of alternative B, \u201cfor the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward [our] objectives.\u201d Second, I consider waiting until we\u2019ve seen somewhat more progress on our objectives advisable on risk-management grounds.  If economic growth in the second half of the year was to turn out to be stronger than I anticipate or if we were to begin seeing signs of accelerating wages and prices, we would have ample opportunity to respond appropriately over the course of 2017 and beyond.  But if economic conditions were instead to turn out to be weaker than expected or if downside risks to the outlook were to emerge, then we would probably regret having decided to move today.  After all, the surprising events that we\u2019ve encountered so far this year\u2014turmoil in global financial markets, wild month-to-month swings in the data, and Brexit\u2014 demonstrate that bumps in the road are common and the concerns related to the effective lower bound are not to be dismissed.  And this is especially true in an environment in which we find ourselves repeatedly lowering our estimates of r*. While I strongly believe that economic performance has been well served by our caution in raising interest rates thus far this year, we clearly can\u2019t delay too long because policy does need to be forward looking.  If labor market conditions improve somewhat further in coming months, as I expect, then a December rate hike will, in all likelihood, be warranted to reduce the risk of the unemployment rate markedly undershooting its longer-run level in 2017 and beyond.I think an increase will be appropriate even if inflation readings remain near their current levels, as I expect. The language in alternative B is meant to convey this expectation for policy.  I recognize that the phrase \u201cfor the time being\u201d is essentially a calendar-based reference, but I think, in the current circumstances, we need to be clear in our intentions.  Softening this language by just saying that policy will be data dependent would, in my view, only increase confusion about our reaction function and intentions. So let me stop there, and our next speaker is President Williams", " MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will support alternative B.  This year, financial turmoil, weaker incoming data, and a reassessment of the neutral rate of interest have pointed financial markets and the Committee toward a more gradual path of rate increases.  That path can and will be adjusted, either up or down, as events evolve.  I believe that the Committee\u2019s patience through this period has paid dividends and will continue to do so.  Nonetheless, the labor market has continued to tighten, and the forecast is for output to strengthen and inflation to continue on its path of gradual increases.  If that forecast is broadly realized, then I believe that it will be appropriate to raise the federal funds rate soon. I\u2019ve written down one rate increase for this year and two for next year. It is possible, as several here have pointed out, to wait too long to move.  This would put the Committee \u201cbehind the curve\u201d and require more aggressive action, possibly risking a  recession.  That risk increases as the unemployment rate continues to move down and labor markets show increased signs of tightening. For me, the time for the overshooting argument is coming but is probably not yet here for a couple of reasons.  The apparent upside surprise in labor force participation suggests that we have more room to grow.  In fact, looking back this morning, labor force participation has now really been flat, in the high 62s, since late 2013, which represents a pretty significant three-year gain against our estimate of the underlying downward trend.  It does suggest that we may actually be using up a margin of slack, but it also suggests, yes, grounds for humility that, in fact, there may be more room to go. The economy is growing just barely above trend.  Inflation is below our 2 percent objective and has been every single month since the second quarter of 2012.  We\u2019re making progress toward 2 percent inflation, and my baseline case that we can continue to do that.  But let\u2019s face it\u2014it\u2019s happening at a snail\u2019s pace. So, for me, the balance of risks continues to call for patience and a gradual path of rate increases, assuming the forecast is realized.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari", " MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I am comfortable with alternative B, but I lean toward alternative A.  I prefer alternative A because I would like to see evidence of rising inflationary pressure before tightening.  In particular, I\u2019m looking for either a sustained upward move in core PCE inflation or evidence of rising inflation expectations or a substantial decline in the headline unemployment rate.  The discussion we had yesterday about workers coming off the sidelines\u2014it\u2019s not moving the headline unemployment rate.  The truth is that we don\u2019t know how much slack is left.  It seems to me that there is still some more slack. I\u2019d like to find out how much more there is.  Actually, I found President Evans\u2019s comments very consistent with my own views. When I saw the Tealbook and its staff forecast of core PCE inflation of 1.6 percent for the rest of this year and for all of next year, I asked myself, \u201cIf that\u2019s right, what would it take to get me to want to move.\u201d I\u2019d want to see inflation expectations climb, or I\u2019d want to see the headline unemployment rate fall meaningfully, such that I had confidence that slack had actually been taken up.  Absent that, I\u2019m starting to get persuaded by my neighbors here, President Bullard and President Evans, that I don\u2019t see a strong case for raising rates.  Alternative A lays down a marker that we want to see meaningful progress toward our inflation target, and I think that that would be helpful. Alternative B isn\u2019t terrible, but I\u2019m a little nervous about the language, because I do think it signals to the market that a rate hike is coming. It may not come, and I think we all agree that every time we put out a marker that it\u2019s about to come and then we don\u2019t deliver, there\u2019s a cost to us in terms of our credibility.  So I\u2019m nervous about alternative B being too strong in signaling a December rate increase. Now, some say that we need to get going to raise rates so that we don\u2019t fall \u201cbehind the curve.\u201d I think each of us reads these optimal control simulations and takes what we want out of them, because I look at them and, even in the most accommodative scenarios, the overshoot is 2.2 percent inflation.  So if these things are valuable at all, I don\u2019t see where the concern is.  If the worst-case scenario is 2.2 percent inflation, that\u2019s less of an overshoot than we\u2019re undershooting right now. Then there\u2019s been discussion that, well, it\u2019s better that we gradually raise rates because a shallow path and then steep at the end is somehow more recessionary.  My staff found a Board   memo of 2014, a background memo on potential implications of alternative approaches to the timing and pace of tightening.  This memo by Board staff suggests that it\u2019s entirely unclear that a late and steep path of tightening is somehow more recessionary than a gradual path.  So I don\u2019t find those arguments persuasive.  I\u2019m not saying one is right and one is wrong, but it doesn\u2019t appear to be clear that one is better than the other. In view of where economic growth is\u2014it\u2019s pretty slow\u2014and that inflation is definitely below target, I think we should be patient and allow the data to come to us before we are anticipating inflation that may not come. The last thing I\u2019ll say is, I know this makes me sound like I\u2019m an uber-dove or a perma-dove.  I\u2019m not. When the data reveal themselves\u2014when inflation actually materializes or expectations change\u2014I will be advocating raising rates. I just don\u2019t see it yet.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I favor alternative B-plus or A-minus.  I\u2019m not exactly sure which.  And the reason is, I have some measure of uncomfortableness with a couple of the elements of alternative B as written. First, the characterization of the risks as being roughly balanced doesn\u2019t accord with my own understanding.  I think that shorter-term risks still are modestly to moderately on the downside.  While I don\u2019t take too much signal on the basis of the retail sales numbers because, basically, that\u2019s stuff from stores, a decreasingly important part of total consumption, the bouncing-around of housing permits and starts gives at least a little pause.  And, like Vice Chairman Dudley, I do put a little bit more weight on, or at least have a little bit more concern with, the nonmanufacturing purchasing managers\u2019 survey, particularly because it\u2019s a forward-looking indicator in the much larger part of the economy that\u2019s relatively insulated from the effect of the stronger dollar. When coupled with the apparent softness in the total number of hours worked, as reported by the BLS, which was applicable in the service sector as well as the manufacturing sector, it indicates to me at least something to watch, but it\u2019s a risk. It\u2019s not a reality\u2014it\u2019s just a risk.  But I think that the \u201croughly balanced\u201d is getting a little bit ahead of ourselves. Second, I am also a little uncomfortable with the language in paragraph 3 of alternative B because, as many have commented, it does lean forward\u2014perhaps not as far as some would like\u2014to a December rate increase. And as Presidents Bullard and Lockhart and others have noted, in and of itself, that may raise some communication problems, but it may also raise some issues for us of, what is it that we\u2019re expecting to see.  However, it may be the best language that could garner a consensus,in view of the rather divergent views of people here.  But I did want to indicate that I am a little bit uncomfortable with it. I think, by the way, the problems that Presidents Bullard and Lockhart and others have referred to will only be exacerbated if everybody on this Committee runs out trying to influence market expectations about later increases, because then we\u2019re going to get into another one of these wars of words, in which everybody goes out and gives their speeches and then sees how much the 10-year has moved to see whether they\u2019ve given a good speech or not.  And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s been particularly useful for the Committee as a whole.  I feel like we\u2019re stuck in a bit of a collective action problem here, and I don\u2019t know how to get out of it.  But maybe the communications subcommittee\u2014no, I\u2019m only kidding, Stan"], "2016FOMC20161102meeting.txt": [" VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I agree with all that you said, Madam Chair, in terms of not having to make decisions right now.  But presumably there are some decisions that you might want to make now, just because there might be consensus and there might be a deadweight loss of not making that decision.  The one that seems most obvious to me, potentially, is the reserve requirement. It doesn\u2019t seem, in the current regime, that required reserves has any great value, and it has administrative costs.  It results in fewer high-quality liquid asset sales. I have a general question for the staff or anyone else.  Do people feel like all this has to necessarily be deferred if there is consensus on issues like required reserves.  I presume a determination on required reserves is a Board decision", " MR. POTTER.  The only thing I would say is that it might signal something that you don\u2019t want to signal.  So there have to be some overall context, I think, for a decision like that", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I, too, found the briefings and the memos very valuable.  However, I have a somewhat different take on where we are on these issues.  I noticed that in the briefing it was described as the \u201clong-run monetary policy implementation framework,\u201d and that was the task that you were assigned and carried out.  I actually think we need to be thinking much more seriously about the long-run monetary policy framework itself, and this ties into a lot of the comments that David L\u00f3pez-Salido made in his presentation. I\u2019m going to focus primarily on macro stabilization and macroeconomic objectives, and my main concern, as always, is how are we going to conduct monetary policy successfully, achieving our inflation goal and our macroeconomic goals, in a world of a very low r*.  I\u2019ll note the staff\u2019s view today is that the equilibrium nominal funds rate is 2\u00be percent.  I agree with that. If you look at the recent research that Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and I have done, and at research by economists at central banks around the world using similar methods, many people are finding that r* is much lower today than in the past in many countries.  And it\u2019s a global phenomenon. This brings me to concerns about our monetary policy framework.  First, if you think about our balance sheet of more than $4 trillion and the massive QE in other countries, that is presumably adding, at least according to our models and our analysis, quite a bit of stimulus to the U.S. economy and to the global economy more generally. If you look at the methods for actually estimating r*, whether it is the model with Thomas and Kathryn or models, such as those developed at the Richmond Federal Reserve, DSGE models, and others, they generally do not take into account the effects of QE on demand.  It\u2019s just part of where the IS curve is, if you will. Then, if you actually think about going from massive QE stimulus in the United States and around the world and taking that away, going back to the baseline, you\u2019re talking about reducing a significant amount of stimulus in the global economy and the U.S. economy in particular, which arguably, using the methodology either of the work of my work with Thomas or other people\u2019s work or DSGE models or whatever, generally would imply that r* will be lower in the future, not where it is today. I am really picking up on what David L\u00f3pez-Salido said.  He described it the opposite way; a large balance sheet will boost r*. But if you actually look at how the methodology of   these research papers work, because they don\u2019t take into account the balance sheet generally, it actually is arguing that that boost to r* is already built into our estimate. So I would argue that there is up to \u00bd percentage point lower r* out there once we take away QE in the United States, and more generally globally, which would argue a nominal neutral federal  funds rate maybe of 2 or 2\u00bc percent or so.  And that does bring a huge challenge to carrying out monetary policy.  If we keep the balance sheet elevated to keep r* higher, like David L\u00f3pez-Salido said, we don\u2019t have as much room to use QE to stimulate.  If you look at the very nice paper by Dave Reifschneider a few months ago, it does point out, if we can get our balance sheet back down and if r* isn\u2019t lower, we actually have a lot of room for stimulus. But in my interpretation, I fear that there\u2019s not nearly as much room for stimulus.  There are limits to how far QE can go in terms of the assets that we can buy under current law and the amount of outstanding MBS. These considerations make me think that, really, we need to be seriously discussing the monetary policy framework.  And we should be focusing our discussions and our decisionmaking on that framework, meaning what our inflation target should be and whether we should be thinking about price-level or nominal GDP targeting or other approaches to overcome the effective lower bound.  And from that will flow naturally some of the decisions about what\u2019s the right size of the balance sheet, what\u2019s the right policy framework. From my point of view, I agree with the Chair that we are not in a rush to make these decisions about what I think of as mostly tactical aspects of the operational sides of monetary policy.  I think instead we should not be making public statements about what our operational or implementation side of our framework would be until we really have thought through some of these longer-run issues in connection with what our objectives and our actual monetary policy framework itself should be.  Thank you.CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren", " MR. LACKER.  Why wouldn\u2019t you want to use them", "  Moreover, the low profitability of European banks likely reflects other factors besides low NIMS, such as excess capacity, failure to cut costs, low GDP growth, and legacy of nonperforming loans. Accordingly, protecting the financial system is probably not a sufficient reason to forgo further stimulus.  Instead, what Japan and especially Europe need are assertive measures to restore banking system health, including cutting costs, consolidation, and concerted capital raising.  The inadequate capital and profitability of Europe\u2019s banks pose two threats to the outlook.  First, they may constrain lending, leading to lower investment and growth.  Second, they raise the likelihood of bank failure.  The Tealbook features an alternative scenario in which the deterioration in the financial position of a large systemic bank in Europe requires its resolution.  Obviously, it\u2019s very difficult to predict the consequences of such an event.  In our scenario, the failure of the authorities to bail out the bank, concerns that other banks may have similar problems, and difficulties implementing the resolution process trigger disruptive spillovers and a retreat from risk in global financial markets. Europe falls  back into recession, and\u2014as shown in panels 10 through 12\u2014the dollar appreciates, U.S. GDP growth slows, and the federal funds rate rises more slowly. While we are on the topic of financial stability, I\u2019d like to briefly remind you of a new product developed by the International Finance Division that was presented in the QS financial stability report a couple of weeks ago: the International Financial Stability Matrix, or IFSM.  As shown in your final exhibit, the IFSM provides evaluations of financial vulnerability for 12 countries based on both quantitative data and judgmental assessments and, like the matrix for the U.S. economy, is built up from assessments of various key sectors.  You may have noticed that I spoke about uncertainties in the foreign outlook for 10 minutes without discussing China.  Indeed, China is one of the countries highlighted in our matrix as being especially vulnerable to financial disruptions, but describing its many issues would take at least another 10 minutes and would in any case cover pretty familiar ground.  I will cede that time to Michael, who will discuss U.S. financial-stability issues", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I\u2019d like to hear more about this upgrade.  What caught my ear was the increase in maturity transformation activity at Federal Home Loan Banks. Let me just verify that they\u2019re not off the table or out of bounds because they\u2019re quasi-government.  If they\u2019re risky, it counts as risk for you, right", " MR. PALUMBO. The mutualization of the prime money funds with the rounded NAV provided a first-mover advantage for highly sophisticated investors that evidently were unwilling to take chances on receiving their money a few weeks after they thought they were promised it.  That was a very dangerous and run-prone vehicle", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Mike, I also have a question for you.  It\u2019s on exhibit 2, and I\u2019m trying to figure out in my own mind how much comfort I should take from the change between the \u201clevel\u201d and the \u201cadjusted for Treasuries.\u201d  One way to think of this chart is, if we were in a bubble world, the orange-red-red would more than likely be orange-red-red in the second column, and that would be a bubble. If instead the mechanism was \u201creach-for-yield,\u201d then it might look a lot like the column that you actually have there.  So I was trying to ask, in my ownmind, is there an inherent reason why the risk of price reversal is greater in an asset-bubble world than it is for a \u201creach-for-yield\u201d one, and should I take comfort in the difference between these two columns", " MR. PALUMBO.  Well, I can\u2019t say that you shouldn\u2019t.  I think the reason we presented it this way is that, necessarily, you cannot feel better about the right-hand column than the left-hand column.  As a group, we frankly ended up splitting the difference.  And I tried to allude to that a little bit in my remarks, but I think we\u2019re of two minds. If you\u2019re just somebody who\u2019s discounting cash flows, and you\u2019re using a risk-free rate and you don\u2019t mind a rate that has a negative term premium in it to do your discounting, then, again, that\u2019s the sense in which the right-hand column gives you more comfort, and I think neither of these have super predictive power for what the future price changes are going to be, but, on average, there\u2019s probably a little bit of evidence for the right-hand side versus the left-hand side.  But I think it\u2019s just a case in which we don\u2019t know.  And I would say, to me, the low-term premiums as part of the calculus is part of the reason that I would be more inclined to hedge away from the right column toward the middle column.  That\u2019s really an unusual pricing situation for these asset markets, and I guess I wouldn\u2019t want to be too confident about how that would play out with a shock or even maybe with something that\u2019s not even so shocking. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams", " MR. ROSENGREN. He had a two-hander", " WILLIAMS.  So that does set me up.   There are a couple of issues about whether Treasury securities are properly priced.  One issue is just this issue of very low r*. How do you take that into account if you really think we\u2019re in this world of very low rates. Then that obviously changes your view about what interest rates should be relative to the SEP.  But the second issue is the term premium itself. In our earlier discussion today, I think we kind of came around to realizing that we\u2019re probably going to have a big balance sheet for a long time despite our earlier public statements that we\u2019re going to normalize the balance sheet. So that could be an argument for a low term premium for a very long time.  In addition, I think there\u2019s a growing recognition that the pricing of risk in the Treasury securities market has changed fundamentally from the 1980s and 1990s, when the risk you were protecting against was high inflation.  The market seems to be, at least based on what I\u2019ve seen, pricing the downside scenario in terms of what you\u2019re really worried about.  And that is just going to push the term premium associated with a 10-year Treasury security from a high positive value to a potentially very low positive value or even a negative value. Getting back to President Lacker\u2019s question:  How do you take into account both a very low r* and, probably because of a low r*, a shift in the equilibrium term premium when you do this kind of assessment", " MR. FISCHER.  Just two questions.  First, why do you show the level of debt on a ratio scale.  What happens if you show debt service. Doesn\u2019t everything look very different", " MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  You said it\u2019s also useful to track the overall positions, but the ones with the income are not shown", " MR. EVANS.  Right.  The way you did the presentation, I might have had the takeaway that looks like this is not that unusual, but recognizing those two episodes, I wonder about that.  Sounds like it\u2019s up for grabs, at least", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I just want to make a few comments on one of the risks that\u2019s already been highlighted by several different people on the staff, which is Deutsche Bank. As I see it, there are multiple problems here:  a bad business model, poor execution, undercapitalization, and multiple legal cases that will result in large fines that will certainly put even greater pressure on the bank\u2019s capital.  And the situation is made worse because of the lack of visibility about when the legal cases will be settled and the amount of fines that will ultimately be assessed. The firm is apparently waiting to settle its RMBS case with the Department of Justice before unveiling its new strategy, which apparently is going to be to shrink to a smaller, more reasonable footprint supplemented by a large equity capital raise. But the problem is that, in the meantime, the franchise is eroding, which undercuts the firm\u2019s future profitability prospects.  This also makes it more difficult for the firm to raise the necessary equity to shore up its balance sheet. I think someone remarked that it\u2019s selling at 0.3 times book value currently.  So the firm is very fragile, and even though it announced its earnings last week and nothing really bad happened, the risk of an abrupt loss of confidence seems to still be very, very high.  I rememberthe summer of 2008 when there were weeks and months when there were firms that looked okay.  That didn\u2019t mean that they turned out to be okay. Now, one might argue that the German government will not let Deutsche Bank fail because it is their largest bank, and that could be correct, but I think it does ignore two constraints, one political and one legal.  The political constraint is that a German government bailout of Deutsche Bank would be very unpopular politically, and that\u2019s particularly relevant in the current environment, in light of the upcoming German election and the fact that Angela Merkel\u2019s popularity is already somewhat diminished.  The German government has said they will not do a recap, but it\u2019s unclear what their appetite would be if there was actually no alternative. The legal constraint is the European Union\u2019s bank competition policy, which sharply constrains the ability of national governments to recapitalize, as opposed to resolve, their troubled institutions.  In a resolution, bank debt has to be built in, which means large losses for investors and a heightened risk of contagion.  So they\u2019re in a difficult place. Although the financial system is a lot stronger today than it was in 2008, I believe that the failure of a firm the size and complexity of Deutsche Bank would have significant consequences for the stability of the global financial system.  Deutsche Bank has a huge derivatives book, and a significant portion of this book is still cleared on a bilateral rather than centrally settled basis. Moreover, the risk of failure really isn\u2019t priced in to any significant degree, although Deutsche Bank\u2019s five-year CDS is elevated relative to other institutions.  It\u2019s only trading in a range of 200 to 250 basis points, which is far lower than a number of institutions that actually did not fail during the 2008 financial crisis.  So I think that if Deutsche Bank did fail, it would be a pretty big surprise, and so the shock would be even more intensified.  I also don\u2019t think it would be viewed as a purely idiosyncratic event, because there are other firms that are challenged in terms ofprofitability, business model, and uncertain legal liabilities, including banks like Credit Suisse and Barclays.  Now, on the positive side, I think those firms have some core businesses that are well functioning and actually do have fundamentally stronger franchises, but I have little doubt that if Deutsche Bank failed, it would put significant pressure on several other major banking institutions. Of course, what\u2019s frustrating about all of this is, what do we do about it sitting here in the United States.  Well, there\u2019s not much we can do but to ensure that Deutsche Bank has sufficient liquidity in the United States so there is no late-day funding shortfall, and to press Deutsche Bank and the ECB, which is its supervisor, to have Deutsche Bank settle its RMBS case with the Department of Justice as swiftly as possible.  Settlement of the case, I think, would be important, because it would encourage Deutsche Bank to then go forward and announce its new strategy, quickly followed by a raising of capital.  And I think if those two things could happen, we might be in a somewhat better place.  But where we\u2019re sitting today is not something that makes me very confident.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. No, I don\u2019t think there is anything for us to do, in that sense. The Department of Justice has to do what it has to do, and I don\u2019t think there is any role for us", " MR. EVANS.  Did you mean 100,000", "  MR. EVANS.  I have a question, Thomas.  It has to do with the way you described the uncertainty bands relative to the higher labor costs.  I heard you comment about how the red line was within the 70 percent confidence bands.  I think this is an important question for any future discussion we might have about including error bands associated with our projections.  My concern is, it\u2019s so easy to glibly say, \u201cOh, here\u2019s a path.  It falls within this band.\u201d  And whether you say it or not, it leaves the listener with the impression that there\u2019s not really a significant difference between these.  The validity of the bands, unless you\u2019re doing something different than I\u2019m familiar with, is point by point by point.  So it\u2019s only for one particular hypothesis that it\u2019s actually correct. I think, in my experience in doing some of these research tabulations of things that sort of fit within an error band, if you have a composite hypothesis like the average response or the discrepancy over four different periods, the tabulations might well end up being something significantly different  Do you have any comments on that", " MR. KAPLAN.  I\u2019ll ask one very basic question.  I could see why higher expected GDP growth would raise the term premium, because higher prospective growth might\u2014to me, would\u2014steepen the yield curve.  In your work, you\u2019re saying that even higher inflation not accompanied by higher prospective GDP growth might raise the term premium.  And I just want to hear a little bit more about why you would assert that, as opposed to raising the level of the entire curve", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B for today.  In my view, our normalization program is not proceeding as planned.  One rate increase per year and no change in the balance sheet is not meaningful in the macroeconomic sense. I think it\u2019s becoming increasingly apparent that we should de-emphasize the idea of normalization as we go forward.  My basic recommendation is that we should plan to go ahead with a rate increase at the December meeting.  I think that\u2019s necessary at this point to maintain credibility.  But I think we should accompany that move with language that further moves in 2017 are not anticipated, and that the next move is as likely to be a decrease in the policy rate as it is to be an increase in the policy rate. So let me turn to what I see as the problem with our normalization rhetoric.  Policy is mostly about the intended path of policy and not the level of the policy rate today.  Our rhetoric is that we are on the cusp of a 200 basis point or more move upward in the policy rate. Our forecast is for economic growth near 2 percent over the forecast horizon.  In my opinion, this is not meaningfully different from trend, in view of the degree of precision with which we can measure the trend.  Our forecast is also for unemployment near the Committee\u2019s estimate of its longer-run value, and inflation forecasts are generally centered on the Committee\u2019s inflation target.  The general contours of this forecast are very similar whether one is looking at the Tealbook, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fed forecast, or private-sector forecasts.  What is different about private-sector expectations is the policy rate path, which is very flat in the private-sector view in order to achieve the same forecast outcomes. So let\u2019s take the private-sector perspective for just a moment.  From that perspective, it looks like any surprise in the form of faster output growth, lower-than-expected unemployment, or higher-than-expected inflation will be seen by this Committee as a reason to embark more rapidly on a 200 basis point normalization program.  From the private-sector perspective, this would be inappropriate.  This is like holding a hammer over the economy, as deviations from our forecast expectations will be met very aggressively in the private-sector perception. I think that this is the wrong approach.  With the type of forecast that we currently have and the type of private-sector expectations that we can measure, I think we would do much better to characterize current policy settings as approximately correct, in light of the current state of the economy and its expected trajectory. To conclude, I would say, go ahead for December, but use that moment to realign expectations for 2017 and beyond.  In particular, use the December opportunity to get rid of the perception that we are on the precipice of a major policy rate move.  I just don\u2019t think that that\u2019s an accurate description of the Committee\u2019s intentions.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan", " MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I do believe we\u2019re at the point at which it is appropriate to remove some amount of accommodation.  I would support doing this, if not today, then very soon.  I recommend this in the context of believing that the path of rates over the next few years ought to be very shallow, and the terminal rate is likely to be much lower than we\u2019ve historically experienced. I believe, therefore, that further removals of accommodation should be done very gradually, with an appropriate amount of patience and caution.  I also believe that in the absence of other economic policies, such as infrastructure spending, fiscal policy, and other structural reforms, prospective GDP growth is going to be very sluggish.  This is due to persistent secular headwinds I discussed yesterday that do not appear to be abating. All of this means to me that we can afford to be patient regarding further removals of accommodation.  However, I do believe some amount of removal would be healthy in light of building imbalances I see in terms of the effects on savers as well as the distortions regarding asset allocation and other business decisions.  These imbalances may not only be difficult to ultimately unwind but also have some behavioral effects that, if allowed to persist, could undermine future sustainable economic growth.

There\u2019s also a figure in Tealbook B, and, for November 30, I wasn\u2019t sure if they lined up.  Is there something conceptually different between those numbers. Because some of us are going to be eager trackers of unrealized capital gains or losses in the months and weeks ahead, I suspect", " MR. LACKER.

KAMIN.

FISCHER.  Do we need the SEP when we have the Tealbook. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, we put the SEP into the public domain", " MR. WILCOX.  Well, I thought I was with you, but you indicated the opposite conclusion than what I thought.  I thought I heard you just say that our judgment is mainly a medium-term judgment about asymmetric risks, and I would have said the opposite\u2014that my  concern predominantly is a recession, if one were to occur.  We don\u2019t have one in the baseline.   But we\u2019re talking about risks here.  And a recession in the next year or two, before the level of the funds rate has moved further up in its trajectory, would cause greater concern in terms of the ability of the Committee to fight the effects of the recession", " MR. KAMIN.  We expect that if there are going to be moves, they will be toward higher barriers of trade.  But the array of different possible actions that have been floated by the campaign were so disparate, and the magnitude of some of the individual items\u2014reopening NAFTA, declaring China a trade manipulator\u2014were so difficult to gauge that it was very hard even to assess whether there would be actions that would be macroeconomically meaningful, or whether there would just be a series of disparate actions that might have microeconomic effectsbut not amount to a lot on the macro side.  So, for that reason, we chose not to assume trade policies in our baseline", " MS. AARONSON.  I think there is something there, in the sense that I think when we enter a recession the unemployment rate goes up quickly, and that\u2019s often when you see it.  But I   don\u2019t think that that precludes the possibility that you can have those gradual increases.  I think we haven\u2019t seen that many of them because we don\u2019t have that many examples, but when we were looking, there weren\u2019t that many examples we identified in which the Committee actually said that it was trying to achieve a soft landing. And so I think it\u2019s just a little unclear.  I don\u2019t think the fact that we view this empirical regularity rules out the possibility that it can also go up gradually", " MR. ROSENGREN.  I want to follow up on Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s first question and David Wilcox\u2019s response to it.  When I look at the revisions to the projections broken out by change in fiscal assumption and no change in fiscal assumption, I see that the no change in fiscal assumption for the real GDP is zero, minus 0.01, 0.01, and zero.  So, no change from the previous time. But we observe that the 10-year Treasury yield is 70 basis points higher.  Either you had to do the exercise that David talked about, which is to back out all the financial market movements in order to be able to come up with that forecast, or you have to be modeling a very severe monetary policy contraction because that would be the reason you don\u2019t have fiscal policy changing\u2014then, presumably, it\u2019s a monetary policy change. In effect, this would be modeling a very substantial monetary policy tightening with no change in GDP. If this were to be something that were used in the press conference, I think it would lead to a lot of awkward questioning because you\u2019d have to come up with how people actually backed out their expectation of how much the financial market reaction is due to changed expectations regarding fiscal policy.  That could generate a whole host of questions.  I don\u2019t know if you were planning on using this in the press conference.CHAIR YELLEN.  I wasn\u2019t planning on using this, but I was planning on, if asked about the SEP, saying that some participants included a fiscal policy change and some didn\u2019t, and that you could note that even when there were assumptions of a fiscal policy change, the changes in the federal funds rate paths were modest", " MR. ROSENGREN.  But then, for those that didn\u2019t, you have to explain how you had a 70 basis point increase in the 10-year Treasury yield that is not due to changed expectations regarding fiscal policy.  I mean, you do observe that the long rate has gone up a lot.  So how do you explain the way people actually came up with their assumption about no fiscal policy change using actual rates. CHAIR YELLEN.  And you have essentially a 25 basis point increase in the path, which is, as I understand it, similarly to the effect of this fiscal policy package on r*, and a larger, I guess 40 basis point, move in the 10-year Treasury rate.  Part of this occurs by term premiums and part by moves in the funds rate.  I think that\u2019s consistent with the projections that you see here.  Now, there\u2019s a larger market reaction, but there is a lot of uncertainty and we don\u2019t know what assumptions have gone into that\u2014maybe a larger fiscal package than the staff have penciled in here", " MR. WILCOX.  President Rosengren, I\u2019m not sure that enough information in the SEP process was collected to answer your question because the 10-year Treasury rate is not specified. So, in principal, we don\u2019t know how participants handled that", "  [Laughter] MR. KAMIN.  I\u2019ll take this one.  First of all, just comparing the two international alternative scenarios, the banking crisis one was, I think, marginally more consequential for U.S. variables than the emerging market turmoil one, but not by a great deal.  And, as with most simulations, that reflected in some sense what we put into the simulation, and the inputs included some downward pressure on U.S. confidence and spending and upward pressure on spreads, as the reverberations arising from the banking crisis in Europe spread out through the global economy.  We assume that those will be greater in the case of this advanced-economy banking crisis than would be the case in the event of an emerging-market heightened-financial-stress situation. Now, going to the issue of comparing the effect of one bank having a messy resolution with, let\u2019s say, some genuine bankruptcies of some smaller banks, our view was that the scenario in question was one in which if a very large, very systemically important, one of the most  systemically important banks in the world located in the northern part of Europe was forced into resolution, and potentially if that resolution was handled in a somewhat messy way, leaving a lot of uncertainty and leading to a sort of reverse-moral-hazard play in which some investors were surprised that they were not bailed out fully, then that situation, due to the highly interconnected nature of the bank, its many counterparties, and its prominence in the global financial system would lead to a lot more contagion and reverberations than, for example, the other very prominent banking situation right now in Europe, which is about Italian banks. Now, you can tell a story in which a resolution in bankruptcy of Monte dei Paschi\u2014 which is the current Italian bank that\u2019s the most exposed to problems\u2014with subordinated debt holders being bailed in and with it also being handled poorly so you get queues of people waiting to get their money out, which is seen on nightly television all around Europe, also leads to banking distress.  But the fact is, right now the resolution of that bank and maybe some other smaller Italian banks is a pretty well-anticipated development.  Our sense is that even if that bank gets resolved, which seems to be the most likely situation at present, it would take place without the shock to financial markets and the reverberation through a network of counterparties that would be the case in a messy resolution of a much larger and more systemically important bank. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard", " MR. BULLARD.  I totally understand.  I just want to put in perspective what we can say about future fiscal policy in a realistic sense, in view of model uncertainty and statistical uncertainty, and I think the answer is \u201cnot much, but we do the best we can.\u201d On \u201cUnderstanding Movements in the Dollar,\u201d exhibit 6, if I\u2019m reading the graph on the real dollar\u2014panel 2\u2014correctly, we\u2019re now assuming a bigger appreciation of the dollar.  We\u2019ve talked about this before, and I\u2019ve questioned this before. We\u2019re saying that the dollar is going to appreciate because we\u2019re going to surprise the world with more aggressive monetary policy than it currently expects.  And yet when I look at panel 4\u2014\u201cImplied Federal Funds Rate Path\u201d\u2014in Mr. Potter\u2019s exhibit 1, I see that the market now expects a much higher federal funds rate path\u2014 in fact, much closer to the Committee median\u2014than before. So it seems like if anything, on the basis of that, we should be expecting less appreciation of the dollar, not more", " MR. BULLARD.  You\u2019ve spent a lot of time in the presentation saying, \u201cWell, this was outsized, looked outsized\u201d or something, but it\u2019s not really", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  There have been substantial changes in financial markets since our previous meeting.  The 10-year Treasury yield has increased more than 60 basis points, the dollar has appreciated, and the stock market has reached new highs. I must admit, however, that despite all the excitement in financial markets since the presidential election, my economic forecast has responded with more restraint, in part reflecting my skepticism that fiscal and regulatory policies are likely to be as transformative as some of the markets seem to be anticipating.  Like the Tealbook, I expect the economy to significantly overshoot full employment.  In my forecast, the unemployment rate declines to 4.2 percent by 2019, well below my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment of 4.7 percent.  This occurs despite my assumption of an increase in the federal funds rate at this meeting and about four more per year over the forecast horizon.  If I took literally the fiscal policy as announced by theincoming Administration, it would call for much more monetary policy tightening.  However, reflecting my skepticism about the speed of adopting new fiscal policies and the uncertainty regarding the magnitude of fiscal policies that will actually be passed by the Congress, I continue to assume a relatively gradual increase in the federal funds rate.  Should my skepticism prove wrong, we will need to tighten more quickly. Because of the overshooting of full employment in my forecast, I was quite interested in the staff memos discussing earlier periods of overshooting.  My own conclusion after reading the memos is that significantly overshooting full employment in the United States almost always results in adverse outcomes. Because there is uncertainty about the exact value of the natural rate, there is merit in probing how low the natural rate might be.  At the same time, it is important to weigh the potential costs of an unemployment rate that falls well below all of our estimates of what is sustainable in the long run.  The countervailing costs and benefits are the reason it can be useful to probe the lower natural rate of unemployment, but remaining more than \u00bd percentage point below our best guess of the natural rate for a prolonged period of time would be more like a plunge than a careful probe. My forecast envisions a very gradual decline in the unemployment rate, reaching 4\u00bd percent by the end of 2017.  However, with the unemployment rate for November already at 4.6 percent, there is considerable risk that we will overshoot full employment by even more than I forecast by the end of next year.  If it becomes clearer during the course of the year that this is occurring, I would expect monetary policy to need to tighten more quickly. It is worth noting that there is increasing evidence of tight labor markets. The share of the unemployed who have been unemployed for less than 27 weeks is now near historical lows.  In contrast, the share of unemployed workers who have been unemployed longer than 27 weeksremains fairly elevated. The general scarcity of workers should encourage employers to hire those who have experienced long-duration unemployment.  In support of that notion, we have seen some increase in the probability of reemployment for long-duration workers, although such hires likely come with additional training costs. In view of the general tightening of labor markets, employers are likely to bid more aggressively for those workers with the appropriate skill set. Indeed, there is already evidence\u2014 for example, the wage increases apparent in the Atlanta Fed\u2019s Wage Growth Tracker\u2014that labor costs are starting to rise.  Anecdotally, employers in our region increasingly complain about a shortage of workers.  This is certainly consistent with the low unemployment rates in many parts of New England, with the unemployment rate in Massachusetts now at 3.3 percent and in New Hampshire now at 2.8 percent.  These employers increasingly mention a shortage of workers limiting growth opportunities for their firms.  Consistent with the perception of tightening labor markets and the data in the Wage Growth Tracker, these firms are increasingly talking about offering higher wages and increasing their budgets for workforce development. In sum, my forecast involves an assumption of the same withdrawal of stimulus as the Tealbook. The recent increase in longer-term rates and the dollar appreciation are already doing some of our work for us.  Even so, there is a significant risk that fiscal policy will be even more expansionary than I have assumed. As a consequence, I see the risks associated with my GDP forecast as weighted to the upside and the unemployment rate weighted to the downside.  Although there is a great deal of uncertainty concerning fiscal policy, even with an unaltered post-election fiscal policy assumption, my forecast has the unemployment rate falling well below its full-employment rate and inflation somewhat overshooting our inflation target by the end of   the forecast, albeit with a very different outlook for longer-term rates and the dollar.
