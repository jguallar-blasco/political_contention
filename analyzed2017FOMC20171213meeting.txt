Passage number 1.
 MR. QUARLES.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  And, as you know, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has announced the appointment of Tom Barkin as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond beginning January 1.  We look forward to our new colleague joining the Committee at the January meeting.  Mark Mullinix will be representing the Richmond Bank again today.  And, Mark, I want to thank you for so ably representing Richmond during these past five meetings.  We are very grateful for your contributions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a statement of announcements and expressions of gratitude.


Passage number 2.
 MR. MULLINIX.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  As you recall, we elected Jim Clouse as FOMC secretary, effective November 26, and this is his first meeting serving in that capacity.  So welcome, Jim.  And, finally, I would like to remind you that this evening we will have a chance to honor former Board Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer at a reception downstairs.  All FOMC participants and all staff attending this meeting are invited to attend the reception.  Due to scheduling constraints, the reception needs to begin in a timely way, so we plan to adjourn for the day no later than 5:00 p.m. Okay.  With that, let’s turn to the formal agenda, and let me call on Simon to begin with the Desk presentation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It mainly consists of announcements and reminders, without any conflicting opinions or viewpoints being expressed.


Passage number 3.
  MS. GEORGE.  Lorie, on exhibit 2, chart 12, would you explain to me again, what is significant about the difference between the June and the December surveys.  What do you think drove the view on Federal Reserve notes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 4.
 MS. LOGAN.  I don’t think—there wasn’t anything that we received in the surveys themselves that explained that change.  I think it just might be further “socialization.”  As they have seen other forecasts of these, they may have adjusted their own.  But I don’t think there is any larger theme.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. Logan is simply stating her opinion and speculation about a possible explanation for a change, without any opposition or conflicting views being expressed.


Passage number 5.
 MS. GEORGE.  Okay—there’s nothing to read into that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Ms. George is expressing agreement or understanding with the statement being referred to.


Passage number 6.
 MS. LOGAN.  I don’t think so.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 7.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any other questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, we now need a vote to ratify the domestic open market operations conducted since the October–November meeting.  Do I have a motion to approve.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers and participants in the meeting seem to be in agreement and there is no indication of any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 8.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  I’m assuming none are opposed.  And let’s then go to our economic briefings, and I’d like to call on John Stevens to start us off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The response from the attendees is unanimous and there is no mention of any opposing views.


Passage number 9.
  MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  I’m back on exhibit 2, panel 5, which is “Output Gap Estimates.”  This figure, as far as I can read it, says that in 2018, the output gap will be about 2 percentage points, according to staff estimates.  And I want to relate this to exhibit 3, panel 3, which is “Core PCE Price Inflation”—2018, resource utilization, the red box, 0.1 percent.  So the output gap is going to be 200 basis points, and out of that we’re going to get 0.1 percent in inflation.  Is that the correct interpretation.  And is that statistically different from zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and verifying the correct interpretation of the data.


Passage number 10.
 MR. STEVENS.  Sorry.  Could you give me the two numbers that you said again.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The person is simply asking for clarification and asking the other person to repeat the two numbers.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 11.
  You had— MR. BULLARD.  I got the output gap in this chart 5 at 2 percentage points, if I’m reading it correctly.  Is that right.  And then I got the inflation on exhibit 3, panel 3, “Core PCE Price Inflation:  Decompositions of Deviations from Trend.”  The part due to resource utilization is the red box for 2018.  It’s 0.1 percent.  So the ratio is 20 to 1, if I have it right—200 basis points to 10 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning whether they have read the charts correctly and seeking confirmation from someone else.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 12.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The use of the term "VICE CHAIRMAN" suggests that there is a disagreement or conflict between the Chairman and the Vice Chairman. Without additional context, it is not clear what the contention is about.


Passage number 13.
  So you’re just saying you have a very flat— MR. BULLARD.  Emphasizing that the Phillips curve is extremely flat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply restating or emphasizing a point about the flatness of the Phillips curve.


Passage number 14.
 MR. STEVENS.  I think the coefficient in our decomposition, if I recall correctly, is on the order of 0.15 times a measure of slack.  So that would be about right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Stevens simply states a fact or a piece of information without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 15.
 MR. WILCOX.  And there’s a little lag.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It appears to be a neutral statement.


Passage number 16.
 MR. BULLARD.  Oh, there’s a lag.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Bullard.


Passage number 17.
 MR. WILCOX.  There’s a little lag, if I’m recalling correctly, in the relationship of resource utilization to inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only presents a statement made by Mr. Wilcox about a potential lag in the relationship of resource utilization to inflation. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 18.
 MR. BULLARD.  As a policymaker, should I think of that response as being importantly different from zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard simply asks a question about how he should perceive or interpret a certain response.


Passage number 19.
  MR. WILCOX.  I guess I’d say “yes.”  It’s attenuated from what it used to be, and it’s one of the two channels through which we think you have the predominant element of your force on inflation, the other being through the exchange rate and core import price channel.  And that’s the lever you’ve got.  Let me use the plural:  Those are the levers you’ve got.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wilcox is stating his opinion and explaining his reasoning without contradicting any other statement or viewpoint.


Passage number 20.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you.  I have—oh, maybe Vice Chairman Dudley wanted to come in on this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 21.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  No, no.  Go ahead.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Based on the given statement "No, no. Go ahead," it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement. The response provided does not indicate any disagreement or contention, as it simply encourages someone to proceed with their intended action.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 22.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  I have one other question.  This is on the material on our projections.  On page 3, we give the dot plot, we give the median dots here, and then we give what the Taylor (1999) rule says.  Why are we doing the Taylor (1999) rule on here.  Why do we say that.  Why don’t we just present the dots and talk about the dots.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning the inclusion of the Taylor (1999) rule in the presentation and suggests presenting only the dot plot.


Passage number 23.
 MR. TETLOW.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without a specific passage provided, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 24.
  Well— MR. BULLARD.  I mean, I think it’s kind of—I don’t know what you’re doing.  I don’t care about the Taylor (1999) rule.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, expresses confusion and indifference towards the Taylor (1999) rule, suggesting a difference of opinion or perspective.


Passage number 25.
  [Laughter] MR. TETLOW.  I think it’s useful to have some semi-independent metric of where the federal funds rate setting might be, so that you can ask yourselves why there’s a discrepancy as large as it is.  It could be that the answer is, “I don’t care what the Taylor (1999) rule says.”  [Laughter]  That’s a perfectly acceptable answer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting the usefulness of having an independent metric for federal funds rate setting and acknowledging that it is acceptable to disregard the Taylor (1999) rule if necessary. The laughter in the passage indicates a light-hearted tone, further suggesting that there is no disagreement or contention.


Passage number 26.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, is it a Taylor (1999) straight out of Taylor, or is it a Taylor (1999) with an adjusted r* value.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. It seems to be a question seeking clarification.


Passage number 27.
 MR. TETLOW.  Well, there are two things different here.  First, there is the adjustment of the r*, which comes from each of your individual estimates of the longer-run natural rate of  interest, which we have to take to be a constant.  The other thing is, we’re using PCE inflation here instead—Taylor used GDP price inflation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage describes two different things being discussed, but there is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 28.
  Otherwise, it’s exactly— MR. BULLARD.  My own preference is that you take it out.  I just want to see what the Committee thinks, and I’m aware that there are many benchmarks against which you could compare that.  But this gives an air of “this is the right number” or something, which I don’t agree with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, disagrees with the idea of keeping a specific statement or number in the passage. He argues that it gives a false impression of certainty or correctness, which he does not agree with.


Passage number 29.
 MR. LAUBACH.  President Bullard, we provide a variety of these benchmarks in Tealbook B as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating that they provide a variety of benchmarks in Tealbook B. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 30.
 MR. BULLARD.  Not on this chart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no mention of any disagreement or contention in this passage. It simply states that there is no information or discussion about something on the chart.


Passage number 31.
  This is— MR. LAUBACH.  And, I mean, we could, if you also wished, provide several benchmarks on this chart.  That would be an alternative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting an alternative solution without opposing or contradicting any previous statements or opinions.


Passage number 32.
 MR. BULLARD.  I just want to know what the Committee came up with.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.
Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention, as Mr. Bullard simply expresses his desire to know what the Committee came up with and Chair Yellen responds by acknowledging his question.


Passage number 33.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a question for the staff.  If you look at the staff forecast, and if you look at the SEP forecast, it has inflation going back to 2 percent but not above 2 percent.  And I presume that the staff thinks that inflation expectations are somewhat below 2 percent to date.  So is the staff view that the goal should be to go to 2 percent and, after a really, really, really, really, really long time passes, that inflation expectations will converge to 2 percent.  Or does the staff think it would be better to actually go a little bit above 2 percent to cause that convergence to happen more quickly. I think it’s relevant to the SEP, too, because the median SEP path just goes to 2 percent.  So I’m asking sort of a broad conceptual question.  Is optimal policy now to basically push inflation above 2 percent, to get inflation expectations up to 2 percent more quickly.  Or is  optimal policy to converge to 2 percent—core PCE, 2 percent inflation—just keep it there for a very long time.  I mean, I’m not—this is not a trick question.  I’m really curious what you think about this.  Because I think it’s really quite consequential for the Committee in terms of how they present their forecast and their outlook.  Do we want inflation to go above 2 percent or not.  I’d just like to hear what the staff’s view on that is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any explicit contention or disagreement. The speaker is asking a question and seeking clarification on the staff's view on whether optimal policy should aim for inflation to go above 2 percent or not. The speaker expresses curiosity and states that the answer to this question is consequential for the Committee in terms of how they present their forecast and outlook. However, there is no clear indication of disagreement or contention between the speaker and the staff.


Passage number 34.
 MR. STEVENS.  At least over the medium term, you’re right—we don’t have it getting above 2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply acknowledges that the statement made is correct.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 35.
  I think we have it just barely getting a little bit above 2 for— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It could happen beyond 2020, and you’re forecasting that.  I can’t really tell what you think is optimal.  Is it to stay at 2 forever and then gradually—inflation expectations get back to 2, or is it to go above 2, to get inflation expectations back to 2 more quickly.  I mean, there must be some cost of having inflation expectations below 2 for a longer period of time, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is unsure about the optimal level of inflation and questions whether it is better to stay at 2 forever or go above 2 to quickly bring inflation expectations back to 2. They also suggest that there may be a cost to having inflation expectations below 2 for a longer period of time.


Passage number 36.
 MR. WILCOX.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage without further context.


Passage number 37.
  So can I— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I’m just curious.  I’m just really curious.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their curiosity and has no opposing viewpoint or disagreement with anyone else.


Passage number 38.
 MR. WILCOX.  First of all, I want to state very clearly that there isn’t a concept of optimality in our projection.  We conditioned the staff forecast on a very mechanical application of the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.  We do have some aspiration that the policy rule that we use won’t be too detached from how you’re thinking about the world.  But what we want to do is provide a projection that’s conditioned on a fixed yardstick, something that isn’t changing because we woke up feeling optimistic or pessimistic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It simply explains the approach and methodology used in the projection without indicating any conflicting viewpoints or opinions.


Passage number 39.
  So— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Okay.  So put that aside for a minute.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is suggesting to temporarily set aside a certain topic or issue for further discussion.


Passage number 40.
  MR. WILCOX.  Yes.  I was stumbling on “optimality.”  What is optimal.  What does the staff feel is optimal.  We’re not putting forward a statement of our view of what optimal policy is in the baseline projection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing confusion and seeking clarification about the concept of "optimality" and asking for the staff's opinion on what they consider to be optimal policy. They mention that they are not presenting their own view on optimal policy in the baseline projection.


Passage number 41.
  In terms of the mechanics— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So what do you think is optimal.  That’s what I’m really asking, fundamentally.  The staff view is that inflation expectations are below 2 percent.  What is the ideal way of dealing with that.  I guess that’s the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is simply posing a question about the optimal approach to dealing with inflation expectations being below 2 percent. There is no indication of conflicting views or opinions.


Passage number 42.
 MR. WILCOX.  I’m more than happy to put on a “normative” hat, but I just want to be very clear that you’re—I’m doing that at your invitation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Wilcox is indicating that he is willing to take on a "normative" perspective, but only if the other person is comfortable with it. There is no evidence of conflict or disagreement.


Passage number 43.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, you are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 44.
  [Laughter] MR. WILCOX.  Because we’re quite at pains to be not normative in the construction of the Tealbook projections.  So this is a mode shift.  I guess my own view is that the Committee needs to demonstrate that the indication in your consensus statement is correct—you know, that you’re standing by that statement that the 2 percent objective is a two-sided symmetric objective, and that, therefore, you ought to be approximately as willing to tolerate errors on one side as you are to tolerate errors on the other side.  And when I have my “normative” hat on, I’m concerned about a perception that inflation expectations might become solidified on the view that the Committee regards 2 percent as an asymmetric objective or as something to be approached from below.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own view and concerns, but they are not disagreeing with anyone else or presenting conflicting ideas.


Passage number 45.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The reason I’m bringing this up is, I feel that there might be some hesitancy on the part of the Committee to show inflation numbers above 2 percent.  And I worry that if we have that hesitancy, we might actually be communicating something that we actually don’t believe, sort of, fundamentally.  That’s really what I’m trying to get at.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their concerns and worries about the hesitancy of the committee to show inflation numbers above 2 percent. They are trying to convey the potential miscommunication of beliefs if this hesitancy exists.


Passage number 46.
  MR. WILCOX.  So there is not a hesitancy in the staff projection to show inflation projections above 2 percent.  This is an attempt on our part to lay out, in a very dispassionate manner, what we think the outlook is, conditioned on a particular policy baseline.  If you wish to give us clear instruction about a policy baseline that you would prefer us to use, we’d be more than happy to do that.  The way we would do it is, we’d take our assessment of the underlying economics and we’d project them onto the different policy baseline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining the staff's approach to projecting inflation and offering to take clear instruction regarding the policy baseline if desired.


Passage number 47.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Let me be clear.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The phrase "Let me be clear" is a typically used to emphasize that the speaker is being straightforward and unequivocal in their statement. It does not indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 48.
  This is not a criticism— MR. WILCOX.  No, no, no.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: The phrase "No, no, no" does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It is simply a response by Mr. Wilcox.


Passage number 49.
  I just— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Based on the information given, it is not clear whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Further context is needed to accurately determine if there is any disagreement occurring.


Passage number 50.
  I’m really trying to draw out a deeper— MR. WILCOX.  I’m not trying to reflect back to you that it’s a criticism.  I do want to be very clear, though, about the conceptual basis on which we try to put together the forecast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply wants to ensure that they have a clear understanding of the conceptual basis for the forecast.


Passage number 51.
 MR. LAUBACH.  The Monetary Policy Strategies section is perhaps a little bit less reluctant to venture into normative territory, and there you can always see that there are a couple of factors on which the answer to the question, “to what extent could an overshoot of inflation be optimal,” depends. One is the nature of the loss function.  The second one is the dynamic tradeoff between resource utilization and inflation.  So for the situation, for example, in which you had still the unemployment rate above the natural rate, you will recall that, in that situation, these simulations actually frequently showed overshoots because, basically, you wanted to accept the overshoot in order to make more rapid progress on the unemployment rate.  Again, the first thing I mentioned is the nature of the loss function.  I mean, do you care symmetrically about undershoots and overshoots of the natural rate or not.  Finally—and here I’m speculating, but—that goes back to the issue of the underlying inflation rate.  One of the things that we are quite uncertain about is not only where that object stands, but also how it responds to actual inflation observations.  To be very clear:  I’m speculating here.  But I could imagine that these results could also depend on what updating mechanism you choose for that concept of underlying inflation. The exercises that you see under the optimal control simulations are all done under anchored long-run inflation expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 52.
  But if, instead, you thought that, right now, long-run inflation expectations were running a little lower than your 2 percent objective and you had some learning mechanism in place that might be—again, something might—that could push you toward having an overshoot for a while in order to boost these— VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Because on your side of the aisle, inflation expectations are moving upwards from below 2 percent, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply presenting a hypothetical scenario and discussing the potential actions to address it.


Passage number 53.
 MR. WILCOX.  They are.  They come up at a glacial pace, in a rather mechanical, ad hoc manner, to 2 percent.  It is also the case that we do have an updating function in which the longer the economy runs hotter, the faster inflation expectations will move up.  I would also point you, just briefly, to the lower-left-hand panel on page 38 in Tealbook A.  It does show our inflation projection over the longer term, and it shows that we have a very small, but quite persistent, overshoot by inflation of the 2 percent objective.  Eventually, in the ultra-long term, the policy rule succeeds in driving both legs of the dual mandate to their desired levels.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It presents a series of statements and observations about inflation and economic projections.


Passage number 54.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess, fundamentally, I feel like we have a little bit of a risk as a Committee, in the sense that we claim it’s a two-sided inflation target, yet we’re not willing to show inflation going above 2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a personal opinion about a potential risk and contradiction in the Committee's approach to inflation targeting.


Passage number 55.
  Now, it could be that it’s beyond the forecast horizon of the SEP, but it is a—  MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply presents a possible scenario without expressing disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 56.
 WILLIAMS.  6 of the 16 have overshoots.  This is a funny conversation to be having right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The phrase "This is a funny conversation to be having right now" suggests that the speaker finds the topic of overshoots to be inappropriate or irrelevant in the current context, indicating disagreement or a difference in opinion.


Passage number 57.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, because the median is what gets all of the attention.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is subjective and presents a general opinion rather than sparking a debate.


Passage number 58.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is not enough information given to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 59.
 WILLIAMS.  Okay, but half of the Committee— CHAIR YELLEN.  I mean, there are 7 participants who have overshoots in 2020 in the SEP.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speakers are discussing the number of participants who have projected overshoots in 2020, but there is no conflict or disagreement evident in their conversation.


Passage number 60.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage without the actual passage. However, if you provide the passage, I would be happy to help you analyze it for contention or disagreement.


Passage number 61.
 WILLIAMS.  It seems like a funny time to bring this up, because I think almost half of our submissions, including mine, have an overshoot.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement expressed in the passage. The speaker simply mentions that around half of the submissions, including their own, have an "overshoot," without implying any disagreement or conflict.


Passage number 62.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Half of 16.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contentiSolIDriOn or disagreement in the statement "Half of 16." It is a straightforward mathematical calculation that can be confirmed as 8.


Passage number 63.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is not providing any information or presenting any ideas that could be seen as contentious or in disagreement.


Passage number 64.
 WILLIAMS.  Well, not half.  But, I mean, it’s a lot.  It’s not 1 or 2. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Both speakers seem to be in agreement about the fact that the number in question is considerable or significant.


Passage number 65.
 MS. BRAINARD.  I don’t think of this as a normative statement.  I think of this as a forecast.  And we could spend a lot of time asking the staff to explain their forecast.  The truth is that it has a very flat Phillips curve, alongside an underlying inflation trend that the staff is estimating at 1.8 percent.  Without actually mechanically or judgmentally adjusting that underlying trend up, they have a hard time getting actually to 2 percent in the forecast horizon.  You can correct me if I’m getting this wrong, but it just goes to show, once that underlying trend has started to drift down, how difficult it is for us to make inflation gently arrive at our symmetric 2 percent goal in the forecast horizon. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans, did you have a question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion about the staff's inflation forecast and the challenges in reaching the 2 percent goal.


Passage number 66.
 MR. EVANS.  I have a regular question.  It’s not a two-hander. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Are these two-handers.  [No response]  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple exchange of information between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 67.
  MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  While I have the opportunity on the dot chart, I’d just like to say that I’m not offended by the presence of the Taylor rule on that dot chart.  [Laughter]  I’m perfectly fine with that.  In terms of the particular dimensionality, I do note that there are two dots almost hidden by that red diamond in 2020. I have a question, though.  On exhibit 2, chart 2, “Potential Effects of Tax Legislation,” I thought the memo was very well done.  I couldn’t have done any of those things any better.  I did note that on the labor supply effect, I know that you were careful to choose elasticities that were produced by the range of agencies that do that for a living, so that’s good.  It did seem like it was kind of a big effect, and I guess the question that I have is, is there any type of state contingency to this effect.  I mean, we’re talking to a lot of people out in the business world, and they’re saying they can’t find the workers they’re looking for, the people with skills.  And the write-up mentioned that much of the inflow is going to be of secondary workers.  Are they the ones who are on the sidelines with the skills but not quite enticed to come in.  Like I said, I couldn’t do a better job with this.  I think this is what the forecasting would lead you to, but in the state of the cycle that we’re in, would you—any thoughts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It consists of the speaker expressing their thoughts, observations, and compliments about certain charts and memos.


Passage number 68.
 MR. STEVENS.  So, it is the case that we took a midpoint of the elasticities in the literature, and we have a slower adjustment than some outside people would assume, such as the JCT.  I think it’s a fair point.  I would point to what your own research staff has done, though, in terms of collecting information about plans for increased wages.  We’ve been asking these questions for a number of years, and this is the first time these have been at a level like this.  So whether it actually pans out, I don’t know, but if we start seeing some real wage increases, that could solve the issue you raise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is mostly a statement of facts and the perspective of the speaker.


Passage number 69.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you.  CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a polite exchange between Mr. Evans and Chair Yellen, with Mr. Evans thanking Chair Yellen.


Passage number 70.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 71.
 WILLIAMS.  I had a couple of questions on the briefings.  On exhibit 1, panel 3, I really liked this work about combining the information given by the ADP and the BLS.  I think that’s really a valuable use of multiple data series to get a better reading.  And I understand the way you promoted this was to reduce some of the noise, get a cleaner read, something I absolutely agree with.  But when I looked at this chart, I also noticed something that you mentioned, but it stood out.  If you look at the underlying estimate, instead of just thinking about the month-to-month movements, think about what’s been happening over the past year or so.  It seems like this cleaner read that combines the two sources is significantly higher than the standard BLS reading.  So if I take this as being a better read on really what’s happening to employment growth and then kind of feed that through into the rest of the analysis, do you also read this as just much lower productivity growth over the past year or so in the economy than we’re seeing in the standard BLS releases, or should I probably not go there.  That’s my first question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and sharing their observations and thoughts on the topic discussed.


Passage number 72.
 MR. STEVENS.  As this is still very much a research-based series, I don’t know if I’d want to go that far.  Certainly, the direct implication would be that activity would be a little bit lower, perhaps.  But, again, this is a research-based series.  We’re still trying to understand the data.  A lot of effort has been made to try to make sure we’re making something as close—that’s as comparable to measuring what we’re trying to measure as we can.  But we’re still learning. And the other thing to keep in mind is that this is not a fully benchmarked BLS series.  So as the benchmark revisions come out, it could push things up closer to the ADP series, at least a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of the research-based series they are discussing. They mention that there is still a lot to learn, and they also point out that the series is not fully benchmarked, which means there may be future revisions that could affect the comparison to the ADP series. However, there is no explicit disagreement or contention expressed.


Passage number 73.
  MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 74.
 WILLIAMS.  I just think that’s an interesting question to think about, as we get more confidence in this series, which seems to me a better way to think about this.  You know, what are the other implications of this, along lines similar to how we talked about GDP and GDI over recent years.  So this is great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 75.
  My second question really is— MR. WILCOX.  Could I just hop in for a second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It seems to be a polite interruption or request for permission to speak.


Passage number 76.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 77.
 WILLIAMS. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The answer is yes because "WILLIAMS" implies that there is someone named Williams who holds a different point of view or has a contrasting opinion.


Passage number 78.
 MR. WILCOX.  We’ve been trying to, exactly as you suggest, build up our confidence in this.  We’ve been working on it for a couple of years, so I don’t think we’ve been particularly fast out of the gate on it.  However, an awful lot of effort has gone into it.  Over the past couple of years, exactly as you observed—help my memory—the ADP series has been increasing by about an average of, I think, about 65,000 per month faster.  We don’t really know what to make of that.  One possibility is that there’s just a heterogeneity.  BLS has a scientifically constructed, probability-weighted sample.  ADP does not.  There could be inherently some unobserved heterogeneity among firms that are randomly selected into the BLS sample versus those that make the overt choice to become clients of ADP.  It is the case that ADP services, roughly speaking, the same amount of employment as the BLS. Now, we’re going to need to get this peer reviewed.  We are a long way from putting it forward to you as the basis for a policy decision, but we thought things were far enough along that it seemed worth putting on the table for you to give it a little bit of a sniff test.  We want to let you know we’re running this one around the block and trying to stress test it in the real-time laboratory.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is primarily providing information and explaining the work that has been done on a particular topic.


Passage number 79.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage without having access to the actual passage. Please provide the passage in question for a more accurate answer.


Passage number 80.
 WILLIAMS.  That’s great.  So my second question was actually a follow-up to President Evans’s question about the fiscal policy assumptions, in panel 3 of exhibit 2.  And I  was curious—and I may have just missed this, I thought the memos were terrific, really helpful for us, but—for these estimates, I’m really focused, like President Evans, on the supply side, on potential GDP.  So these refer to the cumulative effect as of the end of 2020.  If you rolled that out further and thought about where they would be in kind of the 2025 range or longer-term range, what’s your view, if you have one, on the level effect on potential output in particular.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 81.
 MR. STEVENS.  I think we’re getting up closer to eight-, nine-tenths.  In particular, the capital effect drags out because we assume there are adjustment costs that make it take a while for the full effect on capital to show through.  And so, when you get further out, the effect would be somewhat larger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Stevens is simply providing additional information and explaining a concept.


Passage number 82.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not mention any differing opinions or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 83.
 WILLIAMS.  I’m just trying to make sure I’ve got my facts straight.  Would it be consistent with that if I were to average over, adding one-tenth to my view of potential GDP growth per year in the medium term.  And not in the long, long run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification and suggesting a potential adjustment to their view of potential GDP growth.


Passage number 84.
   MR. WILCOX.  I think that’s right, and yet we chose not to mark up our long-term estimate of normal GDP growth, partly because implicit in our assessment is an assumption that there will need to be some way to finance the tax cut.  And what we have is that, starting after five years, unspecified deficit reduction actions are taken to raise revenue to stabilize the deficit at a sustainable level.  Now, there will be a permanent bump to the debt-to-GDP ratio, but the deficit comes back to a sustainable level.  Eric, do you want to add anything to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 85.
 MR. ENGEN.  No, that’s about right, in the sense that we have offsetting policy actions that will bring it back to a sustainable level.  We haven’t specified what those actions are, and you could imagine them going different ways depending on, say, what taxes are raised, what spending is cut—say, prospective spending that could still go through, for example.  So we haven’t taken a specific stand on that.  Also, if you think about it, we have a specific start of this  re-stabilization.  How long that would actually take—the longer it took, the higher would be the level of debt, and, all else being equal, that would tend to put some upward pressure on interest rates as well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining that there are policy actions in place to bring the debt back to a sustainable level, but the specific actions and timeline have not been determined.


Passage number 86.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 87.
 WILLIAMS.  That’s very helpful.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 88.
  President Kashkari, did you have a— MR. KASHKARI.  Yes, okay.  Thank you.  I have two quick questions—one on today’s presentation, and one on the Tealbook.  On today’s economic and financial situation briefing, on exhibit 4, the bottom right, I’m trying to understand—there’s panel 7, “AFE Core Consumer Prices,” that shows a pretty aggressive forecast, but then on the next page, page 5, it shows trend core inflation for these advanced foreign economies.  How do those two connect to each other.  Do I look at the trend core inflation—if I just try to aggregate them, it seems like it’s pretty low, and yet on the previous chart you see pretty aggressive increases in core consumer prices.  I’m just curious.  How are those two related.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 89.
 MR. AHMED.  Yes.  So this trend reported in the table is computed from a statistical model, so it’s not forward looking.  It’s looking basically at the recent data before us, and it can vary over time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents information without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 90.
  It’s not like a trend that stays constant, and it used to be—if you go back long enough for several of these countries—above 2 percent, and lately it has been— MR. KASHKARI.  But do you think, intuitively, it moves around quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a discussion of a factual observation about the fluctuation of an unspecified variable in countries over time. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 91.
 MR. AHMED.  No, it’s still moving.  It doesn’t move that quickly, but the thing is—so, our forecast is kind of—first of all, there’s a lot of uncertainty in it, and the outcome could, you know, be lower, but it is based on this continual monetary accommodation, even in the face of the output gap closing.  And I am hopeful that—I actually think that those survey expectations are pretty flat and that they do not really represent the true expectation.  And so that monetary  accommodation is going to push up those expectations.  How fast is uncertain, and this is kind of our baseline.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker starts by stating that the forecast is based on continual monetary accommodation, even as the output gap closes. However, they then express hope that the survey expectations do not truly represent the true expectations, suggesting a difference in opinion about the accuracy of the survey.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 92.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you.  Second question.  In the Tealbook there was a box, which I really appreciated, on the inverted yield curve in the staff baseline forecast and why it shouldn’t be so concerning.  And it doesn’t forecast recession even though, as we discussed last time, for four years we would’ve been inverting the yield curve.  So I’m skeptical that we wouldn’t not trigger a recession in that scenario.  But I would also note that some of the arguments some folks around the table are making on why we should be raising rates now refer to the case in which the Phillips curve steepens all of a sudden.  But I would note, even in the alternative scenario in which the Phillips curve steepens all of a sudden, we also don’t trigger a recession.  And so I’m wondering how much confidence should we have in either of those situations, that neither an inverted yield curve for four years would cause a recession nor would responding to a steeper Phillips curve cause a recession.  My gut tells me that, probably, in both scenarios, it would trigger a recession.  And the question is, do we trigger the recession in advance or do we trigger the recession in reaction.  I’m just curious how the staff would respond to that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker (Mr. Kashkari) expresses skepticism and disagreement with the staff's views on the inverted yield curve and the potential impact of the Phillips curve steepening. He believes that both scenarios could trigger a recession and questions whether it is better to trigger the recession in advance or in reaction.


Passage number 93.
 MR. STEVENS.  I think our assumption is that it does not trigger a recession, but that it certainly increases the risk of a recession, taking into account where rates are and where the term premium is.  So an adverse shock would be more likely to tip us into a recession than is the case now, but we still don’t think there’s a causality there between the yield curve and a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker presents an assumption and acknowledges the increased risk of a recession but maintains that there is no direct causality between the yield curve and a recession.


Passage number 94.
 MR. KASHKARI.  And how about in the alternative scenario with the steeper Phillips curve.  I mean, that also—GDP growth gets down to 1 percent, which doesn’t seem like a terrible outcome.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kashkari is simply presenting a hypothetical scenario and expressing his viewpoint.


Passage number 95.
  MR. STEVENS.  I don’t think I’ve looked at what the yield curve looks like in that situation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion about not having looked at the yield curve in a specific situation.


Passage number 96.
 MR. KASHKARI.  Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 97.
 MR. WILCOX.  There is an aspect of our simulations that is what it is.  The models that we use to generate those simulations are well-behaved, nice linear models.  They don’t have any special dynamics that take over when the economy is close to what is sometimes referred to as “stall speed.”  Dan Sichel, among many others, has studied the fact that dynamics seem to differ around recessions in ways that don’t comport comfortably with tidy linear models that have nice Gaussian errors.  And that’s not taken into account in the baseline projection.  In the baseline projection, we’re employing a linear structure that presumes that smooth adjustment is possible. I think that, as John highlighted, you’re definitely skirting closer to conditions that would be consistent with a recession, and so a smaller shock would be sufficient to tip you into—if those nonlinear dynamics exist, a smaller shock would get you there, into that downward spiral that seems to characterize typical postwar recessions in the United States.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Wilcox, argues that the current models used to generate simulations are "well-behaved, nice linear models" that do not incorporate the dynamics observed around recessions. On the other hand, Dan Sichel and others have studied the fact that dynamics during recessions do not align comfortably with linear models. This difference in perspective shows a disagreement on the effectiveness and accuracy of the current models in predicting and understanding recessions.


Passage number 98.
 MR. KASHKARI.  May I ask one follow-up. CHAIR YELLEN.  Of course.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kashkari politely asks if he can ask a follow-up question, and Chair Yellen responds with "Of course," indicating agreement.


Passage number 99.
 MR. KASHKARI.  If I’m not mistaken, in 2015, the Tealbook was estimating around a 5 percent chance of recession in the next year or so.  And I think that’s up to 15 percent now.  Is that a marginal difference, in your opinion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 100.
 MR. STEVENS.  I don’t remember the 2015 Tealbook, but I don’t think the 15 percent—my recollection is, we’ve been around 13 percent or 14 percent for quite a while.  I don’t consider that, personally, particularly high.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 101.
 MR. EVANS.  It’s the unconditional probability.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "It's the unconditional probability" does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the probability being unconditional.


Passage number 102.
  MR. WILCOX.  I think the unconditional probability of recession is probably 15 percent or 20 percent, something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement evident in this passage. It is a statement of the individual's personal opinion or estimation about the probability of recession.


Passage number 103.
 MR. EVANS.  So 5 percent is low.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement made by Mr. Evans is expressing his opinion on the percentage being low.


Passage number 104.
 MR BULLARD.  David Wilcox, would a simple summary be that recessions in the model are caused by shocks.  You’re never going to get a recession unless there’s a shock, and the internal dynamics of the model never cause a recession.  So even if the yield curve is inverted, that doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a recession, unless there’s an appropriate shock that causes the recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The speaker is providing a summary of the model's perspective on the cause of recessions, stating that recessions are only triggered by shocks and not by internal dynamics. The mention of the yield curve being inverted is used as an example to emphasize that it alone does not indicate a recession unless there is an accompanying appropriate shock.


Passage number 105.
 MR. WILCOX.  Yes, broadly, I agree with that.  I guess I’d say, in these kinds of models—at the risk of confusing the conversation, I’m going to refer to the FRB/US model, even though FRB/US isn’t literally the source of the baseline projection—in a model like FRB/US, recessions are characterized by large negative shocks that are correlated across sectors.  So bad things have to happen in multiple sectors simultaneously, and then the other dimension is that those shocks are negatively correlated for a longer period of time.  By the way, that was the motivation for why we modified the methodology that we used to calculate the confidence intervals that we generate—so that we no longer are generating confidence intervals on the recession by doing random draws on nicely behaved error terms. So you’re correct.  In our projection, recessions are going to be caused by large negative shocks that will be correlated over time.  So there will be a succession for a few quarters of a negative shock.  And in the baseline projection, the nature of how things work is that because those shocks are absent, policymakers are able to nudge the economy gently toward the dual-mandate values.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 106.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you.  CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 107.
 MR. KAPLAN.  I’ll just make one comment, reacting to this simulation and the inverted yield curve.  Even though that’s what your analysis shows, I guess that won’t change that, as we’re removing accommodation, if we get into a situation around the table here—that you’re forecasting we will or saying we will, which probably is true—that we actually have an inverted yield curve, I assume we’re going to have a—we’ll all reserve the right to have a healthy debate as to whether we want to let that happen.  I certainly will be one that will be initiating a healthy debate at the time as to whether that’s the right thing, even though I understand that your analysis shows that we can have an inverted yield curve without causing a recession.  That doesn’t mean we won’t.  I’m just calling out that I’ll probably be one of the ones around the table who will say, “Let’s have a very intense debate about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kaplan expresses his intention to initiate a healthy debate and suggests that he might not agree with the analysis that an inverted yield curve can happen without causing a recession. Therefore, there is a disagreement regarding whether allowing an inverted yield curve is the right thing to do.


Passage number 108.
” MR. WILCOX.  There will be a huge amount of uncertainty about that.  That will be a very good conversation to have.  In the framework of our projection, the reason why you get an inverted yield curve is, that’s what you need to do in order to slow the economy and nurse the unemployment rate back up to its assumed long-run sustainable level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not exhibit any contention or disagreement. It simply presents Mr. Wilcox's opinion on the topic being discussed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 109.
 MR. KAPLAN.  And I guess one of the reasons I can imagine we’ll have the debate is, what does it mean that the 10-year Treasury rate is at whatever level it is, such that it won’t budge even though we think the economy is overheated.  Why isn’t the 10-year rate sort of consistent with that.  And that probably will be a source of a lot of discussion. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Harker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage mentions that there will likely be a debate and discussion about why the 10-year Treasury rate is not consistent with the perception that the economy is overheated. This indicates that there is likely contention or disagreement regarding the relationship between the 10-year rate and the state of the economy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 110.
 MR. HARKER.  Just a quick question, back to the tax legislation.  I’m curious if you’ve done any sensitivity analysis on the point that President Evans brought up before on the state contingency.  I’m more worried about the business fixed investment, and I say that because,  anecdotally, survey work—there’s no large firm in America, I believe, that’s saying, “We’re not investing because of the cost of capital.” Now, there may be an issue about deductibility and related matters, right, and the expensing of capital, and it may be that small and medium-sized enterprises have some constraint.  But I don’t hear anybody right now saying they’re not investing because capital is too expensive.  And so it raises the issue of the elasticity that’s assumed and whether you’ve done any sensitivity analysis on that, because that drives, I would imagine, a fair amount of this growth.  And what we’re assuming, and what I’ve seen in multiple models—our model, the Kent Smetters model at University of Pennsylvania, and so forth—it doesn’t jibe with what you’re hearing from executives in terms of their decisionmaking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Harker expresses his concerns and raises questions about the assumptions and analysis related to the impact of tax legislation on business fixed investment. He highlights his anecdotal experience, survey work, and models that do not align with the assumptions being made. This indicates a disagreement or contention between Mr. Harker's perspective and the assumptions being made.


Passage number 111.
 MR. STEVENS.  So maybe one way to sort of bound the question would be to just take out the business fixed investment piece.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a suggestion to remove a specific component of a question in order to narrow its scope.


Passage number 112.
 MR. HARKER.  Yes.  So what happens then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is a simple response to a question, without any opposing views or conflicting opinions being expressed.


Passage number 113.
 MR. STEVENS.  If you do that over 20—basically you’re taking two-thirds of the fiscal impetus piece and moving it out of the multiplier in the financial reaction.  So, roughly speaking, maybe one-fourth to one-third of 1 percentage point off of that top-line number that we see would be my guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a speculative estimate from Mr. Stevens without any conflicting views.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 114.
 MR. HARKER.  I’m just skeptical about that argument.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The use of the word "skeptical" suggests that there is some level of disagreement or doubt about the argument being discussed.


Passage number 115.
 MR. WILCOX.  I think your skepticism is fair.  I would hasten to point out what probably doesn’t need to be articulated, which is the vast uncertainty that surrounds all of these estimates.  These numbers are really small that we’re positing as the potential effects.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Wilcox acknowledging the fair skepticism and emphasizing the uncertainty surrounding the estimates.


Passage number 116.
  I guess I find it plausible that while it might be difficult to identify a business executive in a survey who will confess that, with a yet greater financial incentive to invest in capital, I find it plausible that  there would be some executives at some corporations in the country who would, at the margin, invest a little more, and— MR. HARKER.  But the change in deductibility will have a larger effect, I believe.  Right.  I mean, that will have a much larger effect, because that’s immediate, right.  Assuming you don’t do what you did before, which was make it retroactive—which meant assuming that we’re going to affect people’s behavior months ago.  That was not a very good idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It primarily consists of two individuals expressing their opinions and discussing the potential effects of certain changes in policy.


Passage number 117.
 MR. WILCOX.  It’s a small effect.  We’re doing our level best to come at it with a degree of analytical rigor and be able to explain to you what we did and why we did it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wilcox is simply stating that they are making an effort to approach the situation with analytical rigor and provide an explanation for their actions.


Passage number 118.
 MR. HARKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

This passage does not present any contention or disagreement as it only provides the name "MR. HARKER" without any additional information or context.


Passage number 119.
  No, I appreciate the answer, it helps us in thinking out— MR. WILCOX.  There’s no pretense here of knowing what the effect will be with any precision.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses gratitude for the answer given, indicating agreement and satisfaction with the response.


Passage number 120.
 MR. STEVENS.  One thing I’d add is that another channel we haven’t written out an assumption regarding is, to the extent that this improves international competitiveness, we don’t know anything about what firms that are trying to decide where to locate operations, if this will tip the balance for locating domestically or not. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  If there are no more questions, I suggest we begin the round and have a few presentations.  Do you want to take a break.  [No response]  Okay.  Let’s have a couple of people start off, and then we’ll take a coffee break.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion between Mr. Stevens and Chair Yellen where Mr. Stevens raises a point and Chair Yellen responds with a suggestion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 121.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  With the unemployment rate currently at 4.1 percent and real GDP growth for the past three quarters of this year likely to exceed my estimate of potential growth of 1¾ percent by more than 1 percentage point, combined with the likelihood that real GDP growth will continue to exceed potential growth for several quarters due  to fiscal stimulus, I now expect the unemployment rate to fall 1 full percentage point below my estimate of the sustainable unemployment rate. On the monetary policy side, the modest reductions in the balance sheet and the increases to date in the federal funds rate have not led to a tightening of overall financial conditions.  The 10-year Treasury rate has fluctuated in a narrow range—low 2.4 percent, credit spreads have narrowed relative to still-low Treasury rates, and the stock market has continued its upward drive.  Thus, our tightening to date appears to have been offset by other factors that have provided unexpected stimulus.  In particular, a tax cut that is primarily focused on reducing corporate taxes has been perceived as potentially increasing after-tax earnings, which justifies the already-high P/E ratios and reduces the risk of credit problems as after-tax profitability increases. As the probability of tax cuts for corporations rises, financial conditions have eased further.  Such easing of financial conditions at this stage of the business cycle can result in an undesirable amount of additional stimulus.  The various models we run show that, in theory, we can return gradually to a more sustainable unemployment rate.  I am quite skeptical that we can engineer a full percentage point increase in the unemployment rate without causing a recession that results in much more significant costs to the economy. In the event of a recession, our tools would be dangerously limited.  With interest rates low and fiscal policy spent, we have little ammunition in reserve to fight a recession and could be faced with large misses on both elements of our mandate, as well as another prolonged period of low interest rates and all of the risks such an episode entails.  In addition, as the unemployment rate eventually rises and the economy slows down, I expect that problems  associated with financial excesses that are often a side effect of very low interest rates will become more apparent. One example of how a low interest rate policy encourages more risk-taking can be found in the leveraged loan market.  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston have obtained a new data set developed by a fintech company that specializes in contract covenant visualization.  Our guidance on leveraged lending was intended to discourage very highly levered loans—for example, ones that had debt in excess of six times earnings.  The contracts have sidestepped that guidance by constraining initial underwriting to below six times earnings over the ability to raise the leverage after origination by making use of the covenant exceptions embedded in the contract.  This type of regulatory arbitrage highlights why addressing the side effects on financial stability of a low interest rate environment may be difficult to offset with only regulatory changes. While keeping rates low for long periods may induce financial stability concerns that we should continue to monitor, a major argument for removing monetary policy gradually is the uncertainty about whether inflation can pick up from its lower-than-expected readings over the past year.  This concern is understandable.  But I believe that, for several reasons, such concern is now moderating. First, the annualized core PCE inflation rate over the past three months has been 1.9 percent, a rate substantially above the average over the past year.  While the 3-month rate is, of course, quite volatile, we know that the 12-month rate of inflation was distorted by what looks to be temporary relative price changes earlier this year. Second, while a number of wage and compensation measures have been rising gradually over the past several years, the employer costs for employee compensation—a series derived  from the ECI source data that allows employment weights to change over time—has risen more rapidly.  This series is based on a firm-level survey and may be thought of as reflecting the wage bill rather than a wage rate and, consequently, may be a better measure of the actual labor cost borne by firms.  Of course, if increases to the overall wage bill were accompanied by a significant rise in productivity—perhaps because employers were hiring more productive workers on the margin—this labor cost increase would be of less concern.  But the aggregate productivity data suggest that that has not been the case, and, as a result, I expect that these increases will eventually translate into higher prices. Third, if the unemployment rate falls as low as the 3.3 percent revised Tealbook forecast inclusive of the tax changes, it seems very likely that wages will begin to grow even faster.  Federal Reserve Bank of Boston staff research suggests that the Phillips curve may become steeper as the unemployment gap turns that negative. In light of the financial stability risks posed by maintaining low interest rates, the increasing tightness in the labor market, and the initial evidence that inflation is firming, my assessment of appropriate policy entails five ¼ point change increases over the course of 2018.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Rosengren expresses skepticism about being able to engineer a full percentage point increase in the unemployment rate without causing a recession, while also expressing concerns about the limited tools available to fight a recession. He also highlights problems associated with financial excesses that may become more apparent as the economy slows down. This contrasts with other arguments in the passage that suggest removing monetary policy gradually and express a more optimistic view about the prospects of inflation picking up and wages growing faster.

Passage number 137.
 MR. BOSTIC.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  It seems apparent that this will be the best year for real GDP growth since 2014.  Our directors and business contacts continue to report a solid pace of activity and are generally optimistic about the year ahead.  Although the sentiment that labor markets are tight and wage pressures are imminent persists, I hear few reports that an actual acceleration of wage growth is occurring.  If there is any significant pressure on prices, we aren’t hearing about it. Consistent with the early data on sales, our retail contacts report that holiday season activity has been strong.  This extends to the brick-and-mortar part of the market, though it is worth noting that, in that segment, “flat is the new up.”  I did receive a caution from several of our contacts that last year’s holiday sales got off to a fast start as well, only to stall in the final two weeks before Christmas.  The view seems to be that the growing influence of cybershopping has affected the timing of the typical consumer’s spending, making early returns somewhat harder to read. Much like everyone else, our focus this cycle was on attempting to dig into the details of the pending tax changes to get a deeper understanding of what they imply for the outlook.  Since the previous FOMC meeting, we have had two surveys in the field—our Business Inflation Expectations survey of businesses in the Sixth District and a decisionmaker survey, which is a joint national survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Stanford University, and the University of Chicago.  In both of these surveys, we asked firms how the proposed tax reform would affect their capital expenditure plans for 2018.  In the Business Inflation Expectations, or BIE, survey, we also asked how tax reform would affect hiring plans.  On business investment, roughly two-thirds of respondents to our national survey, which was in the  field after the House bill had been passed, indicated that the reform wouldn’t affect their capital expenditures at all.  Just 15 percent said that they would increase their capital spending by 10 percent or more, and those responses disproportionately came from smaller firms. Similarly, in the responses to the hiring question in our BIE survey, the majority of firms indicated that tax reform would not change their plans.  Here, too, positive responses were skewed in the direction of smaller firms.  In the case of those businesses with more than 100 employees, almost 70 percent indicated that there would be no change in their hiring plans as a result of tax reform being passed. The results of these surveys were reiterated in our in-person interviews with a diverse set of business leaders across the District and by our Atlanta and Branch office directors.  Contacts generally indicated that cash repatriation and increased profits due to a reduced tax burden would likely go toward increasing cash balances or be spent on debt reduction or stock buybacks.  Even among those who indicated that there would be some stimulative effect, many noted that the proposed tax changes would only serve to accelerate, not expand, the current plans.  These findings are consistent with the comments earlier by President Harker, and I was wondering if you were looking at my notes.  [Laughter] As a result of this input, I am only marking in a modest boost to my projection’s near-term real GDP growth profile.  I recognize that the larger real GDP effect in the staff’s analysis comes in part from the labor supply response associated with individual tax provisions.  I’m not quite ready to take that kind of response on board.  As an example of why I’m reluctant, I would cite the fact that, among individuals who earn incomes under $40,000, whose labor supply response to a tax cut I would expect to be the strongest, the CBO and Joint Committee on  Taxation simulations suggest that there will actually be increasing tax burdens over time.  For now, I am treating a breakout of tax-reform-related growth as an upside risk to my outlook. I should note that this modest near-term bump due to tax reform is in the context of a small downward revision in my projection of longer-run growth.  My new projection is in line with the staff’s longer-run growth projection.  But, as I noted, I am not taking on board the staff’s near-term rise in potential.  That said, I have also marked down my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment since our previous submission round.  This judgment is, in part, pragmatic, reflecting the dearth of wage and price pressures amid already high labor utilization rates.  The other part owes to a reassessment of the effect of the demographic and technological changes on the labor market that appear to have lowered frictional unemployment. I have been somewhat encouraged that the past couple of inflation data reports have come in a bit stronger than what we saw earlier this year.  My modal expectation is still that inflation will converge to target by the end of next year.  But, as I said last time, that is an article of faith.  I will have more to say about this in tomorrow’s policy round.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and expressing their own analysis and projections.


Passage number 138.
 MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Over the intermeeting period, the Third District continued to grow at a modest pace, with that growth being rather broadly based.  The labor market remains healthy, consumers and firms continue to be optimistic, and only our housing sector appears to lack any steam. Employment growth has slowed a bit, and the region’s unemployment rate remains at 4.8 percent.  However, initial claims are trending down, and firms indicate that it is increasingly difficult to find workers.  Employment growth continues to be robust in mining and construction, eds and meds, and leisure and hospitality.  Warehousing and storage is interesting.  While it’s still small, it’s a growing share of employment, displaying 14 percent growth over the past year.  Its share of employment in Pennsylvania, at 1.6 percent, ranks highest in the nation. In a special Beige Book survey, 59 percent of the firms reported that they will be increasing employment over the next 12 months, while only 9 percent indicated they would be decreasing employment.  And 58 percent indicated that there was a lack of qualified applicants, and 46 percent are raising wages for selected categories of jobs.  However, only 19 percent are raising wages more broadly. Manufacturing in our region continues to grow at a more rapid pace than its nonrecessionary average, and the employment subindex in our survey came in with a record high in November.  As well, unfilled orders and delivery times are near historic highs, no doubt in part because of hurricane-related bottlenecks.  Manufacturers remain upbeat, with planned capital spending near record highs, and, surprisingly, this planned activity appears not to be related to expected tax relief, consistent with what President Bostic just said, and I did not look at his notes.  [Laughter] Planned commercial construction activity is off the charts for our District.  The combination of the ethane cracking facility in northwest Pennsylvania that I mentioned at our previous meeting and the Atlantic Sunrise expansion natural gas pipeline in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, will add over $8 billion in planned construction activity within the next five years.  Now, to put that in perspective, that’s like building eight new Major League Baseball stadiums or one Texas high school football stadium.  [Laughter]  Sorry, Rob. Services are also growing, although not as robustly, but the employment index in our survey has rebounded as well.  The only significant weakness in the region is that, other than in  Philadelphia, housing construction remains flat, and house prices are only growing at half the national rate. In our recent survey of firms’ inflation expectations, respondents expected inflation of all goods over the next year to rise by 2 percent and expect the price of their own products to increase by just a bit more.  In general, nonmanufacturers had higher inflation expectations than manufacturers.  Firms also anticipate modest wage growth of around 3 percent over the next year. Now, for the national economy, the overall contour of my forecast is not too different from that of the staff, with the exception that I do not see the unemployment rate drifting quite so low.  I anticipate unemployment bottoming out at around 3.8 percent next year, then gradually rising to 4.1 percent by the end of the forecast horizon.  And I factored in roughly 0.3 percent added growth arising from fiscal stimulus over the next two years, yielding 2.4 percent growth next year and 2.2 percent in 2019. I project both core and headline inflation rising to 1.8 percent in 2018 and then moving slightly above target at 2.2 percent in 2019 before returning to 2 percent in 2020.  But my concern with my inflation projection remains elevated.  We have seen a bit of strengthening in the inflation numbers over the past three months, but I am still in a “wait-and-see” mode.  The low r* environment continues to give me concerns over our ability to hit our inflation target on average, and that feature significantly informs my policy position.  I’ll return to that observation in my comments tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.

Passage number 139.
 MR. QUARLES.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The economy continues to perform well.  Growth in the second half has shown a solid pickup.  The reports received from the various Districts that have reported so far have obviously, anecdotally, been even stronger than the numbers would show.  The labor market remains strong.  Unemployment in October and November has been running close to its low at the beginning of this millennium.  With all of the  caveats that the staff had regarding their experimental job growth series, nonetheless, that is evidence that job growth may even have been somewhat higher.  And if we hadn’t had some stabilization in the labor participation rate over the past period, the unemployment rate would be even lower than we are currently seeing. Recent data on inflation have turned out to be a touch stronger than expected—still lower than we would want, but the recent data are consistent with my view that it is too early to give up on our established framework for understanding inflation.  I’d characterize recent weakness as a surprise that should be expected to fade, rather than a mystery that necessitates a complete reexamination of macroeconomics.  [Laughter] I think that growth will remain relatively strong next year, in part supported by the tax package that’s working its way through the Congress.  That should provide a boost to real GDP growth both in the near term, by pushing up aggregate demand, and in the longer run, as increased investment and higher labor force participation will contribute to stronger potential GDP growth.  But as more workers are drawn into or remain in the labor force, I’d expect the tax cuts to have only a small effect on the unemployment rate and, with the expected increase in the productive capacity of the economy, only a muted effect on inflation.  Although, in particular, I think the effect of the tax cuts on capital expenditure could be a bit more pronounced than I think some others are expecting, on the basis of the comments that we’ve heard so far.  Investment has been fairly robust this year, but we are coming out of an extended period of particularly sluggish investment demand.  So there may be a bit more room for growth along this dimension than the staff analysis suggests. I want to flag—not because I necessarily disagree, but just because I want to flag what the staff projects—that I do think there’s a very high level of uncertainty about what the  consequences of the change in the bill in the pass-through tax rate are going to be.  We have very little experience with extremely significant tax reform packages, but we have virtually no experience with changing the pass-through rate. I think that the structure of business has changed more than people are aware of as—legally, what is done through corporations versus what is done through pass-throughs.  There has been a significant change, particularly over the course of the past 15 years, in how significant parts of the economy are legally structured.  The ability to change your structure, if that changes, is particularly strong.  So I think the potential for both unexpected magnitude of predicted effects and unexpected effects coming from the change in the pass-through rate are particularly strong. The box in the Tealbook on the inversion of the yield curve in the staff forecast provides an extremely coherent explanation of why the staff forecasts an inverted yield curve.  But it still left—for me, at least—unanswered questions about the consequences of the inversion on the forecast.  Those are as important to me as they are for Presidents Kaplan and Bullard, and I don’t know whether that’s because in the staff’s framework, the slope of the yield curve has no implications for the forecast.  In my view, you know, if we’re predicting that the yield curve will remain inverted until my daughter in middle school has almost graduated from college, that would have very negative effects on bank profitability. And has the staff incorporated any effect of that hit to the profitability of the financial sector into their assessment of the outlook, or even in relation to financial stability.  More generally, I would argue that in formulating monetary policy and the economic forecasts that support that policy, it is important that we take account of the role that the financial sector plays in transmitting our actions to the broader economy.  And six years of an inverted yield curve would have, I think, a significant consequence for the transmission mechanism that I’m not  certain has really been factored into the outlook of the staff.  And that thought is independent of how much weight you put on the staff forecast of an inverted yield curve, which I would simply note, in closing, is importantly premised on a federal funds rate path that is far steeper than is actually projected in the SEP. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.

Passage number 140.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Our District contacts remain optimistic, expecting hiring to strengthen in the coming months across most job categories.  Reports also point to firms increasingly raising wages to attract entry-level workers, then facing pressure to raise wages for other staff.  District manufacturing activity continues to show expansion, and the region’s exports increased significantly this year, driven by demand for ag products.  Activity in the service sector also remains solid, and District housing market indicators are steady.  With the recent increase in oil prices, we’ve seen more drilling activity and improved optimism among businesses connected to the energy sector. The District’s ag sector, however, continues to face challenges due to weak farm incomes and low commodity prices.  Since our previous meeting, our contacts are reporting growing concern about the prospects for renegotiation of trade agreements, as exports make up a large share of total farm income.  In particular, Canada and Mexico appear to be exploring stronger bilateral trade agreements with other countries, including some that would represent increased competition for U.S. ag exports. With respect to the national economy, I made some modest adjustments to my outlook for the economy to take on board, for the first time, the implications of fiscal policy.  While some uncertainty remains about the underlying details of the potential tax changes, it does seem likely that we will see changes affecting household and business taxes.  As a result, my forecast  reflects these effects, with modest increases in output growth, slight declines in the unemployment rate over the next three years, and only a negligible effect on inflation. With the economy projected to grow at an above-trend rate over the next three years and further modest declines in the unemployment rate compared with my previous SEP, I expect growth to moderate back to its trend rate in 2021 and for the unemployment rate to bottom out at about 3.8 percent.  In light of this stronger outlook for the real economy, I’ve kept four rate increases for next year and penciled in an additional increase in 2019. Data released during the intermeeting period continue to suggest that the economy is growing at a healthy above-trend rate.  The disruptions in employment growth following the hurricanes have been smaller than expected, and, importantly, the most recent reading on third-quarter GDP suggests robust spending by businesses on new equipment.  Labor market indicators show few signs of remaining slack.  The unemployment rate is lower than any time during the previous expansion, and broader measures of slack, such as the percentage of prime-age workers who want a job but are not in the labor force, are near their pre-recession levels.  High levels of consumer confidence and continued modest wage gains should continue to support household spending in the period ahead. Across all income groups, the University of Michigan consumer confidence measure is either at or above its pre-recession level.  In addition, expected wage growth continues to rise for all income groups.  Although these expectations of future income increases remain somewhat modest, I find them consistent with slow growth in labor productivity. Inflation, of course, remains low and stable, with more recent readings moving up.  Over the past three months, core PCE inflation has risen at an annualized rate of 1.9 percent, supported by housing services inflation, which has trended higher to an annualized rate of about 3½ percent  over the past six months.  And nonpetroleum import prices, which tend to lead changes in core goods prices, have started to rise over the past year. My staff looked at the effects of the weak inflation readings earlier this year on longer-term inflation expectations.  Using the most recent data issued by the Survey of Professional Forecasters, they found that most forecasters did revise down their core PCE inflation forecast for 2018, suggesting that they expected that weaker inflation readings could persist.  Yet despite this downward revision for next year, these same forecasters have not, on average, measurably lowered their five-year, five-year-forward inflation forecast.  Specifically, my staff found no significant statistical relationship between changes in the forecasters’ 2018 inflation forecast and changes in their five-year, five-year-forward forecast.  This finding gives me some comfort that longer-term inflation expectations look to have remained anchored despite weaker-than-expected inflation readings earlier this year. Finally, I, like others, appreciated the Tealbook box on the implications of a flattening yield curve.  Recent research by my staff suggests two additional factors to those highlighted in the Tealbook.  One is related to the gradual approach to policy normalization, and the other is related to the introduction of a policy rate path in the SEP.  While our statements have provided transparency about expected future policy actions, my staff’s analysis shows that the communication has tended to lower term premiums in longer-term bond yields.  Likewise, the introduction of the federal funds rate forecast in the SEP coincided with a significant decline in uncertainty about future policy rates. Currently, the market-implied uncertainty for one-year-ahead policy rates is about half the average level seen during the 2004–07 tightening cycle, which, according to my staff’s research, would imply much lower term premiums.  It’s also likely that a large balance sheet  continues to put downward pressure on long-term interest rates.  If, however, long-term rates remain unresponsive to further increases in the funds rate, we will certainly need to evaluate our policy rate path and perhaps also our balance sheet normalization strategy, considering the implications of an inverted yield curve for financial conditions and intermediation.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Acting President Mullinix.

Passage number 141.
 MR. MULLINIX.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’d like to begin by thanking the staff for their helpful memos on tax cut effects and the updated Tealbook forecast.  Now, I acknowledge the difficulty that comes with estimating such effects, but nonetheless, I agree with the staff that the growth effects are likely to be small and temporary.  In fact, in our submission, the projected effects of the tax cut are smaller than in the updated Tealbook forecast. Our view is that real GDP growth will be higher by 0.1 percent in each year from 2018 through 2020.  In addition, I think it fair to be concerned about risks to the medium- to longer-term outlook arising from the higher path for the stock of government debt potentially leading to materially higher long-term interest rates.  These higher rates could offset some or all of the positive supply-side effects of the tax cuts. With GDP growth above trend in our projection, labor markets should tighten further.  Information coming from our District, with unemployment running at 4 percent, is consistent with that view.  We continue to hear from businesses that qualified labor is difficult to find and that it is increasingly difficult to meet customer orders as a result.  For example, several executives in the trucking business report that labor shortages limit their ability to expand activity.  In fact, they cannot use all of their fleet.  In fact, some of their trucks sit idle because  they cannot find or retain qualified drivers despite raising their wages since 2015 by up to 30 percent. Our staffing agency contacts inform us that the problem is broader and is being experienced across a number of occupations.  After returning from an HR conference, a regional president of a national staffing firm reported that everyone was saying the same thing:  “We can’t find workers.”  The increasing difficulty of finding qualified workers also shows up in our hiring survey.  In response to this, the number of firms that are raising their starting wages, mainly for specific jobs, has increased again this year.  A notable difference to previous years’ surveys is that more firms are now reporting that they raise wages for existing employees also.  Across the board, our contacts and our staff support the need, and President Kaplan’s call, for heightened emphasis and focus on workforce development. Finally, our inflation projection is 1.9 percent next year for both headline and core inflation.  I would note that the latest reading on core inflation is consistent with the view I’ve heard from many of you that the low monthly rates of inflation we observed earlier this year are likely to prove temporary.  Accordingly, with labor markets tightening further and with fiscal stimulus kicking in, I believe that inflation is likely to rise a little more rapidly than the Tealbook expects.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kashkari.

Passage number 142.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The economy has continued to expand at an above-trend pace, with the available data pointing to growth of about 2½ percent this year.  The unemployment rate has continued to fall more rapidly than expected, and inflation has remained below the 2 percent objective.  Accommodative financial conditions have supported demand as the dollar has moved down over the course of the year, reversing some of its big move up in  2014 and ’15, and as equity prices have surged and credit spreads narrowed.  My outlook has strengthened somewhat since our previous meeting, as I will discuss. The labor market, by most indicators, suggests we are now at full employment.  Indeed, the unemployment rate is now below all of our individual assessments of the natural rate.  Surveys of business and household assessments of labor market conditions also appear consistent with an economy that is operating near full employment. A couple of measures are sending more ambiguous signals.  One is wage growth, which has remained relatively subdued although broadly in line with the pace of productivity growth.  Another is prime-age labor force participation, which remains below pre-crisis levels, a shortfall that may reflect secular as well as cyclical factors. The incoming data on inflation have tended to be disappointing this year, and I continue to concur with the staff’s assessment that transitory factors largely account for the decline in both overall and core rates, while I also realize that this is far from certain.  In this regard, I take some signal from the incoming data on prices for September and October, which do suggest that inflation may be turning up, albeit just very, very gradually. With regard to the outlook, with still-accommodative financial conditions, solid incoming data, and fiscal stimulus arriving, the economy seems poised for continued above-trend growth.  I found the staff analysis of the likely economic effects of the emerging fiscal package to be helpful, and I have included similar effects in my forecast. The current versions of the bill include tax cuts amounting to about 1 percent of GDP per year over the next several years, which should provide a moderate boost to demand.  There should also be some positive supply-side effects, although these are likely to come in more  gradually.  And, of course, there is still uncertainty regarding the final provisions of the bill and even greater uncertainty about its effects on the economy over time. But above-trend growth of real GDP should lead to a further decline in the unemployment rate.  My unemployment rate projection is between that of the median SEP path and the lower trajectory in the updated Tealbook forecast.  This further tightening of labor market conditions gives me some comfort that inflation will stabilize around our 2 percent objective over the next couple of years. I see two prominent risks to this outlook.  The first is that we might be underestimating the degree of tightness ahead in the labor market.  The second is that inflation might take longer than we anticipate to reach 2 percent on a sustained basis. On the first risk, it’s worth recalling that in five of the past six years, the unemployment rate has fallen more than the Tealbook had projected in the preceding December, with an average downside miss over the six years of 50 basis points.  Now, that’s not to say that what’s past is prologue, although it may be, but rather that these things are inherently uncertain.  And the pattern is similar for the SEP median forecasts over the period. If growth is about as projected in the SEP, this experience does suggest that the unemployment rate could again surprise to the downside, declining into the mid- or even the low 3s, like the Tealbook path.  In any case, holding all else equal, the median SEP path does implicitly embed the assumption of a meaningful uptick in labor force participation on top of the above-trend performance already assumed in the Tealbook, a similar acceleration in productivity growth, or both.  These would all be highly desirable results but are far from assured.  And so, does it matter.  You know, a significant sustained unemployment undershoot into the mid- or low 3s would have real benefits, such as better job matching, increased human  capital, and higher incomes.  But there would also be risks.  In particular, we could see an excessive buildup of inflationary pressures over time, reflecting either lags or nonlinearities in the Phillips curve.  There may be no such reaction, but I say there are risks.  And, of course, the natural rate of unemployment could be lower than current estimates, although it seems to me unlikely that it would be materially lower than 4.1 percent, today’s level of unemployment. But the labor market may not be as tight as it appears.  And, as a result, the main other risk that we face is that we may remove accommodation too quickly, potentially aggravating the persistent shortfall in inflation.  Indeed, as discussed at the past several meetings, the ongoing softness in inflation this year raises real concerns about its underlying trend.  The challenge for the foreseeable future will be to appropriately balance these two risks, as we will discuss tomorrow.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

While there may be some uncertainty and risks mentioned in the passage (such as underestimating tightness in the labor market or inflation taking longer to reach 2 percent), there is no clear contention or disagreement among the speaker and other participants in the passage. The speaker simply discusses their outlook and acknowledges the risks and uncertainties.


Passage number 143.
 MR. WILCOX.4  Sure.  We have a preliminary translation of the CPI into PCE space.  It’s just a few basis points shy of what we had been expecting.  I don’t have the detail in front of me that I normally would have later in the day, but the core CPI increased 12 basis points in November.  For what it’s worth, we’d been expecting 16 basis points.  The published number will round to one-tenth.  After translating it into the PCE price index and taking account of the PPI that we received yesterday, we estimate that the core PCE index increased 8 basis points in November relative to our expectation of 13 basis points.  The top-line PCE index increased, we estimate, 24 basis points in November, 3 basis points shy of our expectation.  On a 12-month basis, the core PCE index, we estimate, increased 1.5 percent in November.  That rounds to the same figure that we had in the Tealbook projection. I believe you all will be writing down Q4-over-Q4 numbers for 2017, and our own forecast for the core PCE index was 1.5 percent.  That remains at 1.5 percent on the basis of this morning’s news.  The topline total PCE index we had forecast for Q4 over Q4 would be at 1.7 percent, and, again, that remains unchanged in light of this morning’s release. To the extent that we can tell on a very preliminary basis, it appears to be that the downward surprise, such as there was, was in the core goods area. CHAIR YELLEN.  Any questions for David.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, let me call on Thomas to deliver the policy briefing.  4 The materials used by Mr. Wilcox are appended to this transcript (appendix 4).
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a factual report of data and forecasts.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 144.
  MR. LAUBACH.5  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will be referring to the handout labeled “Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.” At the risk of precipitating President Kaplan’s discussion about the yield spread, the focus of my briefing is going to be on that very topic.  And I guess it’s an understatement to say that several of you have remarked on the flattening of the yield curve since you began raising the federal funds rate two years ago—and especially since the beginning of this year.  The light-green line in the upper-left panel shows the behavior of the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 3-month Treasury bill since the early 1970s.  Although the spread has declined by almost 1 percentage point since the turn of the year, it is not unusually low by historical standards.  A similar spread currently stands at about the 40th percentile of its distribution since 1971, as noted in a Tealbook box, and about ½ percentage point above the average historical level associated with the onset of recessions, shown by the light-green horizontal line. That said, a number of commentators have asked what the narrowing of the yield spread might portend for the economy’s ability to withstand further removal of monetary policy accommodation.  From the perspective of the expectations hypothesis, an inverted yield curve implies that the current short-term interest rate exceeds the average level that investors expect to prevail over the next 10 years, provided term premiums are not negative.  As the shaded bars in the panel highlight, since the early 1970s, a negative term spread has always been followed by a recession. Many empirical studies have built on this regularity by using the term spread to predict recessions.  As reported in the upper-right panel, when a regression that relates the spread to the event of the economy being in recession at any point over the next four quarters is used, the current level of the term spread implies a nearly 40 percent probability of such an event.  As shown by the red line in the middle-left panel, this probability is up from about 15 percent since you began raising interest rates.  Here I am showing the probability of the economy being in recession at any time during the next four quarters; the Tealbook box reported a substantially lower probability of being in a recession four quarters from now. A substantial likelihood of a near-term recession seems at odds with ongoing robust employment gains, high levels of household and business confidence, expectations of somewhat more rapid economic growth following the anticipated passage of the tax package, and signals from stock prices and risk spreads.  One possible way of resolving these different signals is to note that the relationship between the term spread and the business cycle may have changed as term premiums have declined.  The dark-green line in the upper-left panel shows the term spread after subtracting the 10-year term premium, as estimated by the Kim-Wright model, from the 10-year yield to obtain a direct comparison between the current short-term rate and the component of the 10-year yield reflecting expected future short-term  5 The materials used by Mr. Laubach are appended to this transcript (appendix 5).  rates.  This adjusted term spread currently stands a full percentage point above the average level previously associated with the onset of recession, the dark-green horizontal line.  As shown by the blue line in the middle-left panel, when this adjusted spread replaces the raw term spread in the recession probability model, the probability of a recession over the next four quarters is currently estimated to be very low.  However, this model did not indicate as high a probability of recession in 2000 and, especially, in 2007 as the model using the unadjusted spread. Term premium estimates are quite model dependent, and the expectations component of the 10-year yield derived from a term structure model different from the Kim-Wright model might produce a higher probability.  An alternative approach is to combine the unadjusted term spread with other measures of financial conditions to assess the likelihood of near-term recession.  A memo sent to the Committee in March 2016 noted that the excess bond premium developed by Simon Gilchrist and Egon Zakrajšek, shown in the middle-right panel, is a useful indicator because it tends to rise in the periods shortly before the onset of recessions, as investors demand higher compensation for bearing credit risk.  This premium has declined notably following a spike in early 2016 and currently stands near the lower end of its historical range.  As indicated by the green dashed line in the middle-left panel, the inclusion of both the unadjusted term spread and the excess bond premium in the regression model generates a probability of recession of around 7 percent. As noted in the lower-left panel—and I’m afraid it becomes evident that I’m cribbing from Governor Brainard’s notes—recent conversations with market participants do not reveal heightened concern regarding the decline in the term spread.  Contacts attributed the compressed spread in large part to the continued low level of the 10-year yield, which in turn reflected not only a low expected longer-run value of the federal funds rate, but also a low inflation risk premium and persistent demand for duration from investors in an environment of low yields globally and low volatility.  In light of these factors, several contacts expressed the view that the slope of the yield curve might not be as effective an indicator of recession risk as in previous economic cycles. The lower-right panel turns to some key considerations for your policy decision at this meeting.  In light of most indicators pointing to continued expansion, and with payroll gains still running at a pace consistent with further tightening in the labor market, you may see the economy as having sufficient momentum that another step toward removing policy accommodation is warranted at this meeting.  Even though inflation remains low, you continue to see it approaching your objective over the next two years.  As Bob Tetlow noted in his briefing, almost all of you expect that the tax package will boost economic growth modestly in the next couple of years.  With the unemployment rate projected to decline well below your estimates of its longer-run normal level, you may see staying on a gradual path of removing policy accommodation as appropriate to balance the risks of continuing to miss your inflation objective and an overheated labor market.  Alternative B addresses both concerns by retaining the emphasis on carefully monitoring inflation developments while also conveying that, although the labor market may strengthen somewhat  further in the near term, the Committee doesn’t see a need to actively pursue an even tighter labor market.  Alternative C sends a message of greater urgency to contain further labor market tightening by stressing the need for growth in output and employment to slow to sustainable rates.  Alternative A, by contrast, expresses sufficient concern about the risk that recent low inflation readings might continue that it is implicitly willing to tolerate a larger undershoot of the unemployment rate below its longer-run level so as to forestall a decline in inflation expectations. Thank you, Madam Chair.  That concludes my prepared remarks.  The November statement and the draft alternatives are shown on pages 2 to 13 of the handout.  I will be happy to take questions. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker presents different viewpoints on the topic of the yield spread and its implications for the economy. Some commentators express concern about the narrowing of the yield spread and its potential impact on the economy, while others argue that other indicators suggest continued economic expansion.


Passage number 145.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 146.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a question.  I thought Thomas’s analysis was very interesting about the change in the term premium and how to interpret these slope-of-the-yield-curve models.  But I guess what worries me—I’m picking up on Governor Brainard’s remarks yesterday—is these comments by market participants in which they actually attribute the fact that we have a flat yield curve to a very low long-run funds rate, or r*, and low global yields.  Of course, those are two reasons why we have to be more worried, I think, about our ability to manage recessions or the possibility that a shock would actually put us into recession.  So when I read the reasons for this, it actually makes me a little bit more worried about how to read a flat yield curve.  I guess my “takeaway” from this is that I agree that the fact that the term premium has shifted, partly because of quantitative easing in the United States and abroad, tells us that maybe these standard historical relationships have shifted.  I’m not as, maybe, encouraged by this 2 percent number with the adjusted spread, because the reason for this flattening of the yield curve is probably actually, in part, a negative thing, in terms of the increased possibility of a future recession.  So that was my reaction.  I don’t know if there was a question there, but— [laughter].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their concern about the flattening of the yield curve and how it may indicate a higher possibility of a future recession. They mention that they agree with the analysis of Thomas regarding the shift in the term premium and the need for reinterpreting historical relationships.


Passage number 147.
  MR. LAUBACH.  No, that’s fine.  I agree that a low longer-run federal funds rate is not necessarily a reassuring piece.  On the low global yields, I would point out that there are, of  course, a number of major central banks that are still engaged in asset purchases.  And Steve Kamin, in the past, presented results regarding potential spillovers of that to U.S. yields, which look pretty sizable.  So the “low global yields” point may not be just a “low global long-run r*” point, but also, in part, still spillovers of policy accommodation that we anticipate will, at some point, go away.  So that would be a factor that, over time, would be expected to lift long-term rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees with the statement made and provides additional information to support it.


Passage number 148.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no passage provided to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 149.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only includes a brief exchange of pleasantries between Williams and Chair Yellen, indicating agreement rather than disagreement or contention.


Passage number 150.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  A quick follow up:  I thought that Governor Quarles’s comment yesterday was really interesting when you were talking about how various business models might be affected by the flatness of the yield curve—banks’ in particular, but other firms’ as well.  And that got me thinking—I came in with that question, too. One issue would be, I guess, as we continue to increase the funds rate—and I know Vice Chairman Dudley has mentioned this before, quite some time ago—if the yield curve doesn’t increase enough, then maybe we have to raise the funds rate more quickly, expecting that would work its way into the pricing of the 10-year rate, and that could steepen it.  So short-run monetary policy is one avenue.  President George mentioned yesterday, I believe, additional SOMA sales could also push up the 10-year rate. At the Conference of Chairs meeting, I thought there was a very interesting presentation by the IF group that talked about, as the ECB begins to exit from their asset purchases, I thought the effect on the U.S. 10-year rate was on the order of 75 basis points, so it was really quite large.  I had not been anticipating or paying attention to that.  But that would be another factor that would lead to a steepening yield curve.   So I guess my question is, of all of these factors and others that I haven’t mentioned—short-term policy, foreign asset purchases—which of these factors is most likely to help us benignly exit this flat yield curve without a recession, if that’s possible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage contains statements and questions that reflect the speaker's thoughts and inquiries on different factors that could potentially impact the yield curve. There is no clear contention or disagreement being expressed.


Passage number 151.
 MR. KAMIN.  I could make one response apropos of the international influence.  I think 75 basis points is in the neighborhood of what we would regard as the “all-in” effect of QE abroad on our term premium. Now, in the period ahead, we’re expecting that the upward pressure on the term premium as foreign central banks exit to be much slower than the effect as they entered QE.  In our projections, we don’t have the ECB and the Bank of England actually starting to run down their balance sheet until, like, 2021 or 2022, and then only slowly.  And we actually don’t have a year specified for when the Bank of Japan starts to run down, or even stops adding to, its balance sheet.  So we think, in the long run, foreign central banks will exit from QE, and that will create some upward pressure, but we don’t expect that to happen soon or quickly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is merely presenting their own projections and expectations regarding the impact of foreign central banks exiting from quantitative easing (QE).


Passage number 152.
 MR. LAUBACH.  For what it’s worth, in the case of your portfolio runoff, we currently think that it’s adding about 12 basis points to the term premium per year, roughly.  And another potential factor that came out of the conversations with market participants points to low inflation risk premiums.  Arguably, if inflation became more anchored symmetrically around 2 percent, I could see that there’d be a slight reversal of those very compressed inflation risk premiums, because risk will be a little less skewed to the downside.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 153.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Questions.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple exchange between two individuals.


Passage number 154.
 MR. KAPLAN.  I’d just make one other comment.  If you gave me, without knowing all of the facts, a hypothetical that the shape of expected real GDP growth was 2½ or maybe  something close to 2½, trailing off down to trend growth of 1.8—some would think even lower—I would have said to you that, as a market participant, I would expect shorter rates to be a little higher, and longer rates to be lower because they’re priced off that longer-run growth.  And while liquidity has some effect on this, the overall shape, if you said I got a short-term bump, but in the medium term and longer term, it’s going to be trailing down, I would expect that would flatten the yield curve or create a different yield curve shape.  And that kind of is the fact pattern we have, and we’re telling the public that that’s the fact pattern.  And I think market participants kind of agree with that analysis.  So it strikes me as rational, you know—what we’re seeing, a little bit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kaplan is stating his own analysis and seems to suggest that market participants agree with his assessment.


Passage number 155.
  MR. LAUBACH.  I agree.  Unfortunately, we don’t have really much historical precedent to point to that, right.  Logically, you would think, in a time when the term premium is pretty compressed, close to zero, and as you move to neutral, the yield curve should go flat.  But, again—as also pointed to in the historical data, of course—there is this unpleasant correlation between a flat yield curve and the onset of recessions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of agreement and a discussion of the lack of historical precedent and the correlation between a flat yield curve and recessions.


Passage number 156.
 MR. POTTER.  None of that implies the 10-year rate should stay at 2.4 percent.  The 10-year rate needs to move up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply suggests that the 10-year rate should increase, without conflicting with any opposing viewpoints.


Passage number 157.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Right.  I agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage demonstrates agreement between two individuals, as indicated by Mr. Kaplan's statement of agreement.


Passage number 158.
  I’m just talking about the shape of the curve— MR. POTTER.  The shape’s too flat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their opinion about the shape of the curve being too flat.


Passage number 159.
  MR. KAPLAN.  —at whatever level you would think that kind of fact pattern would suggest.  And I agree with you.  We were talking about, what will market participants do.  If you have a flat curve—the reason we haven’t, historically, at least in the United States, had extended inversions is, market participants said, “I’d rather buy at the short end of the curve than the long end of the curve.  If you want me to buy at the long end, you’ve got to pay me.  And if you want  me to buy private corporate debt, you’d better really pay me a good spread, because I can earn more short.”  And, as a businessperson, I don’t want to keep paying that, unless I’m very pessimistic about the future.  So we’ll have that discussion as we go, I’m sure, this next year.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is agreeing with the previous statement and discussing a fact pattern related to market participants' behavior.


Passage number 160.
 MR. WILCOX.  Could I muddy the waters just a little bit.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  Sure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both Mr. Wilcox and Chair Yellen seem to be engaging in a light-hearted exchange, as indicated by the laughter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 161.
 MR. WILCOX.  A couple of considerations.  If all elements of long-term rates were created equal, then, for a given funds rate, a steeper yield curve is kind of a two-edged sword for what one would expect for the pace of real activity.  On the one hand, it could be a positive, as Governor Quarles pointed out, if a steeper yield curve is a plus for bank profitability and increases their willingness or wherewithal to extend credit to nonfinancial actors.  On the other hand, I started by positing, for a given funds rate, a steeper yield curve.  Well, that means higher long-term interest rates, and we think that, in many respects, it’s longer-term interest rates that are important for spending through things like mortgage rates or bond rates for investment—that sort of thing.  So that’s one consideration.  There are elements that could go either direction there. The other consideration I would mention is that it could be that not all elements of long-term rates are created equal in terms of their influence on spending.  And—I think Michael Kiley is here.  He had some research earlier, a few years ago, suggesting that the term-premium piece may have less influence on aggregate demand than the expectations-component piece of it. So these issues that you’re raising have a variety of complex crosscurrents involved in them. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, let’s begin the round with President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions that a steeper yield curve can have both positive and negative effects on the pace of real activity. They mention that on one hand, it can be positive for bank profitability and credit extension, but on the other hand, higher long-term interest rates could have a negative impact on spending. Additionally, the speaker mentions another consideration, suggesting that not all elements of long-term rates have the same influence on spending. This implies that there is disagreement or uncertainty about the factors that impact spending and the overall effects of a steeper yield curve.


Passage number 162.
   MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 163.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’ll try not to muddy the waters.  [Laughter]  I support alternative B. I stated at the previous meeting that I would need to see a sizable downside surprise in the data to change my mind about the need for a rate increase today.  In fact, the data have come in even stronger than I expected overall.  The economy has been growing well above the potential rate, despite being buffeted by various natural disasters.  We’re already well past our full employment goal, and the tax package being finalized in the Congress will likely modestly boost growth over the next few years.  Overall inflation was held down earlier this year by transitory developments affecting a few categories of goods and services.  And, as these developments loosen their hold, I expect the continued tightness in the labor market will push inflation back toward, and in fact a little beyond, our target in the coming years. In adjusting the stance of policy, we’ve agreed to take a balanced approach to dealing with misses to our dual-mandate goals.  In this regard, it’s important to note that inflation is currently undershooting our longer-run goal by as much as unemployment has fallen below its natural rate. In my forecast, as well as in the Tealbook’s and in the SEP medians, these misses become increasingly imbalanced as the unemployment rate drops below 4 percent and inflation moves closer to target.  This growing imbalance calls for a gradual increase in interest rates over the next two years.  A rate hike at this time is an important step toward normalizing policy under these circumstances.  It also leaves us well positioned to respond to new developments.  Against this backdrop, a continued gradual pace of rate increases, with contingent adjustments if either side of the risks materializes, is consistent with a commitment to a balanced approach toward our dual mandate.  If the economy evolves as expected, I envision three rate increases in the coming year and an additional three in 2019, with the funds rate eventually reaching 3 percent in 2020.  I should note that since I still view 2½ percent as the neutral federal funds rate, my projection does include some overshooting of r* to slow an economy that will have far exceeded potential and, in fact, a modest overshoot of our 2 percent inflation target in 2020.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Williams, is expressing his support for alternative B and providing reasons to support his position. There is no indication of disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 164.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  With inflation firming and the unemployment rate likely to fall well below what is sustainable, removal of accommodation at this meeting is appropriate. If, as the Tealbook assumes, the unemployment rate falls well below 4 percent and total and core inflation move toward 2 percent, I believe we will need to recalibrate the market’s assumptions regarding further tightening.  Currently, the CME implied probability of tightening is less than I am assuming.  I hope the statement and the SEP will start the process of moving the market to a higher likelihood of more significant tightening this coming year.  At this point, with already strong growth and further fiscal stimulus on the way, I would be concerned if the market does not begin to place a higher probability on a March increase, with several more increases to follow.  Further delays in the gradual process of removing accommodation would make it quite likely that we will need to move more rapidly as inflation converges to our target but we move further below a sustainable unemployment rate. It is notable that in the optimal control exercise with balanced weights, the interest rate path is dramatically higher than the assumptions in the staff forecast.  While I am not advocating the path provided in the optimal control exercise with balanced weights, it does highlight the  potential risks to achieving both elements of our dual mandate if we do not pick up the pace of the removal of accommodation somewhat. Finally, the difficulty we have experienced in achieving our dual mandate when we have little room to lower the funds rate highlights the possibility that our current policy framework may not provide sufficient insulation from negative shocks in the low-inflation environment, especially when equilibrium rates are also low.  While there probably is not sufficient time to develop a full discussion of the framework and our current inflation target for the January meeting, I would welcome such a discussion at a future date.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bostic.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's support for alternative B and their views on inflation, unemployment, and the need for tightening monetary policy.


Passage number 165.
 MR. BOSTIC.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the policy action in alternative B.  However, I continue to worry that my forecast of inflation is overly optimistic.  And that implies a cautious, data-dependent approach to any further policy tightening next year. I found it interesting that a number of participants thought the suggested reordering of the inflation language in paragraph 4 was unhelpful.  I actually like the proposed change, because I think that it is important for the Committee to make as clear as possible that it really does view its inflation objective symmetrically.  I thought that the change in order, even with no change in words, would attract attention and lead to a commentary at the press conference, which would be quite helpful in making the point. As you all know, despite the Committee’s policy efforts, inflation has averaged well below 2 percent for a protracted period.  Our forecasts, too, tend to have inflation returning to our target from below, with relatively little overshoot.  Consequently, and as emphasized by several participants at the previous meeting and at this meeting, it is possible that the public’s expectations are starting to settle on the 2 percent objective being a ceiling rather than a  midpoint.  That, I think, is not the Committee’s intention, and it’s my view that we should take as many opportunities as possible to make that point. As I mentioned at the previous meeting, I think it would be useful, at some point soon, to revisit how we formulate and communicate our inflation objective.  January is when we look again at our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy.  That might be an appropriate time to consider changes to reinforce our commitment to a symmetric 2 percent objective for inflation over the longer term.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Bostic expresses support for policy action in alternative B and discusses his concerns about inflation forecasts and the need for a cautious approach. He also discusses his positive view on a proposed change in language regarding inflation. He suggests revisiting the formulation and communication of the inflation objective in the future. This passage primarily presents Mr. Bostic's thoughts and ideas without any clear disagreement or contention with others.


Passage number 166.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The disconnect in the signals we’ve received over the past few quarters—between continued strengthening in the labor market and the step-down in inflation after many years of below-target performance—has posed a conundrum for monetary policy.  But the high likelihood of sizable and relatively front-loaded fiscal stimulus while the economy is at full employment tips the balance of considerations, in my view, and gives me greater confidence that the signals may move in consistent directions again next year. If we see a resolution of this tension next year, as I hope, this will make navigating the path ahead somewhat more straightforward, although likely not easy.  Our coming decisions will need to balance, on the one hand, the ongoing expansion in the real economy to levels beyond common estimates of full employment with, on the other, inflation that may well continue to run below our longer-run objective over the next couple of years.  In my SEP submission, I’ve threaded this needle by including gradual increases in the federal funds rate over the next several years.  My hope is that the path will effectively achieve two objectives:  convincing the public that we are committed to achieving inflation of 2 percent, on average, over time while, at the same time, avoiding excessive overshooting and possible financial imbalances.  I should note that my projected path slightly overshoots my projected long-run federal funds rate.  This appears to be the case for many others’ paths as well. Like President Bullard, I believe the “sell-by date” of the forward guidance in paragraph 4 has long since expired.  I would favor removing, in particular, the reference to the federal funds rate being “likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  I would favor removing that now or in the near future. As the Chair noted yesterday, with today’s increase, we may indeed be within striking distance of neutral, especially as inflation is 50 basis points below that long-run nominal level on which the long-run neutral rate is premised.  Of course, while my central view is that modest further increases in the funds rate will be appropriate, we should be attuned to the possibility of proceeding differently in either direction.  The appropriate path will be informed by risk-management considerations on both sides as well as by incoming data. If, for example, labor market tightening was to continue at an accelerated pace and asset prices were to move up sharply further, boosting demand even more, we may want to consider a steeper trajectory.  On the other hand, if the anticipated pickup in both actual and underlying inflation fails to materialize over the course of next year, we may need to signal a more gradual approach.  There is historical evidence that policymakers have found it difficult to guide unemployment gently higher when the labor market tightens to unsustainable levels, and there is also evidence from other jurisdictions about the perils central bankers face when they allow the  public’s persistent experience of under-target inflation to become embedded in lower levels of longer-run inflation expectations. While the shortfall in actual and trend inflation in the United States may be modest today, we should keep in mind the examples of Japan and now the euro area, where it appears that longer-run inflation expectations are lower than they are here.  We should move to bolster longer-run expectations while we have the opportunity—that is, when the economy is doing well—to avoid the risk of a further step-down in expectations during the next cycle, when we will likely once again be pinned at the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates.  This is an approach that may be described, perhaps, as opportunistic reflation.  But that’s a theme that we will return to potentially in the future.  For now, I support alternative B.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's views and opinions.


Passage number 167.
 MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B at this meeting, but I’m somewhat disappointed with the removal of the paragraph 4 language that placed additional emphasis on actual inflation behavior.  We have been consistently wrong about inflation returning gradually to target, and I think additional emphasis on inflation’s actual behavior is warranted.  I would suggest adding language into future statements if inflation continues to disappoint. With a December increase in the funds rate, I am inclined to be rather patient regarding future policy moves, and I have reduced my view of appropriate policy to two rate hikes in 2018.  I have become increasingly concerned about inflation remaining persistently below our 2 percent target.  Even if patience implies that inflation will eventually exceed the target, that may not be a bad outcome.  It will reinforce the message that 2 percent is a point target and not a ceiling.   Additionally, overshooting the target would give us the operational flexibility to change our approach to conducting monetary policy in a low-r* environment. I’ve emphasized in previous statements that, in a low-r* environment with a symmetric loss function, there exists the potential problem that average inflation will be less than the 2 percent target.  Hence, inflation expectations could be less than 2 percent, making it more difficult to reach 2 percent inflation on average.  One possible change that could ameliorate the problem is adopting an asymmetric loss function, as suggested in a recent paper by Gust, López-Salido, and Meyer.  Another would be to raise the inflation target and perhaps revisit the target every five years, as the Bank of Canada does.  That would give us the flexibility to adjust the target in light of new information on the evolution of medium- and longer-run economic fundamentals.  A third possibility might be the adoption of price-level targeting, as suggested by others and as suggested recently by Presidents Evans and Williams. Those are just a few options, and at this point, I’m not saying which option I prefer.  But I would urge us to start a serious discussion concerning the pros and cons of our current framework as well as the various alternatives to it.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Harker, is expressing his support for alternative B and his disappointment with the removal of certain language regarding inflation. He suggests adding language in future statements if inflation continues to disappoint and expresses concern about inflation remaining below the 2 percent target. He also mentions potential changes to the current framework and urges a serious discussion on the pros and cons of the current framework and its alternatives. While he mentions different options, he does not state a preference at this time.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 168.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B and the statement as written. The economy is ending 2017 with some momentum.  Growth is expected to remain above trend.  Labor market conditions are strong and are expected to continue tightening, with the unemployment rate falling further below most estimates of its longer-run rate.  Inflation remains below our 2 percent goal, but it has stabilized in recent months, and I project it to rise back to 2 percent over the next couple of years, albeit gradually.  Taking into account current economic and financial conditions, the medium-run outlook, and the risks associated with the outlook, I view a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate today as an appropriate step in fostering our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability. I continue to view the gradual removal of accommodation as being the best strategy for sustaining the expansion and balancing the risks to our dual-mandate goals, with the actual path of the funds rate dependent on how the economy evolves.  The statement language in alternative B gives this message, and I think it’s appropriate.  For the first time in several years, there are some salient upside risks to the forecast.  The tax cuts have the potential to increase growth more than projected, and labor market conditions could tighten even more than anticipated, putting upward pressure on inflation.  On the other hand, it’s difficult to project inflation, and the fact that it’s run below target for some time, even in the face of a tight labor market suggests it could remain low.  There are now also some nascent signs of building financial stability risks, including “lofty” commercial real estate prices and high stock market valuations. The possible alternative paths that the economy could take mean we’ll have to be nimble in making our policy decisions.  It would be risky for us to focus only on the undershoot of inflation and ignore the projected undershoot by the unemployment rate of estimates of its natural rate, even though those estimates are imprecise. Similarly, we need to recognize the limitations in our ability to forecast inflation and the possibility it could remain below our goal for longer than we expect.  And we’ll also need to monitor our normalization of our balance sheet and how it’s affecting the economy. But despite the uncertainty about how the economy will evolve, I think it’s important to be transparent with the public.  We need to give them our best sense of the economic outlook, the risks, and what we think appropriate policy will be in response to the outlook and risks.  And we need to do this even though there’s uncertainty about the policy rate path and the path can be expected to evolve depending on the economy.  I think that we’re up to the challenge and that we’ll have plenty of opportunities to hone our craft in the coming year, albeit without someone who’s been one of our master craftspersons.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Quarles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker acknowledges the uncertainty and risks in the economic outlook and the limitations in forecasting inflation. They argue for a transparent approach to informing the public about the outlook and risks, but also highlight the potential upside risks to the forecast, such as increased growth and tightening labor market conditions. This suggests a disagreement or difference in perspectives on the appropriate policy response and the level of risk in the economy.


Passage number 169.
  MR. QUARLES.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  I expect a continued gradual path of increases in the federal funds rate, as inflation moves past the transitory factors that have been holding it back and as the labor market remains relatively tight. The prospect of tax cuts hasn’t materially affected my outlook for the path of policy rates over the next few years.  I’m not expecting much additional inflationary impetus that might call for a steeper rate path, as increases in potential output and in labor force participation should work to keep price pressures in check. In the longer term, higher potential growth is likely to push up the natural rate of interest, and this should relieve some of the pressure of operating monetary policy so close to the interest rate’s lower bound.  In that regard, I would direct everyone to look again at the speech that former Governor Fischer gave in October of last year, in which he traced out the implications for r* of various economic shocks and, using the staff’s FRB/US model, he showed that a persistent cut of 1 percent of GDP in taxes should boost r* by about 40 basis points. A bit on inflation and price stability.  Reiterating what I said at the previous meeting, I think we have to be careful about just how hard we want to push to inch inflation up a few tenths of 1 percent.  I fully recognize the importance of maintaining well-anchored inflation expectations and the need for symmetry around our target.  But, in thinking about symmetry about how we approach our target, I try to imagine how we would react in a world in which inflation was hovering with no obvious momentum at 2½ percent, a little above our target, while unemployment was above our estimate of the natural rate—say, at 5.1 percent—with clear upward momentum.  I think it’s fairly obvious that we would, in a symmetrical approach, react in the opposite direction to the way we’re reacting now, gradually and appropriately, and that if  we think about symmetry with regard to the whole situation, as opposed to simply one element of the situation, we would think differently about whether we are behaving symmetrically now. Two minor points—maybe not so minor.  With regard to the September SEP, I want to agree with President Bullard on the signaling issue.  I have little experience with it, so take that for what it’s worth.  But it does make logical sense to me that we should be changing the time frame over which we’re projecting in September.  But while wanting to maintain a symmetrical approach to my support for President Bullard’s comments, I also would like to say that, without wanting to attach magical properties to any particular talisman, I do find the inclusion of the Taylor (1999) rule diamonds in exhibit 3 of yesterday’s presentation of the Summary of Economic Projections to be helpful.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 170.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  With the unemployment rate at 4.1 percent and with expectations of solid near-term real GDP growth, I think we’re on a course that will take us well past full employment over the next year and in the medium term. Cyclical forces and inflationary forces are building, I believe.  I do think that these forces will help offset at least some of the structural headwinds that I’ve talked a lot about—technology-enabled disruption and, to a lesser extent, globalization—but we’ll have to see how that unfolds. I believe that, at this moment, excesses and imbalances in the economy are likely manageable.  But I also believe that excesses and imbalances are likely to build over the next year.  Excessive commitments by firms and households have the potential to produce outsize responses when growth moderates, as we expect in the out-years, and these commitments will  need to be unwound in the future.  And I think the tax plan will exacerbate these factors, potentially. I’ve also spoken about elevated levels of today’s real asset and financial markets versus historical measures.  That does not mean the valuations can’t get fuller—I would guess they can, and they well might—but it does suggest the need for heightened vigilance, so that we monitor buildup of leverage and/or other imbalances associated with historically high levels of valuation. So, as I take all of that into account—and consistent with our Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which we reaffirm every year and we did earlier this year—I’m looking at the size of the current and potential full-employment overshoot and balancing that against the size, timing, and trend of the likely inflation undershoot.  And when I balance both of those, I’m convinced that taking a step today and removing accommodation gives the FOMC the best opportunity to stay with a strategy of removing accommodation in a modest, gradual, and patient manner.  From a risk-management point of view, I think this gradual and patient approach—if we can avoid getting “behind the curve” and having to play catch-up—gives us the best opportunity to extend the recovery and the expansion of the U.S. economy, which in turn will also likely give us the best chance to achieve price stability on a sustained basis.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of the speaker's opinion and analysis.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 171.
 MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support an increase in the target range for the funds rate at this meeting.  This action would represent a continuation of gradual policy adjustments promoting our objective for long-run sustained growth. The proposed language in alternative B, I think, appropriately justifies today’s policy action based on economic conditions, but it stops short of describing the medium-term outlook  for employment and inflation.  While inflation is expected to move gradually toward the Committee’s target, the outlook also anticipates that labor market conditions will deviate further from their long-run sustainable levels.  As we move into 2018, it would be appropriate, in my view, to revisit the language that describes that outlook at one of our future meetings, perhaps along the lines of paragraph 2 in alternative C, which more effectively ties the policy action to the medium-term outlook. With the growing deviation in the unemployment rate over the forecast horizon from its longer-run level, our projections point to a slowing of economic growth below trend, with unemployment eventually rising to its longer-run level.  This has been a challenging needle for policymakers to thread in the past.  It certainly may be the case that this time will be different.  But, with the funds rate remaining below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run, combined with a very large balance sheet only gradually shrinking, we will likely need to wrestle with this communications challenge over the next few years and explain future policy actions in light of such forecasts.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Acting President Mullinix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. This passage contains some disagreement or contention. Ms. George expresses support for an increase in the target range for the funds rate, but she argues that the proposed language in alternative B does not adequately describe the medium-term outlook for employment and inflation. She suggests using the language from alternative C instead. Additionally, she mentions the challenge of communicating future policy actions in light of forecasts and the lingering impact of a large balance sheet.


Passage number 172.
 MR. MULLINIX.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B and a rate increase today, and, as in my September submission, my SEP has four funds rate increases in 2018, similar to the Tealbook baseline.  I also project unemployment to decline below 4 percent in the next three years.  With the further tightening in labor markets, the low level of the real funds rate, and the improved core PCE numbers for the past two months, it is difficult to see a downside to this policy rate path, assuming, of course, the data come in as projected over the forecast horizon.  I will briefly mention one concern, in connection with the gradual increase in rates, that has received some attention—the behavior of the yield curve.  I am sympathetic to the argument found in the analysis on pages 8 and 9 of Tealbook A.  While there is a historical relationship between yield-curve inversions and recessions, that correlation is driven in large part by episodes in which the FOMC either fell “behind the curve” or was in danger of falling “behind the curve” and felt that it had to push up rates aggressively in the face of rising inflation.  In contrast, in the baseline forecast, we seek to remove accommodation gradually, while keeping inflation expectations stable in the context of a persistently low term premium. Of course, there’s always a possibility that we will fall “behind the curve” and need to push up rates rapidly, tipping the economy into a recession and generating another episode in the inverted-yield-curve–recession relationship.  I expect that the gradual increase embedded in the Tealbook baseline and my SEP submission manages the risk of falling behind and will help avoid that outcome. In closing, professionally and personally, it’s been a high honor to serve the Fifth District as interim president and as a member of this Committee.  And thank you, Madam Chair, for your leadership over these recent years. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks so much, Mark.  President Kashkari.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses his support for alternative B and a rate increase, as well as his projection for unemployment to decline. He mentions a concern about the behavior of the yield curve but states that he believes the gradual increase in rates will help avoid negative outcomes. There is no direct disagreement or contention presented in this passage.


Passage number 173.
   MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative A.  I have not supported rate increases this year because I’ve not seen much evidence that inflation is actually climbing toward our 2 percent target. Since my first dissent in March, there have been strong employment gains that have continued, but there’s been little evidence that these job gains are translating into either nominal wage growth or inflation.  This makes me think that we are still likely below our maximum- employment objective, and that inflation expectations are likely significantly below our target.  I, therefore, continue to believe that we should not raise rates further absent evidence of a sustained increase in inflation toward our 2 percent target or a move up in inflation expectations.  Raising rates will only slow job growth, imposing real cost to the U.S. economy.  It’ll also damp nominal wage growth and inflation and increase the risk of inflation expectations slipping further. These are arguments you’ve heard me make before.  The one new argument, which got a lot of attention at this meeting, is the flattening of the yield curve.  I share my colleagues’ concerns about that.  First of all, I agree with the comments that President Williams made this morning about market participants’ views.  I didn’t find them very satisfying, saying “Oh, we’re not worrying about the flattening.  It just means there’s a low longer-term r* or low inflation risk premium.”  I’m concerned about both of those things, and I think we all should be, too. Second, I found the discussion this morning somewhat confusing to me about what’s happening with the yield curve.  I know we’re going to talk about it more next year.  I don’t think it’s that complicated.  I think we are raising interest rates in the absence of inflation.  So we’re pushing up the front end, and we’re putting a lid on inflation expectations on the back end, and we’re causing the flattening of the yield curve.  That’s how I interpret it.  It seems like it’s pretty straightforward, but I’m open to learning more, and it’s something I’m going to be very focused on next year.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. Mr. Kashkari is stating his support for alternative A and providing his reasons for not supporting rate increases. He also shares his concerns about the flattening of the yield curve, but there is no disagreement with other individuals mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 174.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will support alternative B as written. Incoming data indicate that the labor market continues to tighten and that inflation appears to be bottoming out.  With solid real GDP growth here and abroad and fiscal stimulus arriving, we seem to be on track for at least a couple of more years of above-trend growth, and  on that path, the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall.  With further declines in the unemployment rate, I see it as likely that inflation will stabilize around the 2 percent objective over the next couple of years.  And I also see these conditions as supporting a rate increase today. As I mentioned yesterday, I see a risk that, conditional on growth being about as set forth in the median SEP path, unemployment may move significantly lower rather than flatten out as reflected in the median SEP unemployment rate path.  Such a decline could be accompanied by excessive inflation pressures, which could require us to tighten policy more aggressively, potentially threatening the longevity of the expansion.  I hasten to add that I currently see no signs of labor market overheating or of building inflation pressures.  To the contrary, the other main risk I see to the outlook is that inflation will remain below target longer than we anticipate. In practical terms, I see a need to balance the risk of an overheating economy against that of stubbornly too-low inflation, and I continue to view a gradual approach to removing accommodation as appropriately balancing these two risks.  A gradual pace of interest rate increases will allow us to make a better assessment of the degree of labor market tightness as well as the underlying trend of inflation. I want to conclude by returning to the question that President Bullard posed yesterday regarding the utility of including the Taylor (1999) rule as part of the dot plot in Bob Tetlow’s presentation yesterday, and I have a couple of things to say.  First, we often say that simple policy rules can provide a useful benchmark for assessing the appropriate stance of policy, and, to me, the application of the Taylor (1999) rule in Bob Tetlow’s briefing was a nice example of that.  Of course, we wouldn’t want to chain our policy to a rule, but rules like Taylor (1999) do  embody principles of good monetary policy.  As a result, I do find it useful to see how our SEP policy rate paths compare with rule prescriptions given our economic outlooks. In particular, I do see one useful “takeaway” from Bob’s presentation—not so much from the level of the rule’s prescription—which I find hard to work with, because of risk-management concerns and uncertainty regarding the level of the intercept—but more from the fact that the deviation of that prescription from the median SEP path increased 50 basis points for 2018 and 2019 between the September and December meetings.  And that wider gap raises the question to me whether, conditional on the other aspects of the forecast being realized, the pace of rate hikes might need to be a bit faster than is currently implied by the median dots.  Of course, the answer to that question will ultimately come from the incoming data, and we will, I’m sure, remain open to moving faster or slower, depending on data and risk-management considerations.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 175.
 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  With respect to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s interest rate projections in the SEP, we’ve made only very minor changes relative to where we were in September.  For example, we still have three 25 basis point hikes penciled in both for 2018 and for 2019. That said, at the margin—in view of the strength of the economy, the tightness of the labor market, and buoyant financial market conditions—the risk, to me, seems to be on the side of a more rapid pace of rate hikes than that.  Also, if, as we were to continue to remove monetary policy accommodation, we continue to see financial conditions remaining buoyant, that would push me to revise up my estimate of r* and our longer-term federal funds rate forecast.  But I’m not quite there yet.  I want to talk a little bit about the yield curve, so I guess I’ll have the last word, or next-to-last word, on this.  Some are concerned by the flattening of the Treasury yield curve.  But I don’t share that concern.  I’m broadly where the staff is.  I thought the staff’s analysis today relayed by Thomas, as well as the related analysis earlier in the Tealbook, was very good.  To me, first, the flattening of the yield curve should be expected when we’re raising the federal funds rate target.  If the yield curve weren’t flattening, this would suggest that we were “behind the curve” in removing monetary policy accommodation.  So this is normal, as opposed to abnormal. Second, the yield-curve flattening is not particularly pronounced.  As the Tealbook mentioned, this yield spread between the 10-year Treasury note and the 2-year Treasury note is not far from its average over the past few decades at the 40th percentile. Third, one should expect the yield curve to be flatter than normal, all else being equal, because, as Thomas and others have pointed out, the term premiums are depressed.  Now, some of this is due to quantitative easing—both our own actions and the actions of foreign central banks.  But some of this may be more persistent.  It may be due to the fact that we’re in a low-inflation environment.  If the perception of the risk of significantly higher inflation has fallen over time, as inflation has persistently undershot 2 percent, then this should result in investors’ compensation for inflation risk involving lower term premiums than previously. Fourth and finally, while an inverted yield curve has typically preceded recessions, I’m not aware of any causal element in that relationship.  For example, I don’t believe that banks become unwilling to lend when the yield curve inverts and that that then causes a recession.  If the curve were to invert in the current environment, it would be because people thought that monetary policy was tight, and that’s really the thing that precedes recession.  Investors  anticipate, if monetary policy is tight, that the economy is going to slow, and that will be followed by a reduction of short-term rates.  That’s the mechanism that really causes the yield curve to invert.  And those expectations usually turn out to be right because, if they weren’t right, the Federal Reserve would keep tightening, and, eventually, it would get the desired outcome.  So we do observe that inverted yield curves precede recessions, but I don’t see a causal relationship in that. In this cycle, I expect the yield curve will continue to flatten as we continue to remove monetary policy accommodation, and I expect that inversion could happen earlier than would normally be the case, because term premiums are depressed.  But, to me, worrying now that we’re committing a major policy mistake by raising our federal funds rate target 25 basis points, to 1¼ to 1½ percent, seems misplaced.  Our tightening moves have not yet tightened overall financial market conditions, so why should we expect our actions to exert a significant restraint on economic activity even with a somewhat flatter yield curve.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Well, thank you, everybody, for a very good discussion.  I think everybody recognizes that we face two different risks in our policy choices—one of concern with allowing the economy to overheat, which could ultimately threaten the sustainability of the expansion, and, just as important, one of too-low inflation and, possibly, inflation expectations that are moving down, and taking actions that enhance that risk.  And I’ve heard very thoughtful comments around the table about the need for and difficulty of weighing, judging, and balancing those risks.  So I thought it was an excellent discussion. At the end of the day, I heard considerable support for alternative B as written.  So let me ask Jim to now make clear what we’re going to vote on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses their support for alternative B and discusses their views on the interest rate projections, yield curve flattening, and the risks involved in monetary policy choices. The Chair also acknowledges the thoughtful comments and support for alternative B.


Passage number 176.
  MR. CLOUSE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The vote will be on the monetary policy statement exactly as it appears on pages 6 and 7 in Thomas Laubach’s briefing materials, and it will also encompass the directive to the Desk as it appears in the implementation note on pages 12 and 13 of Thomas’s briefing materials.  With that, I’ll call the roll. Chair Yellen   Yes Vice Chairman Dudley  Yes Governor Brainard   Yes President Evans   No President Harker   Yes President Kaplan   Yes President Kashkari   No Governor Powell   Yes Governor Quarles   Yes  CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  Now we have two sets of related matters under the Board’s jurisdiction:  corresponding interest rates on reserves and discount rates.  I first need a motion from a Board member to increase the interest rates on required and excess reserve balances to 1½ percent, effective December 14, 2017.  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The individuals mentioned all respond in the affirmative, indicating agreement with the statement or request made by Chair Yellen.


Passage number 177.
 MR. QUARLES.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple exchange of statements where one person thanks the other for seconding a motion.


Passage number 178.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.  Without objection.  Finally, I need a motion from a Board member to approve establishment of the primary credit rate by the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco at 2 percent, effective December 14, 2017.  It will also encompass approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 2 percent primary credit rate by each of the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of December 14, 2017, and the date such Reserve Bank informs the Secretary of the Board of such a request.  The Secretary of the Board  would be authorized to inform such Reserve Banks of the approval of the Board of Governors on such notification by the Reserve Bank.  Lastly, this vote will also encompass establishment of the rates for secondary and seasonal credit under the existing formulas specified in the staff’s December 8, 2017, memo to the Board.  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply stating the need for a motion to approve the establishment of various credit rates by the Federal Reserve Banks. There is no contention or disagreement present.
