Passage number 1.
 MR. LYON.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN. Let’s see.  Now, let me say, this entire meeting, as has been the case for a few meetings, will be a joint meeting of the FOMC and the Board of Governors.  So we need a motion to close the Board meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing the procedure for closing the Board meeting.


Passage number 2.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  Let’s ask Simon to start things off with the Desk report.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 3.
 MR. POTTER.1  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Since the Committee met in October, expectations that liftoff will occur at this meeting have increased substantially, while the expected slope of the target rate thereafter is little changed. As liftoff expectations grew earlier in the period, broader asset prices were relatively range bound. However, late in the period, sharp commodity price declines weighed on risk sentiment.  On net, domestic financial conditions tightened over the period. As shown in the top-left panel of your first exhibit, over the period the market-implied probability of liftoff at this meeting increased markedly, driven by the October FOMC statement and the better-than-expected October employment report. Adjusting for year-end effects in the January federal funds futures contract, we estimate a market-implied probability of roughly 90 percent.  The average probability 1 The materials used by Mr. Potter and Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 1).   of liftoff at this meeting, according to the Desk’s most recent dealer and buy-side surveys, is also around 90 percent.  And all but one of the 51 respondents view this meeting as the most likely time of liftoff. Amid the buildup in expectations regarding liftoff, there was a parallel shift up in the market-implied policy rate path, as shown in the top-right panel.  The market-implied path continues to be shallow by historical standards at the initiation of tightening phases, rising by about 50 basis points per year in 2016 and 2017.  According to the Desk’s surveys, the average expected pace of tightening in the first two years after liftoff, conditional on not returning to the effective lower bound, declined slightly, as shown in the middle-left panel, continuing the trend observed since we first asked about this in September 2014.  On average, survey respondents now expect the target rate to increase 80 basis points in the first year after liftoff and 95 basis points in the second year. Market rates over the next two years are still somewhat below the mean expectations of the target rate in the Desk’s surveys, as shown in the middle-right panel.  These mean expectations are derived from survey questions eliciting probability distributions for year-end rates.  Importantly, the answers include assessments of the likelihood of returning to the zero bound.  The dots in the panel show individual respondents’ expectations for the year-end target federal funds rate in 2016 and 2017, with the dots scaled by the proportion of respondents expecting each rate level and shaded by how likely they view a return to the effective lower bound; darker shades indicate a lower probability of returning to the effective lower bound.  As you can see, the gap between market rates (the red diamonds) and the average survey expectations (the blue dashed lines) is slight for 2016 but becomes larger in 2017, and respondents that place high weight on a return to the zero lower bound have lower mean rate expectations. The medians of the survey respondents’ modal expectations regarding the federal funds rate remain slightly below the median of the SEP dots published in September.  Desk survey respondents generally expect a decline in the median 2017 and 2018 dots and in the median projection of the longer-run rate at this meeting. In written commentary, they highlighted persistent downward pressures on global growth and recent Federal Reserve communications on the neutral federal funds rate as underpinning these expectations.  Thomas will discuss the path of policy and market expectations more in his briefing. Shifting to broader markets, expectations for liftoff to come at this meeting appeared to be taken largely in stride, particularly over the time period in early November during which these expectations increased to high levels.  In November, domestic equity price indices and credit spreads were relatively little changed, and, as shown in the bottom-left panel, option-implied volatility across asset classes remained subdued.  However, sharp declines in oil prices late in the intermeeting period appear to have had knock-on effects throughout global financial markets. These declines in oil prices are shown in the bottom-right panel.  Over the period, the price of front-month Brent crude dropped by about 20 percent.  Broader commodity prices also declined notably over the period, with the Bloomberg Industrial Metals Index falling by roughly 10 percent.  While contacts largely attribute the decline in oil prices to persistent oversupply—especially following the most recent OPEC meeting—broad-based weakness in commodity prices likely in part reflects ongoing concerns about global growth. The commodity price declines had adverse effects on high-yield corporate credit markets, as reflected in the widening in high-yield spreads shown in the top-left panel of your next exhibit.  The widening was most pronounced in energy credits (the dark blue line), with spreads, on average, up 200 basis points over the period.  However, there was also a more broad-based selloff, with high-yield spreads ex energy widening by 80 basis points.  As part of this, U.S. high-yield mutual funds and ETFs saw outflows of $4.5 billion for the week ending December 9, up from an average outflow of about $1 billion over the prior month.  And as was widely publicized last week, one open-ended high-yield mutual fund that had invested in lower-quality corporate bonds gated investors amid persistent redemption requests. Commodity price declines also continued to serve as a headwind to inflation compensation and emerging market asset prices. Five-year and five-year, five-year-forward inflation compensation was little changed on net and remains well below historical averages and the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective, as shown in the top-right panel.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 4.
 Meanwhile, the JP Morgan Emerging Market Currency Index declined by 3 percent, and the MSCI Emerging Market Equity Index fell by over 10 percent.  The onshore and offshore renminbi depreciated against the U.S. dollar, as shown in the middle-left panel, taking the renminbi to levels weaker against the dollar than those seen following the devaluation in August.  Further, the basis between the onshore and offshore renminbi widened in recent weeks, as shown in grey in this panel, likely reflecting a reduced desire by Chinese officials to intervene in the wake of the announcement of the renminbi’s inclusion in the SDR basket and ahead of FOMC liftoff.  China’s leadership repeatedly stressed the strength of the renminbi on a trade-weighted basis, and many expect that in the future they will measure the renminbi against a basket of currencies rather than considering only the U.S dollar. More broadly, while dollar strength was most pronounced against commodity-linked currencies, the dollar appreciated modestly against the currencies of all major U.S. trading partners over the period, as shown in the dark blue lines in the middle-right panel.  The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index increased by about 1 percent, pushing year-to-date gains to nearly 8 percent. The ongoing theme of monetary policy divergence, particularly between the Federal Reserve and other major central banks, such as the ECB, continued to serve as a tailwind to U.S. dollar strength.  While on net the euro-to-dollar exchange rate was little changed on the period, the euro did touch its weakest level against the dollar   since March, as expectations of Fed and ECB policy diverged starkly.  This divergence can be seen in the spread between U.S. and German two-year nominal yields, shown in the bottom-left panel, which reached year-to-date highs just ahead of the December ECB meeting. At that meeting, the ECB announced an array of additional easing measures, including a 10 basis point cut to its deposit facility rate to negative 30 basis points, an extension of its asset purchases by at least six months, and an expansion of its public-sector purchase program to include reinvestments and local and regional bonds. Nevertheless, market expectations for the extent of ECB easing had become quite lofty ahead of the meeting, and the announcement led to an abrupt tightening of euro-area financial conditions, including a sharp increase in euro-area sovereign yields.  Interestingly, a substantial portion of the rise in these yields passed through into Treasury yields, particularly at the long end of the curve, as shown in the bottom-right panel.  This highlights, as did the taper tantrum, the correlation in global term premiums and financial conditions more broadly. As I noted earlier, the move to an almost fully priced-in increase for the federal funds target range appeared to be taken largely in stride during November, but this occurred with no reevaluation of the path of policy.  As is clear from both the taper tantrum and the recent experience of the ECB, markets can be very sensitive to changes in policy or communications—at times, it appears, for no good reason.  Thus, there is still likely event risk surrounding the announcement of the Committee’s decision tomorrow, particularly given the turbulence in markets in the past few days, although the major surprise to markets would be no change in the target range.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It primarily provides information and analysis about various economic indicators and events.


Passage number 5.
 MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to go back to exhibit 1, figure 1. This shows market-implied probability of a rate hike at or before the December FOMC meeting. I am concerned about a little bit of revisionist history here.  I am looking before the September FOMC meeting, and this survey is showing a probability of 90 percent that the Committee would lift off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Bullard is expressing a concern about potential revisionist history, but he is not disagreeing with anyone or presenting an opposing viewpoint.


Passage number 6.
  My recollection of that period is that market-implied probabilities were only about 30 percent going into the— MR. POTTER. For the September meeting, this shows the probability of liftoff at or before the December meeting. We are trying to capture the probability of liftoff in 2015 in this chart.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply providing information and explaining the purpose of a chart.


Passage number 7.
 MR. BULLARD. The probability of liftoff in 2015, not at a particular meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a statement about the probability of liftoff in 2015 and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 8.
 MR. POTTER. It is at or before the December FOMC meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 9.
 MR. BULLARD. Now I’ve got it, sorry.  Okay.  Then I want to go to exhibit 4, figure 21, “Expected Timing of End to Some or All Reinvestments Relative to Liftoff.” We’ve got some dots here at zero.  Does that mean somebody in the market is saying that we are going to lift off and cease reinvestments at this meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking for clarification on a specific exhibit.


Passage number 10.
 MR. POTTER.  That is the one respondent who doesn’t think there will be liftoff.  That respondent thinks that you will cease reinvestments at this meeting and lift off in April.  None of the traders who work at that firm believe that’s true.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states a fact that none of the traders who work at the mentioned firm believe in the respondent's prediction.


Passage number 11.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Well, it kind of makes me wonder about some of the other dots.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing curiosity and wondering about something.


Passage number 12.
  [Laughter] MR. POTTER. This person has been more accurate than other people over the last three or four years, as he’s had a view very contrary to what the market and the consensus was, and that was a good place to be. My guess would be that he probably is going to be wrong this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that the person has been accurate in the past but speculates that they may be wrong this time.


Passage number 13.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you.  CHAIR YELLEN.  Other questions.  [No response]  Okay.  Seeing none, Simon, why don’t you proceed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 14.
 MR. TARULLO.  Don’t complain, Madam Chair.  [Laughter]  CHAIR YELLEN.  All right.  I need a motion to ratify open market operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The exchange between Mr. Tarullo and Chair Yellen is lighthearted and characterized by laughter, indicating a friendly and joking tone. The request for a motion to ratify open market operations does not suggest any disagreement or contention either.


Passage number 15.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN. Without objection.  Okay.  Let us proceed to the economic briefings, and John Roberts will start us off.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker agrees with the suggestion made by Mr. Fischer and proceeds without any objection.


Passage number 16.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have two questions.  First, on the SEPs.  Exhibit 3, inflation versus the unemployment rate in the lower left—I started staring at that, and all of a sudden I started feeling calm, and I started thinking about alt-B, and I started thinking that maybe alt-B was better, and I felt more calm [laughter].  It is rather hypnotic, isn’t it. Okay, anyway—back to the real question.  The economic outlook, exhibit 2, the medium-term outlook, real GDP.  Looking at potential GDP growth, I was reminded of something I have asked questions about in the past—in 2014, the potential output growth looks like it was quite low.  And then I wondered if maybe I hadn’t prepared carefully enough.  So I went back to look at the Tealbook chart that has that, and 2014 was buried in an average of 2011 to 2014, which was 1.1 percent.  I had sort of forgotten that we have 0.4 here for 2014.  I guess the question is— and, John, you are the perfect person, as I understand it, to answer this, since it is based upon your research on Kalman smoothing and things like that.  What is the basis for thinking about this.  And since it is so amazing, the question really is, does this provide a lesson for the future.  Because it is a rather dramatic step-down in potential output growth.  If we had found something like that at a period featuring less resource slack, maybe we might think that some inflation will be coming our way.  I’m not sure how to think about it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply asking questions and seeking clarification.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 17.
 MR. ROBERTS. We tried to get the improvement in the output gap right for 2014.  Of course, the changing output gap is just the difference between real GDP growth and potential GDP growth.  And we saw in 2014 that labor market conditions were improving very rapidly.  The unemployment rate was coming down quite a lot, so we thought, “Oh, the output gap must be improving a lot.” So what we essentially did was to say, “Hmm, with GDP growth not as strong as it should be to get that kind of an improvement in the output gap, there must have been some measurement error in the actual GDP numbers.”  And because we don’t have room in our accounting system right now for measurement error, we put the measurement error in potential GDP. This is something we are thinking a lot about.  In the research of mine that you cite, we do have an explicit role for measurement error, but that isn’t something that’s in our traditional accounting systems.  One could imagine a more elaborate system in which you break down real GDP into not just the two components, of potential output and the output gap, but into three components:  potential output, the output gap, and measurement error.  So that’s what’s going on there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is a disagreement or contention in the passage.
No, there is no disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 18.
 MR. EVANS.  That is a little less satisfying than I was expecting, because if my memory is right, I thought that was the occasion when the first-quarter winter was really dastardly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply expresses their disappointment with the outcome of a previous event.


Passage number 19.
  MR. ROBERTS.  Exactly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage consists of a single statement, "Exactly," spoken by Mr. Roberts. There is no mention of any other individuals or conflicting viewpoints, so there is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 20.
 MR. EVANS.  And we just made this judgment call to take it all as potential output.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any disagreement or contrasting viewpoints. The statement made by Mr. Evans is given as a straightforward account of a judgment call made by a group or individual.


Passage number 21.
 MR. ROBERTS.  That is exactly right, and that is what I am calling “measurement error.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating an agreement.


Passage number 22.
” MR. EVANS.  Right.  So I understand that kind of swag, I guess.  But on the other hand, GDP was 2½ percent that year, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply discusses two different perspectives regarding a subject without any contradictory statements or opposing opinions.


Passage number 23.
 MR. ROBERTS.  Yes. But you are exactly right.  We are putting a lot of weight on what we thought was an anomalous Q1 number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker agrees with the other person's statement and acknowledges their correctness.


Passage number 24.
 MR. EVANS.  Right.  Okay.  Thank you.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple expression of gratitude.


Passage number 25.
 MR. WILCOX.  GDP growth was 2½ percent, and the unemployment rate was coming down a lot, so unless you posit a big discrepancy between the growth of actual GDP and potential GDP, it’s really hard to reconcile a substantial decline in the unemployment rate.  So we sort of “squeezed the balloon,” and, as John Roberts described, we squeezed it into here. Now, we are in the process, as John Roberts mentioned, of inventing a more elaborate system that would allow us to do something that we can’t do at the moment, and that is, have a smooth series for potential GDP that probably accords a little more with our economic intuition so that potential GDP growth is driven by things like trend multifactor productivity, capital investment, population growth, those sorts of things.  What we’d like, ideally, is to have a smooth series for potential GDP that represents that, and we would also like to show you an output gap that itself is also smooth and accurately represents pressures on resource utilization. At the moment, absent, as John was describing, a third category for—in the Kalman filter world, it is called “observation error.”  Absent an explicit designation of observation error, wecan’t do those two things.  So as an imperfect parking place, we have put the noisiness into potential GDP growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the need for a more accurate representation of potential GDP growth and the challenges in achieving that.


Passage number 26.
  That’s what’s going on in the— MR. EVANS.  I think it was a good decision.  I think we are well served by that type of good judgment, just put all the pain in one place and let the analytics go forward on a more reasonable—no, I’m not questioning that, I’m just trying to understand it.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Williams.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for a decision and trying to understand it better.


Passage number 27.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 28.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a question on John’s exhibit 4, “A Recession at the ZLB,” which obviously was also in the alternative scenarios in Tealbook A.  As I read from the text and from your presentation, if I look at the blue dot-dashed line—which indicates that you are not imposing a zero lower bound, you are not imposing anything—you are actually doing two things with the funds rate here.  You have a baseline assumption about some kind of Taylor rule with inertia, but then you are also dropping the funds rate by 275 basis points to show a typical or a strong reaction to the recession.  So it is a combination of these two effects.  And then, on the zero lower bound, you are constraining it at essentially 10 or 12½ basis points. I have one technical question, which is, I am puzzled by the fact that the red dashed line with the zero lower bound is almost always—by just my looking at panel 5 in the exhibit—above the blue dashed line, which goes against economic intuition.  I understand it is above at the zero lower bound, but it wouldn’t be that way, for example, for 2018.  Even though the economy is worse off, the funds rate is higher.  So I was curious about really what’s going on here. And the second issue, which is kind of more related to the box in the Tealbook about the effective lower bound, is I would be very interested to see what would happen if, when you do these kinds of scenarios, instead of a zero lower bound, you used a negative 50 basis point or a  negative 100 basis point lower bound, given the experience in Europe, and in light of what we’ve learned from that, which is reported in the Tealbook, just to kind of give us a flavor of, in a situation like this, if we could go to negative rates.  And if we had a view on how that would pass through to financial conditions, how much of an extra kick would that give us before going to, say, QE4 or some other tool.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker is expressing confusion and disagreement with the red dashed line consistently being above the blue dashed line in panel 5 of the exhibit, which goes against economic intuition. The speaker also suggests using a negative lower bound to see the potential effects, indicating a disagreement or different perspective on the approach being taken.


Passage number 29.
 MR. ROBERTS. Let me answer your first technical question. We assume that there is the initial kick-down in the federal funds rate, and then, after that, it just follows the inertial Taylor rule. That is sort of what is going on in the blue dot-dash line. The reason the red line is above the blue dot-dash line is basically the inertia.  The inertial Taylor rule has a lot of inertia, and so you’re inheriting zero rather than negative 1, and it is persistent, so that is why it is above. So that was your first question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is explaining the reason for the red line being above the blue dot-dash line, and there is no opposing viewpoint being presented or debated.


Passage number 30.
 Your second question, why not— MR. WILCOX.  Is that clear, John.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question, seeking clarification.


Passage number 31.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but I cannot determine the presence of contention or disagreement without the passage you are referring to. Could you please provide more context or the passage itself?


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 32.
 WILLIAMS.  It’s clear, but it’s not satisfactory, really, because if you think about it—and I have talked about this so many times—these kinds of arbitrary “I am pushing the funds rate in one, and I am putting inertia in the other,” and you are getting what are nonsensical responses that one path is above the other, even though the economy is worse.  I would prefer to see something like an optimal control exercise, in which you are really doing something that is apples-to-apples, so that I could see what the different outcomes would be if I was trying to do something that is consistent with our views.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker expresses dissatisfaction and disagreement with the current approach and suggests an alternative method (optimal control exercise) that they see as more preferable.


Passage number 33.
  But this is something that we can, you know— MR. ROBERTS.  Yes, that’s something that we’ve been thinking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. The speaker simply acknowledges that they have been thinking about something without any opposing views being expressed.


Passage number 34.
 MR. WILCOX.  This is pretty simple.  It is a mechanical application of the inertial rule. The inertial rule is simply feeding off a lagged value that’s zero when the ZLB is imposed, and   the inertial rule is feeding off a negative number when the ZLB is not imposed.  It, obviously, would be possible to do an optimal control version of the same kind of exercise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage is explaining a concept and does not include any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 35.
 MR. ROBERTS.  So your second question—I would suggest averaging the blue line and the red line.  If the federal funds rate could go to minus 100, then the outcome would probably be somewhere in between where it is when it goes to minus 200 and when it’s stuck at zero.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a suggestion for averaging the blue line and the red line to find an outcome between two hypothetical scenarios.


Passage number 36.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: A: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage because it is not provided.


Passage number 37.
 WILLIAMS.  I’m really thinking ahead to, if this really happened, what the cost-benefit analysis, or at least the benefit analysis, would be in terms of macroeconomic stabilization if we really thought that the effective lower bound was something lower.  You know, giving us a little more information in these kinds of scenarios of, “Hey, if you guys were willing to go to minus 50, you wouldn’t get an unemployment rate of nearly 7, you might get an unemployment rate that peaked at 6¼.”  So that’s where I’m going with this, thinking ahead to the staff analysis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 38.
 MR. LAUBACH.  Madam Chair, may I briefly—the staff is in the process of evaluating various technical, legal aspects of our actual ability to implement negative short-term interest rates, on the basis of the experience abroad.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that the staff is evaluating technical and legal aspects related to implementing negative short-term interest rates based on experiences abroad.


Passage number 39.
 MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 40.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 41.
 MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to follow up with President Williams on the same exhibit 4, “A Recession at the Zero Lower Bound.” I agree with President Williams, to do this experiment in which we lower the funds rate to implausible levels and then trace out the response—I’m not sure that’s the most useful thing to show to the Committee.  I’ll suggest an alternative experiment, which is:  You do have this constant probability of recession.  If a recession occurred in 2016, I think what the Committee wants to know is, how much QE  would you have to do to mitigate the recession and what does the staff model say about that. And then, as an alternative, you assume the recession does not occur until 2019 or something like that, when the funds rate is much higher or in a much better position, and then presumably you might not have to do any QE, or might have to do much less or something like that.  But otherwise we’re comparing to something that, you know, we can’t do.  So that’s kind of distressing. On exhibit 7, which is entitled “Liftoff” and is about the dollar, figure 2, “Dollar Moves Around the Start of a Tightening Cycle,” shows the average of past tightening cycles, and the black line declines—which I guess is a depreciation of the dollar in the months following these four previous historic tightening cycles.  So I thought you were going to show me an alternative scenario of “what if that happened.”  And that isn’t actually the alternative that you showed me in figures 3, 4, and 5 here.  You showed me further tightening.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is some contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Bullard, disagrees with President Williams about the usefulness of the experiment mentioned in exhibit 4. He suggests an alternative experiment and expresses his distress at comparing to something that cannot be done. Additionally, he expresses a discrepancy between what he expected to see in figure 2 and what was actually shown in figures 3, 4, and 5.


Passage number 42.
  So I guess— MR. GRUBER.  That’s right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The statements "So I guess" and "That's right" suggest agreement or confirmation.


Passage number 43.
 MR. BULLARD. —what’s the connection.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage is simply stating a question posed by Mr. Bullard, without indicating any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 44.
 MR. GRUBER.  I think you’re right, your interpretation of the black line is correct here.  On average in previous tightening cycles, we have seen a slight depreciation of the dollar, because tightening likely has been priced in before the actual event of the interest rate increase, as you would expect.  Honestly, this was just highlighting the risk more.  What people probably are seeing is the risk of the forecast.  But I think you’re exactly right, we don’t really have a very good idea of what’s going to happen to the dollar post-liftoff, and it’s possible that it would fall.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Both speakers agree that the interpretation of the black line is correct and that the future movement of the dollar post-liftoff is uncertain.


Passage number 45.
 MR. POTTER.  So in most of these episodes, China’s not important.  In 2004, they’re important.  They start appreciating against the U.S. dollar in 2005.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states a fact about China's importance in different episodes and their appreciation against the U.S. dollar in a specific year.


Passage number 46.
 MR. BULLARD.  Oh, sure, you’re averaging across these past periods, which are different.  Absolutely.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker is expressing agreement with the previous statement.


Passage number 47.
 MR. GRUBER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There isn't enough information provided to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage about Mr. Gruber.


Passage number 48.
  So the currency composition— MR. POTTER.  But the China one would be a big one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not suggest any contention or disagreement. It simply mentions that the China currency would be significant.


Passage number 49.
 MR. GRUBER. We took this to basically a further 10 percent appreciation of the dollar just because I think that’s the risk that we had in mind, but that’s not to say that’s the only thing that could happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Gruber, is expressing his personal opinion about the potential risk of a 10 percent appreciation of the dollar. However, he acknowledges that there are other possibilities that could occur aside from what he mentioned.


Passage number 50.
 MR. BULLARD.  Well, one interpretation of this figure 2 is that a lot of the action is ahead of the tightening cycle because it’s all pulled forward in financial markets.  Then, after you get past the initiation of the cycle, other things happen in the economy, and you don’t know what those are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It presents different possibilities and acknowledges uncertainty about future events.


Passage number 51.
 MR. GRUBER. That’s in line with our forecast, I would say, with this relatively flat forecast path of the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Gruber, is simply stating that the forecast for the dollar aligns with their previously anticipated path.


Passage number 52.
 MR. KAMIN.  President Bullard, I think I would add, exactly apropos of the point that you made, that we have another alternative simulation in the Tealbook that highlights the possibility that foreign growth is a little faster than we expect, and as a result of that faster growth, the dollar depreciates.  And that’s exactly the type of thing that could be reflected in the depreciation of the dollar, shown in this average of past tightening cycles, that the FOMC tightening is already built in beforehand, and then new information arises afterward.  And, as a result, the dollar can go up or down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply discussing alternative simulations and the potential effects on the dollar's depreciation or appreciation.


Passage number 53.
 MR. BULLARD.  All right.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are simply thanking each other and addressing each other respectfully.


Passage number 54.
MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Number one, still on panel 2 of exhibit 7, am I not correct, Joe, that the past tightening cycles that you’ve averaged were ones in which there was already a fair amount of divergence between U.S. policy rates and policy rates in at least two out of the three important central banks for our purposes, which is to say, the Bundesbank, the ECB, and the Bank of Japan.  And, number two, in none of these circumstances, obviously, have there been six years of more or less coincident rates, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is a clarification being sought in the passage, but there is no disagreement or contention.


Passage number 55.
 MR. GRUBER.  That’s correct.  I think you’re right in pointing out that in 1994, there was policy divergence already at that point, but like you said, we were both headed in the same direction, but basically at different paces.  So in some sense the divergence is a little different this time because we’ve had six years, basically, of the same rates, and things are going in different directions at this point. And so you see that the much faster realized appreciation of the dollar going into this tightening episode is probably a reflection of that, right.  So we’ve had, what, a 16 percent rise in the dollar since middle of last year, and I think that’s not something we’ve seen around other tightenings. CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions. [No response]  Okay.  Why don’t we begin the round, and I’m going to call on President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It is a conversation where Mr. Gruber is agreeing with the point made by another person and adding his own perspective.


Passage number 56.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Economic conditions in the Fifth District have changed little in recent months.  The overall tone of our contacts and survey respondents remains positive, though there are pockets of weakness associated with energy production and exports.  Preliminary December numbers for our manufacturing composite index remain basically at a neutral level, and reports received from our contacts were mixed.  Bright spots  include aerospace, power generation equipment, medical equipment, and the auto industry, in which several new plants are being built in our District.  Weakness appears concentrated among export-related businesses.  An illustrative comment came from a chemical manufacturer in North Carolina who said that his export business was down sharply, off 25 percent, but domestic business was up 15 percent. Contacts at our large defense contractors are reporting a much more positive outlook as a result of the budget deal.  They welcome the increased funding, of course, but they also noted that the extended time horizon was reducing uncertainty and allowed them to plan, hire, and invest. Lower natural gas prices have resulted in reduced drilling activity in the Marcellus region.  Pipeline construction to connect existing wells is still active, however. Residential real estate markets continued to improve at a moderate pace. We hear that some homebuyers are entering the market anticipating rate increases ahead, but shortages of buildable lots and labor are said to be driving up costs and limiting single-family construction activity. Our bankers say that demand for credit is growing and credit quality is improving, but competition is still fierce for good borrowers.  They say that TRID, the new closing document requirement, is increasing mortgage origination costs, and that it is going to be difficult for small community banks to afford to do any mortgage lending. The struggle to find qualified workers continues across a range of occupations.  My favorite anecdote this time is that construction companies are posting armed guards at work sites to discourage the poaching of construction crews.  And, finally, in the category of “be careful what you wish for,” we hear of sizable hiring plans at large D.C. law firms. Turning to the national economy, I agree with the Tealbook’s assessment that the outlook has not changed much since our previous meeting.  I’ll touch on just a few significant developments.  First, consumer spending is obviously the key to the outlook.  Although the reports on real PCE were weak in September and October, there were quirks each month that reduced their signal value, and retail sales ex gasoline were up significantly in November.  I expect consumer spending to continue to grow at around 3 percent for at least another year, bolstered by strong income growth, good job prospects, and a solid household balance sheet. Second, we are seeing some signs of increasing wage growth in the data, and that fits well with the many reports we have seen about shortages of skilled workers and growing wage pressures.  It seems plausible now that we will see a pickup in wage gains next year, something that should support a healthy household sector. Third, the federal budget agreement should provide a direct boost to overall economic activity next year.  Not only does it add to outlays in the near term, but, as I said, some firms in our District report that it reduces uncertainty, a development that should itself encourage spending. One source of concern of late is that manufacturing diffusion indexes have been noticeably soft, including our own Fifth District index.  At the same time, though, the Board’s industrial production index for manufacturing as a whole has been rising at a modest pace.  Thinking about how those two types of sources aggregate disparate sectors, I am more confident in the Board’s index, so I share the staff’s view that total manufacturing output should continue to advance even in the face of further strength in the dollar. In sum, recent developments line up well with the Tealbook’s forecast of above-trend real GDP growth next year.  I wrote down 2.4 percent, which is not that far from the Tealbook.  I partcompany with the staff a bit on the near-term inflation outlook, however.  In the absence of shocks, I think it is reasonable to look for headline and core inflation to make substantial progress toward 2 percent next year.  In any case, there is substantial uncertainty about the inflation outlook over the next two years, and we need to keep this in mind as we craft language on policy guidance.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a summary of economic conditions in the Fifth District and the national economy.


Passage number 57.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As a final sounding of my District’s contacts before the possible liftoff decision at this meeting, my team met with a large number of business leaders across the Sixth District.  The spread of interviews was fairly representative of the national industrial mix. Businesses appear to be ready for and supportive of a rate increase coming from this meeting.  This support seemed to be based on a broadly held view that business activity is expanding at more or less the same moderate pace that we’ve seen for most of the recovery.  Overall, I would characterize the outlook of the majority of our contacts as “restrained optimism.” Major employers indicated that demand for workers continues to grow, and wage growth appears to be firming.  Pockets of softness were reported, as expected, in regions and industries with concentrations in oil exploration and refining.  Companies with significant ties to commodity production also reported slowing, as did some manufacturing firms. Continuing heightened inventory levels were mentioned frequently as a potential source of production weakness in the near term.  This contrasts somewhat with the Tealbook’s more benign view of the inventory situation.  Even in the auto industry, whose sales are very strong, we heard concern about inventory trends.  Our director, who heads the nation’s largest auto retailer, mentioned a recent surge in inventories partially fueled by imports.  Apparently, automanufacturers with global operations had been redirecting shipments to the United States as the market they consider as having the best prospects for excess global inventory absorption.  He offered the opinion that, in the near term, the pace of sales can absorb the heightened inventories, but he expressed concern about whether the historic high sales pace is sustainable. Although earlier in the year we heard references to logistics bottlenecks—most prominently the Long Beach port strike—as contributing to the inventory buildup.  In this cycle, we heard more emphasis on disappointing sales.  In that regard, consumer spending reports were mixed.  Several contacts said they expect significant price discounting in coming weeks to move unsold stocks. Regarding business investment, our chair, who participates in the Business Roundtable, noted a downshift in the composite business outlook of the group and, with that, a sharp reduction in anticipated capital expenditures over the next six months. Despite some concerns, most of our contacts are expecting continued moderate expansion of business activities.  They are seeing the glass as half full.  Along with their support for liftoff, we heard broad support for taking a cautious approach to the pace of normalization until underlying points of strength in business conditions can be confirmed. In my outlook for the U.S. economy, I’ve lowered my forecast of near-term real GDP growth a little, in order to reflect the cautious sentiment we detected along with the mixed data picture.  This puts my growth outlook pretty much into line with this meeting’s Tealbook forecast. I’ve also lowered our projection of headline inflation for 2016, as has the Tealbook. We recently surveyed businesses once again about their “business-input inflation” expectations.  While cost expectations of firms are more or less unchanged from earlier surveys, we picked up notable differences in perspective from industry to industry.  Our data on  businesses in the retail industry and manufacturing showed slippage in year-ahead cost expectations compared with this time last year. We’re not prepared to conclude that these moves are an early signal of a more broadly based downshift in inflation expectations of businesses, but they may be an additional cautionary note regarding inflation expectations. In updating my forecast for this meeting’s SEP submission, the trend of inflation expectation readings was hard to ignore.  Six months ago, we were getting different readings from financial markets and household surveys.  Now, it’s my sense that the various indicators of inflation expectations are more in alignment, and so it’s a little harder to claim that expectations remain anchored at levels near the Committee’s target. In my projections for 2016, even as I’ve lowered my estimate of headline inflation, I’m treating recently softening inflation expectations as representing a risk to the outlook.  Consistent with that treatment, my balance of risk perspective has the risks to growth and employment as balanced, while I have inflation risks showing a downside bias.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

Passage number 59.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  After waiting many, many years, the whole world is holding its breath to see what happens this week.  I’m referring, of course, to the plot of the new Star Wars movie [laughter], but we face a decision of cosmic importance here as well. Since our previous meeting, the data have evolved largely as expected—in fact, even a little better—leaving little doubt about the strength and resilience of the expansion.  Real GDP growth remains on track, bolstered by solid consumer and business spending.  The economy is poised to enter the new year with good underlying momentum.  Indeed, I see growth continuing above trend in 2016. I see the risks to the outlook as balanced.  On the downside, the restraining effects of earlier dollar appreciation may spill over into the coming year, and the threat of further slowdowns in the euro area or East Asia remain. By contrast, sagging energy prices could spur consumer spending further in the near term, and data on household formation suggest some upside risk in the housing market. With continued above-trend growth, we made significant progress toward our employment goal.  Job growth has been especially strong, averaging over 200,000 per month for most of the past few years, and my own District has been leading the charge.  For job growth over the past 12 months, 7 of our 9 states are ranked in the top 10, and this group includes states that were hit the hardest by the housing bust and the financial crisis, such as California, Nevada, and Arizona.  Clearly, these states had to climb out of a deep hole, but it is reassuring that they, too, are mostly recovered despite lingering economic and financial headwinds. With national unemployment at my estimate of the natural rate of 5 percent, I see the labor market as very close to our maximum employment goal.  Even if we consider the individuals who are not active labor market participants but state that they want a job, the news is good. The size of that broad group has fallen dramatically over the past year and is now largely in line with levels observed in the past two expansions when the unemployment rate reached 5percent.  Other labor market indicators such as perceptions of job availability, job openings, and difficulty filling jobs are near or above their levels associated with full employment. Looking ahead, with above-trend GDP growth next year, my SEP submission has the labor market overshooting our full employment target by a substantial margin.  Indeed, since our previous meeting, I’ve lowered my expected path for the unemployment rate.  I now expect it to fall to 4½ percent this year.  Looking further ahead, I see growth needing to fall back to slightly below potential in order to get the unemployment rate back to its natural rate, which I see as happening in 2018.  Therefore, in my SEP submission, I actually have in 2017 and 2018 growth of about 1¾ percent, which is below my estimate of trend.  Now, this has nothing to do with the Phillips curve or anything—it’s simply the arithmetic of having an unemployment rate of 4½ percent and wanting it to move back to my natural rate of 5 percent in the next few years. The sustained period of labor market overheating should increase upward pressure on inflation and offset some of the lingering disinflationary pressures associated with the pass-through of lower import and energy costs into core prices. I expect inflation will gradually move back to our target of 2 percent by the end of 2017, and I’ll note that I am SEP respondent number 16. In terms of my SEP submission, I put in liftoff for this meeting and, consistent with my view of the outlook, have four increases in the funds rate next year and five in 2017.  Then, in 2018, I have the funds rate reaching my estimate of the nominal natural rate of 3¼ percent. Now I’ll turn to a topic that’s garnered a great deal of attention in the Twelfth District but also nationwide, and that’s the burgeoning commercial real estate boom.  In hot metro areas in the Twelfth District, such as Silicon Valley, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle, investor interest has driven commercial properties up to new highs.  Rental rates in some cases haven’t kept pace, and that’s pushed cap rates way down, reportedly into the 3s for some properties. This upward trajectory in prices and the decline in cap rate show no signs of abating.  This activity has been spurred, in part, by foreign investors, especially those from China who are seeking a relative safe haven for their capital investments and who are willing to accept abnormally low returns. The market for multifamily housing in my District’s leading metro areas has been even hotter than the one for commercial real estate overall.  Prices of apartment buildings in San Francisco and Silicon Valley have left their previous peaks in the dust and continue to soar. Although prices for commercial real estate have skyrocketed in these key markets, rising construction activity has been more moderate. Nonresidential construction activity has increased, but growth in this segment pales in comparison with past booms. Construction activity in multifamily housing is up more substantially.  However, this appears to largely reflect pent-up demand for new apartments and condos rather than speculative overbuilding.  Indeed, my contacts tell me that regulatory constraints on new building, particularly in the hot markets in my District, have kept a lid on the construction boom, at least so far.  In fact, it’s one of the few times when business people have actually told me that the regulatory burden has been serving a useful purpose. In line with the surge in multifamily construction, community banks in the Twelfth District have seen rapid growth in this segment of their loan portfolios.  However, danger signs in this market, such as loose lending standards and excessive leverage, remain largely absent. The bottom line on conditions in commercial and multifamily markets is that although they’re not yet flashing red, the potential for imbalances merits close monitoring.  Turning back to the national scene:  The progress we’ve made toward our goals for the past year is remarkable. Truly with us, the Force is.  [Laughter]  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Powell.

 MR. TARULLO. Top that one, Governor Powell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is a simple statement without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 61.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On a more serious note, my forecast has not changed a great deal since the September SEP submission. I see real GDP growth continuing modestly above the potential rate, although a bit slower in 2016 than the Tealbook growth forecast at 2½ percent, due to the headwinds arising from the external sector. The unemployment rate has declined six-tenths so far this year, and I continue to expect that it will decline to 4½ percent by the end of 2016 and remain near there in 2017 and 2018.  I see core inflation moving up to 1½ percent next year and to around 2 percent in 2017, as the economy tightens and as the effects of a strong dollar and lower oil prices eventually fade. The two strong employment reports for October and November totaling a little more than 500,000 new jobs provide solid evidence to me that the economy is continuing to expand at an above-trend rate.  Payrolls are now averaging comfortably above 200,000 for all of 2015 and for the past three months.  Layoffs are low and job openings are high.  I see continued growth supported by solid increases in consumer spending, reflecting a much-improved labor market, rising incomes, and an elevated wealth-to-income ratio.  In addition, residential investment and business investment outside the energy sector seem to be on a solid footing.  Fiscal policy is now supporting the economy, rather than holding it back.  The drag on aggregate demand due to the behavior of the external sector will continue, but that drag hasn’t been sufficient to slow the economy below trend. The amount of remaining slack is probably modest, but there is enough uncertainty about the location of supply-side constraints to counsel a cautious approach in removing accommodation.  Without trying to address every margin of slack, I’d like to mention three areas in support of that.  First, while the unemployment rate of 5 percent is at or close to many estimates of the natural rate, I don’t yet see persuasive signs of an acceleration in compensation. The one indicator that does show a strong uptick is compensation per hour, and that is the highly volatile one, just as Governor Brainard said.  So I don’t see a sustainable or broad-based increase at all there, much as I stare at the graph.  Such signs would be a welcome indicator of labor market tightness. Second, I would point to the labor force participation rate, which, at least to me, has been disappointing so far this year after remaining more or less flat for 18 months.  It’s now dropped four-tenths, but there is good reason to expect that participation will return to trend and probably exceed trend in the next couple of years on this path. The Tealbook estimate of the cyclical participation shortfall is about 30 basis points, consistent with the canonical paper by our staff—Stephanie Aaronson, Bill Wascher, and four others.  In the Tealbook forecast, participation moves sideways and in doing so reaches trend by around the end of 2016 and then actually moves slightly above trend thereafter, which is consistent with past recoveries. In fact, in the past two recoveries, participation has risen to roughly 50 basis points above trend late in the cycle when wages are rising and the unemployment rate is low. I would also point to a good deal of interesting research that has documented the damage done to the labor force from long and deep recessions, and here I’m thinking of the work by Greg Howard, Rob Martin, and Beth Anne Wilson here at the Board, among others, for example.  The bottom line is that I’m not in any hurry to conclude that the current low level of participation reflects immutable structural factors.Inflation provides a third reason for caution.  More recent movements in the dollar and oil should exert some downward pressure on prices for a while longer, although the staff estimates they would be modest.  Although no one can predict the timing with any confidence, oil and the dollar will eventually stabilize, and inflation will increase mechanically as a result.  That’s my forecast, but I will admit that that analysis leaves me with some degree of unease. In addition, although inflation expectations are broadly stable, they do appear to be under some downward pressure, and this is a challenge that the Committee simply has to meet.  The fact that we’re much more likely than anyone would like to return to the zero lower bound makes this all the more important.  Market participants should look back on this period and be convinced that the Committee is determined to get back to 2 percent inflation and is willing to run some risk of overshooting on resource utilization to do that, and only our behavior can carry that burden. With that background, I have shifted to a slightly lower path for the policy rate in this SEP.  I assume liftoff at this meeting and a total of three increases of 25 basis points each for 2016 and three more in 2017.  I believe that for the next couple of years, economic weakness around the world will mean that the Committee can and should remove accommodation only gradually. I would conclude by commenting briefly on recent conditions in leveraged finance markets, which have been a topic today and for the past couple of weeks.  These markets have been in a correction since about midyear, particularly for the most risky assets, such as those rated triple-C or lower or not rated at all, and particularly among energy firms.  The Third Avenue announcement last week that the firm would refuse to allow withdrawals has put significant further pressure on these markets, and while the situation warrants careful monitoring, it’s worth saying that sharp changes in sentiment and liquidity are not at all unusual in leveraged finance markets. I can’t say—no one can really say—whether this will portend a sustained turn in the credit cycle, but for now I don’t see this correction as having important implications for the real economy or for monetary policy.  In fact, given that rates are likely to stay low for several more years, there remain powerful incentives to reach for yield, and many professionals are saying that this is the best and, in fact, the first real buying opportunity in several years.  This isn’t a forecast, but it would not surprise me if, after all of this settles out, the leveraged finance markets return to a boil in the first half of 2016 after this correction.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Lyon.

Passage number 62.
 MR. LYON.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The Ninth District economy is expanding, but growth is modest and uneven.  There’s little evidence of rising inflation. The strong dollar and slower growth in foreign economies are contributing to weaknesses in the District’s industrial, agriculture, energy, and mining sectors. At the same time, urban areas are generally continuing to grow.  Unemployment in the Twin Cities area fell to 2.9 percent in October, the lowest rate among metropolitan areas of 1 million or more.  Notwithstanding this low unemployment, the BLS reports that the core CPI for Minneapolis–St. Paul increased only 1.1 percent from the first half of 2014 to the first half of 2015. The same combination of modest growth and low inflation prevails nationally and bears on the Committee’s deliberations.  In its October statement, the Committee specified two conditions for raising rates at this meeting:  further improvement in the labor markets and reasonable confidence that inflation would return to 2 percent over the medium term.  I think there’s no doubt that the U.S. labor market has improved since October across a range of metrics, so I’ll focus my remaining remarks on the outlook for inflation. Core PCE inflation has been quite stable over the past year, running close to 1.3 percent.  Although today’s CPI report shows some improvement, the CPI data still do not appear strong enough to bring the PCE inflation rate back to 2 percent.  The fact that core inflation is running consistently below target is important in light of the research literature on forecasting inflation.  This literature has repeatedly shown that it’s hard to improve on a forecast that equates future headline inflation to the recent trend value for core inflation.  As in October, such a forecast predicts that headline inflation will run below our 2 percent target. In particular, the literature shows that adding the unemployment rate or other measures of economic activity alongside lags of core inflation does not notably improve forecast accuracy.  Thus, we should not be very confident that continuing improvements in labor markets will automatically push up inflation. It is true that headline inflation should rise toward core inflation as recent transitory declines in energy prices fade, but energy prices will likely play a minor role in the evolution of core inflation.  Stabilization in the foreign exchange value of the dollar will help to stabilize import prices, which in turn will contribute to a modest uptick in core inflation.  But with disinflationary trends in place in most of the major exporting nations and currency values notoriously unpredictable, we shouldn’t count on import prices to restore U.S. inflation to target.  What about other ways to gauge the likely direction of future inflation.  Unfortunately, as has been the case for some time, neither market-based nor survey-based measures of inflation expectations instill much confidence that inflation is returning to our 2 percent target over the medium term.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain near their historic lows. Survey-based measures have edged downward and are also near historic lows. In sum, I see little reason to be more confident now than in October that inflation will return to 2 percent in the medium term.  In the next round, I’ll discuss how this may raise communication challenges for the Committee. Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.

Passage number 77.
 WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I unequivocally support alternative B as written.  The data convincingly support this decision, according to the conditions that we laid out.  Job growth has come in stronger than expected, and broad measures of labor underutilization have continued to improve.  It appears likely that the economy will exceed full employment next year by even more than I had anticipated just a few months ago. Incoming price inflation data remain low, but this weakness largely reflects dollar appreciation and declines in energy and commodity prices.  These transitory factors should dissipate as labor markets really start to be stretched next year, and I’m confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent target over the next couple of years. The downside risks to the outlook have also fallen substantially.  Fears of a sharp slowdown in China have diminished, and a federal fiscal battle appears to have been avoided. The resilience of the economy over the past few months in the face of those headwinds has also been encouraging. Of course, the flip side of starting normalization now is, we can signal that the appropriate path will also be quite gradual, and the language in the statement does just that.  Slow and steady increases in the funds rate should provide an appropriate tightening of broader financial conditions to maintain moderate growth and full employment in the face of continuing headwinds. I also support the language in paragraph 5 that signals that the reinvestment will continue until the funds rate normalization is well under way.  This approach is supported by both communications and risk-management considerations.  For the next year or so, it’s desirable to keep policy focused on our traditional tool of monetary policy, the short-term interest rate.  Such a focus will concentrate the public’s attention on our policy message; center policy rate expectations; and, I hope, minimize confusion.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Evans.

Passage number 78.
 MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support alternative B today, in large part because of its important state-dependent characterization of our gradual adjustment path. I find today to be a tough call.  I think the risk-management case for delay until mid-2016 remains strong.  Core PCE inflation continues to run well below our 2 percent objective.  Some of our best medium-term r* measures are at zero or below, and the statistical models suggest they could be very low for a long time.  In a global environment full of low-inflation risks, I think uncertainty arguments weigh strongly for further delay while we monitor inflation for signs of revival toward 2 percent.  After all, we know how to raise rates if inflation heads too high, but we don’t like our toolbox nearly as much if we face renewed disinflationary pressures.  But the   big weakness in the argument for alternative A today is that most of our recent monetary policy communications by this Committee have signaled that data conditions and our outlook have met the threshold for liftoff. Acting today seems appropriate to me as long as our first move is accompanied by a communication strategy that indicates that our initial adjustments will be gradual.  This strategy also needs to be clear that the path is state dependent, based on further confirmation that we are on track to achieve our dual-mandate goals over the medium term.  I believe that alternative B as written provides this clarity and strikes a reasonable balance among competing concerns. Another important feature in alternative B is the language in paragraph 4 stating that the shortfall of inflation from 2 percent means the Committee needs to give special consideration to actual and expected progress toward our inflation target.  This language recognizes reality.  It acknowledges that the main challenge we face today is getting inflation back up to target.  It appropriately emphasizes our concern over this policy shortfall, and it seems about as close as we can get today to saying that we are committed to a symmetric inflation target. As I’ve discussed here many times before, if we act as if our target is actually a ceiling, it will be all that much harder for us to ever achieve our policy mandate.  Most of us have said that we think we have a symmetric inflation target. Let’s make sure we also act as if we do.  And I hope that we will talk more about symmetry in January during the annual review of our longer-run goals and policy strategy.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing support for alternative B and providing reasons for their stance. They also express agreement with the language and strategies outlined in alternative B.


Passage number 79.
 MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as written.  It is positive news that the economy is finally at the point at which it is appropriate to get off the zero lower bound, a point we should continue to contemplate. Labor markets have certainly improved, and it was good news that the past two employment reports have been so positive.  I am reasonably confident that inflation will reach 2 percent, at least in part based on the current tightness in the labor market.  However, as I highlighted yesterday, the biggest risk to my forecast is that inflation does not rise to 2 percent as anticipated, similar to the comments that President Evans just made. As we raise rates, I would suggest that we continue along that path only as our confidence that our inflation target will be met improves from reasonable to high.  Since I expect the tangible evidence of movement toward our inflation target to be slow, I am quite comfortable with a normalization path that incorporates only a gradual increase in rates.  If we don’t move from reasonable confidence to high confidence, I could easily imagine a pace of normalization slower than in my SEP. Today we do not need to decide the path, and I am confident that it is appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Rosengren expresses his support for alternative B and outlines his reasons for believing that the economy is at a point to raise rates. He also highlights the risks to his forecast and suggests that the path of rate increases should be based on improving confidence in meeting the inflation target. There is no mention of any disagreement or conflicting views.


Passage number 80.
 MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, and I’m satisfied that the statement as written will serve as effective communication of the Committee’s momentous decision in alternative B. I’d like to spend a couple of minutes sharing some anticipatory thoughts on possible implications of the sentence in paragraph 4 that begins “In light of the current shortfall of inflation.” This sentence calls out inflation as the focus of attention as we go through 2016 and, since the Committee’s decisions will be data dependent, suggests that the inflation data will significantly influence subsequent policy rate decisions.  The SEP dot chart looks as though it will set up an expectation of rate increases on a schedule of every other meeting.  The word “gradual,” used twice in the alternative B statement, will, to some extent, take its definition from the SEP.  So, assuming a move in January is a virtual nonstarter, which I do, the expectation will be for a second policy rate move in March. In the spirit of an “eyes wide open” approach, I think it’s worth considering what we will likely know at the time of the March meeting. We will have the February CPI data arriving on the second day of that meeting.  We will have PCE price data only through January.  With the continuing softness in oil, gasoline, and commodity prices, it seems to me likely that the inflation data we will have in hand will be very weak.  The Tealbook, in fact, suggests zero for the headline inflation number for the first quarter.  At this juncture, I have no reason to dispute the Tealbook projection.  The Chair pointed out yesterday that we might have a small uptick in the year-over-year headline and core PCE readings because January 2015 was extremely weak. Even so, an inflation-data-dependent decision to raise the policy rate a second time in March could be problematic, it seems to me. As I said at the beginning of my comments, I support the statement as written. Nonetheless, I’m a little concerned about how we will operationalize the criterion of actual and expected progress toward our inflation goal in the early part of next year.  I doubt we will have inflation statistics that are supportive of a conclusion that progress is being made.  We may have to rely once more on employment data, along with the faith-based expectations drawn from our forecasts.  The emphasis may have to remain on the expected, rather than the actual, inflation evidence. My overall point is a small one, really:  It’s one thing to project from the SEP exercise a forecast-based median level of the funds rate at year-end 2016.  It may well be another thing tomake post-liftoff rate decisions in real time, especially in March, before those forecasts have had much validation.  So before the ink is long dry on today’s statement, we may well be advised to start thinking about how to make subsequent policy decisions and, very importantly, how to communicate the nuances of data dependence when the data are less complete or more ambiguous than we would like.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is the personal opinion of Mr. Lockhart and he is expressing his concerns and thoughts on the topic.


Passage number 81.
 MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  For the past several meetings, I’ve been convinced that economic conditions warranted an increase in our target federal funds rate range.  This was based on a sense that labor markets were in line with our best assessments of what constitutes full employment and on confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent once the most recent disinflationary impulse has passed.  Since then, as I discussed in our earlier go-round, the economic reports for the United States haven’t appreciably altered that assessment.  So I continue to see a rate increase as well justified, and I support alternative B.  It’s great to be able to say that. With this first rate increase effectively behind us, market attention is going to focus on the guidance we provide in the statement regarding the prospective funds rate path.  Many Committee participants, myself included, have been saying that they expect the pace of the funds rate increases to be gradual.  As a result, market participants probably expect to see the word “gradual” in the statement.  As drafted, the statement does a great job of that. It includes it twice—once in paragraph 2, in which we refer to “gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,” and then again down in paragraph 4, in which we refer to “only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”  These are both new elements.  My sense is that this statement could well   push down the expected path of short-term rates.  I don’t think pushing down the expected path of short-term rates would be a desirable outcome. As we saw yesterday, markets already expect a funds rate path substantially below the path embodied in the median SEP or the staff’s forecast.  And according to the Tealbook, the market’s uncertainty about the pace of tightening is well below the levels seen during the previous tightening episodes, and I thought that evidence was quite striking. Under those circumstances, we should avoid pushing down market expectations of the funds rate path even further, but I’m willing to support the statement as written.  However, I think we’re running a risk here of exacerbating the disconnect between the market’s expectations of the funds rate path and ours, and I hope that doesn’t happen. I also see a risk that emphasizing a gradual path could reinforce the excessive sense of certainty in markets about that path, and that that could impede the adjustment of market expectations if the economic outlook starts to change materially in either direction, as Governor Fischer emphasized. We should provide guidance to markets about how we will react to incoming data whenever we can, and I think the new sentence in paragraph 4 that President Lockhart discussed, which refers to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, seems to be a constructive element that does so.  But a heavy stress on the word “gradual” could dampen the market’s responsiveness to incoming data.  If anything, based on the Tealbook’s assessment of the market’s current lack of uncertainty about rates, I think it would be worthwhile to encourage markets to be less certain about the future path of rates. I have a suggestion regarding communications for use either in the press conference or more generally for all of us, and this is a “bipartisan” suggestion.  Lately, the answer to questions about the pace of increases seems to be a one-word mantra, “gradual.”  And it seems to have  emerged as this cycle’s replacement for the two-word mantra of “measured pace,” which, during the past tightening cycle, came to be understood to mean precisely a quarter-point increase per meeting.  So I’d suggest that our mantra should be a four-word phrase, “gradual but data dependent,” in order to emphasize that responding to economic conditions takes precedent over implied past promises to proceed at any particular pace.  In other words, we shouldn’t say the word “gradual” without saying “but data dependent.”  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their support for a rate increase and the inclusion of the word "gradual" in the statement, but also raises concerns about market expectations and the need for flexibility based on incoming data.


Passage number 82.
 MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As everyone will have inferred from my remarks yesterday, I don’t think it’s appropriate policy to raise rates today.  Even if one is inclined toward the transitory factors hypothesis, today seems an odd moment to declare reasonable confidence that inflation will return to the Committee’s stated 2 percent target, what with the further declines in oil prices, the expected extension of strong dollar effects, the CPI reading earlier in the week, and the number of concerns expressed here yesterday about inflation expectations.  In light of the number of important questions about whether inflation dynamics have changed in recent years, as well as about the labor market, I continue to believe it more prudent for the Committee to act more on evidence than on faith that traditional economic patterns and relationships will reassert themselves. Again, I don’t deny that these patterns may reemerge, but it’s far from certain.  And with numerous tightening tools available in an economy that is not running very hot but with an unappealing set of options were more accommodation to be needed, I think it wise to be particularly certain of the directions of inflation and the economy before raising rates, thereby diminishing the chances of this latter eventuality.  My policy preference is captured fairly well   by alternative A, though I would remove the sentence in paragraph 3 about providing additional accommodation. Of course, I’ve asked myself what the best argument for acting today is and have listened to or read the views of many others on this topic.  It seems the best reason to act lies not in the economics we face at today’s meeting, but in the fact that many on the Committee and, more recently, a particularly influential member thereof have intimated that we’re going to do so.  I’ve noted in the past that one shouldn’t follow through on an ill-advised policy just because one has said one might adopt that policy, but I have to admit that, at this point, the credibility of the FOMC is at some risk since many in the markets and the public believe that the FOMC promised September, then didn’t act, and has now promised December. This poses some disturbing institutional issues—most important, the question of whether the Committee is to be pushed into action through arguably premature or overbroad public statements.  That is an important issue, and maybe it should bear discussion at some point in the Committee.  But, speaking for myself at this meeting, I wasn’t a part of this, and, as many will recall, I’ve advised against this pattern of frequent public comments with frequent references to particular meetings. Despite all of that, I will reluctantly go along with alternative B today for two reasons. First, there is the institutional reality that there’s enormous significance attached out there to a member of the Board voting against the Chair’s position.  Perhaps this shouldn’t be this way and we might be better off with the culture of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee, but reality is what it is. This moment of liftoff after seven years would be a particularly bad time to enter a dissent and thereby risk the Chair’s leadership position at a critical moment in monetary policy, which may face some considerable challenges in the months ahead.  Second, the Committee’s decision today as shaped by the Chair is, at least by its terms, not just for the rate rise, but also for an approach to monetary policy over the next year, one that is presumptively gradual and, with the addition of the language on inflation to paragraph 4, emphasizes what I’ve been suggesting—that is, it pays particular attention to whether inflation plays out as today’s SEP suggests it will. I requested such language and feel that its inclusion provides some basis for my going along with what is a broader policy orientation than just the federal funds rate increase.  And, as I suggested yesterday, the transitory factors hypothesis is plausible. I hope this orientation will mean that I’ll be closer to the majority of the Committee in assessing the economy—and inflation, in particular—as we go forward.  After all, even though I do think some secular changes in the economy may be playing an important role in affecting inflation, my baseline expectation is still for a gradual upward movement next year.  Because of the questions that I discussed yesterday, I just don’t have enough confidence to act on those expectations right now. I was going to omit this statement.  I had written this out last night, and I crossed it out this morning.  But, having just listened to several other comments, I recognize that others may differ, and I may be left concluding at a future meeting that faith has trumped empirics too much.  I have to confess, I already hear some effort to undermine the language that has been inserted, so I’m afraid I do anticipate that I may have some differences with the majority of the Committee in the future.  I hope not. I have one final point, though.  My focus on evidence and pragmatics is not one way.  It’s not a position of principled or devoted dovishness.  If, for example, inflation were to begin moving well ahead of what the Committee expects in a way that suggested a trend, I would not  be averse to taking quicker action despite my current instinct that things have changed in the economy in some pretty basic ways over the past 10 or so years.  And it’s for that reason that I actually would not want any stronger language in the statement committing us to a gradual approach or to reinvestment.  I never thought that it’s a particularly good idea to remove the kind of optionality that one wants to maintain up until the point of a decision.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kaplan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply expresses their own views and preferences about raising rates, while also acknowledging the views of others on the committee. They ultimately state that they will reluctantly go along with the majority decision.


Passage number 83.
 MR. KAPLAN.  Thank you, Chair Yellen.  I am in favor of alternative B as written.  I believe it is time to begin the process of normalizing policy, and I am very mindful of the fact, as we have discussed, that monetary policy operates with a lag. I do believe we will likely need to maintain some level of accommodation for some period because of slower growth outside the United States—in particular, severe overcapacity and overleverage in China, which will likely push down rates of growth there for some extended period; aging demographics in the United States, which are likely to negatively affect workforce participation rates; and, in addition, the end of the so-called debt supercycle globally, which means that if there are debt increases in the future, they will need to be primarily supported by income growth. In light of all of these factors, though, I agree with the plan to remove accommodation gradually and assess and reassess conditions as we go.  I also agree with the tone of our statement and ongoing communications, which emphasize our intention to move gradually; an explanation that this means we are likely to remain accommodative even after this increase, and that, even after a couple of more moves, that still means we have some degree of   accommodation; and an emphasis that we will be data and state dependent on the upside as well as the downside. In 2016, I expect to see GDP grow 2 or 2½ percent, driven primarily by strength in the services sector, and that manufacturing will remain weak.  I do expect the unemployment rate to continue to decline, further reducing labor market slack, and I think that inflation will move up, but gradually, eventually converging to 2 percent. As we do this, I do believe markets have been well communicated with or set up, so they should be able to process these moves, although there will be bouts of volatility and some market illiquidity because of the structure of the investment industry, particularly as it’s developed in the past number of years.  This volatility may be driven higher, particularly if corporate earnings continue to be sluggish, which I think is a distinct possibility.  Some amount of market revaluation may be healthy, though, particularly with P/Es and market-cap-to-GDP measures at historically elevated levels.  So I wouldn’t want to necessarily over-read or overreact to some level of market volatility, although I’m sure we’ll discuss this further as we go forward.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Brainard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Kaplan, expresses his support for alternative B and agrees with the plan to remove accommodation gradually. He also discusses his expectations for GDP growth, unemployment rate, inflation, and market volatility, but there is no indication of any disagreement or contention.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 84.
 MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I’m heartened by the continued progress on getting Americans back to work and by the prospect that there’s room to pull more prime-age workers back into the labor force.  By contrast, I’m uneasy about the inflation leg of our mandate, and it would be difficult for me to point to any developments in the intermeeting period that have raised my confidence that core inflation will move to our 2 percent target in the next two to three years.For six years now, PCE inflation has averaged below 1.5 percent.  As this is despite substantial monetary accommodation and a substantial gain in resource utilization, it really does suggest that the Phillips curve is inert.  In addition, I’m troubled by hints that the persistent underperformance of inflation may be having some effect on inflation expectations.  Although previously, survey data had remained fairly steady, recent readings of both the Survey of Professional Forecasters and the Michigan survey—and, of course, as Vice Chairman Dudley pointed out yesterday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York surveys—have drifted lower.  This follows a pronounced and persistent deterioration in market-based measures. Moreover, while the risks to domestic activity look relatively balanced, I am wary regarding the fact that that foreign developments could continue to pose downside risks to economic activity and financial conditions.  China is in the midst of navigating a complex of difficult cyclical and structural challenges.  Recent further sharp declines in oil and metals prices underscore ongoing risks to a broader set of emerging markets, which are confronting challenges of their own that could be exacerbated by further terms-of-trade deterioration, weak growth prospects, and difficulties associated with elevated debt burdens.  It would be unwise to dismiss lightly the risk of further bouts of currency volatility or pressure on these economies. I’m also mindful of the fact that there are important risks on the other side—in particular, the risk that inflationary pressures may emerge with greater force than is expected today.  As I take into account the risks on both sides, the combination of asymmetrically greater room to tighten than to ease through conventional means; core inflation stubbornly below its target, with the deterioration we’ve seen in inflation expectations; and downside risks arising from abroad leads me to place somewhat greater weight on the possible regret associated with tightening tooearly than on the possible regret associated with waiting a little longer to see some of these risks play out before moving. I respect, of course, that many other members of the Committee, after lengthy deliberations, have come to a different conclusion.  In that context, those same risk-management considerations argue for great care in what we communicate about the path forward.  Let me highlight three specific aspects.  First, in light of the persistent low readings on inflation, the deterioration in measures of inflation expectations, and the fact that we will be lifting off when actual inflation remains well short of our goal, it’s very important to me to emphasize that future monetary policy will be importantly shaped by the credibility of our commitment to move inflation back to our target.  In our discussion of the likely future path of monetary policy in paragraph 4, I put a lot of weight on the language that calls out inflation developments and progress toward our 2 percent goal as importantly influencing the stance of future policy. Second, the combination of a low neutral rate with slow progress on inflation suggests a greater likelihood of hitting the effective lower bound than in previous decades, when the nominal neutral interest rate was probably much higher.  The lower the longer-term nominal neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to push growth sufficiently below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate well below zero to provide accommodation.  As a result, monetary policy is likely to remain more constrained at the effective lower bound than to be operating at interest rate levels above it.  As the probability of hitting the effective lower bound increases, that asymmetry in our flexibility becomes more pronounced. For this reason, it’s very helpful that the statement provides additional guidance reflecting the Committee’s consideration of our reinvestment policy.  The language in the fifthparagraph clarifying that the Committee anticipates continuing reinvestments “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” helps clarify that future changes in monetary policy initially will rely primarily on the funds rate—our best-understood and most tested policy tool—and will provide more room to respond to negative shocks through conventional monetary tools. Finally, it’s very important to communicate that, based on our understanding of the neutral rate, the path is likely to be more gradual and move to a lower level than has been the case in past tightening cycles.  Recent research by the staff and others has shown that the current neutral rate is extremely low by historical standards and has persisted at a very low level for some time. Furthermore, persistent changes in demographics, productivity growth, risk premiums, and foreign growth suggest that it may remain at a low level well into the future.  As these circumstances are highly unusual, it’s necessary to communicate to the public the effects they will have on monetary policy—namely, that normalization of the policy rate will likely be more gradual than in previous tightening episodes and likely move to a longer-run policy rate below historical norms.  Moreover, the “gradual and low path” message should help reduce the risk of a “tightening tantrum” reaction to liftoff—a reaction that could slow progress toward both of our goals.  For all of these reasons, I place a lot of weight on the message that the pace of normalization is likely to be gradual, albeit data dependent. Let me conclude by saying I appreciate the careful and exhaustive preparations that have been undertaken by the staff, as well as the thoughtful approach of the Chair and the Committee over the past many months to ensure liftoff is operationally well managed and to align public expectations with the Committee’s policy reaction function and outlook. At this critical juncture, I place a very high premium on ensuring the credibility of monetary policy and demonstrating effective control over monetary policy right out of the box.  For that reason, I support the Chair’s preferred approach as laid out in alternative B.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. Ms. Brainard expresses disagreement with the current state of inflation and expresses concern about the potential risks to economic activity and financial conditions. She also mentions that she places greater weight on the risk of tightening too early rather than waiting longer.


Passage number 85.
 MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I will support alternative B today.  The Committee has said that it will raise the federal funds rate when there has been further improvement in the labor market and when the Committee is reasonably confident that inflation will return to the 2 percent objective in the medium term.  I see those tests as met today.  The inflation part of the test, for me, is a closer call, particularly in light of uncertainty about inflation dynamics.  The Committee will need to monitor closely the progress of inflation, and, under the Chair’s leadership, I am more than reasonably confident that we’ll do that.  As I mentioned yesterday, I think it’s likely to be necessary for the economy to run above trend for some time to ensure that inflation does reach our 2 percent target.  If the economy evolves about as expected, I’m prepared to support a very gradual path for rate increases to achieve that outcome.  The statement is up to the task of signaling that the Committee expects to move gradually—again, assuming that the path is about as we expect.  And I would single out the mention of “gradual” twice, which will certainly be noticed.  Let me say that I’m fine with that and am happy to support this statement as written. Finally, I do think it’s right that the market observers will read the SEP and think, “Four increases,” and they know the press conference schedule, so “Let’s focus on March.”  There will be a natural tendency to assume that there’s another increase in March.  Let me just say now that that is not my prior at all.  I have no prior about March.  I wrote down three increases, not four.  I’m very happy to go through, therefore, a six-month period of no rate increases next year, and I would like to see that decision remain open and evolve according to the incoming data.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Harker.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Powell expresses his support for alternative B, discusses the criteria for raising the federal funds rate, and mentions his view on inflation dynamics. He also mentions his preference for a gradual pace of rate increases and his lack of prior expectation for a rate increase in March. Overall, there is no indication of disagreement or contention in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 86.
 MR. HARKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In line with my economic forecast, my position on policy remains that we should raise rates at this meeting, and that the path of future funds rate increases should be gradual and data dependent, to use President Lacker’s language. Given my inflation forecast, I anticipate that this will lead to a rather gradual tightening of policy, and that policy will remain accommodative for some time.  I adopt this position based on the fact that inflation has remained persistently below target and I thus attach some uncertainty to our ability to achieve our inflation target over the medium term.   Placing some weight on these risks implies a policy rate path that is somewhat more accommodative than would be implied by historical behavior.  In particular, I envision at most four rate hikes next year, leaving the funds rate at, say, 1.38 percent at the end of 2016, with subsequent increases to 2.63 percent in 2017 and to 3.5 percent at the end of 2018, which is my view of the long-run neutral funds rate.  However, I should stress that my perspective will be continually updated by the data.  Therefore, I support alternative B, which I believe is in accordance with these views. I would suggest one small change in the language, and that is to delete the clause “and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes” in paragraph 3.  Now, I understand the logic behind the addition of this phrase, but it seems innocuous at best and may just add confusion.  This may be idiosyncratic to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, but, in a discussion of what the wording could possibly mean, there were as many views among the people who were in the Philadelphia Reserve Bank staff’s briefings to me as there are among FOMC participants.  The views ranged from signaling to the markets that the current move should not be interpreted as having any immediate economic effect to indicating that the current move was being made to prevent the Committee from “falling behind the policy curve.”  I think we should, therefore, admit that this language, at least to us at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, is unclear, and I believe we should avoid adding uncertainty to our current policy decision.  While I understand that a change in the language of alternative B at this time is highly unlikely, it is wording I would not want to see carried from statement to statement.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Harker, disagrees with the inclusion of a specific clause in paragraph 3 of alternative B and argues that it adds confusion and uncertainty to the policy decision.


Passage number 87.
   MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B.  The economy’s progress over the past five years is notable, and today’s action is fully consistent, in my view, with our longer-run goals for promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The four policy rules in Tealbook B indicate liftoff is appropriate, and the real federal funds rate lies below the Tealbook-consistent measure of r* by the widest margin within the past 10 years.  Of course, we know the focus now turns to the path.  As the box in Tealbook B highlights, markets largely expect action at this meeting and then anticipate a gradual pace of rate increases. In addition, uncertainty associated with the path is lower than at the start of the 1994 and 2004 tightening cycles.  The market-implied path is a bit lower than that in my own SEP submission, but my path is also quite gradual relative to past tightening cycles.  A gradual path does stand in sharp contrast to the optimal control exercises in Tealbook B, which show a rather steep pace of rate increases.  Earlier, optimal control exercises were informative regarding delaying liftoff, though it’s notable how they now resemble the “late and steep” option that the Committee discussed a year ago, which is a reminder for me that the Committee’s next steps are likely to prove as challenging as the path that led to today’s decision.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  First Vice President Lyon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. George, expresses her support for alternative B and provides reasons why she believes it is appropriate. She also acknowledges that there are different views within the committee, but there is no direct contradiction or argument presented in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 88.
 MR. LYON.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  In October, the Committee stated that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate if two conditions were met:  First, we saw some further improvement in the labor market, and, second, the Committee was reasonably confident that inflation would move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  In the previous go-round, I noted that the labor market has improved since October, butindications of future inflation have changed very little.  Alternatives B and C would raise the federal funds rate target, but neither offers as complete a rationale for this decision as I would have preferred. As I discussed in the previous go-round, our best statistical forecasting models, as well as market- and survey-based forecasts, suggest that inflation is likely to remain below target over the medium term.  To maintain its credibility, the FOMC must ensure that the public fully understands how monetary policy decisions relate to the Committee’s stated objectives and plans.  In turn, credibility is crucial for keeping inflation expectations well anchored.  I therefore believe it would be useful to offer a more complete and explicit rationale for raising rates at a time when the modal outlook still calls for very tame inflation.  Such an explanation could build on concerns that if we delay raising rates, we face the risk of having to eventually tighten rapidly and disruptively in the event of a rapid increase in inflation. If this concern or other risk factors broadly reflect the Committee members’ thinking on why a rate increase is appropriate at this time, then I would encourage the Committee to take every opportunity to explain these concerns in its communications.  Thoroughly explaining the key factors in the decision will help build public understanding of the Committee’s reaction function and ensure that we maintain the credibility of our 2 percent inflation target. I believe that effective communication will become even more important as normalization proceeds. The SEP suggests that the Committee is likely to raise rates by about 100 basis points in the first year—in other words, at only about half of the meetings.  I’m concerned that such a pace may prove particularly challenging to communicate.  The Committee will need to explain why it’s adjusting the funds rate target at some meetings but not others, without tying policy too tightly to volatile incoming data but also without committing to a fixed path of increases that cannot react to data at all.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Mester.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The speaker, Mr. Lyon, expresses disagreement with the decision to raise the federal funds rate and suggests that a more thorough and explicit rationale is needed. He believes that inflation is likely to remain below target and that a delay in raising rates could lead to a disruptive tightening later on. He encourages the Committee to communicate their concerns and key factors in the decision to maintain credibility and public understanding.


Passage number 89.
 MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support the action of raising the federal funds rate target range by 25 basis points at this meeting and the language in alternative B.  In my view, the criteria we’ve set out for liftoff have been met.  We’ve seen some further improvement in the labor market, and economic developments support being reasonably confident that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. It’s well accepted that monetary policy needs to be forward looking.  On the basis of the economic outlook, I believe it is prudent to take the first step today on the path of gradual normalization of interest rates. I believe we will be able to implement this policy change with the tools at our disposal.  I appreciate the analysis and testing of the tools undertaken by the New York Fed and Board staff that have led to more confidence in our tools.  But I also believe the careful monitoring of developments in financial markets post-liftoff is very appropriate and will help us calibrate the tools to hit the federal funds rate target range. Communications leading up to and subsequent to this action have played and will continue to play a significant role in shaping the expectations and interpretation of future policy.  I commend the Chair on the communications she’s undertaking during the intermeeting period to help ensure that market participants and the public are ready for this change.  I don’t think she could have done anything more to prepare them. Despite the preparation, I do expect some reaction in the financial markets.  It is, after all, the first change in the federal funds rate in seven years and the first rate increase in nine and a half years.  But I don’t expect the volatility to be economically significant. Alternative B, as amended and published in the Tealbook, seems to do a plausible job of capturing the various views expressed around the table and explaining the various factors that had to be balanced in deciding to take this action.  That said, I continue to think we could evolve the statement in a beneficial way by putting less emphasis in paragraph 1 on small, short-run changes in the economic data.  The description of economic developments in paragraph 1 tends to reinforce the natural inclination of market participants and others to focus on short-run developments in the economy rather than on the medium-run outlook, which is the more appropriate time horizon for monetary policy decisions.  But that’s a longer-run issue and not one for today. In light of an action today, the focus from now on is going to be on the future policy rate path.  The statement walks the careful line of explaining that we currently expect the economy to evolve in a way that warrants, for some time, keeping interest rates lower than the level we expect to prevail over the longer run while conveying the idea that policy will respond appropriately to changes in the outlook.  Thus, there is uncertainty about our policy rate path because there’s uncertainty about the outlook.  Our actual policy rate path could turn out to be shallower or steeper than currently anticipated.  Here I think the SEP and its dot plot of federal funds rate projections, as well as the evolution of that plot over meetings to come, will serve the Committee well by giving the public a very good sense of the current views of FOMC participants of the future policy rate path. Another focus of the public will be on reinvestment policy.  The language in the statement that we anticipate continuing reinvestments until rate normalization is “well under way” may hold off people for a time.  But, as they say, inquiring minds will want to know what we mean by that.  On this matter, I think it would be beneficial to clarify in the press conference or testimony that we’re thinking about state-contingent criteria for ending reinvestments and not time-dependent criteria. Finally, I think we have to recognize that today’s move won’t stop the questions leading up to each meeting about whether the Committee will raise interest rates at that meeting. Because we currently anticipate moving rates up more gradually than we did in the past two cycles, this is to be expected.  Clear communications will continue to be a challenge, but it also presents a good opportunity because it can help the normalization process go more smoothly and effectively and can help preserve our ability to use the nontraditional policy tools of the future.  Thank you, Madam Chair. CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses their support for raising the federal funds rate and provides their rationale for doing so. They also express their satisfaction with the communication efforts of the Chair. The speaker does suggest some potential improvements, such as putting less emphasis on short-run economic data and clarifying reinvestment policy, but they do not express disagreement with the overall decision or direction.


Passage number 90.
 MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, I thought that phrase was acknowledging the lags in monetary policy, and I’d like to hear what you thought. CHAIR YELLEN.  It was meant to explain why, at a time when inflation is low and we’ve not overshot our employment goal, we would be raising rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Bullard is simply expressing his interpretation of a phrase used by Chair Yellen and asking for her opinion on it.


Passage number 91.
 MR. BULLARD.  Right.  So maybe the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia staff doesn’t believe in lags.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 92.
  [Laughter] MR. HARKER.  I’m just reporting what they said. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I propose that we vote on alternative B as written and the associated directive.  Let me call on Brian to explain exactly what we’re going to vote on and call the roll.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The participants are discussing a proposal and preparing to vote on it.


Passage number 93.
 MR. MADIGAN.5 This vote of the Federal Open Market Committee will be on the statement for alternative B as presented on pages 7 and 8 of Thomas’s package of briefing materials from yesterday.  It will also be on the directive as included in the draft implementation 5 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). note on page 1 of the package labeled “Updated Implementation Note,” which was distributed this morning.  This directive would supersede the resolution on overnight RRP test operations that was approved by the Committee at its December 16–17, 2014, meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply states what the vote of the Federal Open Market Committee will be on and mentions the materials being used for the vote.


Passage number 94.
 Chair Yellen Yes Vice Chairman Dudley Yes Governor Brainard Yes President Evans Yes MR. MADIGAN. Governor Fischer.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The responses of Chair Yellen, Vice Chairman Dudley, Governor Brainard, and President Evans are all in agreement. The mention of Governor Fischer does not provide any indication of contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 95.
 MR. FISCHER.  May I enter a divided vote. I would not like the word “unanimously” to appear in the fourth line of the implementation note.  There is, in the fourth line— CHAIR YELLEN.  We haven’t voted on that yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. Mr. Fischer disagrees with the word "unanimously" appearing in the fourth line of the implementation note.


Passage number 96.
 MR. FISCHER.  Oh, it’s going to be a separate vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that there will be a separate vote, without any indication of conflict or disagreement between the parties involved.


Passage number 97.
 MR. MADIGAN. Well, let me first mention that there’s no vote on the implementation note per se.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply providing information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 98.
 MR. FISCHER.  Oh, I thought I heard you saying there was. CHAIR YELLEN.  We’re going to have some further votes, and we’ll see if they’re unanimous or not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. This is indicated by Mr. Fischer's statement expressing his belief that there was disagreement, and Chair Yellen's response indicating that further votes will determine whether there is unanimity or not.


Passage number 99.
 MR. FISCHER.  Okay, fine—I’m in favor of alt-B.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no explicit contention or disagreement indicated in the passage. The speaker simply states their support for something without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions being mentioned.


Passage number 100.
 MR. MADIGAN.  Thank you. President Lacker Yes President Lockhart Yes Governor Powell Yes Governor Tarullo Yes President Williams Yes CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  We have some further votes to take, and these will be votes of the Board of Governors.  First, on interest rates on reserves, I need a motion to increase to  basis points from 25 basis points the interest rates paid on required and excess reserve balances, effective December 17, 2015.  Do I have a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The individuals mentioned are all in agreement and there is no indication of any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 101.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved. CHAIR YELLEN.  Second.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, Mr. Fischer moves a motion and Chair Yellen seconds it. There is no contention or disagreement evident.


Passage number 102.
 MR. TARULLO.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  Without objection.  [No response]  Okay.  Very good. Now let’s turn to discount rates.  The vote on discount rates is also a vote of the Board of Governors, and it is going to cover three discount rate actions.  They are, first, to approve the requests of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco to increase the primary credit rate to 1 percent from ¾ percent, effective December 17, 2015. Second, the vote will encompass approval by the Board of Governors of the establishment of a 1 percent primary credit rate by the remaining Federal Reserve Banks, effective on the later of December 17, 2015, and the date such Reserve Banks inform the Secretary of the Board of such a request.  The Secretary of the Board would be authorized to inform such Reserve Banks of the approval of the Board of Governors upon notification by the Reserve Banks. Finally, this vote will also encompass approval of the renewal by all 12 Federal Reserve Banks of the existing formulas for calculating the rates applicable to discounts and advances under the secondary and seasonal credit programs.  I need a motion that would cover all three portions of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a description of actions that need to be approved and there is no indication of any disagreement or opposing views.


Passage number 103.
 MR. FISCHER.  So moved.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. "So moved" is a phrase commonly used in meetings or discussions to indicate agreement with a proposal or motion.


Passage number 104.
 MR. TARULLO.  Second. CHAIR YELLEN.  All in favor.  [Chorus of ayes]  Any opposed.  [No response] Okay.  Well, we have now taken the steps toward implementing our policy.  Let me just mention something.  Because I think many of the people around this table have joined the System since the last interest rate cycle and may not be entirely familiar with what I’ll call standard procedures regarding discount rates, let me mention that, commonly, when the discount rate is changed, which occurs usually commensurate with a change in the federal funds rate target that’s approved by the FOMC, some, but not all, Federal Reserve Banks have requested that change.  This time, we have 10 that have requested it.  So the standard practice is that the boards of the remaining Reserve Banks, within about a day of the FOMC announcement, request the same change in their primary credit rates—it’s called a conforming rate request—to bring the discount rate up to the approved new national average in all areas of the country. Now, in many Reserve Banks, this requires a vote of the board of directors of the Bank.  In some others, I think this decisionmaking authority is delegated to a committee of the board rather than the full board, or, in some cases, it can be delegated to the president by the board of directors.  So there may be different procedures in different Banks, but I did want to note that it is quite standard—and this should occur very rapidly, within 24 hours—that Reserve Banks that have not requested an increase would return to our Secretary of the Board with a request for a conforming change.  And, the Board of Governors has just voted to, essentially, preapprove those requests. You know that the implementation note that was just distributed will be published today as an addendum to the Committee’s policy statement, and it includes the domestic policy directive verbatim.  Then what we’ve agreed is that if, during the intermeeting period, we need to  make changes to policy tools to implement the stance of policy agreed upon in the FOMC statement, we will issue a new implementation note that we will vote on. In addition, let me mention that the Desk will be releasing, also at 2:00 p.m., a Desk statement on implementation, and tomorrow the Desk will be releasing a statement on term RRPs.  Let me call on Lorie to discuss that statement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a description of standard procedures and announcements related to the implementation of a policy.


Passage number 105.
 MS. LOGAN.  Matt is handing out a table that I’ll refer to, so I’ll just wait until those are passed out.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In this passage, there is no contention or disagreement. MS. LOGAN is simply waiting until a table is handed out.


Passage number 106.
 MR. LACKER.  Madam Chair, is this implementation note we got this morning different from the one we got yesterday. CHAIR YELLEN.  I think the blue changes, too, were there yesterday.  On page 2, I believe the phrasing “the discount rate” is new.  I think it previously said “primary credit.”  We thought that might be confusing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Although there is a discussion about changes in the implementation note, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speakers are simply trying to clarify if there were any differences between the implementation note they received that day and the one they received the day before.


Passage number 107.
 MR. LACKER.  Oh, I see.  That part is new.  Okay.  Thank you.   CHAIR YELLEN.  The public knows about the discount rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple exchange of information between Mr. Lacker and Chair Yellen.


Passage number 108.
 MR. LACKER.  Brilliant changes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "brilliant changes" suggests a positive or admirable opinion, without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 109.
 MS. LOGAN.6 In light of the Committee’s policy decision to increase the target range and to temporarily suspend the cap on the overnight RRP, we wanted to summarize plans for the already announced term operations that cross year-end.  These details are shown in the table of your handout, which is labeled “Material for Briefing on Term RRP Operations over Year End.” The Chair approved plans to offer $300 billion in three term operations with 17-, 12-, and 6-day maturities and to offer sizes of $50 billion, $100 billion, and $150 billion on each of these days, respectively, with any unused capacity from the first two operations rolling into the third. However, unlike the previous term operations—and as shown in the fifth column—these will be offered at a zero basis point spread to the overnight RRP rate. Without offering any financial incentive for investing funds for term instead of overnight, we anticipate there to be limited interest, other than perhaps some modest 6 The materials used by Ms. Logan are appended to this transcript (appendix 6).  interest coming from those who value the convenience of not having to reinvest maturing proceeds each day. The Desk plans to release these remaining details at 4:00 this afternoon, and we’d be releasing two other forms of information, also at 4:00 this afternoon. CHAIR YELLEN.  I see—at 4:00 rather than tomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about the Committee's policy decision and plans for term operations.


Passage number 110.
 MS. LOGAN.  Right.  And those would be the FAQs associated with the overnight RRP as well as the FAQs on reinvestment policy that I mentioned in the Desk briefing yesterday.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating some information given in a previous conversation.


Passage number 111.
  MR. POTTER. We have those available, if people need to look at them. CHAIR YELLEN.  Are there any questions for Lorie or Simon.  [No response]  Okay.  I have a couple of more things.  Our next scheduled meeting will be on January 26 and 27. That takes me to the issue of our plans for post-liftoff briefings.  As we’ve previously agreed, starting tomorrow, we will have briefings, possibly for as many as two weeks.  Or, if things are going very smoothly and we decide they’re no longer necessary, we will cancel them.  But the first briefing is scheduled for tomorrow at 4:00 p.m.  The remaining briefings, with the exception of two, are scheduled for 2:00 p.m.  On two dates—Thursday, December 24, and Thursday, December 31—we hope we will be able to cancel briefings, but if we need to have them, they’ve been scheduled for 10:00 a.m. Let me say about these briefings that if we do decide we need to change any of the tools or make intermeeting adjustments, all of these briefings can be converted, even midstream, into FOMC meetings.  I’d like to remind you that, whether they’re briefings or turn into FOMC meetings, FOMC meeting attendance rules will apply to the briefings.  Our plan is to record and prepare transcripts of all of these briefings/meetings, even if they’re briefings and don’t turn into meetings.  If they do turn into meetings, then minutes will be prepared and published with the minutes of the January FOMC meeting.  Let me say that the difference between a briefing and a meeting is that, in a briefing, you’re welcome to quiz staff members and ask them questions, but if it looks as though we need to deliberate on policy and make comments that are real policy deliberations, we will need to convert the briefing into a meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 112.
 I think that’s it, other than to say that we have boxed lunches available, and anybody who— MR. FISCHER. May I ask a question. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 113.
 MR. FISCHER.  I’m sorry to return to this point, but, in the “Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation,” the word “unanimously” appears twice in square brackets.  Since the extent of the majority by which this decision is being made by the Board is of no consequence whatever to how we do the monetary policy implementation, I don’t know why we need the word “unanimously.” CHAIR YELLEN.  No, we do because these are Board votes, and we’re reporting Board votes.  If they’re not unanimous, anyone who dissented would be listed explicitly as a dissenter, potentially with some short statement as to what the dissent was.  So we’re formally recording here, in the implementation note, votes of the Board of Governors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. Mr. Fischer questions the need for the word "unanimously" to be included, while Chair Yellen argues that it is necessary to accurately record the votes of the Board of Governors.


Passage number 114.
 MR. FISCHER.  Okay.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

In this passage, there is no clear indication of contention or disagreement. Mr. Fischer is expressing gratitude, and Chair Yellen responds with a statement that does not contradict or challenge Mr. Fischer's statement.


Passage number 115.
 MR. BULLARD.  Madam Chair, in the past, when we’ve had briefings, have we prepared transcripts and then distributed the transcripts. CHAIR YELLEN.  No, we haven’t.  But, in light of the fact that any of these briefings could turn into meetings and there would seem to be some historical value for the public in understanding what happened and what our discussions were in the aftermath of this decision,  we thought it wise to actually make transcripts of the briefings to have that historical record.  We will need it, of course, if any of them turn into meetings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a discussion between Mr. Bullard and Chair Yellen about the decision to prepare transcripts of briefings. Chair Yellen explains the reasoning behind the decision without any arguments or disputes.


Passage number 116.
 MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  So the plan is that they will be released after five years with everything else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a plan that the individuals will be released after five years with everything else. There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement.


Passage number 117.
 MR. MADIGAN.  If they are turned into meetings.  A decision has not yet been made if they’re just briefings.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only states that a decision has not been made yet about whether the briefings will be turned into meetings. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 118.
 MR. BULLARD.  I see.  If they’re just briefings, then they may not be.  I see, all right.  Thank you. CHAIR YELLEN.  President Evans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The individuals are simply exchanging information and expressing understanding.


Passage number 119.
 MR. EVANS.  If I could just clarify what you meant by the distinction between a briefing and a meeting, in a briefing, it’s like a game of Jeopardy. in which all of the comments have to begin with a question.  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It consists of Mr. Evans seeking clarification from Chair Yellen and making a light-hearted comment, which is met with laughter.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 120.
  If we need to change the interest rate on excess reserves today to make our policy work, yes, that— MR. EVANS.  Right.  But as soon as somebody opines in a policy way, that’s not according to the rules.  That’s the way I remember the FOMC briefings in the past, during the crisis. CHAIR YELLEN.  That’s right.  We’ve had these briefings before.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker implies that changing the interest rate on excess reserves is necessary for their policy to work, but another speaker argues that making policy decisions in such a manner is against the rules. This disagreement suggests a contention between the two speakers regarding the appropriate approach to the situation.


Passage number 121.
 MR. EVANS.  Well, President Williams reminded me of that, too. CHAIR YELLEN.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement mentioned in the passage. Both individuals mentioned, Mr. Evans and President Williams, seem to agree on the point being discussed.


Passage number 122.
  You mean that you can ask a question that— MR.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a simple statement asking for clarification. There is no indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 123.
 WILLIAMS.  You just don’t opine or bring up the discussion regarding, for instance, the ON RRP rate or something, but you can ask the question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 124.
 MR. EVANS.  So it has to be, “Isn’t it true that we need to . . .”  [Laughter] CHAIR YELLEN.  “If we don’t change the overnight RRP rate in this meeting . . .”— something like that.  Yes, you can do that type of thing, but if it looks like members of the Committee will need to talk to one another about changes, the intention will be to turn it into a meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a discussion about the wording and format of a meeting.
