Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the timing and extent of a potential narrowing of something but does not argue against any stated position or contradict anyone else's viewpoint.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a hypothetical question that does not contain any conflicting viewpoints or opinions.


Passage number 19.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Well, that would depend a good deal on thenature of the discussion around the table here. I think [the answeris] mechanically, yes, but there are nuances in the day-to-dayexecution of policy in that we'd want to take guidance from theCommittee's sentiment.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is acknowledging that the answer to a question could be yes, but also acknowledging that there might be nuances and variations depending on the specific circumstances.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 22.
MR. PARTEE. Peter, I too am sort of mystified by this up-creep in the funds rate relative to borrowings. It's really quiteobvious and seems to be rather enduring. You mentioned Continental'sborrowing in a negative way--as not being a factor--but I'm inclinedto wonder whether in fact it isn't a factor. I seem to recall that weobserved the same kind of phenomenon when Franklin borrowed sizableamounts in the summer of 1974, and I'm wondering whether there isn'tsomething about the channels of distribution that could have somemarginal impact on the rate relationship.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. MR. PARTEE is expressing his own opinion and questioning the viewpoint of the person he is speaking to. He suggests that Continental's borrowing may actually be a factor in the situation, contrasting it with the other person's statement that it is not a factor.


Passage number 23.
MR. STERNLIGHT. I mentioned the reluctance to borrow as themost reasonably clear and persuasive reason to me. I didn't mean todismiss entirely the Continental borrowing and the cutting of newchannels. I'm not thoroughly persuaded; that has some plausibility tome, but I can't really pin down well in my mind just how the wholeprocess worked.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is acknowledging the possibility of the Continental borrowing and the cutting of new channels but is not thoroughly convinced or clear on how the process worked.


Passage number 24.
MR. PARTEE. You seem to have the same view that I do. Ifeel that there might be something there too but, of course, one can'tprove it and the arithmetic doesn't support it. But, still, there arequite different channels. The reason I mention it is that it doesn'tlook as if Continental is going to be out of the [discount] windowanytime soon; in fact, they may borrow substantially more over theweeks and months to come. So, if there is a tendency for that [tooccur], it could be exacerbated. And if we had to [unintelligible], Idon't know what to do about it. But I wonder whether it isn't afactor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their own view and speculation about a potential situation, without indicating any disagreement with the listener.


Passage number 25.
MR. BLACK. We took a cursory look at it--and this is by nomeans definitive--and it looked as if there was reluctance to borrowby large Chicago banks more than anything else.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Black is simply stating that their initial examination suggested a hesitancy among large Chicago banks to borrow, but he clarifies that it is not a definitive conclusion.


Passage number 26.
MR. PARTEE. Well, of course, one thing that happens when wecount it as nonborrowed is that what used to be Continental'sborrowing from time to time automatically gets excluded. Now, thatcan't be quantitatively very big. That would be one factor.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply presents a statement and a logical explanation without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 27.
MR. BLACK. We figure the Chicago banks wanted to make darnsure nobody felt they were in the same situation as Continental andthey might be more reluctant to borrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing a belief or assumption about the intentions of the Chicago banks.


Passage number 28.
MR. KEEHN. The big banks have not been in.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statement or indication of contention or disagreement between individuals or parties.


Passage number 29.
MR. BLACK. That was the most striking difference that wefound in just a quick look at it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage states a fact about the speaker's observation without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 30.
MR. KEEHN. In fact, proportionately the District borrowingsare down.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 32.
MR. BLACK. I can imagine some of them are reacting that way.

8/21/84MR. STERNLIGHT. We've had that information from two or threeof the very large banks. And some of them think that it's true ofothers, but not everyone admits to it in a direct way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.

Passage number 36.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Any other comments.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no statement or indication of disagreement or contention in the prompt.


Passage number 37.
MR. KEEHN. This is really an observation. WithContinental's large and prospectively even larger borrowing and withFinancial Corporation of America likely to come in, several peoplehave asked the basic question of what our technical limitation is byway of a borrowing level. What is the operational limit. If there isa possibility of a problem, it might be helpful if we had a ratheruniform statement as to how we might reply to this type of inquiry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating an observation and suggesting that it would be helpful to have a consistent response to a potential question.


Passage number 38.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I don't think we want to give anyimpression that there is any limitation under these circumstances.Unfortunately there is, which surprised me. We have a collateralrequirement for Federal Reserve notes which cannot be met by lendingto banks unless the loans are secured by eligible paper. So, we mayhave to put in a little effort to get some eligible paper to securethose borrowings and to keep track of it. The limits are not all thatfar away, if we get another big bank coming in to borrow or ifContinental's borrowing keeps going up. It depends upon circumstanceselsewhere on a day-to-day or week-to-week basis. That troubles me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. The person is expressing their concerns and observations about the limitations and potential future issues related to borrowing and securing loans.


Passage number 39.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The way I've heard the question isnot so much the way Si has heard it but: At what level will distressborrowing complicate open market monetary policy operations. Willthere be a limit on the amount of borrowing the System can makeavailable to banks that need liquidity because of the problem itcreates for our open market operations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply stating that they have heard the question posed differently and are presenting their own interpretation of it.


Passage number 40.
MR. PARTEE. I think the answer is that Paul has [noted]something that is going to hit before the limit on open marketoperations hits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply stating his opinion and offering a potential answer to the question.


Passage number 41.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's going to hit earlier.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no apparent contention or disagreement in the statement "It's going to hit earlier." The passage simply states a fact or prediction without any conflicting opinions or perspectives.


Passage number 42.
MR. PARTEE. Yes. That hits early. Hardly anybody knowsabout it, but we have to collateralize those notes and it's a criminaloffense to issue them without proper collateral. So, it would come upwith another ten billion in borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact that issuing notes without proper collateral is a criminal offense and suggests the need for additional borrowing.


Passage number 43.
MR. BLACK. When banks are out of Federal Reserve notes wejust send them coins.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. It simply states a fact without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting statements.


Passage number 44.
MR. PARTEE. Well, that's what we would have to do--justwithdraw currency from circulation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee is making a statement about what needs to be done regarding currency withdrawal from circulation.


Passage number 45.
MR. MORRIS. Maybe that's how we can get the Susan B. Anthonycoins in circulation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Morris is proposing a potential solution for getting the Susan B. Anthony coins in circulation.


Passage number 46.
8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends upon what the marketcircumstances are. If market circumstances are disturbed, as theymight be in those circumstances, we couldn't offset it. But it may bethat we wouldn't want to [do that] in some circumstances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not demonstrate contention or disagreement. It discusses different possibilities based on market circumstances, without conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 47.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. There are a lot of questions of thatsort floating around and there is a lot of uneasiness. And if FCAcomes into the [discount] window, I think we're going to see asignificant increase in concerns. You know [about] the actions thattook to help FCA out--they are a very tough bunch,strictly profit oriented--and for the first time I heard them sayingthat part of their motivation was their worry that the FCA situationwould extend to other thrifts and just cause general problems which,of course, would affect them, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The mention of "significant increase in concerns" and "general problems" suggests that there are differing opinions or conflicting viewpoints about FCA coming into the discount window and the potential impact it may have.


Passage number 48.
MR. BALLES. Mr. Chairman, so everybody will be up to speedon the FCA situation, it's quite likely that they will be in to thewindow this week, though not in a big way in the sense that we've beenpressuring them hard to get lots of collateral with us and all theyhave come up with so far is $2 billion. And that is all very largedenomination commercial real estate loans. We have a team analyzingand evaluating this on a crash effort basis but initially, if they dorequest accommodation, we're going to take at least a 50 percentmargin on that stuff and may never go above that margin. So, forcollateral reasons, we couldn't go above $1 billion right at thismoment. And it's doubtful that they are going to be able to get muchmore collateral into our Bank--at least this week. I might add thatnone of it, of course, is eligible commercial paper. It's all largedenominations of commercial real estate loans. So, it won't help thatparticular aspect of [our collateral] problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information about the FCA situation and stating the amount of collateral they have obtained so far.


Passage number 49.
MR. MARTIN. Yes, it may be that it will require a FHLB orFSLIC guarantee behind even a collateralized loan to provide enoughliquidity even in the very short run on a day-to-day basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Martin, expressing the possibility of needing a guarantee behind a collateralized loan for liquidity purposes.


Passage number 50.
MR. ROBERTS. Can we lend to the Home Loan Banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is a straightforward question asked by an individual named Mr. Roberts.


Passage number 51.
MR. BALLES. Well, that's an issue I've raised and I hope wewill get a firm answer to that pretty quickly. We may need it. It'sunder discussion now, I understand, but I don't know what the answeris. We did raise the issue of whether we could lend to the Home LoanBank based on collateral promissory notes that they have from theircustomers. FCA has been scrambling hard to get billions of collateralinto the Home Loan Bank; that's where they put their big effort. Buteven there they may run out of gas, in terms of acceptable andavailable collateral. We hope to avoid the loans [to] the HLB itself;it would make many less waves in terms of all sorts of things if wecould lend to FCA, but we are exploring direct loans to the Home LoanBank as a fallback position. We've asked our staff along with theBoard's staff to explore the legal and other aspects of such loans.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing a topic and expressing their hope for a firm answer to a question. They also mention that they are exploring different options and asking their staff to look into the legal and other aspects of those options.


Passage number 52.
MR. PARTEE. I'm sure it can be done. That's a paragraph 3loan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply expresses a belief that something can be done.


Passage number 53.
MR. AXILROD. Unless things have changed, by law at themoment a loan to a Home Loan Bank--unless it's secured by somethinginterpreted as government securities--would require a 5-man vote ofthe Board and a declaration that it is because of unusual and exigent8/21/84circumstances. It's technically possible by law but it would need atthe moment to be within those confines.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact about the current law regarding loans to Home Loan Banks.


Passage number 54.
MR. FORRESTAL. The press is reporting $800 million borrowingfrom the Home Loan Bank. Is that accurate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply a question posed by Mr. Forrestal regarding the accuracy of the reported borrowing amount.


Passage number 55.
MR. PARTEE. No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 56.
MR. MARTIN. No.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any disagreements or indications of contention.


Passage number 57.
MR. ROBERTS. Paul, if borrowing burgeoned, let's say, to $25billion in the System and we didn't have the collateral to sell, justtechnically isn't it possible that we could raise reserverequirements. I understand the psychology, but that would be themechanical way to resolve it, wouldn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Roberts is posing a question to Paul and seeking clarification on a possible solution.


Passage number 58.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mechanically, yes, we could resolve itthat way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "Mechanically, yes, we could resolve it that way" suggests agreement and acceptance of resolving the issue in a certain way.


Passage number 59.
MR. ROBERTS. If we announced that that was the purpose.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Roberts, is making a statement or suggesting an idea, but there is no indication of any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 60.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It depends on the circumstances; I can'tsee offhand that that's likely to have any advantages over selling inthe market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
Explanation: The passage expresses uncertainty or lack of a definitive answer, but there is no clear contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 61.
MR. ROBERTS. But if we didn't have anything to sell--.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Roberts is simply stating a hypothetical situation without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 62.
MR. BLACK. That's not the problem, I don't think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Passage number 63.
MR. STERNLIGHT. We have plenty of short-term securities tosell.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that there are plenty of short-term securities to sell.


Passage number 64.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, actually, that might be a way tomaintain the assets that we need. I suppose that's what we could bedriven to in order to maintain the assets we need to collateralize thecurrency. That could make all the banks love us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a possible solution or strategy to maintain desired assets and suggesting that this approach could lead to the banks having a positive perception of them.


Passage number 65.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But at that point we probably wouldneed some ease in the financial markets and, if anything, in thebanking system.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a likely need for ease in the financial markets and banking system.


Passage number 66.
MR. ROBERTS. We could ease. If we're expanding reserves bythe borrowing, we could less than offset them by the reserverequirements and still ease.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply suggesting a course of action to ease the situation by offsetting the borrowing with reserve requirements.


Passage number 67.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, you could get the same mechanicalresult. I guess we could do it--protecting our assets that we need toback currency.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that it is possible to achieve the intended outcome without any conflicting opinions or opposition.


Passage number 68.
MR. PARTEE. That's hard to explain, though. Can you imaginesaying that on account of the financial crisis, we're raising reserverequirements.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage as it is a statement made by Mr. Partee. There is no conflicting viewpoint or opposing argument presented.

Passage number 70.
"CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We would have to raise the reserverequirements quite a lot, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It may imply uncertainty or speculation, but there is no clear disagreement present.


Passage number 71.
8/21/84MR. MARTIN. Bob, back to your question again, the lastfigure we had yesterday on the American Savings & Loan borrowing fromthe HLB--and I can be corrected by staff--was about $2.3 billion.There was a reduction because of the payback out of thecredit extended on a portfolio of single-family residentialmortgages. So, they paid down part of a HLB balance that was runningabout $3 billion. They--temporarily, I stress--paid it down to about$2.3 billion yesterday. Of course, this morning at 9:00 a.m.California time, they may be right back to that or even higher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply providing information about the borrowing and repayment of American Savings & Loan from the HLB. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 72.
MR. FORRESTAL. Is the HLB's limitation basically collateralor their own funding problems.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a question about the limitations of the HLB and their funding problems.


Passage number 73.
MR. MARTIN. It's a combination of things, including the bitmore autonomy that a HLB Board of Directors has compared to a FederalReserve Bank Board of Directors.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that an HLB Board of Directors has more autonomy compared to a Federal Reserve Bank Board of Directors.


Passage number 74.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Do they have a run on.

MR. MARTIN. Of course they have a run on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Martin is stating a fact, without any opposition or conflict.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 76.
 They have had arun on now--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I see comments in the press. First,they talked about the institutional deposits they were losing. Thenin the last few days, ever since the revised earnings report, I sawthat it was retail deposits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The speaker mentions losing institutional deposits and links it to the comments they see in the press. Then, they mention the revised earnings report and how it has affected retail deposits. This suggests a disagreement or contention between the speaker and the information they are receiving from the press.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 77.
MR. BALLES. Tony, that's totally inaccurate. That New YorkTimes story was especially bad yesterday about their losing only $200million and that most of it was retail. In fact, in the last 4 or 5business days the net loss has been a half billion dollars a day onaverage and the great bulk of it is in these jumbo accounts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes.

Explanation: The phrase "Tony, that's totally inaccurate" and the disagreement expressed by Mr. Balles indicate contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 78.
MR. MARTIN. So, the so-called retail is very frequently aresult of telephone solicitation in a city like Washington, D.C. by anemployee of FCA or by American. That's so-called retail. It's notfrom Merrill Lynch. That makes it retail.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of fact, explaining that what is commonly referred to as "retail" in the context of the passage is not from Merrill Lynch, but rather from telephone solicitation by FCA or American.


Passage number 79.
MR. BLACK. They had 300 people doing that, didn't they.

Passage number 83.
MR. BLACK. The press reports have been inaccurate on thattoo, then.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage simply states that the press reports have been inaccurate without indicating any disagreement or contention among people or parties involved.


Passage number 84.
MR. MARTIN. The only matter that one could say was well donein this whole thing--and not from a moral point of view--has been themanagement of news by these folks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage mentions that the management of news by these people was well done, but it does not imply any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 85.
MR. BALLES. They lie very well.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not explicitly mention any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 86.
MR. MARTIN. I was trying to avoid that term, John.

Passage number 87.
8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have this question of limits. Are you[unintelligible] convinced by Mr. Sternlight's analysis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: N/A


Passage number 88.
MR. PARTEE. He's in a better position than we are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 89.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [I need] somebody to make a motion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. "Somebody to make a motion" is a straightforward request without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 90.
MR. STERNLIGHT. Again, it's very uncertain and a lot dependson the extended credit. If I were sure that that were going upsubstantially, we wouldn't really need the [additional] leeway and Iwould just wait until the situation arises. I'm just asking as amatter of prudence because I see the possibility at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Mr. Sternlight is expressing uncertainty and seeking clarification for a matter of prudence.

****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 100.
MR. KICHLINE. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of square brackets indicates that something has been omitted, which suggests that there may be a disagreement or dispute over what has been omitted or how it has been presented. Additionally, the use of the term "Appendix" suggests that there may be conflicting information or perspectives presented in that section.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 101.
]VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I have a question about yourprojection on inflation. You are projecting, as you just said, 1percentage point higher inflation in '85 compared to '84. But if Iunderstood correctly your analysis 6 weeks ago, you are projectingabout a 1 percentage point rise in unit labor costs. Now, that alonecould account for a 1 point rise in inflation but on top of thatyou're also factoring in a 10 or 15 percent reduction in the exchangerate, and presumably you'll get some some increase in utilization ofcapacity. I don't see how, based on your assumptions, you end up withonly a 1 percentage point increase in inflation in '85 over '84.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is questioning the projection on inflation and stating that based on the assumptions, they do not understand how the projected increase in inflation is only 1 percentage point.


Passage number 102.
MR. KICHLINE. We now have unit labor costs rising in 1984 atabout 2-1/2 percent and for 1985 we have them up in the neighborhoodof 4-3/4 percent. It's a substantial rise, in part becausecompensation is rising and in part because we have smaller gains inour forecast for productivity. So, we get a substantial rise in unitlabor costs, but from a level in 1984 that is quite moderate. Withrespect to the dollar, you are quite correct that we have the adverseeffects there but they really show up very late in the year. As timehas gone on, in fact, two things have happened. One is that Ted keeps8/21/84saying the dollar in our forecast should come down 15 percent. Thething we don't talk about is from what level; and the level always ishigher in the short run. So, in part what we're dealing with is morefavorable prices from the dollar occurring early on in 1985; it'sreally in late 1985 that the adverse [dollar] effect occurs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information and explaining the rise in unit labor costs and the effects of the dollar.


Passage number 103.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But don't the price effects show up alot earlier than the trade effects.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a statement, and there is no indication of any form of disagreement or contention. It is a declarative sentence presenting a point of view.


Passage number 104.
MR. TRUMAN. They certainly show up earlier, but Jim iscertainly correct. If you had [a dollar decline of] 15 percent forthe fourth quarter of the year--which is not what we're projecting--bythe fourth quarter of next year you would only have half of the priceeffects of that. And if you spread out that 15 percent decline overthe next 5 quarters, then you're really talking about having arelatively small component of the price effects of the dollar[decline]. In fact, we have nominal import prices going up over the 4quarters in 1985 by about 14 percent, so even there we don't have allthis coming through, with lags and so forth, until after theprojection period.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Truman is simply explaining that even if there is a 15 percent decline in the dollar, the price effects would be spread out over time and would not have a significant impact on import prices in the projected period. He supports his statement with the fact that nominal import prices are projected to go up by about 14 percent over the four quarters in 1985.


Passage number 105.
MR. WALLICH. But even if the dollar stays where it is, sinceit has been rising over time we have some benefit for inflation fromthat rise if it stops.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Wallich is presenting a statement about the potential benefit of a stable or rising dollar on inflation.


Passage number 106.
MR. TRUMAN. That's Jim's point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Truman is simply acknowledging Jim's point without expressing any opposition or contradictory view.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 107.
MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I wonder if I could follow onthis with a similar question. I generally agree with the staffforecast but, if I understand your analysis correctly, you haverevised your growth forecast upward and you have revised the inflationnumber downward for 1985, whereas the unemployment rate associatedwith both of those is unchanged. There are obviously severalexplanations for this--the strength of the dollar, perhaps increasedproductivity, and so on. But, frankly, I'm a little confused aboutwhat seems to me to be a somewhat inconsistent forecast. Can youenlighten me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Forrestal expresses confusion and raises the point that the forecast seems inconsistent. He questions why the growth forecast has been revised upward and the inflation number downward, yet the unemployment rate remains unchanged.


Passage number 108.
MR. KICHLINE. First of all, I would say that given themargin of error I view our real side forecast as not significantlydifferent from what we had before. But you're quite correct that tothe extent we made changes over the 6-quarter period they are up--especially for 1985, where it's a quarter point or so higher. On theinflation side, I'd mention several things. One is very important:food prices. Indeed, we now have a food price increase of about 5percent projected for this year and next. That had been in the rangeof 6-1/2 percent and earlier it was up to 7-1/2 percent. That's a bignumber in terms of the overall price picture. There we think we justmissed; it may show up later but frankly we've held onto that forecastin making downward revisions along the way. But, again, it's veryimportant. The dollar we have talked about. In the very near termthere is energy; we had gasoline prices dropping at something like aseasonally adjusted 12 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Thathas lagged in the PPI; we haven't really seen much of that in the PPIand it should be showing up. When we get the CPI it ought to beshowing up soon; so, in the very near term, we think energy marketsare quite weak. We have noted that also spilling over into coal andnatural gas prices. The only thing that seems to be happening is that8/21/84electricity rates are going up. But that's important for us in theshorter run. More so, I'd say, is our assumption on oil prices whichis that in fact they will be drifting down a little in real terms.So, we have taken a more optimistic view on some of those things. Iwould also note that on the wage side, the numbers that came in on theGNP revision over the last 3 years tended, especially in 1983, torevise down rates of increase in compensation. Part of it is on thebenefit side but as more information became available, compensationincreases in the past now look different--that is, lower and morefavorable. On the wage data, we had been expecting fairly goodnumbers and they were better than we thought. The employment costindex now is running at 4 percent over the first half of the year.It's down more than a percentage point from 1983. The contracts thathave been settled to date so far this year are averaging a 3.8 percentincrease for the first year. Basically, we sat down and looked at abroad range of information from many different sources and concludedthat it would be prudent to knock some tenths off of various things,which we did. And it added up to a more favorable picture.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining their view and the changes they have made to their forecasts.


Passage number 109.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know as we can stand all this goodnews.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement expresses uncertainty or doubt rather than contention or disagreement.


Passage number 110.
MR. BLACK. Just one short question, Jim. [Unintelligible.]Do you have a gross domestic business product fixed-weight index forthe second quarter now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not exhibit any contention or disagreement. It is simply a statement or question being asked by Mr. Black.


Passage number 111.
MR. KICHLINE. Here comes the bad news. It was revised up to4.1 percent; the preliminary number had been 3.3 percent. I would saythat that is of virtually no concern because nearly all of it occurredin the residential structures component. The Commerce Department nowsays that prices associated with the residential construction arearose at an 11-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. At thispoint, much of that is really fiction as much as fact. They don'thave very much information.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating the revised numbers and expressing their opinion on the significance of the changes.


Passage number 112.
MR. PARTEE. How do they get it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The passage consists of a direct question and does not present any conflicting points of view or arguments.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 113.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It seems like an extraordinary rate ofincrease in prices of residential construction.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage describes an "extraordinary rate of increase in prices of residential construction." This suggests a significant and potentially contentious issue regarding rapidly rising construction costs.


Passage number 114.
MR. KICHLINE. Well, keep in mind that there was somethinglike a 2 percent increase, I believe, in the first quarter. Theyreported a 5-1/2 percent increase initially in the second quarter andnow they have 11-1/2 percent. If history rings true, they could havezero or minus 3 percent for the third quarter. That number reallyjust flips about. So, it's not in an area that we think is a realproblem, but it was revised up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing information about reported increases in numbers over different quarters, without expressing any disagreement with those numbers.


Passage number 115.
MR. BLACK. They're probably capturing improvements inquality, as I understand it. What do you think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. Mr. Black is simply expressing his understanding and asking for the opinion of the other person.


Passage number 116.
MR. KICHLINE. I don't know. At this point they really dohave limited information and they have a great deal of trouble withmix problems. We have been getting a lot of increase in multifamilyconstruction and they may well end up revising that away later on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply presents a statement about the limited information and challenges faced in dealing with mix problems in multifamily construction. It does not involve any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


Passage number 117.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If I understand, all the constructionmaterials prices are steady or down and wage rates are steady.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is presented as an observation or understanding, stating that construction materials prices are either steady or down, and wage rates are steady. There is no conflicting information or contrasting viewpoints.


Passage number 118.
8/21/84MR. BLACK. And there are no changes in the implicitdeflator. It's an unusual phenomenon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is stating a fact about an unusual phenomenon without any conflicting views or arguments.


Passage number 119.
MR. MARTIN. In support, Jim, of our outlook for inflation, Ithink we need to be careful not to assume that the projected changesin the value of the dollar--I'm being serious now--will have the kindsof impact on domestic producers and on prices of both business goodsand consumer goods as was true in many other expansion periods. Itseems to me that the loss of share of the market to foreign suppliers--to the out-sourcing entities--is to a large degree a fairly long-term loss of those markets. Domestic producers and domestic sellersmay get those markets back or they may not, and those are importantmarket gains to the foreign producer. He is going to hold on to thatmarket share if that means price concessions or price steadiness. Ithink the American consumer will benefit from that. So, the loss ofshare of the market has a positive impact on domestic inflation inthis country.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion and providing reasons to support their view.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 120.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. On the other hand, although there may besomething to what you say, we're going to get some protectionistmeasures that may lead to some direct price [effects] in steel andcopper and other things.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The phrase "On the other hand" suggests a contrasting viewpoint or disagreement with the previous statement. Additionally, the mention of "protectionist measures" indicates a potential disagreement or difference in opinion about trade policies that may impact prices.


Passage number 121.
MR. MARTIN. And those industries will find all kinds ofingenious ways to get around those measures unless they are very, verybroad and firm indeed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating that industries will try to find ways to bypass measures unless they are strict and comprehensive.


Passage number 122.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'm not sure that your basicproposition is clear because [foreigners had] even a much smallershare of the [domestic] market in 1978 when the dollar was down[unintelligible], and other exporters were giving discounts to keeptheir share of the market. What you're really saying is that becausethe foreign share of the market is larger than it was, they are goingto be more willing to make concessions.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing uncertainty and seeking clarification.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 123.
MR. MARTIN. They are going to have slow growth in their owneconomies, Tony. Their own markets are not expanding the way theirshare of our markets is expanding. They have a very great incentiveto hold their prices or not increase them much, and that puts pressureon our price setters. These are administered prices and it is veryimportant to keep them steady because they have just gotten that shareof the market. If you have just penetrated it, you are going to bevery careful in your pricing. These are cartel mentalities from theseother countries. They have a different legal scheme where they aregoing to administer those prices carefully, I think, to maintain theirmarket share in the world's biggest market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Martin, argues that other countries have a "cartel mentality" and are using price administration to maintain their market share in the world's biggest market. This implies that there is disagreement or tension between different countries in terms of market expansion and pricing strategies.


Passage number 124.
MR. PARTEE. Do you think they would tend to hold theirdollar prices and eat the change in the exchange rate profit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question asking for an opinion on a hypothetical situation.


Passage number 125.
MR. MARTIN. I do, sir. We're talking about the short run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that Mr. Martin agrees with something without providing any conflicting opinions.


Passage number 126.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Empirically what they do, Chuck, as Ihad occasion to follow it very closely, is that they don't hold theirdollar prices but typically will split with their distributor half thecosts of the exchange [rate change]. The distributors also have aninterest in preserving the volume and share of market, so they will-10-8/21/84cut their own [profit] and the manufacturer will [unintelligible] andbe willing to accept some of the smaller profits.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply describes a business practice without presenting opposing views or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 127.
MR. MARTIN. For a while.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Martin is expressing his thoughts or statements without any contradiction or argument.


Passage number 128.
MR. PARTEE. For a while. This is part of the lag that Tedis talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Partee's statement is in agreement with what Ted is talking about.


Passage number 129.
MR. MARTIN. I think we'll have more lag.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage is a statement made by Mr. Martin expressing his thoughts and does not involve any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 130.
MR. WALLICH. It troubles me that most of the good news aboutinflation does seem to be reversible over time--not all of it, butmost. It's reminiscent of the early '50s when we were tellingourselves that we had finally achieved price stability and what washappening was that food was coming down for several years andeverything else was going up and the net was stability. This islikely to catch up with us again after a year or two.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing concern about the sustainability of the good news about inflation.


Passage number 131.
MR. MARTIN. In a recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states that Mr. Martin is speaking during a recession, without providing any further information or indicating any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 132.
MR. WALLICH. I hope that will give us some boost. I wasjust assuming that the economy would be growing at a stable rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing a hopeful sentiment about the economy growing at a stable rate.


Passage number 133.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. If you analyze what happened toinflation in the last recovery which was almost a 5-year period goingfrom the third quarter of '75 to the first quarter of '80--and I'm notsaying I've done it scientifically, but I've asked a lot of questionsabout this--we hit double digit inflation problems. Part of that, ofcourse, was a very large drop in the dollar. First of all, I wouldput the oil shock as [unintelligible] and then the drop in the dollar.And part of it, I guess, was monetary policy. Even though the moneysupply numbers looked pretty good for most of that period, interestrates really did not rise and in hindsight the experts tell me thatthere was a shift in the demand function--whatever that means, I don'tknow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply discussing their own analysis and understanding of inflation during a specific time period, acknowledging that it is not based on a scientific study but rather on conversations and questions they have had.


Passage number 134.
MR. PARTEE. Unexplainable.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 135.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The interest rates would not keep therise [unintelligible] agreed-upon proposition. Until the dollar begandeclining, which forced some major rises in interest rates,[unintelligible] interest rates probably did not keep the economy fromoverheating. It's interesting to analyze when you look back if thereis any way to give weight to these certain factors. Was the Systemmore to blame than the Arabs and OPEC. I don't know. It's true thatwe probably are not going to have an oil shock. That looks to be thecase. It looks as if there are going to be a lot of assurancesagainst another oil shock almost permanently--I mean by permanently inthe next 5 to 10 years. And presumably we're running monetary policynow somewhat more tightly. We are more sensitive to an inflationarythreat during a recovery. On the other hand, we don't really know howthe dollar will behave and what the impact of that would be. So, itseems to me that there's a useful lesson to be learned from doing morescientifically what I was trying to do--analyzing what is different inthe factors affecting inflation in this recovery than in the last one.That is relative to Henry Wallich's kind of pessimism about[unintelligible]. Are we going to end up doing any better or not. Itseems to me that there are two things going for us that may make a-11-8/21/84significant difference. One is the likely absence of any oil shockand the other is the way we are running monetary policy now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is mainly discussing factors that may affect inflation and monetary policy.


Passage number 136.
MR. WALLICH. Well, I was speaking about an even more distantperiod. In the early '50s we had no particular oil shocks; we had afood shock. As I look at the numbers for the future, capacityutilization now has been upgraded in this staff projection by almost 1percentage point for the end of '85. Nominal GNP is about the same,but real GNP is significantly higher in the latest projection. Idon't know what happens to unit labor costs but they certainly risevery sharply from '84 to '85. And in that environment, to think thatinflation will rise by only 1 percentage point is on the optimisticside.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply sharing their observations and analysis of data.


Passage number 137.
MR. FORRESTAL. And nobody has mentioned fiscal policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. Explanation: The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Forrestal.


Passage number 138.
MR. WALLICH. Right. There is an increase of $20 billion inthe full employment deficit--in other words, something we would haveregarded as enormously stimulative some years back.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about the increase in the full employment deficit.


Passage number 139.
MR. AXILROD. Governor Wallich, do you think interest rateswill rise in that scenario.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not convey any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a question to Governor Wallich.


Passage number 140.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We tend to think there might be somerise in interest rates in '85, which would hold things back a little.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states that "We tend to think there might be some rise in interest rates in '85" which implies that there is speculation or a possibility of an increase in interest rates. However, there is no explicit disagreement or contention expressed in the passage.


Passage number 141.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, it's interesting how the deficit hasdisappeared from the market's thinking. It was pervasive and now it'ssomewhere in the background.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement made by Mr. Roberts is an observation about the market's thinking regarding the deficit. There is no indication of opposing viewpoints or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 142.
MR. MORRIS. The one positive factor that you didn't mention,Tony, is that if you compare this expansion to the one of the late1970s, the rate of wage advance is substantially lower now than it wasat the same stage of that expansion.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents a comparison between the rate of wage advance in the current expansion and the expansion of the late 1970s.


Passage number 143.
MR. MARTIN. And the rate of productivity increase is muchhigher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement about the rate of productivity increase being much higher is provided without any opposing viewpoint or conflicting information.


Passage number 144.
MR. MORRIS. Not yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 145.
MR. MARTIN. Relative to the 1970s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any contention or disagreement. It simply introduces the topic of the 1970s.


Passage number 146.
MR. MORRIS. I don't think we can really document that yet.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Morris is expressing uncertainty or doubt about the ability to document something.


Passage number 147.
MR. MARTIN. 2.9 percent and 3.3 percent are the numbers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states two numbers without any conflicting viewpoints or opposing arguments.


Passage number 148.
MS. SEGER. [Unintelligible] in the early '70s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. This is evident as the passage only mentions MS. SEGER and does not provide any context or information related to any form of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 149.
MR. GRAMLEY. Well, the trend was. But Frank is talkingabout the same period of expansion. We had a very substantialimprovement in productivity as we came out of the 1974-75 recession.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.  There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply adding more information to clarify the topic being discussed.


Passage number 150.
MR. MORRIS. Unit labor costs are doing much better now butprimarily because the rate of wage advance is much lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact about unit labor costs and the rate of wage advance.


Passage number 151.
MR. PARTEE. And, of course, real interest rates are muchhigher.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that real interest rates are much higher.


Passage number 152.
-12-8/21/84 -13-MR. BLACK. But, Frank, it's interesting if you look atconsumer prices. So far in this expansion they have been 5.6 percent,which is the second largest amount of increase in any of the 6 postwarrecoveries. And the fixed-weight price index is up 6.2 percent versus6.5 percent in the 1970-72 period, which means more is going to profitdespite wage restraint. It doesn't look that different. It's ratherscary as a matter of fact looking at some of these, which I have doneon a preliminary basis but not as thoroughly as I need to. Producerprices look a lot better; they are half as much so far as in 1970-72--2.3 percent versus 4.6 percent for the first six quarters. That hasfood in there; if you look at the nonfood part you might get adifferent impression. I just happened to run across these rightbefore the meeting.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing information and sharing their observations about consumer prices and producer prices.


Passage number 153.
MR. WALLICH. Why is it that the projection for the outputper hour--that is, productivity--is so pessimistic for 1985. I missedthat; it goes from 2.5 percent in 1984 to .8 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply asking a question about a projection and expressing surprise at the pessimistic outlook for productivity in 1985.


Passage number 154.
MR. MARTIN. I'm glad you asked that question, Henry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Martin states that he is glad someone asked a question, suggesting a positive attitude.


Passage number 155.
MR. KICHLINE. Because we think that we've overshot trend.The way these things are done, in looking back at history one wouldassume that over time we would get down to a trend rate of growth.Our view is that in 1984 we're dealing with trend growth ofproductivity of around 1-1/4 percent. That's subject to debate, butthat's the number we used. We're getting more than that and we expectwe will slowly be approaching trend, so that in 1985 we fall below1-1/4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is presenting their own view and acknowledging that it is subject to debate. They are not engaging in a debate or argument with anyone else.


Passage number 156.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. In looking at these summaries of Districtbusiness conditions, I thought I detected a considerably more cautioustone than had been reflected earlier. Did I detect wrongly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The author is simply questioning their own perception of the business conditions.


Passage number 157.
MR. GRAMLEY. Do you mean on the price side or business.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply a question asking for clarification.


Passage number 158.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, on the business [side].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The given passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker simply states that there is no disagreement or contention on the business side.


Passage number 159.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In my District I noticed that myboard reflects that more cautious tone. They are heavily influencedby retail sales, car loans--the [industries] they are in--and theyseem to feel that [business conditions] are not quite as ebullient asthey were. Still, that's just a nuance of tone, I think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their observation about the tone of their district's board without any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 160.
MR. BOEHNE. Part of that is that in the business communitythere is nothing very tangible except the old conventional wisdom thatwhat goes up comes down. Things have been going along pretty well andthey think it has to come to an end sooner or later, so I think thatmakes them cautious. Looking at it from an analytical point of view,while expansions vary all over the lot in terms of length, we aremoving up toward an average life for this recovery. And I think Presmade a point on the inflation outlook that things are going alongpretty well right now. As you look out, you can see certainpossibilities of being ambushed but one that hasn't been talked aboutis the possibility of a recession. We have a great reluctance toproject recessions around the table. In fact, most people do. But Ithink at least some mild recession out over the 1985-86 horizon is areasonable possibility. And that is clearly a negative as far asinflation turning around. Being this far [into a recovery] with the8/21/84positive signs that we have--. We really have made a remarkabledownward adjustment in inflation from the last cycle to this one. Andit seems to me that most of those gains are going to be maintained,largely because we have circumstances that are favorable and also justbecause expansions wear out in time and finally they die. That, Ithink, is the basic assurance of it really [not] getting away from us.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing their perspective on the current state of the economy and expressing the possibility of a recession in the future.


Passage number 161.
MR. PARTEE. I really don't understand how you can say that,Ed. We're 2-1/2 years into the recovery. At 2-1/2 years into themiddle 1970s recovery, we didn't have much inflation. Bob was givingthose figures.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain contention or disagreement. It only includes Mr. Partee expressing confusion and seeking clarification from Ed.


Passage number 162.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We're only 21 months, I guess, by agenerous interpretation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply presents a timeframe or duration without any conflicting opinions or contradictory statements.


Passage number 163.
MR. PARTEE. It took quite a while for that inflation to heatup in the middle 1970s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is a factual statement about the timing of inflation in the 1970s. There is no contention or disagreement present in the passage.


Passage number 164.
MR. BOEHNE. Yes, but that really got going, I think, as aresult of the oil shock.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that something got going as a result of the oil shock, without indicating any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 165.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage without the actual content of the passage.


Passage number 166.
 Well,--MR. BOEHNE. It contributed to it, but was not a factor to[unintelligible].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It seems to suggest that something contributed to a situation but was not a significant factor.


Passage number 167.
MR. PARTEE. Yes. The oil increase was about early 1979,wasn't it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking for confirmation about the timing of the oil increase in 1979.


Passage number 168.
MR. BOEHNE. No. Which one are you talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a simple question and does not involve any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 169.
MR. MARTIN. The first one was in 1973.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about when the first occurrence happened, without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 170.
MR. PARTEE. I'm talking about the second oil shock.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 171.
MR. BOEHNE. The second part of the 1970s.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage only consists of one statement by "Mr. Boehne," which does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 172.
MR. PARTEE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage as indicated by Mr. Partee's response.


Passage number 173.
MR. WALLICH. That was in '79 and in '74 we had one.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating two different events that occurred in different years.


Passage number 174.
MR. PARTEE. I'm talking about the second half of the '70s.It took some while for the inflation to really accelerate. Then onceit accelerated, it accelerated fast.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a chronological progression of events related to inflation.


Passage number 175.
MR. WALLICH. But that was not oil, I think. Oil came afterthat, in '79.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Wallich is simply stating a fact about the occurrence of oil coming after a certain event in 1979.


Passage number 176.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I think what happened was this: Inthe first years of the Carter administration basic inflation wasrunning only around 6 percent but they admitted privately that therewere a lot of built-in factors in the policy that was being followedthat would bring that inflation rate up substantially even without theoil shock. But it probably would not have gone to double digit rates;it probably would have gone to 8-1/2 percent without the second oilshock.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage presents a discussion of historical events and the opinions or beliefs of the speaker. There is no clear contention or disagreement between different parties or viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 177.
-14-8/21/84MR. BOEHNE. I think we have much less room here forinflation to get going as it did then because of the level of interestrates. If we had a turnaround in inflationary psychology, I think wewould get a big push-up in long-term rates. And I don't think there'sthat much room between where we are now and what it would take to tripthe economy into a recession. So, I think it would take less of achange in inflationary expectations now than it did then to get theimpact on interest rates that would give us the slowdown.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Boehne, believes that there is less room for inflation to increase now compared to before due to the level of interest rates. He argues that if there was a change in inflationary expectations, it would have a significant impact on long-term interest rates and could potentially cause a slowdown or recession. This perspective contrasts with the possibility that there may be more room for inflation to increase and the impact on interest rates may not be as severe.


Passage number 178.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: To answer this question, the passage must be provided.


Passage number 179.
MR. ROBERTS. Just responding to this question of attitudes,we've been surveying people in our District and I would say theconsensus is that no one anticipates a downturn this year. They areall feeling comfortable. They are a little more cautious as theysense the slowdown. We've been asking them what they think aboutprices and they give us two responses. One is that there are no pricepressures out there from their suppliers and they are not able toraise prices in the market. Every time they try, they get knockeddown. Looking ahead, however, to the year-end or the fourth quarter--not next year--they are all trying to raise prices about 4 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents the results of a survey conducted by Mr. Roberts in their District.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 180.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. This brings up something that I wantto check with Jim Kichline on. My people project that even by the endof 1985, assuming these growth figures that we more or less are inagreement on--let's say 3 percent real GNP in 1985--that utilizationof capacity should not exceed 85 percent because they believe thatcapacity will be growing in 1985 at about the same rate. Therefore,even though we're up now to the 83-84 percent area--I don't knowexactly where in there--we probably will not see 85 percent even bythe end of 1985. Is that correct. Is that your assumption.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage contains disagreement or contention. This can be seen in the phrase "assuming these growth figures that we more or less are in agreement on." This suggests that there may be some disagreement or lack of consensus regarding the growth figures.


Passage number 181.
MR. KICHLINE. That's right. We're at 82.5 percent now andthat is our view. It moves up a little but we are assuming thatcapacity growth is increasing perhaps at a 3 to 3-1/2 percent rate nowand we have growth of output slowing, so that our number at anendpoint is around 84-1/2 percent. So, our view would be consistent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating their view and the assumptions they are making.


Passage number 182.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That would make a big differencealso, because as I remember the Carter period we got up to 88 percentand that [utilization rate] was putting on a lot of pressure.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement about the potential impact of a certain situation.


Passage number 183.
MR. CORRIGAN. There is somewhat of an inevitability here tooin the context of the ballpark range of numbers that we are looking atfor unemployment and capacity utilization for 1985. We could be luckyand get the kind of inflation picture that people are talking about.But it is also true, inevitably true, that we're getting near thepoint in both capacity utilization and unemployment rates where itwouldn't take a heck of a lot to get a worse result. And with all thegood things that are going on--and there are a lot of them--if we hitthose points, whatever they are, in capacity and unemployment, we willstart to get price pressure. It's as certain as the day is long.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not involve any contention or disagreement. It presents a statement by Mr. Corrigan and provides an explanation of a potential outcome related to unemployment, capacity utilization, and inflation. There is no contradictory viewpoint or argument.


Passage number 184.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it seems to me the major risk on theprice side is the dollar. Let me examine the proposition that theeconomy may turn out to be a little softer in the near term than Mr.Kichline has projected. We have housing definitely going down now andI think we have some momentum in business spending with the latest8/21/84number--though it may not mean anything--but the latest consumptionfigures are not so great.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 185.
MS. HORN. In the Fourth District, Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: . Smith has a commanding lead in the polls.


Passage number 186.
 Chairman, we do havereports of some lessening in steel, which is definitely in thatcategory of housing--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Steel still is showing no pickup from thislittle slump in the spring.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that there is no pickup in steel despite a little slump in the spring. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 187.
MS. HORN. Yes, but you were referring to business spending.We are getting a lot of reports of a great deal of enthusiasm on thebusiness investment side of things. That sort of goes on with anattitude that good times will go on forever--forgetting underlyingproblems such as the exchange rate, deficits, and so forth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. Ms. Horn is simply providing additional information and addressing different aspects of business investment.


Passage number 188.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, that seems to be the strongestthing. I suppose for the short run the economy is going to bedetermined by inventories as always.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating an opinion or assumption about the economy being determined by inventories in the short run.


Passage number 189.
MR. GRAMLEY. The one thing we do know in that respect,though, is that the revisions of the second-quarter statistics makethat picture look a little better. The upward revision of GNP wasaccompanied by a downward revision in the rate of inventoryaccumulation. So that looks a little better. In terms of theprospects for too much of a slowdown, I think one needs to take intoaccount the fact that the 7.6 percent rate of growth in the secondquarter took place despite a drop in auto inventories. If you takeinto account the drop in auto production, you're looking at anunderlying rate of over 9 percent. The staff has it going down along, long way and I think the basics that we've been looking at forthe past year--including the thrust of both monetary and fiscalpolicies--would suggest to me that worries about an excessive slowdownwould seem premature at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, is presenting information and giving his own analysis of the data. He believes that the revisions of the second-quarter statistics make the picture look a little better, and he takes into account the drop in auto inventories and production to suggest an underlying rate of over 9 percent. He also mentions that the staff has a different view and that worries about an excessive slowdown would seem premature at this point. However, there is no clear disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 190.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We've had the shift of the tooling upin the automobile industry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 191.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes. It isn't going to add a lot to the thirdquarter, but it's going to stop taking off so much.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker agrees that the mentioned action will not have a significant impact in the third quarter but will prevent further negative effects.


Passage number 192.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I was told it was going to add quite a lotto the third quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not include any contention or disagreement. It simply states what the speaker was told about an anticipated addition to the third quarter.


Passage number 193.
MR. GRAMLEY. It took out 2 percentage points or thereaboutsin the second quarter and the amount of upward thrust in the thirdquarter I don't think is quite that large.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It simply states the speaker's belief about the size of the upward thrust in the third quarter, without conflicting viewpoints being expressed.


Passage number 194.
MR. KICHLINE. [It depends on] what you are talking about.If you talk about the auto sector in total, it's a little more than 2percentage points difference from Q1 to Q2. If you go through theexercise of saying "If GM had behaved as the rest of the industry,"then it's around a percentage point or a little more that it reduced[GNP] in the second quarter and it adds about a little more than apercentage point in the third quarter. So, there are [different]questions and different numbers. But we have a little more than apercentage point on that basis.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 195.
8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The GNP figure ought to look prettyhealthy in the third quarter, but I'm not sure that means anything.It has this bloop in it. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage does not show any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing uncertainty about the significance of the GNP figure in the third quarter due to a "bloop" or anomaly in it. However, there is no indication of a disagreement with another person or viewpoint.


Passage number 196.
MR. KEEHN. I would certainly support your observation thatthere is a more moderate tone out there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing agreement and support for someone else's observation about a moderate tone.


Passage number 197.
 Certainly, in the MiddleWest, those sectors of the economy that have been doing well--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I was observing on your observation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating an observation about the economy in the MiddleWest.


Passage number 198.
MR. KEEHN. Thank you. Those sectors that have been doingwell are continuing to do well but in terms of output, employment,income, and orders, there is far less optimism than has been the casein the past. But as always, to repeat a comment, I continue to beimpressed by how uneven all of this is. The folks in the capitalgoods industries--those impacted by both a high level of imports and areduced level of exports--and anybody who is at all involved in theagricultural sector are continuing to be very, very gloomy about howthings are going. And I suppose to say the obvious with regard to theinflation outlook, the UAW negotiations are quite key. And I can'tget a very good feel as to what is going on out there. Those I talkto conjecture that there's a pretty good opportunity of gettingthrough [the negotiations] without a strike and they say that if thereis a settlement, it will be in the 4 to 6 percent area and [thecompanies] can make that up on productivity. But on the other side ofthat coin, the strike fund is at a record level. The union leadershipthat negotiated the concessions by and large has been voted out and ontop of that the negotiations are described as being terribly, terriblycomplicated. I think that's an uncertain scenario, and certainly keyto the wage outlook would be the results of that particularnegotiation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any direct contention or disagreement. It is more of a descriptive and speculative analysis of different sectors and the uncertainty surrounding certain negotiations.


Passage number 199.
MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I think any effort to try toisolate factors that might result in a sharp slowing [of theexpansion] or, as you put it, even an indication of a possibility--Iwon't even say probability--of recession should take into account thepossibility of greatly increased nervousness on the part of consumers/savers/depositors with regard to the thrift industry and to someextent the heightened concern about commercial banking. I'm preparedto expand on that theme, as I'm sure you're all delighted to hear. Wehave a major holder of household deposits--$900 billion or a trillionor whatever the number is, including the savings banks--and the newsand the facts with regard to those industries are going to be verynegative. I would guess, not out of any expertise, that the mediawill find the ongoing saga of difficulties in thrift institutions andquestions about the efficacy of the deposit insurance system apotentially depressing factor on consumer behavior. I'm only sayingthis in response to your suggestion that we examine some of thedownside factors, and this to me is a real one. I don't know whatprobability to attach to it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Martin is simply expressing his opinion and concerns regarding the potential impact of negative news about the thrift industry and deposit insurance system on consumer behavior.


Passage number 200.
MR. ROBERTS. Pres, I'm sure that's a possibility; I don'tdeny that at all. But the experience I had was that the stress in thethrift institutions in Chicago was [met with] a yawn. We had onesituation involving a panic in a small S&L where they made people lineup. But whenever they were working [these situations] out in mergers,people seemed to be totally indifferent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker acknowledges the possibility of a different perspective but shares their own experience without directly contradicting or disagreeing with anyone else's viewpoint.


Passage number 201.
-17-8/21/84VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. They certainly aren't yawning out inCalifornia.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It simply states a fact or observation.

VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Chuck, you will be interested to hearthat the CEO of one of the major money center banks in New York saidat a meeting in my Bank with S&Ls and quite a few industrialists,[unintelligible] "You would think that the regulatory authority wouldbe able to prevent a situation like that." And I said to him that myunderstanding was that they had--that the whole reckless expansion hadbeen frowned upon very seriously by the regulatory authorities butthey didn't have the legal authority [to stop it]. I said that wecouldn't too easily in our system, given all the emphasis onderegulation, issue a cease and desist order simply because ofimprudence or what we judge to be imprudent expansion when thechickens haven't come home to roost yet. [The question is] whether wereally could prove that in court. What is the ability of theregulatory authorities to slow down an expansion that they think isimprudent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No 

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply explaining a conversation they had with the CEO, stating their understanding of the regulatory authorities' role in preventing reckless expansion.


Passage number 214.
MR. MARTIN. They'd have to resort to Section 207 of the Actin the Home Loan Bank System and find that it was unsafe and unsound.I shouldn't try to practice law here, but they would have to go-18-8/21/84further than imprudent and that's quite a finding, as we all very wellknow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Martin about the actions that would need to be taken.


Passage number 215.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. And you can ask where the bank regulatorsare too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The sentence is simply stating that one can also inquire about the location of bank regulators.


Passage number 216.
MR. MARTIN. Regulation is ex post. Supervision of financialinstitutions is always ex post, by the nature of it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage states that regulation and supervision of financial institutions is always ex post, which means that it occurs after an event or action has taken place. There is no contention or disagreement mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 217.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Miss Seger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 218.
MS. SEGER. I would like to make a couple of comments aboutthe auto negotiations, following up on Si's comments. I know mostpeople seem to be betting that there won't be a strike, but there isalso a chance that there will be. I think the primary risk is thatthe cast of characters has changed dramatically. Doug Frazier, ofcourse, has left as head of the UAW and this has triggered a lot ofmovements within the union. Mr. Beaver is not Doug Frazier and no oneknows exactly how he will come down in the final days of negotiationsnext month. Furthermore, if there is no strike and if they settle fora "modest" in quotes 4 to 6 percent, maybe the auto industry can makethat up with productivity gains; but to the extent that thesesettlements are duplicated by other industries that cannot make it upby productivity gains it can have an inflationary impact. I think, bythe way, that the auto executives are more aware of that this timearound than they used to be when they just went zipping along on theirown, not giving a darn what they left in their wake. I think theyhave come to their senses a little.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a single speaker expressing their thoughts and observations on the possibility of a strike in the auto industry and the potential impact on inflation. There is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting information presented.


Passage number 219.
MR. BLACK. Except on their own salaries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage only states that the speaker agrees with something, without mentioning any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 220.
MS. SEGER. Actually, if you compare what some of them maketo what some top people in banks make, including some banks that gotinto trouble, I don't think the comparison is that adverse.[Laughter.] Also, if there is a strike--as I said, the jury is stillout--I think we will have to pay some attention to this in ourforecast for the remaining months of this year. I know that theeconometric models show that that is quickly made up, but those of usin the trenches who don't just go by models know that there is anadjustment period that isn't smooth necessarily. It does mean a lossin momentum, particularly at the time of the year when the new modelsare being introduced, and this could have an effect. I generallyagree, Jim, with your forecast on auto sales, etc. but that's assumingthere isn't a strike.A second point about inflation prospects that I don't hearmentioned very much around this table involves the changing attitudeson the part of business management. A lot of these people were reallybeaten up in these two recessions we had back to back and I think theyhave gotten new religion about cost control. Again, the old notion ofwho cares--the attitude of write a blank check to the unions or toanybody else because we can always pass these higher costs along--ifit hasn't been completely eliminated is 90 some percent on its wayout. I think we are going to see the effect of this differentattitude, In line with that is a greater commitment to improving theefficiency of production. This is tied in, by the way, to the goodcapital spending numbers. A lot of those capital expenditures are for-19-8/21/84equipment that will allow them to operate more efficiently--expenditures on robotics, for example. I know it's nice to look backat historical trends but when things of this nature are developingthat are different from history, I don't think extrapolating pasttrends is necessarily going to tell us what's coming up. So, on theone hand, I'm more encouraged about inflation prospects than some ofyou; on the other hand, looking at the auto side, I'm concerned aboutwhat that could do.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their opinions and observations about different topics, but there is no opposing viewpoint presented or argument being made.


Passage number 221.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That auto industry settlement is thesecond biggest threat to the inflation outlook, next to the dollar.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage is stating that the auto industry settlement is the second biggest threat to the inflation outlook, next to the dollar. It is not expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 222.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The 4 to 6 percent settlement doesnot include the COLA, which they are going to maintain. Therefore, ifinflation goes up, say, 5 percent altogether, then we're talking abouta 10 percent increase in compensation. Am I incorrect.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact and asking for confirmation about their understanding.


Passage number 223.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. No, I think--I hope--when they are talking4 to 6 percent they are including the COLA.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses their hope that when "they" are discussing a 4 to 6 percent figure, it includes the COLA.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 224.
MR. KEEHN. They are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. This can be inferred from the use of the word "they" in Mr. Keen's statement, which suggests that someone else has a differing opinion or perspective. However, without further context or information, it is not clear what the disagreement or contention is about.


Passage number 225.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. How can that be.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply poses a question and does not express any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 226.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, it's a guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty or lack of confidence in their guess.


Passage number 227.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I had a presentation which said thatthey were not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 228.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. A 4 to 6 percent increase without the COLAwould be bigger than what they used to get.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about a potential increase in percentage without the inclusion of COLA (cost of living adjustment). There is no conflicting opinion or opposing view presented.


Passage number 229.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But if we're figuring inflation isgoing to be up in the neighborhood of 5 percent, are you talking aboutonly a 1 percent [real] increase.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating a hypothetical scenario and asking a clarifying question.


Passage number 230.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they don't get a full passthrough onthe COLA, I guess.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not express any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating an observation or guess about a situation.


Passage number 231.
MR. PARTEE. I don't think it's quite full.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses their opinion without any conflicting views being presented.


Passage number 232.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's pretty big.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage "It's pretty big" because there is no contrasting opinion or opposing argument presented.


Passage number 233.
MS. SEGER. They toned down the formula--not the last timearound but two times ago--so that they don't get a complete percentage[passthrough].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is simply stating a fact about the toning down of the formula.


Passage number 234.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I wonder if the staff knows theanswer to this.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage simply expresses curiosity and does not indicate any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 235.
MR. KICHLINE. I don't know the answer. It is the case thatwhen you're talking about these numbers of 6 percent or so that thoseare associated with the COLA. I know that the COLA requirements thatthey get are less generous than what they used to get. They used toget something close to 90-95 percent, but I don't know what the numberis [currently].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Kichline simply states that he is unsure about the current number associated with the COLA requirements.


Passage number 236.
-20-8/21/84MR. MARTIN. If you recall the Chairman's data on recentmajor settlements that he gave us six weeks ago, there was a string ofno COLA, no COLA, no COLA, small COLA, and so on in that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 237.
MR. KICHLINE. He came up with a little over 3 percent in thefirst year on the collective agreements.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a fact about the percentage increase in the first year of the collective agreements. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 238.
MR. MARTIN. But the COLAs were almost all absent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states that the COLAs (Cost of Living Adjustments) were almost all absent without any conflicting opinions or viewpoints.


Passage number 239.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Those figures are apart from COLAs. Notall those agreements had COLAs. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states two separate facts about agreements: some agreements have COLAs and not all agreements have COLAs. There is no indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 240.
MS. SEGER. But when the auto industry talks about theircosts they have to think in terms of total costs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Ms. Seger, is stating a fact about the auto industry's perspective on costs.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 241.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 242.
MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With respect to yourquestion "Is there more pessimism." I'd say things perhaps are morepessimistic in the Tenth District. It's a very unbalanced recovery inthe sense that in manufacturing, particularly auto assembly, aircraft,and other manufacturing, together with construction, things are goingvery well. I don't know that there's been any damping of thosesectors of the economy. On the other hand, I'd just note that thegood projection for inflation in the period ahead is tied largely tothe energy and agricultural food sectors, which will have an effect oflowering the outlook for inflation. In each of those cases--in theenergy sector, for example, the dropping of oil prices and thedropping of natural gas prices will impact the discovery andextraction of petroleum products in the Tenth District ratherdramatically. There has been no increase in rig counts in the mostrecent time; it's fairly level and some ten to thirteen percent higherthan it was April of '83, which was a low point in the rig count. Ifenergy prices fall further, we're quite likely to see that sector turndown again, and it's already in trouble. At the same time, as all ofyou know and as has been recited around this table, the agriculturalsector is in trouble and there is no prospect in the sense of exportsor other factors that will raise commodity prices. That's thesalvation and the hope, [but] there is nothing out there. As a matterof fact, there is a good crop assured at this point and that has acontinuing depressing effect. The one tangible number that I canrecite to you is out of a survey of farm land prices; they havedecreased another 2-1/2 percent in the second quarter of 1984. Thathas an impact, obviously, that rolls back into the financial systemthat we quite likely will see around the first quarter of 1985. Ithink we're talking about the thrifts, for example, and potentially asegment of our financial industry that supports the agriculturalsector that could be in really serious trouble late this year or inthe first quarter of 1985. Again, I don't think the interest rates inand of themselves hold out much hope. Lower interest rates wouldhelp, to be sure, but that isn't what will extract the agriculturalsector; it will be commodity prices, and nobody has any real hope thatthat will come to pass.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage presents a disagreement or contention. Mr. Guffey expresses pessimism about the Tenth District's economy, particularly in the energy and agricultural sectors, while noting that manufacturing and construction are doing well. The disagreement lies in the differing outlooks for different sectors of the economy.


Passage number 243.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the provided passage. It only states "Mr. Forrestal" without providing any additional information that suggests disagreement or contention.


Passage number 244.
MR. FORRESTAL. Well, Mr. Chairman, in the Sixth District, Idon't think you would find very much caution. There seems to be a-21-8/21/84good deal of optimism and bullishness on the part of most businesspeople. To the extent that there is a cautionary psychology creepingin, I think it can be attributed to three basic things. One is theweakness in the housing sector and related industries. That sector isdefinitely coming off in our District and is giving cause for someconcern. On the price front, we have an interesting dichotomy, itseems to me. On the one hand, there are a lot of people who are stillconcerned about inflation. They look into 1985 and they see capacityconstraints; they see labor-wage negotiations perhaps bringing us outof this period of moderation; and they are a little worried about aprecipitous decline of the dollar, which would hurt us on theinflation side. But on the other side of the coin, there are otherpeople who are concerned about deflation. I've had a lot of questionsabout that, I guess in light of the newspaper articles that haveappeared. So that's an interesting kind of schizophrenia, if youwill, in the market psychology. Some people are afraid of higherprices and others are afraid that the bottom is going to drop out. Athird thing that has emerged very recently is a very, very realconcern on the part of most people about the financial system. When Iwas here 6 weeks ago I said in my comments that there was a "ho hum"attitude about Continental at that time. That has definitely beenreversed. There is now a very definite concern about spillovereffects of Continental and of course now a very, very great concernabout the thrifts. So, those are the three areas of concerns that arebeginning to emerge in our part of the country. And for what it'sworth, the automobile people that I have talked to recently who havemade their annual pilgrimage to Detroit and have come back arereporting that in their opinion there will be a strike. There doesn'tseem to be any question in the minds of the people that I have talkedto about that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply presents various concerns and observations without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 245.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm not sure a strike is the worst thingin the world that can happen, if the alternative is a high laborsettlement.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating that a strike may not be the worst outcome if the alternative is a high labor settlement. This statement presents an opinion or perspective without contradicting or engaging with any opposing views.


Passage number 246.
MR. FORRESTAL. Incidentally, they think it's going to berelatively short--4 to 6 weeks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states a belief or expectation that the duration of something is relatively short, without providing any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 247.
MR. PARTEE. A strike followed by higher wages.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage states that a strike is followed by higher wages. There is no contention or disagreement mentioned in the passage.


Passage number 248.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's the worst--if we get the high wagesand a strike. If no one else has any pressing comments, why don't wehear from Mr. Axilrod.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing concern about the possibility of high wages and a strike happening simultaneously. They then suggest hearing from Mr. Axilrod unless anyone else has any pressing comments.


Passage number 249.
MR. AXILROD. [Statement--see Appendix.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: As an AI language model, I cannot access the Appendix or any specific external information. Therefore, I cannot determine whether there is contention or disagreement in the passage without further context or information.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 250.
]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We'll take some brief questions now andmaybe have coffee. Before that, let me just say that when I look atthis directive I'm a little hard pressed to see why we're runningbelow [the specifications for the aggregates]. I know we're runningbelow the track a bit on M1; that's fine. I don't know why. Thequestion that occurred to me right off is: Why reduce the target forM1 for the quarter when we're running a little low--or reduce it somuch, anyway. Then, if it went back up and we got the target we werelooking for before, we'd have to tighten. That's a little odd to me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker expresses confusion and skepticism about the decision to reduce the target for M1 and questions the reasoning behind it. They find it odd and don't understand why the target would be lowered when they are already running below the specifications.


Passage number 251.
MR. PARTEE. We have a tradition of not changing much, too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any statements or arguments that suggest contention or disagreement. It simply states that "we have a tradition of not changing much."


Passage number 252.
8/21/84MR. MORRIS. My question for Mr. Axilrod is: We're seeing aperiod of relatively modest growth in the monetary aggregatesaccompanied by a period of sustained, very excessive rates of growthin total credit. How do you interpret these different growth ratesand what policy implications do they have.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is describing a situation and asking for an interpretation and policy implications. There is no clear indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 253.
MR. AXILROD. One of my problems in answering your question,President Morris, is that I really would not ever have thought ofrunning policy on total credit.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker simply expresses that they would not have considered running policy on total credit.


Passage number 254.
 But I would--MR. PARTEE. It makes it hard to communicate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 255.
MR. AXILROD. I would tend more, if I were looking in thatdirection, to be looking through it to the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses what Mr. Axilrod would prioritize when looking in a certain direction.


Passage number 256.
MR. MORRIS. Well, put it this way, then: Relative to thenominal GNP, the monetary aggregates have been running very low andthe credit aggregates are about in line with what one would have now.Put it in those terms.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not display any clear contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information about the relationship between the monetary aggregates and the credit aggregates in relation to the nominal GNP.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 257.
MR. AXILROD. If we do get a 6 to 7 percent growth in Augustand September, the monetary aggregates--according to our always shakyequations--will be running about as we expected based on the quarterlymodel; on our monthly model, not quite. The quarterly model wouldhave predicted for given interest rates and GNP enough money demand tocreate this much money growth without much different interest rates.So, that wouldn't be far off. What is far off, as you're suggesting,is the credit growth. I had in my head two reasons that I haven'tquite been able to demonstrate statistically. One is that with thegovernment being such a large element in borrowing--when thegovernment is spending more than it's taking in--it has no real optionto reduce assets. It really has to borrow. So, I think its borrowingpropensity is [virtually] one for any amount of deficit spending.Whereas if other sectors are spending in excess of what they're takingin, they have the option of cutting down on assets, which doesn't getreflected in our credit figures. So, I have a feeling that the largepersistent role of the government is raising credit relative to GNP.Also, and I think Governor Gramley mentioned this at a discussionearlier here, we're in a period where we have much more freedom forcredit to flow at any price relative to earlier periods; there is morederegulation. And that may then be permitting a greater flow ofcredit at the high [rates], and the higher interest rates are exertingthe pressure more than the restricted availability. Those are theonly two factors I have, particularly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes

Explanation: In this passage, Mr. Axilrod presents his perspective on the factors affecting credit growth. He mentions two reasons that he hasn't been able to statistically demonstrate, suggesting there may be disagreement or contention regarding these reasons. Additionally, he mentions Governor Gramley's earlier discussion, implying that there may be differing opinions on the impact of deregulation on credit flow. Overall, the passage suggests that there may be disagreement or contention regarding the factors affecting credit growth.


Passage number 258.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'll suggest another factor too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The phrase "I'll suggest another factor too" does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply introduces a new point or consideration to be added to the discussion.


Passage number 259.
MR. AXILROD. Well, right. One other is the stock market.I'm not forgetting stock market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Axilrod simply states that he is not forgetting the stock market.


Passage number 260.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we went over that last time. Ithink the growth of domestic demand has been a lot faster than that ofGNP. And those imports have to be financed too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their thoughts about the growth of domestic demand in relation to GNP and the financial implications of imports.


Passage number 261.
MR. PARTEE. I looked at that yesterday afternoon. It makessome difference, but not a great deal. What happened really is thatthere was less GNP rise last year relative to credit growth than youwould have expected and this year it's more normal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply discussing the relationship between GNP rise and credit growth, stating that last year's GNP rise was less than expected but this year it's more normal.


Passage number 262.
-23-8/21/84MR. AXILROD. We've had a difficult time isolating thesevarious circumstances, but we could go back and look at it. But thoseare the elements I could think of so far.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 263.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Why don't we have a coffee break.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is posing a question and there is no opposition or conflicting viewpoints mentioned.


Passage number 264.
[Coffee break]CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Let us proceed. Let me indicate that Ihave some bias for not making radical changes in these monetary targetnumbers in the middle of the quarter unless there's a very good reasonto do so. What's more important than those numbers may be what weactually do, reflected in the borrowing and the reserve assumptions.So, let us proceed.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply suggesting a preference for not making radical changes in monetary target numbers unless there is a good reason to do so, and emphasizing the importance of actual actions rather than just the numbers.


Passage number 265.
MR. PARTEE. I had a thought, in the nature of a question forSteve: If one did feel that there had been some change in the demandfor free reserves--as you say in the technical jargon--that was goingto persist for a while, the way to deal with that technically would beto change the initial borrowing. Is that the way that one would dealwith it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking a question and seeking clarification.


Passage number 266.
MR. AXILROD. Well, that would be one way to do it. Clearly,another way would be not necessarily to change it but, as we observewhat is happening in the course of operations, to adjust in the way wemight adjust if we observed more excess reserves and a change inborrowing attitudes. We would be more willing to oversupplynonborrowed reserves to accommodate it. We would end up with a littleless borrowing than was plugged into the path. There would be twoways of going at it and getting the same result: one prejudging andone not prejudging.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is simply presenting two different approaches to achieve the same result without expressing any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 267.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Chuck, even though we did end up witha higher Fed funds rate than we would have expected for a $1 billionborrowing assumption, it seems to me we'd be imprudent now to reducethat borrowing level. It seems to me a little premature, given thestrength of the expansion, to move down, say, to $700 or $800 millionof borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no explicit contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the borrowing level, acknowledging that the higher Fed funds rate was unexpected but still suggesting that it would be imprudent to reduce the borrowing level. They state that it seems premature to decrease the borrowing level given the strength of the expansion. However, there is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented in the passage.


Passage number 268.
MR. PARTEE. Well, I was asking this as a technical matter.If you thought that there had been a shift in the demand, the way toaddress it would be to change the borrowing level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply asking about a technical matter and inquiring about a possible solution.


Passage number 269.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But we don't know how long that shiftwill persist.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply expressing uncertainty or lack of knowledge about the duration of a certain shift.


Passage number 270.
 The usual--MR. PARTEE. But if you thought it was going to endure for awhile--. And we do have now the possibility that FCA and Continentalare not done borrowing. They are going to be with us for some monthsto come--maybe years--with, I think, a steadily larger number. So, itcould be that it will persist.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the possibility that FCA and Continental may continue borrowing for a longer period of time.


Passage number 271.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Continental's borrowing is going to go upat least until that stockholders meeting. There may be a chance ofgetting it down then: I don't know. I would just note, to put it inyour mind, that on this international debt situation a portion of itseems to be going as well as could be hoped. That Argentine situationcould still go very much either way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not include any statements that indicate contention or disagreement. It primarily provides information and expresses uncertainty about the future.


Passage number 272.
-24-8/21/84MR. PARTEE. Is all of that special credit washed out now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement asking if all of the special credit is now gone.


Passage number 273.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they still have $100 million. Isthat what you mean.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The statement "Well, they still have $100 million" is a factual statement that does not involve contention or disagreement. 


Passage number 274.
MR. PARTEE. Yes. And then did they pay back the other LatinAmerican countries.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any disagreement or contention. It simply asks a question about whether the mentioned countries paid back the other Latin American countries.


Passage number 275.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. They either paid them back or madeother arrangements to pay them back.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply states that the individuals either repaid their debts or found alternative ways to do so.


Passage number 276.
MR. CROSS. They paid them $125 million.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage simply states that "They paid them $125 million" without any indication of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 277.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. But, you know, that situation hadreally looked [unintelligible]--without getting into too much detail.Even though the risks are that there will be a higher level ofuneasiness about the banking system and the international system thana relaxation of these special tensions, which probably have beencausing the fed funds rate to be higher than we had originallyexpected, it seems to me that that situation is very unpredictable.Even though we want flexibility to cope with that kind of thing, if itshifts in the other direction, it seems to me that at this point if wewere to reduce the borrowing because we ended up with a higher fedfunds rate than we expected, that would be sending a premature policysignal. The market would interpret that as a fairly significanteasing of the fed funds rate. It would be attributed to a shift[toward an] easing of policy. It would not be attributed to a changeof bank attitudes in regard to reluctance to borrow. Do we reallywant to bring about that kind of policy signal at this point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion and reasoning about a situation and potential actions, without specifically addressing any opposing views or arguments.


Passage number 278.
MR. PARTEE. Well, the rate had drifted up by 1/2 or 3/4 of apoint or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states a fact about the rate drifting up by a certain amount.


Passage number 279.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. 50 to 75 basis points.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The passage only presents a range of 50 to 75 basis points without any contrasting viewpoints or conflicting information.


Passage number 280.
MR. PARTEE. There's nothing in the aggregates that wouldhave warranted that, and the economy has been moving broadly in thedirection we expected it to--although maybe not as far--and the pricenumbers are even better. So, I don't see any reason why the rateshould have drifted up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker expresses his opinion that there is no reason for the interest rates to have increased based on the information available.


Passage number 281.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know if you expressed an opinionon these specifications.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they are uncertain about the other person's opinion regarding the specifications.


Passage number 282.
 If you would like to do so while you havethe floor, Governor Partee--MR. PARTEE. Well, all right. I would like to retain thespecifications we had last time and view them somewhat broadly. Wedon't have to be slavish about it. That's none of these alternatives,is that right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 283.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. That's none of these. The only differenceof any significance, I think, is on Ml.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 284.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, I think that's right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the person (Mr. Partee) agrees with a statement.


Passage number 285.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. What would you do about theborrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement simply asks for a response or suggestion about the action of borrowing, without any conflicting viewpoints or opinions expressed.


Passage number 286.
-25-8/21/84MR. PARTEE. I would reduce the borrowing number by $200million to [a level of] $800 million [unintelligible]. Although Idon't like to talk too much about the funds rate, I would expect [itto decline] but I would want to manage its decline. That is, I wouldwant it to drift down only [gradually], the way that it drifted up,rather than suddenly adjust it down by 3/4 of a point the day aftertomorrow.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage.


Passage number 287.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Boykin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The given passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 288.
MR. BOYKIN. Mr. Chairman, if I understood Tony right, Iwould stay right where we are. I would leave the borrowing assumptionright where it is and I wouldn't change the specifications. I agreethat this is not the time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no disagreement or contention in this passage. Mr. Boykin is stating that he agrees with Tony's recommendation and would not make any changes.


Passage number 289.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. You would make the specifications aboutwhere they were last time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement is simply suggesting that someone should provide specifications about where a certain group of people were last time.


Passage number 290.
MR. BOYKIN. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 291.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. And the borrowing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not present any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 292.
MR. BOYKIN. And the borrowing at the same level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information about borrowing at a specific level or any indication of disagreement or contention regarding borrowing.


Passage number 293.
MR. RICE. So would I, Mr. Chairman.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Rice is expressing agreement with the chairman.


Passage number 294.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Gramley.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is not enough information provided in the passage to determine if there is contention or disagreement surrounding Governor Gramley.


Passage number 295.
MR. GRAMLEY. I'd like to just say a word or two about what Ithink we ought to be worried about for a longer period. I have beenworried, as everybody knows, about the prospects of worseninginflation. I haven't been right; the staff has been a lot more rightthan I. But I do think we could make a very big mistake if we don'trecognize the potential for that. This was called to my attention byTony this morning when he talked about the Carter period. There weretwo very large mistakes made then. One of them was misestimating thenatural rate of unemployment; we thought it was around 5-1/2 percent.So, when the actual unemployment rate was 7 percent we thought theeconomy had all kinds of room to grow. The other was a failure torecognize how poor productivity really was. Let me just read to youwhat the actual productivity figures were showing in that period.From the fourth quarter of '74 to the fourth quarter of '75 we had a3.8 percent increase in productivity; in '76 we had 2.2 percent; in'77 we had 2.6 percent. It looked like we were doing beautifully. Infact, those were all cyclical improvements in productivity, notsecular trends. And we didn't recognize how bad things really were.So, I think we ought to be very, very careful in looking at the recentproductivity statistics not to get overly optimistic.The other thing I want to mention is that if you look at whathas been happening to monetary policy and take what I would regard asthe best view of how stimulative it is, you have to look at realincreases in the money stock. When you do that, you find that real M1is going up at about twice the rate of the trend rate of increase,which is about 1 percent a year. It's going up at over 2 percent ayear. So, I would like to take some of the benefits of the recentslowdown in money growth [incorporated] in the lower specs of "B." Inote in this connection that if we stick with "B," according to the-26-8/21/84staff we will end up with about a 6-1/2 percent increase in M1 fourth-quarter-to-fourth-quarter, which is about the midpoint of the range weset at the beginning of the year. And that would be reasonablysatisfactory. So, I would stick with the specs of "B" with $1 billionin borrowing, and I would accept a lower aggregate growth for thethird quarter.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, is expressing his personal concerns and opinions about potential inflation and the mistakes made in the past, but there is no evident disagreement or contention in the passage.


Passage number 296.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Morris.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not present any arguments or opposing viewpoints. It simply states someone's name.


Passage number 297.
MR. MORRIS. Well, Mr. Chairman, I think I understand theadvantage of keeping the same specifications as last time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not show any disagreement or contention. Mr. Morris is simply expressing his understanding of keeping the same specifications as last time.


Passage number 298.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't want to be absolutely rigid onthat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any contention or disagreement. It is simply expressing a personal preference without conflicting viewpoints.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 299.
MR. MORRIS. No, without specifying exactly why, I thinkthat's a good idea. On the other hand, I think it would be a mistaketo lower the borrowing guideline because the market has now caught onto how we are running policy. If in following a $1 billion borrowingguideline we were to see interest rates drift down to where we thoughtthey would be at the last meeting, then I think the market wouldunderstand that we were not pushing rates down but that rates weregoing down because of the smaller rate of growth in the economy--ifthat eventuates. If we pushed the guideline down, then I think themarket would have a great deal of difficulty understanding why wechose this particular time to move to an overtly easier monetarypolicy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Morris believes it would be a mistake to lower the borrowing guideline, while others may have different opinions or may be in favor of lowering it.


Passage number 300.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It would spark another rally in thebond and stock markets and it would look, I think, like politics if wewere to do it at this time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement expressing the possibility of a certain action and offering an opinion on how it might be perceived. It doesn't present any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 301.
MR. MORRIS. Yes, exactly. Also, if there's any risk oferror in the staff forecast, I think the risk lies in the economybeing stronger than forecast. Therefore, even though the Julyspecifications would seem to be incompatible right now, if the economyis a little stronger then they could become compatible. So, I wouldgo along with the same package we had last time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. In the passage, Mr. Morris is expressing agreement with the idea that the risk lies in the economy being stronger than forecast and that the specifications could become compatible if the economy is a little stronger. This indicates agreement and not contention or disagreement.


Passage number 302.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Corrigan.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage only mentions Mr. Corrigan without discussing any opinions, arguments, or conflicting viewpoints related to him.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 303.
MR. CORRIGAN. I too would like to stay where we are in termsof the borrowing level, money market conditions, and so on. I'd liketo take the shortfall in M1 and to some extent the other Ms in Julyand put it in the bank and save it for a rainy day. I like the ideaof not changing the darn aggregate specifications at the mid-quartermeeting. I don't know exactly how to get this directive language tosatisfy that objective while satisfying the larger objective ofstaying where we are. But I assume we could figure out a way to dothat.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement or contention in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Corrigan, expresses a desire to save the shortfall in M1 and other money supplies for a rainy day, while also expressing uncertainty about how to achieve this objective without changing the aggregate specifications. This suggests a disagreement or conflict between the idea of saving money and the larger objective of maintaining the current status quo.


Passage number 304.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Forrestal.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage only states the name "Mr. Forrestal" without providing any context, opinions, or conflicting ideas.


Passage number 305.
MR. FORRESTAL. Mr. Chairman, I would support a policy whichwould suggest no change at this time. In my own thinking, that reallycomes out to alternative B. I think that would be the rightspecification at this time to bring us back to the midpoint of therange down the road. I don't think we need to be unduly concerned-27-8/21/84about weak monetary growth because it's likely to be temporary. Idon't know what the August numbers will turn out to be, but I thinkJuly was abnormally low. But more importantly, perhaps, I too wouldlike to associate myself with those who would not want to change thatborrowing number. To bring the funds rate down would send the wrongsignal to the market. I think it's very important at this point thatwe not give any evidence or any hint to the market of easing or havethem interpret our policy as one of easing. If the shift in borrowingthat we've seen is going to continue, as it might, the funds rate willcontinue to drift upward. I would assume, Mr. Chairman, if that wereto happen and we don't change the borrowing number, that we would havea consultation as the rate hit that 12 percent level. If theborrowing pattern were to shift back to a more normal pattern, then Iwould be willing to validate an increase in the funds rate, which inturn would suggest to me some consultation at the 12 percent level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 306.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Solomon.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 307.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, as I said earlier, I think weought to keep the $1 billion borrowing. I think the advantage ofkeeping the same M1 monetary aggregate target that we had in July isthat if conditions weaken in the economy, then it's perfectlyappropriate for us not to be locked into as tight a policy. I wouldkeep the range of 8 to 12 percent [on the funds rate]. I would notchange that even though the rate is around 11-7/8 percent now; I'dhave a consultation if we have to. And I would change the directiveso that it's symmetrical. You remember that it leans slightly,through the judicious use of "would" as against "might," in thedirection of our being quicker to restrain than to ease depending onwhat happens. And it seems to me that at this point we probably arejustified in moving to more symmetrical language.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their own opinion on the matter, but there is no conflicting viewpoint presented.


Passage number 308.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Wallich.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Since the passage only mentions Governor Wallich without providing any further information or context, it is not possible to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 309.
MR. WALLICH. Well, I think we're acting under the impact ofsomewhat temporary factors. We've had a bad month and we are verymuch concerned about the banks, the thrifts, the LDCs, and thefarmers. If we weren't acting under these constraints, I at leastwould favor a tauter policy. That seems to me appropriate for thesituation where we have a strengthening economy--looking ahead for1985, anyway. We have a lower rate of inflation, which to me suggeststhat the money supply should grow more slowly on account of the lowerneed for money. The staff sees ahead that interest rates will rise in'85. So, the question really is: Should this happen earlier orlater. And if it happens earlier, wouldn't it reduce somewhat thedegree of the rise. In that sense, we're really just buying time nowby taking account of the undoubted problems that the System faces. Iwould favor something like a "C+" alternative and I would go toborrowing of $1-1/4 billion. I'd raise the funds rate range 1/2percentage point at each end, to 8-1/2 to 12-1/2 percent. I thinkthen it would be logical to be symmetrical again. If that [range] islower, it seems to me we ought to stay asymmetrical.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is the opinion of one person, Mr. Wallich, and he is explaining his reasoning for favoring a certain policy approach.


Passage number 310.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm sure the staff appreciates that noteof confidence that you see in their forecast.specs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The statement is expressing appreciation for the confidence expressed in the staff's forecast.


Passage number 311.
MR. PARTEE.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 312.
 [Henry is] trying to bring it about by his-28-8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Governor Martin.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: It is not possible to provide an answer based on the given information. The passage provided does not include any information or context that suggests any contention or disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 313.
MR. MARTIN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciated Lyle's briefanalysis of the difficulties of estimating productivity. He does wellto remind us of the errors we've all made in the past. Maybe thestaff has made fewer than the rest of us; I don't know. I think we'remaking a corresponding error today: We are underestimating. The 1-1/4 percent trend line is not the trend line; it's more like 2percent. I think we're returning to the trend line, but I have adifferent trend line, Jim. My reason is that we're a services andinformation workers society now, not manufacturing. Yet we are--maybenot overly obsessed, but--overly concerned with manufacturing output.Finally, I think that software works. Finally, an ordinary humanbeing, not a wizard, can work a personal computer or a terminal orsomething like that. And that has permeated the services side of oureconomy--the sector from which people said we could not getproductivity increases just as they used to say about restaurantsbefore McDonald's came along and showed productivity in that area.This will be the surprise on the productivity side of our society--therising output in services. I'm not saying the services are going tobe anything we really need, but I think we're going to have a lot moreof them, however you measure that. So, I believe that will keepinflation at the staff's [projected] level or even a touch better.The other factor that is going to contribute to lessinflation is one that I deplore, and that is the impact on thefinancial system of failing thrift institutions against a backdrop, ofa government institution--namely the Federal Savings & Loan InsuranceCorporation--that is too small. Whatever has to be done about that asinstitutions fail--whatever receivership or conservatorship pattern wewill suffer through in the next few years from that side of theeconomy and maybe some additional failing banks, given the rate atwhich banks are failing--will change the consumers' outlook. I don'tthink the American public is prepared for the kind of questioning thatwill result from these failures. And it may well result fromsubstantial volumes of uninsured deposits at one or more institutionshaving to be paid back at less than 100 cents on the dollar out ofasset administration which takes many years. If it is thriftinstitutions, these tend to be long-term assets and the payout periodis long and the interest is lost. I believe this is going to be amaterial factor in the thinking of the American public with regard totheir own finances and their own consumption function, if you will,over the next few years. I think that will affect inflation in apositive direction now, though it's unfortunate that it's coming fromthat side.To translate that into policy, I would go along with theChairman's suggestion, which he says he didn't want to make toofirmly, to keep policy where it is in terms of the directive of a fewweeks ago with the exception that I would join my esteemed colleague,Governor Partee, in favoring $800 million in borrowing. I would leavethe range on fed funds alone and would prefer the $800 million onborrowing to give us more flexibility--not only because of theaforementioned change or possible change in the commercial banks'attitude toward excess reserves, but because I feel that the financialfailures will not only affect the attitude of consumers toward savingand spending, but will affect the attitude of commercial banks and-298/21/84other institutions with regard to borrowing from their respectivecentral banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the following passage. Mr. Martin disagrees with the staff's estimation of productivity and believes that the trend line is higher than what is projected. He also disagrees with the focus on manufacturing output and argues that the rising output in services will surprise people. Additionally, he deplores the impact of failing thrift institutions on the financial system and predicts that it will affect the thinking and behavior of consumers and commercial banks.


Passage number 314.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Black.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement as it only mentions "Mr. Black" without providing any additional information or context.


Passage number 315.
MR. BLACK. At the risk of sounding somewhat complacent, Ithink our policy for 12 months has been just about as good as anybodycould have dared hope it would be. We came pretty close to themidpoint of our revised target range in the last half of last yearand, with the behavior of the figures in July, we're heading prettyclose to the midpoint of the present target range. So, we're in agood position to finish the year somewhere near that, regardless ofwhich of these alternatives we adopt. And with velocity apparentlypicking up, it looks to me as if that's about where we ought to comeout. I really prefer the [aggregate] specifications of "C" becausethey get us a little closer; by the same token I recognize there's nota whole lot of difference in these things. So, in my usual display ofeclecticism I would opt for the other specifications of "B," whichwould leave the federal funds range unchanged and the borrowing targetunchanged. And, like Tony, I would prefer that we go ahead and makethis directive symmetrical.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 316.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Miss Seger.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Based on the given passage "Miss Seger," it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement as the passage only mentions Miss Seger without any additional context or information.


Passage number 317.
MS. SEGER. I would go along with the idea of keeping thespecifications the same as they were at the last meeting. As I readSteve's words here on page 5 [of the Bluebook], they suggest thatalternative A comes closest to those adopted at the last meeting. So,that would be the one I would go along with. For reasons of concernabout the health of the financial system, I would be reluctant to havethe fed funds rate go above where it currently is, again because Ithink there are some special and technical reasons that are keeping itup there. If it could be allowed to back off a bit, I would certainlywelcome that. In terms of the borrowing target, I would go with Mr.Partee's $800 million number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement with previous specifications and their concerns about the financial system.


Passage number 318.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Keehn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Without the full passage provided, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 319.
MR. KEEHN. Well, I would agree with Bob Black. It seems tome that we happen to be in one of those times when everything seems tobe going very, very well--indeed, just about right. The comments atour last meeting suggested that the economic expansion was going to bea bit more robust than perhaps has been the case with the passage oftime. I have some feeling that our comments today may suggest agreater degree of moderation than may be the case. I do think thereis an element of moderation out there. Nonetheless, it seems to methat the outlook is excellent; there are inflation risks but theoutlook seems to be favorable. Therefore, I would suggest--since wehappen to be at about the midpoint of the range for M1--thatcontinuing that as an objective and as a target between now and theend of the year is a very desirable alternative. That would put me inthe camp of suggesting that alternative B would be the mostappropriate. The borrowing level would be, say, $1 billion. I wouldleave the fed funds range as it is. I do think that the directiveshould be balanced but also that it should be worded in a way thatwould clearly suggest that we didn't change our basic objectives atthis point; some of the wording could be adjusted accordingly.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no disagreement or contention in this passage. The speaker is expressing their agreement with another person's viewpoint and suggesting a specific course of action.


Passage number 320.
-308/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. All these comments that things are goingnicely brings to mind that I just read a book about the battle ofMidway where the Japanese sailed there with their whole fleet thinkingeverything was going nicely and one day later they thought it was notso nice. Mr. Boehne.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage simply describes the author's thoughts and relates them to a book they read about the battle of Midway.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 321.
MR. BOEHNE. I came in to this meeting with some bias toward"B," but as I listen to the discussion, I agree that there is somevirtue in keeping the quarterly specifications where they were inJuly. But I think those specifications are inconsistent with abillion dollar borrowing figure. There is no great virtue inconsistency but I think there is that problem. My own sense is thatthere is something to this business with reserves. As to how much weshould want to adjust for it, I don't think we should do it in anyspecified way but we ought to at least have a bias that attempts tocorrect for it. My bias would be for borrowings of less than $1billion; I think $800-$900 million makes some sense. We have let thefunds rate drift up over the last several months; we start outthinking where it's going to be and it ends up being higher. So, Idon't think there would be any disaster to the economy or expectationsabout what we're doing if it had some downward drift; in fact, thatwould be my bias. I would keep the funds range at 8 to 12 percent andI would have a symmetrical directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is some disagreement or contention in the passage. Mr. Boehne initially had a bias towards one option (option "B"), but after listening to the discussion, he agrees that the quarterly specifications should remain the same as they were in July. However, he still believes that those specifications are inconsistent with a billion-dollar borrowing figure. He also expresses a bias towards adjusting for reserves but disagrees on the specified amount. Finally, he suggests a different range for the funds rate and a symmetrical directive.


Passage number 322.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Balles.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Based on the given passage "Mr. Balles," it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement. This is because there is incomplete information provided and no context or additional details are given to establish any form of contention or disagreement.


Passage number 323.
MR. BALLES. Overall, I've been pretty well satisfied withthe posture of our policy. In view of the ongoing strength of theeconomy in most, if not all areas, I think it would be premature toease overtly. On the other hand, I'm particularly aware on the WestCoast right now of the fragility of our financial system and what therepercussions could be of another major institution in serioustrouble--and this time possibly involving outright losses to holdersof uninsured deposits. Unless or until that situation clarifies, Iwould be reluctant to see anything happen to push the federal fundsrate up higher. So, I come out favoring alternative B but along withfour others who have already spoken on the subject, I also would be infavor of reducing the borrowing level to $800 million and would favoradditionally the so-called symmetrical directive.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker expresses overall satisfaction with the policy and explains their concerns about the financial system on the West Coast. They also express support for alternative B and reducing the borrowing level, as well as the symmetrical directive. There is no conflicting opinion presented in the passage.


Passage number 324.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Roberts.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage as it only mentions "Mr. Roberts" without providing any context or information that could lead to controversy or disagreement.


Passage number 325.
MR. ROBERTS. It seems to me that the present policy isproducing about the right results. We had 7 percent growth in moneyin the first quarter and 6 percent in the second quarter. So, Iwouldn't change the borrowing target. I think we ought to pay lessattention to the fed funds rate and, therefore, I would like to seethe band widened by 1/2 percentage point to accommodate theprobabilities there. At this stage of the cycle and with the pastpattern of money growth, it seems to me that the odds favor somepickup in inflation notwithstanding the anecdotal information that wehave. I would favor alternative B, indicating growth of about 5-1/2percent in M1 in the third quarter. This also would have theadvantage of avoiding the base drift and would set us up in a goodposition in the fourth quarter to start our plan for money growth fornext year. In terms of the concern in the marketplace, we have tothink about what concerns might arise if we were to ease at this time,causing concern about inflation and possibly creating the opposite-31-8/21/84result than we intended, which would be higher long-term rates. Long-term rates have eased some at this point and if we hold firm in ourpolicy, the probability is that they could ease some more. I don'tthink that just a slackening of growth in the business cyclenecessarily should be associated with lower inflation. We could havethe worst of all worlds--a slackening growth and rising inflation, aswe've had in the past.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and opinions on the current policy and their preferred course of action.


Passage number 326.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Mr. Guffey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: The given passage does not provide enough information to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 327.
MR. GUFFEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I also would opt forthe B alternative. My concern is with the current federal fundslevel. I would hate to see it go any higher and thus would maintainthe 8 to 12 percent range. But my real concern is: What happens ifFinancial Corporation of America does indeed affect the financialmarkets and create a flight to quality and, as a result, the federalfunds rate balloons far beyond the 12 percent. What is the properresponse of the Federal Reserve under those circumstances. Do we tryto keep the funds rate within the 8 to 12 percent range or at the topof that range. Or do we pour in reserves in order to liquify thefinancial system and in order to contain the damage that might be doneby the Financial Corporation of America situation on top ofContinental. I pose it in the form of a question. What would be theproper response. How should this Committee and how should the Deskreact to that. It seems to me there is more potential of that than ofthe fed funds rate falling rapidly and giving some indication to themarket just before an election that we have eased. I would keep thebillion dollar level, to be sure, and the 8 to 12 percent range, but Ipose as a question: How should the Desk react if the FinancialCorporation of America affects the funds rate and pushes it up farbeyond the 12 percent for some period of time. I guess I'm posingthat question to you, Mr. Chairman, since you have daily contact withthe Desk.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement of concern and a question posed to the Chairman.


Passage number 328.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I think we'll deal with thatquestion later.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage expresses a personal opinion about postponing the discussion of a certain question. There is no specific contention or disagreement presented.


Passage number 329.
MR. GUFFEY. Well, I still opt for "B" at the moment until wefind out something different.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their current choice or preference but acknowledges that it may change if new information arises.


Passage number 330.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm left without a comment from Mrs. Horn.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states that there is no comment from Mrs. Horn.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 331.
MS. HORN. I feel that M1 should come in at the end of theyear at the midpoint of its range for a lot of reasons that have beenpreviously stated, and I'm pleased to see that it's near there now.Either alternative B or alternative C or something in between I thinkwould work toward achieving that goal by the end of the year. I wouldbe in favor of maintaining the $1 billion borrowing level and I thinkit would be a mistake to give the markets a signal through the fedfunds rate of any real change. For that reason, I would like toprotect against our producing a reduction in the federal funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Ms. Horn, is in favor of maintaining the $1 billion borrowing level and not giving the market a signal of any real change in the fed funds rate. This implies a difference in opinion with other possible alternatives that may propose a different borrowing level or a change in the fed funds rate.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 332.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I guess everybody has spoken. Ohno, Governor Rice. No, I have your comment here. We have somedifferences of opinion, I would say.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement or contention in this passage. The phrase "We have some differences of opinion, I would say" implies that there are differing opinions among the speakers.


Passage number 333.
MR. PARTEE. Since I'm guilty of throwing in the $800 milliondollar figure on borrowing, let me just say that I must have picked-32-8/21/84that off the wall. I don't know whether that's the figure or not.The point that I wanted to make is that if there has been a shift inthe demand for excess reserves, I think we ought to recognize that andmake some adjustment. And in my view if that results in a downwarddrift in the funds rate, we were certainly all content to see it driftup, so why shouldn't we be prepared to see it drift down. After all,the aggregates are on the weak side and there's nothing inconsistentin that. But I don't know whether $800 million is the right figurefor what I'm talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating their uncertainty about the figure mentioned and expressing their opinion about making adjustments based on the shift in demand for excess reserves.


Passage number 334.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Each $100 million represents about aquarter of a point. So, if you put it at $800 million instead of $1billion, you would be bringing down the fed funds rate 50 basispoints, in theory.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is providing information and explaining the relationship between money amounts and the impact on the fed funds rate. There is no contention or disagreement.


Passage number 335.
MR. PARTEE. Well, that's a very horseback kind of thing. Iwould rather have somebody who is technically proficient with thenumbers indicate what they think.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee simply expresses his preference for someone who is technically proficient with numbers.


Passage number 336.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, let me take off from your commentand suggest what may lie somewhere in an area of consensus. Lookingat the borrowing first, I guess it would be consistent with leavingthat first sentence of the directive unchanged and nominally start offwith something around $1 billion. Maybe in the old fashionednomenclature--particularly if the market seems sensitive or somewhatdisturbed in view of all these financial things or if the businessnews softens or if the money supply continues to come in low or all ofthe above--we should start off with some bias toward erring on theside of somewhat lower numbers but we don't aim at those.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply suggesting a course of action based on potential factors that may influence their decision.


Passage number 337.
MR. GRAMLEY. When you say "bias toward lower numbers," areyou talking about borrowing or interest rates or aggregates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is asking for clarification on what the term "bias toward lower numbers" refers to in the context of borrowing, interest rates, or aggregates.


Passage number 338.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm talking about borrowing now. I'm notsaying aim at a lower number right now. I'm saying that when we makeall these decisions for the next several weeks--[taking into account]the specific reserve averaging periods--we are willing to err a bit inthat direction, depending partly on our guidance on the funds rate andhow tight things look. I'd keep the funds band where it is, which iswhat most people have suggested. Then we would aim more overtly for alower number if in fact the money numbers came in low or we had someof these other contingencies developing; but we wouldn't do thatwithout that evidence. In terms of the numbers for the variousaggregates, I don't think M2 or M3 are at issue, if I understand [thecomments], except maybe for those who wanted "C." They are so closethat it doesn't make any difference. I'm a little troubled by thethought that somehow we would aim as low as 4 or 4-1/2 percent [on M1]even overtly and with that kind of symmetrical approach withoutknowing a little more about the economy and other things than I knownow. I would at least go higher on M1 than any of those alternativessuggest. That's interrelated with how we word the directive. With ahigher number we certainly can make it symmetrical, recognizing thatwe're starting below so we already have this slight bias towardeasing. If we end up with a lower number, I don't know what we do. Iwould make it asymmetrical in the other direction and, therefore, endup in the same place anyway.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different options and considerations for borrowing and monetary policy, but there is no indication of disagreement or argument among the participants.


Passage number 339.
MR. CORRIGAN. You lost me on the last loop.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement "You lost me on the last loop" suggests that the speaker didn't understand or follow something that was said previously. It does not indicate contention or disagreement.


Passage number 340.
-33-8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, if we started off with an M1 figureof 4 percent and we began running above it, depending on where we are,I would not be very anxious to raise the borrowing level.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is discussing a hypothetical scenario and the speaker is expressing their opinion about not being eager to raise the borrowing level. There is no disagreement or argument present.


Passage number 341.
MR. CORRIGAN. That was the second point. I understood that.On the one after that you lost me.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Corrigan is simply expressing his confusion or lack of understanding.


Passage number 342.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't remember the one after that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply expresses a lack of memory about something, without any conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 343.
MR. PARTEE. I think it was that you would make itasymmetrical in the other direction. If you put [M1] at four percent,then you wouldn't tighten if it came in higher but you would ease ifit came in lower.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply expressing their opinion or suggestion on how to make something asymmetrical in the opposite direction.


Passage number 344.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, I just think that in terms of thevisuals you get more or less the same result. Why change the numberand raise all the questions about whether we had a different numberthan we had last time.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no direct contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion about the visuals and questioning the need to change the number, but there is no indication of a disagreement or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 345.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Exactly. And then you can havesymmetrical language too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is making a statement and then suggesting an additional idea, without any indication of disagreement or opposition.


Passage number 346.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know whether it's worthwhile ornot, but we can even off all these numbers and make them 5 percent, 7percent, and 9 percent. I don't know what words of art we have; italready says "around.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing uncertainty and suggesting a potential solution or modification.


Passage number 347.
"MR. PARTEE. We can't use "around" because it's alreadythere.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, is stating a fact and providing a reason for not being able to use the word "around."


Passage number 348.
MR. GRAMLEY. How would you interpret this 5 percent if youcould have an asymmetrical calculation [for the] 3 months. If youtook that 5 percent literally, it would imply a growth rate of 8-1/4percent for August and September and that's way too high for me to becomfortable with. If you wanted to add -1.5, 5.5, and 8.1 percenttogether and [say that] averages [roughly] to five, then that's thesort of asymmetrical calculation I could agree with.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing different interpretations of a 5 percent growth rate and expressing their discomfort with the higher rates implied by a literal interpretation. They then suggest an alternative calculation method that they could agree with.


Passage number 349.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. [Unintelligible.] I don't understand.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: I'm sorry, but without understanding the passage you provided, I am unable to determine whether there is contention or disagreement. Could you please clarify or provide the passage so that I can assist you better?


Passage number 350.
MR. GRAMLEY. My point is that we start from a low base; Julywas negative. If you use 5 percent for the period from June throughSeptember, it implies an August-September increase averaging 8-1/4percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, is making a point based on data and using it to support an argument. There is no opposing viewpoint or conflicting information presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 351.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'm assuming your arithmetic is correct.Is that correct.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing doubt or skepticism about the accuracy of the arithmetic being discussed. They are seeking confirmation or clarification.


Passage number 352.
MR. AXILROD. Well, pretty close. I think it might be morelike 8 percent with the compounding, but it's right in that area.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply offering an alternative estimate, but not opposing or contradicting the previous statement.


Passage number 353.
MR. PARTEE. Well, that's always the case. Of course,[earlier] everybody accepted a minus 2 percent for July, which wasreally a very unusually low number. I presume we would accept a 10 or12 percent for September, which is very well what it might be if theeconomy is reasonably strong. I think we would want to put them alltogether and say the average was not bad.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is discussing the numbers and expressing their opinion on them, but there is no conflicting viewpoint or argument being presented.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 354.
8/21/84MR. GRAMLEY. Putting my point differently: If the staff iscorrect, a specification of $1 billion in borrowing to start with--andholding to that with the kind of federal funds rate which would beimplied if the current demands for borrowing relative to that fundsrate prevail--would not give you 5 percent growth. It would give yousomething more like 4 percent. So, if you were aiming for 5 percent,in fact, what you would do is proceed to lower levels of borrowing,lower levels of the funds rate, and more increase in the aggregatesover time. And I don't think that would be appropriate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, disagrees with the idea of borrowing $1 billion and holding to that with a funds rate that would imply current demands for borrowing. He suggests that such a strategy would only result in 4 percent growth, not the desired 5 percent. He argues that instead, lower levels of borrowing, funds rate, and more increases in the aggregates over time would be more appropriate to achieve the desired growth.


Passage number 355.
MR. PARTEE. You're talking about the difference betweenaccepting and seeking.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 356.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation:
Based solely on the answer provided, "No" would be the answer because the passage does not present any indication of disagreement or contention. However, since only a single line of the passage is given, the context is limited, and it is possible that disagreement or contention arises elsewhere in the complete passage.


Passage number 357.
MR. PARTEE. I think that is an important difference. Iguess my feeling is that the market determines what the money numberis going to be in the short run a lot more than we do. And, as youknow, it's a highly volatile number.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. Mr. Partee is expressing his opinion and emphasizing the role of the market in determining the money number in the short run.


Passage number 358.
MR. GRAMLEY. If one were willing to play that game and putin a 5 percent for visual purposes only, then I wouldn't have anyproblem with it.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley expresses his agreement with putting in a 5 percent for visual purposes only.


Passage number 359.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I have assumed that the 5 percentbecomes meaningful only if conditions weaken.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage states a personal assumption without presenting any conflicting viewpoints or arguments.


Passage number 360.
MR. GRAMLEY. In the economy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 361.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. In the economy, right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Insufficient information. Could you please provide the full passage?


Passage number 362.
MR. GRAMLEY. Beyond what the staff is talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no indication of any contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Gramley, is simply acknowledging the staff's discussion and expressing that there may be additional matters to consider.


Passage number 363.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That's right. Otherwise, theborrowing assumption would prevail and we'll see more or less acontinuation of the present fed funds rate. But if conditions weaken,then I don't think we should have locked ourselves in to a 4 percenttarget, because I think it would be justified that the fed funds ratewould come off somewhat on its own. What I'd be opposed to is for themarket to perceive a clear and overt easing of policy by a move now to$800 million [on borrowing].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: The passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. It is presenting potential scenarios and the speaker's opinion on them.


Passage number 364.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we're in an area of nuance. That isnot unimportant, but I'm not sure it's going to be reflectedadequately in any directive. I don't know whether this is the bestway to do it, but look at it sentence by sentence. It says "In theshort run the Committee seeks to maintain"--the same language we'vehad. Let me as a first approximation either leave [the numbers] thesame or round them off to the lower levels. Make them 5, 7, and 9percent or where they are. What I would almost do--I wouldn'tnecessarily suggest this because I don't know that I'd want to givethat much of a signal--is reverse the whole next sentence. So"Somewhat lesser restraint would be acceptable if growth in themonetary aggregates slowed significantly, while somewhat greaterreserve restraint would be acceptable in the event of more substantialgrowth. In either case, such a change would be considered...." Wedon't have to reverse the sentence but I certainly would make it"would" instead of "might.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any clear contention or disagreement. The speaker is discussing potential changes or adjustments to a directive, but there is no explicit disagreement or conflicting views expressed.


Passage number 365.
"-35-8/21/84 -36-MR. MARTIN. If we reverse it, we need to reverse thesentence that shows that we did contemplate the downside risks in thefinancial system that we perceive could occur.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 366.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I realize we're nitpicking, but evenso it seems to me that if we move to symmetry by changing the "might"to "would," that's sufficient. If we go ahead and reverse the orderof this, we'd look a little silly if the economy turns out strongerthan we think. It looks as if we're really getting into semanticsignals by reversing those, don't you agree.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker acknowledges that they are nitpicking and suggests a change to achieve symmetry in language. They then express a concern about looking silly if a certain outcome does not occur. The last sentence asks for agreement or consensus on this observation.


Passage number 367.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Heck, I don't [know.] It might raise somequestions about attaching more significance to little tiny wordingnuances than we want to tolerate through time. That next sentence Icertainly think should stay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing uncertainty and suggesting that it might be unnecessary to attach too much significance to small wording nuances. They also state that the next sentence, in their opinion, should remain. However, these statements do not involve any opposing or conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 368.
MR. PARTEE. Yes, I do too.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply agrees with the statement made by someone else.


Passage number 369.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's probably considered boilerplate atthis time. We have 8 to 12 percent down below [for the funds raterange].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It simply states a fact or opinion without presenting conflicting views.


Passage number 370.
MR. FORRESTAL. Mr.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the given passage.


Passage number 371.
 Chairman, while you're on nuances, online 74, given what has happened in July, is it--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't have any line 74 on my copy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating that they do not have the information being referred to.


Passage number 372.
MR. FORRESTAL. The way it's written, right after the "whilesomewhat lesser restraint might be acceptable" it says "if growth inthe monetary aggregates slows significantly." Since we've hadsignificant slowing in July already, I wonder if it wouldn't be helpedby adding the work "further" or something like that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is suggesting a potential modification to the text for clarity or emphasis.


Passage number 373.
MR. ROBERTS. Well, it has just bounced around month-to-month. April was down, May was up, June was up, July was down, andthe quarter is up.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 374.
MR. PARTEE. Well, then it gets into ambiguities, Bob. Slowsignificantly further than minus 2. I think it is stated in terms ofthe quarterly numbers. And the "slow significantly" means relative towhatever number is in there.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is simply explaining his interpretation of the meaning of the phrase "slow significantly" in relation to quarterly numbers.


Passage number 375.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Actually, the two sides of that are notsymmetrical as written. The first half is quite clear. "In the eventof more substantial growth of the monetary aggregates" I assume meansmore substantial quite clearly than what is in the previous sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not present any disagreement or contention. It is primarily focused on clarifying the meaning of a specific phrase.


Passage number 376.
MR. PARTEE. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not provide any information or context to suggest there is contention or disagreement. The single word response "yes" could refer to a confirmation or agreement rather than a disagreement.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 377.
MR. GRAMLEY. Yes. It probably would be wise, though, givenBob's point, to change that "slightly" to "were significantly slower."That would use parallel language to what was in the first part of thesentence and would deal with Bob's point.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Gramley suggests changing "slightly" to "were significantly slower" in order to address Bob's point, indicating a difference in opinion or perspective.


Passage number 378.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Use what.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: you need from the set of offers.


Passage number 379.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. "Were substantially slower," if youwant to use exact symmetry.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the following passage. The phrase "if you want to use exact symmetry" simply offers a suggestion for using exact symmetry when comparing the speeds.


Passage number 380.
8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "In the event of significantly slowergrowth." That's symmetrical with the top part of the sentence.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states a condition ("in the event of significantly slower growth") that is symmetrical with another part of the sentence, without expressing any conflicting viewpoints or discord.


Passage number 381.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It's like the Delphic oracle.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is a simile comparing something to the Delphic oracle. It does not discuss any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 382.
MR. MARTIN. But "were" implies it isn't going to happen.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is a statement made by Mr. Martin about the implication of using the word "were" in a certain context.


Passage number 383.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. "Of significantly slower growth." Now,what numbers do we put in up above.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

The phrase "Of significantly slower growth" does not involve contention or disagreement. It simply highlights that the growth is slower compared to something else without providing specific numbers.


Passage number 384.
MR. MARTIN. 5, 7, and 9 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage simply states three percentages without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting statements.


Passage number 385.
MR. PARTEE. I'm attracted to try it with the 5, 7, and 9percent; maybe it has been more on our minds than anybody else's thatwe [typically] don't change these rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Partee is stating his attraction towards trying the 5, 7, and 9 percent rates, and acknowledges that it may have been more on their minds than anyone else's that they typically do not change these rates.


Passage number 386.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we've changed them in the past andsometimes we haven't changed them. I just have a brief record here.It looks like when we've changed them--well, there's one exceptionwhere we changed [M1] from 7 percent to 5 to 6 percent and kept theother two the same. Others we have not changed at all. Once we had 6to 7 percent and we changed it to well above 6 to 7 percent; once wechanged one from 6 percent to 7 percent and we changed some of theothers by 1/2 point, basically. A 1/2 point is the maximum we'vechanged the others. What we've done before is change the adjective infront of it. We've said "This action is expected to be consistentwith growth of M1, M2, and M3 at annual rates of" and following someprevious pattern we changed it to "somewhat less than" or "around" orsomething like that. That's the kind of thing we've done before. Isuppose that may be an alternative--just to change the adjective infront of it--but I don't think it makes a lot of difference. We cansay "This action is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 ofaround 5 percent or a little less and growth in M2 and M3 at 7 and 9percent, respectively.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply providing a record of past changes and discussing potential alternatives without expressing any disagreement or conflicting opinions.


Passage number 387.
"MR. GRAMLEY. That sounds all right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "That sounds all right" indicates agreement.


Passage number 388.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Does that sound better to people. "Thisaction is expected to be consistent with growth in M1 at around 5percent or slightly less and in M2 and M3 at annual rates of 7 and 9percent, respectively.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply presenting an expected scenario without any conflicting viewpoints.


Passage number 389.
"MR. PARTEE. We had 7-1/2 percent for M2.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It simply states the interest rate for M2 without any conflicting opinions or contradictory information.


Passage number 390.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we can leave 7-1/2 percent. Do youwant to leave 7-1/2 percent. Either way you like: 7-1/2 or 7percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is giving two options - either 7-1/2 percent or 7 percent - and stating that the decision can be made based on personal preference. However, the tone is neutral and there is no indication of any disagreement or argument.


Passage number 391.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. I'd leave it at 7-1/2 percent.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a statement of opinion or suggestion.


Passage number 392.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. How many have a preference for 7-1/2percent. One, two, three, four, five, six.SPEAKER(.). Seven.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply asking how many people have a preference for 7-1/2 percent and listing the numbers one through six. "Seven" is mentioned but it doesn't indicate a preference, it's just the next number in the sequence.


Passage number 393.
MR. BOEHNE. I'll make it eight; I don't care.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage shows agreement as Mr. Boehne is willing to go along with a suggestion without any opposition or disagreement.


Passage number 394.
MR. RICE. I don't either.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker simply agrees with the statement that was made.


Passage number 395.
-37-8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. We have six "preferences" and at least two"don't cares." All right, let's try this for the language and thenwe'll discuss the nuances. "In the short run, the Committee seeks tomaintain existing pressures on reserve positions. This action isexpected to be consistent with growth in M1 at an annual rate ofaround 5 percent or slightly less, and in M2 and M3 at annual rates ofaround 7-1/2 and 9 percent.... Somewhat greater reserve restraintwould be acceptable in the event of more substantial growth in themonetary aggregates, while somewhat lesser restraint would beacceptable in the event of significantly slower growth. In eithercase...." All the rest is the same, including the 8 to 12 percent[funds rate range]. We are aiming at $1 billion of borrowing. Werecognize that we're starting out at least with growth a bit on theslow side. If we got evidence of some slowing in the economy--I guessin terms of the earlier discussion, I'm forgetting now about thesespecial financial problems--and there are further upward pressures onthe federal funds rate, we probably would be heading below $1 billion;but if we don't have those signals, we wouldn't, barring this otherfinancial market question.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is discussing the Committee's preferences and potential actions based on different scenarios.


Passage number 396.
MR. GRAMLEY. Are you talking about slowing in the economybeyond expectations.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is a simple question asking for clarification.


Passage number 397.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. I don't know exactly what they are,but that's what I'm talking about.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The phrase "I don't know exactly what they are, but that's what I'm talking about" indicates uncertainty or lack of knowledge about the subject being discussed. It does not suggest any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 398.
MR. PARTEE. It's hard to [quantify].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is stating that it is difficult to quantify something, but there is no argument or conflicting opinion presented.


Passage number 399.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. If we get a weaker employment number,weaker this number or that number--broadly lower than expectations,yes. If we have financial problems that are great enough, we wouldprovide some liquidity. I don't know how one judges that in advance;I think we have to play it by ear. We had this problem for a veryshort period of time with Continental when their borrowing went way upand the market was disturbed and we didn't take the money out rightaway, day-by-day, because the market was tightening up on its own. Icertainly would take into account if this were all reflected, as youput it, in a flight to quality and in fact the federal funds rate andthe CD rates were going way up--and to make rather extreme assumptions--the prime rate were going up. I would interpret that as getting amuch tighter effect on policy than we calculated in making theseassumptions on policy right now.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no clear contention or disagreement in this passage. The passage is discussing potential actions and considerations related to employment numbers, financial problems, liquidity, and interest rates. The speaker is expressing their thoughts and potential interpretations but there is no clear disagreement or contention being presented.


Passage number 400.
MR. GUFFEY. And, therefore, you would react by providingsubstantially greater reserves.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: There is no indication of contention or disagreement in this statement. It is a straightforward statement of a belief or opinion.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 401.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes. If they really got substantial, we'dhave a Committee consultation. Well, that question certainly would beraised.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The use of language such as "If they really got substantial" and "Well, that question certainly would be raised" suggests that there is disagreement or doubt about the likelihood or validity of the subject being discussed.


Passage number 402.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, you wouldn't have anyalternative.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement "Well, you wouldn't have any alternative" simply states a fact without any opposing viewpoints or conflicting statements.


Passage number 403.
MR. PARTEE. I'm unclear as to what would happen to the fundsrate. I could certainly see a widening spread--CD rates going up andbill rates going down--as an indication of a flight to quality. I'munclear about what would happen to the funds rate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their uncertainty and lack of understanding about what would happen to the funds rate in a certain situation.


Passage number 404.
-38-8/21/84MR. AXILROD. Our experience has been, Governor Partee, thatwhen that has happened it has tended to put upward pressure on thefunds rate--[recently], in any event.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply stating a fact about the effects of certain actions on the funds rate.


Passage number 405.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think that is right in this cycle. Ithink what we're getting, and it wasn't mentioned earlier, isrestraints on the supply side of federal funds as well as a reluctanceto borrow from the Federal Reserve. People are cutting back on lines.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It is a statement expressing the speaker's opinion and an observation about the current situation.


Passage number 406.
MR. CORRIGAN. I think there's a husbanding of federal fundsgoing on.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not mention any disagreement or contention. It simply states Mr. Corrigan's belief about the husbanding of federal funds.


Passage number 407.
MR. GUFFEY. Dislocation.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. This is because there is only one speaker, Mr. Guffey, and he is only stating the word "dislocation," which does not imply any conflict or difference of opinion.


Passage number 408.
MR. PARTEE. I guess that could happen, if they really becamesensitive. Otherwise, it's a very liquid instrument to put your moneyinto.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. The speaker is expressing their viewpoint and there is no opposing argument or disagreement present in the passage.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 409.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a liquid instrument if you have agood borrower. People are a little nervous about the borrowers thesedays. I think you see that in the Euromarket and you expect that toput more pressure on the domestic funds market.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is disagreement and contention in the passage. The first statement suggests that having a good borrower makes a financial instrument liquid. However, the second statement indicates that people are nervous about borrowers these days, which implies that the instrument may not be as liquid as previously suggested. Additionally, the mention of pressure on the domestic funds market further accentuates the contention and disagreement surrounding the liquidity of the instrument.


Passage number 410.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. The spread had gotten up to 160 basispoints in Treasury bills and 3-month CDs. Then it went down a littleto about 60 or 70 basis points and now it's back up to about 100.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 
There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. It is simply stating the changes in the spread between Treasury bills and 3-month CDs.

Passage number 412.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I don't know in these disturbed periodshow good those quotations are that we get on CD rates.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is uncertain about the quality of the quotations they are receiving on CD rates during a disturbed period.


Passage number 413.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Okay.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The word "okay" does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 414.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. They are probably people's imagination;they are rates they would like to aim at for CDs.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply presents a speculation about people's imagination and their desired rates for CDs.


Passage number 415.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Well, give or take maybe 10 basispoints, I think they're probably fairly accurate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The speaker expresses certainty and confidence in the accuracy of their statement.


Passage number 416.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, they're accurate for some banks thatcan operate; some just can't operate in these markets. Anyway, it'sunderstood what we're voting on and the nuances have been adequatelyexplained. If there are no other questions, we will vote.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is providing a statement of fact and expressing understanding and agreement.


Passage number 417.
MR. BERNARD.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 418.
Chairman Volcker YesVice Chairman Solomon YesPresident Boehne YesPresident Boykin YesPresident Corrigan YesGovernor Gramley YesPresident Horn YesGovernor Martin YesGovernor Partee YesGovernor Rice YesGovernor Seger YesGovernor Wallich No8/21/84CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I guess that completes [our agenda]. Imight say one other thing. This is of no substantive importance, butI have found it convenient in defending why we don't release minutesright away among my other arguments to say that when we have a basicpolicy decision we typically do announce it right away. These otherthings are just implementing policy that we've already decided upon.And that broadly is reflected in the directive, it so happens. Wespeak about a policy directive but that refers to the whole thing,which has all the long-range targets. When it comes to what we werejust discussing--the language is probably right here--it's called anoperational paragraph [in the Bluebook]; I forget what it's actuallycalled in the directive.SPEAKER(.). It's about that word.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The passage consists of a list of individuals who all agree on a certain issue.


Passage number 419.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. The phrase "in implementing policy" oftenappears. I'd just like to sharpen up the language a bit in theearlier discussions to make some distinction between policy with acapital P and implementing policy. This paragraph is implementingpolicy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The author is simply stating their desire to clarify the language used in earlier discussions by distinguishing between "policy with a capital P" and "implementing policy." The author does not express any disagreement or contention with any other viewpoint or perspective.


Passage number 420.
MR. BOEHNE. Do you find that a convincing argument.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any argument, so there is no contention or disagreement. It is a simple statement.


Passage number 421.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It is useful. Is it credible.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement "It is useful" is not being debated or contradicted in any way. It simply expresses that something is beneficial or serves a purpose. However, there is no indication of credibility being discussed in the passage.


Passage number 422.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Actually, I think it is a usefuldistinction. I don't think it's just purely to handle the substantivepoints. People can say "I want to know what your operational approachis." But in terms of our own thinking we ought to make thedistinction. I don't think we have changed anything here.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing their personal opinion and stating that they believe the distinction mentioned is useful but not necessarily agreed upon or changed by others.


Passage number 423.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes, but we do say--and it's a littleinconsistent with that--that one reason we don't want to release theminutes right away is that if conditions change during theintermeeting period we may want to adjust the standards. Right.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is explaining a potential reason for not releasing minutes right away.


Passage number 424.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think [unintelligible] policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The phrase "[unintelligible] policy" does not provide enough context to determine whether there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 425.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. That also sounds like an adjustmentof policy.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement is not expressing disagreement or contention. It is a neutral observation or opinion about a potential adjustment of policy.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 426.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, we're talking about semantics. Whatdo you call policy and what do call something else. I think there isa distinction between--to use another phrase--longer-term strategy,which is a more basic approach, and these more tactical decisions.[Unintelligible] be tactical.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage indicates a disagreement or contention about the terminology being used to discuss policy and strategy. One person believes there is a distinction between longer-term strategy and tactical decisions, while the other person's response is unintelligible, possibly indicating disagreement or confusion.


Passage number 427.
MR. WALLICH. What would be a "basic approach" short, say, ofchanging the annual ranges.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No


Passage number 428.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: There is no contention or disagreement in the passage.


Passage number 429.
 Well, obviously, [what we did] in October,1979--VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. And the middle of 1982.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the given passage. The statement is simply acknowledging a specific period of time without expressing any conflicting opinions or viewpoints.


Passage number 430.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. --and in late '82 or October of '82. Andwe did announce that very promptly. We didn't change the ranges but8/21/84we said we were deemphasizing M1 and we announced it--not clearly, Iguess. It was a more strategic decision.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is simply providing information and explaining a decision that was made.


Passage number 431.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Isn't this [directive] technically acommunication to my Bank.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. It is a straightforward question.


Passage number 432.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Explanation: The given prompt does not indicate any passage for analysis. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement.


Passage number 433.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. It is.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: not possible to determine if there is contention or disagreement in the given passage without having the actual passage.


Passage number 434.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Yes, and I think it's written that way.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Sorry, but I can't generate a response without the passage you're referring to.


Passage number 435.
It says--MR. PARTEE. It's a directive to the Manager.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker, Mr. Partee, states that it is a directive to the Manager without any indication of disagreement or contention.


Passage number 436.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It's a directive to the Manager and itsays "In implementing policy, follow this operational approach."That's what it says. I think that distinction is in the directivenow; it could be sharpened a bit. The whole thing is called thepolicy directive, but it repeats all the basic stuff.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage is simply providing an explanation or elaboration on the content of the directive. There is no contention or disagreement present.


Passage number 437.
MR. BOEHNE. I have the impression--and it's just animpression--that we have fewer and fewer friends who come to ourdefense on our current release procedure and that we have gotten moredefensive, say, over the last year or so than we have been in a numberof years. Is that accurate or inaccurate.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

While the statement reflects the opinion of MR. BOEHNE, it does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply expresses his personal impression about the current release procedure and the support the company receives.


Passage number 438.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Oh, I think it's probably true. There'scertainly a lot more noise about it. It's the kind of issue that theKemp group has seized upon and they make a lot of noise about it.Certainly, the in-depth analysis is much greater now than it was.It's one of these things that's like fighting motherhood. Just likefreedom of information, it's very hard to argue against it, eventhough you know it's a bad idea.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker expresses agreement with the idea discussed and mentions that there is more public attention and discussion around it.


Passage number 439.
MR. BOEHNE. Yes, I'll agree with that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. Mr. Boehne agrees with the statement provided.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 440.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. All newspaper reporters, even theones who are supportive of us, start off with a presumption that themaximum amount of disclosure is something good. It's very hard toargue otherwise.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is contention in the passage. The statement presents a disagreement regarding the presumption that maximum disclosure is inherently good. The author mentions that it is difficult to argue against this perspective, indicating a contrary opinion or contention.


Passage number 441.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Steve has just pointed out something thatwe can put in this directive we just approved, with your approval.The previous paragraph says "The Committee understood that policyimplementation would require continuing appraisal" and so forth. Theinsert would be: "In implementing policy in the short run" or "Inimplementation of policy in the short run.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Steve is pointing out something that can be added to a directive that has already been approved. The previous paragraph is being referenced as support for the insertion of a statement regarding policy implementation in the short run.


Passage number 442.
"MS. SEGER. Since I'm still intrigued by this fed fundsmatter, would it be possible to request the research people at theindividual Federal Reserve Banks to call around to some commercialbanks to see if, in fact, they are more carefully analyzing the banksthat they will sell fed funds to or if they've changed their approachin the last couple of months.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply suggests a request for further research on the matter.


Passage number 443.
MR. ROBERTS. I could give you the answer. They are.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This passage does not show any contention or disagreement. Mr. Roberts is simply stating that he can provide an answer to something.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 444.
-41-8/21/84MS. SEGER. Yes, I've talked to two individual banks thathave. I have not done a survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. There is contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker mentions having talked to two individual banks but also states that they have not conducted a survey. This suggests that there could be conflicting information or opinions from different sources.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 445.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I'd be a little reluctant to do a surveysimply because if we do, that itself becomes [an issue]. They beginasking why we're making a survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes, there is disagreement in the passage. The speaker is expressing reluctance towards conducting a survey, which is challenged by others who begin questioning the reasons behind doing a survey.


Passage number 446.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. They interpret that as a signal thatthey should borrow less.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It states a straightforward interpretation of a signal.


Passage number 447.
MR. BOEHNE. The Continental situation made a lot of [ourDistrict banks borrow less] even before that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 448.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I think it's something to keep our earsopen to rather than taking a survey.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement expresses an opinion about the importance of listening rather than relying solely on surveys.


Passage number 449.
MS. SEGER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Cannot generate a response without the passage.


Passage number 450.
 I didn't mean a written survey, just some--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. But even if you just call around in anorganized way, it becomes a [survey].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The statement is suggesting an alternative method for conducting a survey, but there is no conflicting viewpoint or disagreement present.


Passage number 451.
MR. RICE. It's still increasing [reporting burdens].
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The speaker, Mr. Rice, states a fact that the reporting burdens are still increasing. There is no indication of disagreement or contention in this statement.


Passage number 452.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Our manager of reporting burdens pointsout that that becomes a survey too. But apart from that, I think it'sjust the kind of thing that would raise more questions than we areprepared to answer. I have had that comment reported to me--not byany banks, but by nonbanks. Peter mentioned that it was attributed toa deliberate effort on the part of the Federal Reserve to police thediscount window more rigidly. And I assume that isn't the case.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply expressing their own opinion about a situation and acknowledging a comment made by someone else.


Passage number 453.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. We checked up on that. There's noevidence of that at all.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The statement is clear and definite, stating that "there is no evidence of that at all." There is no indication of contention or disagreement.

Explanation: The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states that the speaker has checked with other Reserve Banks.


Passage number 455.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. Yes. I had my discount officers callsome of the other discount officers.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement.


Passage number 456.
MR. STERNLIGHT. It was a conference call among the discountofficers, and there was no substantiation of that.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It simply states that there was a conference call among discount officers and no substantiation was provided.


Passage number 457.
VICE CHAIRMAN SOLOMON. This reluctance to borrow is not justat the larger banks. At least two of the larger banks said to us thatsome of the regional banks were more reluctant to borrow. I don'tknow whether you would find any in your area being more reluctant toborrow. Because of the rumors in the market, every bank leans overbackwards.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating observations and potential uncertainties regarding banks' reluctance to borrow.


Passage number 458.
MR. ROBERTS. I think they are torn. This wide spread makesthem want to have mechanical errors on Friday and that sort of thing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is expressing their opinion about the situation, suggesting that the widespread feeling is making people want to have mechanical errors on Friday. However, there is no conflicting viewpoint or argument presented.


Passage number 459.
MR. GUFFEY. I find it strange under those conditions that weseem to be hitting the'targets not only on borrowed but on excessreserves. I should think that excess reserves would be ballooningunder these circumstances.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in this passage. Mr. Guffey is expressing his observation or opinion about the situation and offering his thoughts on why excess reserves might be increasing. It is not a conflicting statement.

Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement present in this passage. It appears to be a date or code with no conflicting opinions or arguments.


Passage number 461.
MR. GRAMLEY. Why would a bank want to hold additional cashassets that are [earning] nothing.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.

Explanation: There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The question is simply asking for the reason behind a bank's decision to hold additional cash assets that are not earning anything.


Passage number 462.
MR. GUFFEY. I'm talking about the fact that there's adislocation. In other words, there's a reluctance in regional banksto sell to money center banks.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a fact or observation about regional banks' reluctance to sell to money center banks.


Passage number 463.
MR. GRAMLEY. But they could put it in other assets.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. There is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The speaker is simply stating a possibility.


Passage number 464.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, presumably there's some fine balancehere. I'm just thinking out loud. They try to hold excess reservesand not borrow; then we provide enough reserves to satisfy [theirdemand for excess reserves]. And the equilibrium happens to be at an11-3/4 percent funds rate. [Unintelligible]--well, the M2 is not.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 465.
MR. PARTEE. I don't think there's any evidence that we'reproviding reserves more generously.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not indicate any contention or disagreement. It simply states Mr. Partee's opinion without any conflicting views being mentioned.


Passage number 466.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. Well, the money supply has gone down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. This statement simply states that the money supply has decreased without expressing any disagreement or contention.


Passage number 467.
MR. PARTEE. And the reserve numbers are on the weak siderather than strong. So, it's something that we're doing here that isnot ginning up the numbers but ginning them down.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any disagreement or contention. It is a statement made by MR. PARTEE about the reserve numbers being on the weak side. There is no conflicting viewpoint being expressed.


****************DISAGREEMENT DETECTED*******************Passage number 468.
 In other words, ifthere's something we're doing--MR. ROBERTS. Why do you say the money supply has gone down.It hasn't gone down year-to-date; it hasn't gone down quarter-to-quarter; it was just down in July.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: Yes. The passage demonstrates contention or disagreement because MR. ROBERTS challenges the claim that the money supply has gone down.


Passage number 469.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. It was down in July.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No, there is no contention or disagreement in the passage. The statement simply mentions a specific time period without any conflicting ideas or arguments.


Passage number 470.
MR. ROBERTS. It's back up already in August.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No.


Passage number 471.
CHAIRMAN VOLCKER.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no evident contention or disagreement in the given passage. The phrase "CHAIRMAN VOLCKER" alone does not provide any context or information that suggests contention or disagreement. More context would be needed to determine if there is any disagreement or contention present.


Passage number 472.
 But it's going down--MR. BALLES. As a matter of fact, I wanted to ask Stevewhether that July figure is for real--that is to say meaningful--orwhether it might be a seasonal problem.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

Explanation: The passage does not show any disagreement or contention. It is simply a request for clarification and further information.


Passage number 473.
MR. AXILROD. Well, we run concurrent seasonals just to seehow we're tracking once the revision is in. I don't have the figuresin front of me but my memory is that the current seasonal through Julywould change that rate of growth from minus 1/2 percent to plus 2percent and would change some of the others. There's a little eveningout.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. The passage does not contain any contention or disagreement. It is merely stating a fact about running concurrent seasonals and how they can affect growth rates.


Passage number 474.
 So, it's still relatively low but it was--CHAIRMAN VOLCKER. I am not suggesting that a minus 1-1/2percent is reflective of the trend of M1 growth.
Does the passage contain contention or disagreement? Response from the model: No. 

There is no contention or disagreement in this passage. The speaker is simply stating that a minus 1-1/2 percent is not reflective of the trend of M1 growth.
