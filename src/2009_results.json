{"2009FOMC20090116confcall.txt": [" CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, the agreement took place over the Lehman Brothers weekend in a situation of considerable stress and anxiety.  But it was a freely negotiated agreement between Bank of America and Merrill.  There was no government assistance, and there was no request for government assistance.  It was a commercial decision.  At that time, we were actually quite happy to see it happen because we were concerned about the pressures on Merrill. But it was their decision, and we had no particular reason to think that there would be extraordinary losses in this case. Of course, the world has changed in just a few months, and this whole situation was stimulated by a call from Ken Lewis just a few weeks ago to the effect that the losses that Merrill Lynch was going to report at the end of the fourth quarter had risen on the order of $10 billion or $15 billion in just a couple of weeks, in terms of what they were reporting to Bank of America.  So these losses were not anticipated, certainly not at the time of the merger agreement, and they were actually quite a shock. We were a little disappointed in Bank of America\u2019s monitoring in that they seemed a bit behind the curve in terms of following the developments at Merrill Lynch.  But there were enormous losses at Merrill Lynch that emerged very quickly and that surprised  Bank of America and us as well. I don\u2019t know if I am answering your question, but we did not anticipate this problem when the transaction was originally agreed to.  You had a follow-up question", " MR. FISHER.  Yes, and where you can see how creative destruction works over very prolonged periods, Mr. Chairman.  I recommend it to anybody who would want to truly get away from what we constantly worry about. Mr. Chairman, you have heard a broad range of views, and that broad range of views indicates the difficulty of reaching a decision in short order here.  In terms of my own preferences, from a theoretical standpoint rather than go through each particular aspect, I would basically ask that I be recorded almost point by point as President Plosser early on articulated.  We are in exact agreement from the standpoint of what we might seek to achieve theoretically.  I was taken by President Evans\u2019s comments, however, in terms of the validity of ultimately having a price objective, but his concern that now is not a good time.  I was particularly struck by his phrase that this exercise may be orthogonal, as he put it, to the current financial crisis.  The only disagreement I have with President Plosser is that issue of timing, and I would probably say that, unlike President Evans of Chicago, I am not open-minded on the subject.  Let me explain. I do not believe the issue right now is the political environment. We went through this argument before in 2007.  My views are clearly recorded.  I was quite concerned about the politics of this, given my background and given that I am neither an academic nor as intellectually potent as the rest of the people around this table or on this video screen.  I worry about those things.  What I worry about most, though, is the last time we discussed this we were basically fiddling while Romewas beginning to burn, and I worry about the market perception of our focusing on this issue at this time.  Let me be blunt from the standpoint of what we have been able to achieve. We basically are working our way out of a deep end zone, just to use a football analogy.  Charlie will appreciate this since they decimated the Dallas Cowboys.  We have fumbled sometimes, and we have been sacked a few times, but I think we are beginning to build street credibility, and that street credibility comes from the evolution of our understanding of these issues.  As President Lacker and you said earlier in discussing the Bank of America transaction or the new support program, we are learning more as we go on.  I think we have more respect in the marketplace. I think the New York Desk is gaining\u2014not that they did not have credibility before\u2014 and we have achieved a great deal in terms of these new programs we are undertaking.  We have a financial crisis upon us.  I do not believe that has been alleviated, and I think we are just at the beginning of the game.  We are deep in the end zone.  We are beginning to work our way down the field, and I worry that being viewed as engaging in a theoretical discussion, which has lots of niceties to it and a lot of attraction to it ultimately, may just make it look as though we are not keeping our eye on the ball or keeping to our game plan. So I would argue very strongly from my sense of those with whom I talk in the marketplace that this is not a good time to proceed with this endeavor.  We can think about it.  I think the discussion today has been very thorough.  Again, I line up with President Plosser in terms of what I would ultimately like to do.  I do not have much of a difference of view there.  But I do not think, Mr. Chairman, that this is a good time to proceed from a financial market perspective and the way we are being perceived in the outside world, whatever the validities may be; and I do not think anybody can doubt, certainly on the hawkish side, my credentials on this issue of inflation, even to the point of standing all by myself against a much wiser majority.  I am deeply concerned about thedeflationary gearing that we are encountering right now.  But I do not think it is the time to talk about this, and I think we should just keep our eye on the ball of what we have been doing and basically running the business that we are running the way we are running it currently. I want to conclude with just underscoring another comment by President Plosser, which is that words and communication are not enough.  Our actions speak infinitely louder than our words, and right now I think our actions should be devoted to getting ourselves out of the mess we find ourselves in.  I think we are making progress on that front, and I do not want to be distracted from it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "   MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will keep my comments short mostly because I do not think my views have changed materially since we last took up this discussion.  On the merits, I remain skeptical of the benefits of establishing an explicit inflation objective, and in terms of timing, I think the timing is really quite poor at this moment.  Part of the reason for the skepticism is that I do not believe an inflation target would have or should have changed our conduct of policy during this period or most other periods that I could envision.  In substance, I think that establishing the objective is of far less consequence than the conduct of policy and the actions of this body.  Our credibility and commitment come from those actions\u2014come from our reaction function to changing circumstances\u2014far more than from what we say, and I think that is particularly true in times like this. I am convinced that the benefits of an inflation objective are small relative to the prudent steps that we have taken in terms of our longer-run projections\u2014along the lines that President Yellen mentioned\u2014in keeping expectations well anchored.  I am far less certain, however, that the costs of establishing an objective are small, particularly in a period like this. President Evans talked about this discussion being orthogonal to the financial situation.  I think that is quite euphemistic.  Among the questions the world and the markets have about the FOMC, this is not on the top of the list or maybe even on the first page of questions they have about us at this moment. The very nature, role, and responsibilities of the Fed are central and are being asked about in all corners, both in the Congress and in markets, and I think that we should not burden those discussions by adding the discussion of an inflation objective to get some modest benefits thereof in this environment.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. DUKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say, first, that I have not been thinking about or discussing these topics since 1995.  [Laughter]  Nevertheless, before I got here I could haveguessed pretty accurately what the intention of the Committee was and what the targets of the Committee were. From that standpoint, I am not sure that articulating a specific objective is going to do much more to inform the general public as to how this Committee might act.  After hearing the discussion, I could, frankly, support in normal times almost any consensus opinion as to what that target should be\u2014how it should be expressed, whether it should be a point or a range, and what measure should be used.  However, these are not normal times, and all of the discussion assumes communication and credibility. On the communication front, I never thought I would see a time when it was almost impossible to articulate the role of capital in the financial system or even the role of the financial system in our overall economy.  So I think this makes it a very difficult time to try to inform the public about something like an inflation target.  The second piece would be credibility.  First of all, we are in a situation with a fairly high level of uncertainty and a low level of confidence in our forecasts, and we are responding to those forecasts with untested tools.  So I think it is really difficult to be precise in what we think the outcomes are going to be.  Second, we have already strained our credibility a bit in our inability to meet the fed funds target for a period of time, and then we moved the target down to where the actuality was.  So I think that those two would make it very difficult right now.  Finally, in the political environment, my concern is that, in our efforts to support the markets and individual firms, we are running very close to the political independence line. Any political capital that we use in that sense is political capital that we need, and I do not think this is a time to use up a lot of political energy on the subject of inflation targeting.  Thank you"], "2009FOMC20090128meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, I applaud the changes in item 5 to the domestic authorization.  I will note here that it has been a triennial tradition for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President to dissent on the foreign-currency-related directives.  I am  going to break with tradition and support them. Our opposition in the past had to do with their use and the implications in foreign exchange operations that struck us as off-balance-sheet fiscal policy that was more properly done by the Treasury. However, I would like to share a couple of comments on the Guidelines for the Conduct of System Operations in Federal Agency Issues.  Let me just state at the outset that, in my view, they conflict with what we are doing now with agencies.  \u201cCredit allocation\u201d is a term of art, and I think there is room for reasonable people, in good faith, to take different positions on what that means, as is the case with terms like \u201cnormal market functioning\u201d as well.  I think of the term in this context by comparing purchasing agency securities with some broader-based purchase of a similar quantity.  I think we will have an opportunity to discuss this later in agenda item 8, but that thought experiment leads me to believe that these operations must, compared with a broader-based purchase of Treasuries, lower particular market sectors\u2019 interest rates relative to others and leave others higher than they otherwise would be.  I recognize that there are members\u2014in fact, the broad majority here\u2014who probably want to continue with the program and not suspend the guidelines. If I had my choice, I would not suspend the guidelines; I would suspend the program.  So what I would like to do is respectfully register a negative vote on this.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Is it too early to ask for a few more details on the swap description that you were talking about.  In the following sense\u2014there was nothing distributed on this, right", " MR. LACKER. Wait, wait, wait.  When you say it would be the same, it depends on whose point of view it is. The way Trish described it, we would bear the foreign exchange risk vis-\u00e0-vis the other central banks.  Is that what you are saying", "  Obviously, the collateral would be in dollars, and the foreign exchange risk would be\u2014 MR. LACKER. Obviously, it is a lending risk.  But before you do the loan, you swap with the foreign central bank. The way we do it now, the foreign central bank bears the currency risk, and in this one, we would", " MR. FISHER. Well, actually, President Evans asked one of the questions that I was going to ask. Mine is a lot more generic, of Trish:  To what degree do you sense that this credit default swap market is helping or hindering efficient markets and the equilibration of these distortions that we are seeing. Because there is some debate about this.  I am talking about the speculative CDS positions", " MR. FISHER. So is it exacerbating", "  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Fisher, you had a two-handed intervention", "   MR. FISHER. I do want just to jump in.  I thought your response was appropriate and correct, and obviously ultimately we would like to put as much of this back to the Treasury as possible. The ultimate objective is to insulate ourselves as a central bank as much as possible from political pressures, so we can do what central bankers do.  I might also add as much as possible from market pressures, but that is another matter.  But I disagree with the point made\u2014 and I agree with the staff conclusion\u2014with regard to the purchase of Treasuries.  It strikes me that there is enormous fear in the marketplace about the potential for open-ended stimulus in fiscal policy and there is great concern that we will acquiesce by monetizing fiscal policy.  I am very reluctant to go down that road.  That strikes me as one of the strongest arguments that the staff made.  At any rate, at this point I don\u2019t think it is necessary.  Rates are quite low as they are", " MS. MOSSER. For what it is worth, I think that the signal to markets of closing even the dormant facilities, given my obvious view about how fragile things are, could actually have a pretty serious, significant, adverse effect, even though they are not being used.  They are viewed very much\u2014particularly the two facilities you mentioned and particularly the MMIFF\u2014as a backstop. We don\u2019t need it now. It is not priced attractively, frankly, given the spreads in markets.  But should we go through another period, heaven forbid, like September and October, it would be used, according to market participants", " MR. LACKER. I don\u2019t understand in what sense the observation that prices are low and that quantities are very low constitutes a demonstration that the consumer-backed ABS market is broken down. Can you think of a model in which that results.  Yes, demand is low, and supply is elastic. I sketched out one. What we are talking about, it is important to remember here, is the interaction, the rivalry, between the balance sheet channel of credit flows and the securitization channel. A broad array of contractual features are important to the relative attractiveness for market participants of those two channels\u2014covenants, risk allocation, regulatory and accounting treatments, and the like.  On balance sheet constraints\u2014would some firms prefer that the demand for securitization be higher, high enough that securitization was less costly for them than holding it on balance sheet.  Yes, I am sure that is true.  But if that is the criterion for whether or not a market is broken down, then it is hard to see the difference between a market being broken down and just regulatory capture in some broad sense. You talked about markets being distorted already.  I can picture information constraints, verification costs, asymmetries, and the like that would lead market outcomes to be less felicitous for all concerned than they otherwise would be.  But, yes, information constraints constrain achievable outcomes, but so do technology constraints.  Would we be better off if we could get more output with the same amount of labor and capital.  Yes, we would.  But I don\u2019t think you would call the market distorted because that is the case. The question is why it is distorted.  If you come to me with a model\u2014with some story, not even a model\u2014that sketches out the interaction of information with technologies and with   market participants\u2019 incentives that convinces me that markets are distorted in a way that government intervention can remedy, I am all ears, and I would be happy to talk about it.  I have been asking for that for a year and a half. I have been even doing the work for you.  I have been even bringing models to the table.  I haven\u2019t gotten any information or any market observations that seem consistent with one story or another.  I am not sure that this request has been taken seriously. So, yes, if markets are distorted by something or other, fine, but that is hardly an answer for justifying the TALF in my view", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I guess this deserves an answer. [Laughter] Well, first of all, I think we have a fundamental disagreement about how we are looking at the current set of events. I think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium, not an equilibrium.  You are looking for models that describe equilibrium outcomes, and I think we are in the middle of a disequilibrium caused by the massive deleveraging of the nonbank balance sheet.  As that process unfolds, we are not where your model wants to describe. Number two, what we are observing is well outside the realm of historical experience.  So I think that to be able to produce a model that describes what we are seeing is very, very difficult because we have never been here before.  We are just generating the empirical data now to develop the model that we can actually test.  In terms of this issue\u2014is the securitization market evidence of market failure.\u2014I think my example is just a very simple one.  The fact that the bank, as you describe it, would rather hold these assets on its balance sheet than securitize them and AAA yields are higher than the net return to the bank of holding them on its balance sheet is telling you that there is a lack of arbitrage between the bank market and the nonbank market.I think fundamentally we have a disagreement about what the process is that we are describing. You say, \u201cShow me a model.\u201d  I certainly want to see your model that describes what has happened over the past 18 months because I think it is very, very difficult to show that model as well", " I am fine with that, but\u2014 MR. EVANS. Well, that is a distortion", " MR. LOCKHART. Can you answer the buggy whip question", " MR. PLOSSER. I agree with you, President Rosengren, about the objective of trying to lower the spread on the MBS, and the mortgage market is important.  However, another way of expressing one of my concerns is that, as we continue to focus on one asset class at a time\u2014 mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed credit card debt, auto loans\u2014I worry that we are gradually being drawn into an ever-wider array of private credit markets and private asset classes and instruments that we will just gradually expand.  Where is the limit to this, and how do we  define what those limits are. How do we decide what the criteria are that constitute something important enough for us to intervene in that way.  I see this creep broadening our balance sheet in ever-greater dimensions in these private credit markets.  I worry that, in its doing so, the implication is that, almost in a negative feedback loop, each market is going to become dysfunctional by something so that it will drag us in.  My desire is to have better objective criteria that help us decide when it is appropriate and when it is not, because I think that we are just going down a slope here that is broadening the scope, which is not helpful for the institution", " MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will just make a couple of comments based on the discussion today. When it comes to the TALF, I find that I am of two minds.  I do think it will ultimately be useful for deploying important central bank liquidity in an attempt to provide more-accommodative conditions.  But I am concerned that we are picking winners throughout this process. When you mention that we are going to consider CMBS, I am reminded of the fellow who came to my office and gave me a presentation.  He owns shopping malls, and last fall he desperately needed funding and still does, but they are not worth very much at the moment.  He wanted a program like this, but it wasn\u2019t available\u2014I do not know that it was, anyway.  I have also received phone calls from heavy equipment manufacturers in my District.  I know you have gotten a letter from at least one of them about their finance company financing.  For them the issue is that they are unlucky enough not to have a thrift through the OTS.  So they cannot get the FDIC unsecured-funding temporary guarantee on that, and their assets cannot be funded that way. There are some competitors that have access to this, and they have done very well, and others that haven\u2019t. As we get into this allocation type of decisionmaking, I am not quite sure how we are going about doing it. Is CMBS selected because it is an important market that we need to keep functioning or because it is going to have a particular macroeconomic effect that is beneficial.  How does that compare with other sectors and whether they are on our radar screen or not.  Maybe that was the right decision, but when we select certain types of asset-backed securities to buy\u2014it is just very difficult.   I also want to agree with many of the comments that President Plosser made with regard to the programs that we have.  The briefing today was very helpful in describing the various programs.  I think we need some additional metrics along the lines of just routine types of statistics so that we can see and have a better idea.  Your familiarity is very great with these, and ours is not as great. I have to admit, as I look at it more, I find that, although I am very concerned about exit strategy in general, at the moment our balance sheet doesn\u2019t worry me quite so much. Finally, I want to applaud your comments at the beginning, Mr. Chairman, about discussions with the Treasury and that we, as best we can be, should be allergic to any attempts to use our balance sheet for long-term financing.  I think that is exactly right.  I wish you all the best for all of us. [Laughter] I have tried to grapple with the very vague discussions of aggregator banks, and when I talk to academics, they do not always help me because they resist the fact that public funds are going to be put into this\u2014they think that it really should be something that public funding is not a part of. If you pick a very large number that is required to take assets off the balance sheet of banks\u2014I do not know what the number is, but it is in trillions\u2014and then you think about how the Treasury is going to fund this, the only way they can do that is by issuing Treasury bonds.  Ms. Mosser was talking about how $150 billion puts strains on yields.  I think you very quickly come to our balance sheet and how we are able to leverage up, and it even makes sense\u2014 because why do the gross funding through bonds when it is really a net kind of funding against assets. So it makes a lot of sense, but it causes a lot of trouble.  I hope that I am wrong in thinking about that and that there are very easy ways out of it.  But those are some of our concerns, and they will be very important", "  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I certainly agree that you cannot trust academics.  [Laughter] President Lockhart", " MR. LACKER. If I could, that is a very important insight.  It is part of the classic tension between healing now versus looking at what we are doing as part of a repeatable process from which people are going to be forming expectations about our future behavior.  That is the inevitable tension", " [Laughter]MS. DYNAN. We have asked separately about what they are doing to credit lines.  In fact, more than half are saying that they are reducing credit lines as well", " I think it is very difficult MR. STOCKTON. The thing that we are having the greatest difficulty with is trying to think about the evolution of inflation expectations in this current environment, in which monetary policy has the fed funds rate pinned at zero, and that shows through in other places.  In this forecast, we are assuming that, because actual inflation is going to run as low as it is for the reasons that Dan said, there will be some downdrift in inflation expectations.  That is implicit in this forecast, maybe on the order of \u00bd percentage point over the next few years.  We are uncertain enough about that that we obviously wanted to show some alternative simulations because a reasonable case could be made that, in fact, we are not going to get as much downdriftin inflation expectations as we have implicitly built into this forecast.  We showed a simulation with anchored expectations running at about 2 percent, and I could see that.  Even though we have already entered a period of extreme weakness, as we showed in the briefing yesterday, the Michigan survey, with 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations, has not really shown any discernible movement yet.  We might have expected that we would already have seen that if the effect was going to be large. On the other hand, just taking a look at historical evidence on sacrifice ratios would suggest a great deal more disinflation than we have built into this forecast.  If you just used average sacrifice ratios of 4, you would come up with something similar to what we had in the deflation scenario that we showed.  Though I am skeptical about that particular sort of pure backward-looking model, I do not think you could write off the possibility that, given that we think we are going to be in an extended period of extreme weakness with large output gaps and declining price pressures coming from commodities and oil, you could see a more significant movement in inflation expectations and even lower inflation.  So we are struggling with all of the exact issues that you laid out. This is our best guess at this point", " MR. PLOSSER. My last question is about fiscal stimulus and your estimates there.  It is hard not to read the commentary, and there is a huge debate going on about the effects of stimulus.  Look at the empirical evidence, the theoretical evidence\u2014the empirical work by Blanchard, and Valerie Ramey\u2019s stuff, and you have Christina Romer\u2019s work on the different estimates of multipliers and all that sort of stuff.  And I was curious. In the discussion, you highlighted two pieces in particular:  The first was the consumer tax cut and the debates about whether or not that is going to be saved or spent, and the second one, which I thought was somewhat more interesting, was that you thought that the business tax cuts would not have much effect. I guess I had two questions about that.  One, my reading of the empirical evidence is that those business tax cuts often do have some very short run stimulative effects, but the empirical evidence also says that large spending increases oftentimes have a negative effect on business investment.  That is where the substitution comes from.  So I just would like a little insight in terms of the model or the assessment of the pieces of this stimulus and how it plays into what you\u2019re assuming about some of those multipliers and so forth", " MR. SICHEL. To pick up on the business side of that first\u2014we looked at the experience from the 2002\u201304 business tax cuts, and our best reading of that was that we just did not see much effect. In terms of the empirical work that we did, we just don\u2019t think that there is a big kick there, perhaps particularly in a period when many businesses are in tough times and taking  losses. It just may not be enough or the right kind of thing to get them to start investing.  So our reading of the evidence is that on the business side there just will not be much", " MR. SICHEL. Yes", " MR. SICHEL. If you look at the picture in Part 1 of the Greenbook, we have some confidence bands based on Greenbook errors. If you compare the large-scale asset purchases line in that picture with the baseline, the large-scale asset purchases line is near the edge of the 70 percent confidence interval. So they are different.  [Laughter]  It is important to acknowledge that there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty, particularly in thinking about these types of programs and the effect of these types of programs.  If you think about all the steps as you go through the exercise of trying to gauge what the effect of these programs is and you go through all the steps of the purchase of securities\u2014what is the effect on interest rates in the market where   the securities are purchased; what is the spillover to other markets; and then in this environment, what are the implications for economic outcomes.\u2014there are many places to be very uncertain", " MR. STOCKTON. I think we can safely say that the confidence intervals are wide here, I think wider than we show in those estimates, probably wider than you can get on a legal size piece of paper.  [Laughter] We start out with our normal simulations that have all of the uncertainty about the shocks to the economy and even about the structure of the model of the economy.  These simulations have the tremendous added uncertainty of what these purchase programs will actually do to private interest rates, and as the note that was circulated to the Committee indicated, there is just a lot of uncertainty about how any particular program would affect mortgage rates, Treasury rates, the Baa rate.  We are doing our best here.  In some sense, this was a response to a question that you posed last time:  What would it take to fill the gap between the unconstrained and the baseline forecasts.  But I think it is extremely uncertain", " MR. LACKER. Two more questions. One for Brian.  In exhibit 6, the projections, bottom panel, longer-run inflation forecast, the dotted line is our October projections, and the solid lines are our January projections. If our intent was to find an inflation number that we all report that had some stability from forecast to forecast, we seem to have failed", " MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, since the last FOMC meeting, our District\u2019s economy has continued to weaken, and this weakness is widespread and is taking on more of the complexion   of the national economy.  Led by a sharp decline in manufacturing and slower export growth, year-over-year private employment growth slipped into negative territory in November for the first time in our region since \u201904.  Consumer spending weakened in December despite heavy discounting, and residential real estate activity remains quite depressed.  Conditions in commercial real estate have deteriorated markedly, and financing in this sector has become extremely difficult.  I might add a footnote here:  In discussions of this with some of the folks involved in commercial real estate, they are concerned about a couple of years from now because in 2002, 2003, and 2004 there were a lot of commercial real estate projects put into play at very low cap rates and very good interest rates, with a 10-year balloon. So those are all turning now with obviously less value because they are assuming that the cap rates will be higher.  They are also assuming that the buildings will not be as new, and therefore the values will be under pressure. So they feel that the problems in commercial real estate are only beginning. Those parts of the District that depend on energy and agriculture continue to be somewhat better, but these areas are expected to show\u2014and are, in fact, showing\u2014declines, and we expect pretty sharp declines in \u201909 due to the falloff in commodity prices.  District businesses are moving rapidly to address the sharp slowdown.  Many have instituted hiring and wage freezes, and layoffs have risen considerably.  Many businesses have significantly curtailed current production and future capital spending plans.  For example, our energy industry contacts expect a 30 to 50 percent reduction in drilling activity and a 35 to 60 percent reduction in capital expenditures in \u201909. The fiscal situation for states and local governments has also deteriorated very rapidly.  Most District states are now looking at significant budget shortfalls over the next two years.  Most states plan to address these deficits through spending reductions rather than tax increases.  The situation for local governments is somewhat mixed, depending on whether they rely on property taxes or on sales taxes for the revenue base.  Many states and localities are looking for assistance from the federal stimulus package to avoid more draconian cutbacks in spending.  Banking conditions are deteriorating within the region.  Nonperforming loans are increasing, and losses are mounting as well. Turning to the national economy, recent economic data have been worse than expected, leading me, like others, to revise down the forecast for growth this year.  I now think we could see negative growth into the third quarter before the economy picks up as the fiscal stimulus begins to take hold later. In the near term, I see considerable downside risk to growth due to the pervasive weakness in the U.S. and foreign economies and the substantial financial headwinds that remain in place.  Indeed, I fully expect banking conditions to deteriorate further, even as financial markets begin to stabilize.  I am especially concerned that commercial real estate, as I mentioned earlier, could be the next shoe to drop, with broad implications for banks and insurance companies across the country.  Consequently, the strength and the timing of the recovery appear, obviously, very uncertain at this point. In terms of inflation, the significant decline in energy and commodity prices, along with a weaker economy, has obviously put considerable downward pressure on overall and core inflation, as a cyclical effect of this recession.  I think it would not necessarily be timely to start projecting deflationary pressures, and although I get more questions about that, at this point I don\u2019t consider that the highest risk we have. Thank you", " MR. HOENIG. They disowned you", " MR. PLOSSER. They have disowned me.  They have had it.  I do anticipate the growth path to look somewhat like that in the Greenbook.  But I am basically a little more optimistic than they are\u2014a very weak first half, maybe some positive growth in the second half, which may just balance each other out, but that may be an optimistic perspective.  I expect the economy to gain some steam in 2010, to about 3 percent, and settle into something closer to a steady state or at least to a long-run trend in 2011.  I have less overshooting in my forecast than some of the models do\u2014and I think than the Greenbook\u2014because, as I explained yesterday, I have less of an output gap than they do. I think some of the productivity shock on financial intermediation is showing up in less of a gap, and therefore there is less of a closure and pushback on the other side. Unemployment rates will clearly rise this year above 8 percent, but I hope that by the end of the year they will begin to stabilize or perhaps come down a bit. On fiscal policy, as I was asking the staff yesterday, I am not very optimistic that the fiscal package will do much for the economy.  A multiplier of 1.3 is probably pretty optimistic, from my perspective.  So I haven\u2019t built in much effect from fiscal stimulus.  I hope the fiscal package is constructed to give its best shot at helping, but I am not entirely optimistic about what its shape will actually look like or whether it will actually be very much help. Obviously, because I am on the more optimistic side, the risks to my forecasts are clearly to the downside. My inflation forecast is less deflationary than the Greenbook\u2019s baseline, and it is similar, as I said yesterday, to the alternative simulation labeled \u201canchored inflation expectations.\u201d In that sense, I am relying more on forward-looking expectational models than on distributed lags of past inflation, which heavily affect both the output gap and the forecast of inflation going forward, given the wild swings in relative prices that we have seen.  I think more in terms of estimated new-Keynesian Phillips curves, in which the output gaps both are smaller and have less effect on inflation.  Again, those lead me to a little less dire scenario in terms of the deflationary pressure of output gaps going forward.  I put a lot more weight on our credibility for keeping inflation near 2 percent than on the past behavior of prices.  There is some risk to this inflation forecast, as I alluded to. Near term, we will not see much inflation.  I am not concerned about that. Nor do I think that deflation is going to be very persistent.  Some of it is already in train because of the way oil prices are behaving.  I do think that, in the longer term, there are inflation risks unless we manage our balance sheet appropriately.  I am encouraged by our discussion yesterday and some of the language that we talked about in terms of thinking about how we manage that in a careful way. Finally, I would just repeat my request\u2014I think it was at our January meeting on inflation targeting\u2014that it would be useful in our forecast summaries actually to forecast and report out, as we do with other measures, our assumed policy paths that each of us are using for our projections. In the internal summary, you give a verbal description of people saying what their assumed policy path is.  But I do think that it would be useful to summarize those in terms of both ranges and central tendencies because, as we move\u2014assuming that we can and do\u2014to a more explicit inflation-targeting regime, that range of central tendencies for the assumed policy paths should be added. I think it will both help for transparency reasons and help anchor expectations as to what we are doing, and that would be good.  So I would encourage us tocontinue to pursue that effort, and, of course, I am in favor of the longer-term projections.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are in the midst of a very deep and protracted downturn, and I have to squint really hard to see any light at the end of the tunnel.  It is a sad commentary that the one glimmer of light during this intermeeting period has been that economic developments have been roughly in line with our expectations.  In other words, we were braced for the bad news we received. For example, we had expected a dreadful holiday retail season, and that is precisely what we got.  One of my directors, the head of a national department store chain, reported that his company posted its worst season since it was founded in 1901. We had anticipated severe hemorrhaging in jobs and a sizable jump in the unemployment rate, and that, too, is what we got.  Many of my business contacts are reporting layoffs and wage freezes. One unpleasant surprise among the economic data was last week\u2019s 15 percent drop in housing starts. The residential housing sector has now shrunk so much that the only real assurance that it will ever stabilize seems to be the fact that construction spending cannot go negative. This is just about the only zero lower bound that is working on our side.  [Laughter] Turning to financial markets, it is comforting that lending terms eased in a few markets, notably money and mortgage markets.  But equity markets continue to sink, and credit spreads remain breathtakingly large.  Another of my directors, the chairman of a large, well-known apparel company, reported that his company, which is rated BB, looked hard for additional financing and the best they could come up with was a loan rate of 18 percent.  We have also heard many reports concerning the tightening of trade credit.  Indeed, a particularly severe shortage of credit to finance international trade flows may conceivably help explain why both exports and imports are shrinking by abnormally large amounts relative to the decline in GDP. Looking ahead, I expect that, as in the Greenbook, high borrowing costs and the continuing credit crunch will help prolong the recession for at least a couple more quarters.  Accordingly, I project that real GDP will decline \u00bd percent this year, and the unemployment rate will rise to 8\u00bd percent.  However, I am hopeful that a large and timely fiscal stimulus will help kick-start a recovery by the end of the year.  In particular, based partly on our situation in California, I think the Greenbook\u2019s assessment of the impetus provided by the proposed federal fiscal stimulus directed toward state and local governments is on the pessimistic side.  The Greenbook assumes that such spending will roll out slowly over the next several years, providing little near-term stimulus.  However, my contacts told me that in California a lack of funds has already halted construction on a number of public infrastructure projects, and these projects could be quickly restarted if federal funds help the state close its huge budget gap.  Outside California, the data suggest that most of the country is facing near-term cuts in state spending in areas ranging from education to construction, and it appears that the fiscal stimulus will allocate money largely to those states that could most use it to avoid immediate spending cuts and finance shovel-ready infrastructure projects.  Still, even with a large fiscal stimulus, it will take many years before the economy returns to potential and economic slack is eliminated. Unfortunately, over the intermeeting period, I have become much more pessimistic about the downside risk to my modal growth forecast owing to the rapidly deteriorating condition of the banking system.  For much of the past year, it was the financial sector that was constricting the real economy, but now the slowing economy is returning the favor.  The sharp decline in equity prices and increases in CDS spreads for bank holding companies since our last meeting  presumably reflect the market\u2019s concern about the likely magnitude of losses that will hit the banking sector. These losses now reflect a broad-based deterioration in performance across the whole spectrum of consumer and corporate lending.  As I mentioned yesterday, I share President Hoenig\u2019s concern about commercial real estate over the next few years.  I fear a cycle in which rising vacancies and falling valuations make it impossible for owners to refinance loans that will be coming due, leading to forced selling and intensifying downward price pressures.  Such a development may undermine the soundness of many regional and community banks, whose exposures to this asset class are substantial. Let me conclude with some discussion of the outlook for inflation, for which there are also sizable risks. I expect core PCE price inflation to come in at about 1 percent this year and then edge down a bit more in 2010 and 2011.  Given the sizable downside risks to the forecast for economic growth, the risks to inflation also appear tilted to the downside.  As in several of the Greenbook alternative scenarios, it is not hard to imagine a situation with excessive declines in inflation and a long-lasting deflationary trap, much like Japan\u2019s experience and perhaps even complete with zombie banks.  Of course, I am reminded that the last time we were concerned about the possibility of deflation in 2003 we were head-faked.  The deceleration in prices during that period was not sustained, and it was actually concentrated in a few categories of goods, particularly used cars with very flexible prices and owners\u2019 equivalent rent. My staff has taken a first look at the current episode in order to see how widespread deflationary pressures are across various categories of goods and services.  Given the available data, they find in this preliminary look that the recent deflationary pressures are more prevalent now than during the 2003 deflationary scare.  Just as in 2003, some recent price declines are in categories of goods with highly flexible prices, like used cars and apparel, where price cuts could reflect a temporary response by retailers to sell off excess inventory.  However, disinflationary pressures are somewhat more prevalent now than in 2003 in categories of goods and services characterized by sticky prices.  We will be analyzing these data in greater depth going forward and monitoring them, but we think they raise the risk that we could see a prolonged period in which inflation falls well below the level consistent with our dual goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment.  That leads me, especially now, to favor going ahead with the publication of our longer-term projections, especially given that inflation over the next three years, our standard horizon, looks as though it is unlikely to converge to the levels that we think most desirable in the longer term.  I think it makes going ahead with the extended forecast particularly appropriate now", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you. Anticipating for a moment the statement in the policy round, there is a proposed sentence that says that the Committee anticipates a gradual recovery later this year with downside risks.  I am listening to the discussion about near-term pessimism and concern and uncertainty, but then you mentioned your forecast of minus 0.8 percent for 2009, which arithmetically suggests that you do think there will be positive  economic growth later in the year, and I think many of the projections that we got were in the same general ballpark.  I just want to flag that as an issue for the next round, which is whether we are comfortable talking about positive growth later in the year or whether we think we should just remain agnostic on that.  President Rosengren", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed forecast has the unemployment rate well above the NAIRU and the inflation rate uncomfortably low throughout the forecast period.  Because our view is that inflation is more sensitive to significant excess capacity, our forecast implies an even greater risk of deflation than the Greenbook\u2019s forecast. Even with the substantial fiscal stimulus and recent monetary policy actions done to date, our outlook implies that it will take more than five years to return to full employment and an inflation rate of 2 percent or more. Housing continues to be a key component of the problems.  Falling housing prices reduce the wealth of consumers, contribute to problems at financial institutions, and provide little incentive for residential investment to improve and so are a significant contributing factor to our dire outlook.  Until housing starts stabilize, I am skeptical that equity prices will show the improvement embedded in the Greenbook forecast.  The rising unemployment rate will be placing further pressure on housing but will also be a contributing factor in weakening commercial real estate, which a number of people around the table have highlighted.  Commercial real estate has held up better in some locations, such as Boston, but even those locations are beginning to soften. With little credit available and vacancy rates climbing, my contacts with real estate developers have become increasingly depressing.  In Boston, commercial real estate has also been buoyed by building by hospitals, colleges, and universities.   However, losses experienced in endowments have caused the construction to be halted unless it was fully funded and already started. Banking continues to be stressed. Large banks are experiencing large losses in their investment portfolios as highly-rated securities continue to sell at very steep discounts, if they sell at all. They are also likely to experience substantial increases in loan-loss reserves, which appear to be lagging the problems.  The economy and financial markets remain susceptible to further bad news emanating from the banks.  Despite monetary and fiscal actions taken or likely to be taken soon, our forecast indicates that, without more-significant actions, unemployment rates will remain too high and inflation will remain too low for an uncomfortably long period of time. Regarding the long-term projections, I do support publishing those.  I would note, as President Pianalto did, that there does seem to be an increase as to where people are targeting inflation. It might be good to update some of the staff work that was done on what the probability of hitting the zero lower bound is and what the probability of deflation is.  It does seem that our targets have been somewhat based on taste rather than focusing on the tails of the distribution. I think we have learned something about the tails of the distribution, and it might lead to a more informed discussion if we discussed in more depth what the probability is now that we have had some recent evidence of those two outcomes", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As noted around the table, the economy continues to contract at a rapid rate, and there are few signs that the pace of decline has slowed. That said, clearly there are some positive elements in aspects of financial conditions, such as interbank funding rates. Corporate bond and mortgage rates have eased somewhat since our last meeting.  Oil prices have fallen a lot over the last few months, and that has bolstered household real income.  Moreover, the political uncertainty about what is next should lessen now that the Obama Administration has assumed power.  Over the next few weeks, the Administration is likely to pass its fiscal program and announce how it plans to utilize the second tranche of TARP monies. That should lessen some of the uncertainty in financial markets about the public policy response. But these developments should not comfort us much, if at all.  In my view, the risks to the New York Fed forecast and the Greenbook forecast, which don\u2019t differ very much, remain very much to the downside, and we should emphasize that when we motivate our response to the crisis. In particular, in addition to the labor market woes already cited, the banking system is probably in worse shape today than it was last fall, despite the injection of hundreds of billions of dollars of government capital.  Moreover, the ability of the federal government to adequately recapitalize the banks as loan-loss provisions mount is in question, impaired by the question of whether the size of the second TARP tranche will be big enough to do the job.  A good portionof this is going to be used for other areas, such as mortgage foreclosure mitigation, and there are exceedingly poor politics associated with giving more resources to aid the banks, making it problematic whether a third TARP installment, which might be needed, can actually be secured politically. Inadequate bank capital is at the core of our problems, and I am not sure we are going to be able to solve this problem quickly or definitively.  It would be much better to do too much in terms of capital injection, taking back that excess later, than being a day late and many billions of dollars short as we have often seemed to be throughout this financial crisis.  Adequate capital in the form of tangible common equity is essential to restore confidence, improve credit availability, and restore good market function. The second issue I would like to talk about is household net worth.  It is contracting at a rate exceeded only in the Great Depression.  We should not understate the size of the blow to U.S. households, for households\u2019 wealth has been evaporating at an alarming rate at a time when the personal saving rate has been unusually low and the safety net had been whittled back.  That is not a good combination.  This is the first big economic downturn in which defined-contribution plans, which are immediately affected by changes in financial asset value, are the dominant source of retirement income for many households beyond Social Security.  In the past, defined-benefit plans with a fixed monthly payment insulated retirees and their families from changes in financial asset values.  Moreover, the decline in wealth may not be over.  Although I will not predict the equity market, the Greenbook forecast of a 12 percent annualized return over the next two years could turn out to be optimistic.  After all, if bank balance sheet constraints are causing risk premiums to be unusually high, couldn\u2019t this also translate into the risk premium for the U.S. equity market remaining high with lower equity prices at least over the near term.   Finally, even if equity prices do better, it certainly looks as though housing prices will continue to fall for another year or so, until housing inventories are brought down to more-normal levels. Third, the U.S. recession is occurring in the context of global weakness.  This means that the trade sector is not likely to provide any significant degree of support here or anywhere else.  I think this is very important, especially in the context of the staff\u2019s analysis of the Reinhart\u2013 Rogoff consequences of past crises.  The staff forecast showed a lesser decline relative to past crises and what has happened historically. Yet in those past crises, individual countries had the out of depreciating their currencies and having trade improvement.  We do not have that out this time, and I think that just makes me a bit more nervous about whether our experience will be more in line with those historical experiences. I know the Greenbook and our own modal forecast assume that the recovery will begin in the second half of the year. I hope that is true.  But it strikes me that, until our banking system is repaired, the risks lie clearly to the downside of such a traditional-recovery, V-shaped forecast.  At a minimum, the degree of uncertainty about the outlook is unusually wide, as described in the Greenbook and illustrated by the width of our fan charts.  We are well outside the range of normal experience.  In such circumstances, model-based forecasts probably should be viewed with somewhat greater skepticism, and the Greenbook acknowledges that.  Under these circumstances, the Federal Reserve needs to continue to be aggressive in providing liquidity and balance sheet capacity to the private sector.  The goal should be to ease financial conditions as much as possible in the current environment, subject to the constraints imposed by our legal authority, subject to protecting ourselves against credit risk and the issues posed by further rapid balance sheet expansion on our exit from our current suite of special liquidity facilities", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I prefer alternative A. The current outlook envisions an inflation rate below 2 percent throughout the forecast period.  We have judgmentally adjusted our inflation forecast upward relative to the straight model outlook.  Thus, our forecast entails a significant risk of deflation occurring in 2010 unless additional actions are taken. I see little harm in expanding our program of purchases of mortgage-backed securities and GSE securities to lower mortgage rates further.  While this alone is unlikely to be sufficient, it will help stabilize housing and the financial sector.  I would prefer this policy to purchasing long-term Treasury securities.  Rates on long-term Treasury securities remain quite low as many investors prefer to hold government securities of all maturities.  Trying to reduce the spreads   relative to Treasuries is likely to be more effective as it more directly attacks the elevated borrowing costs. I would note that, in our own projections over the three-year period, not a single one of us had an unemployment rate back below 5\u00bd percent, and I would note that only one of us thought that we would get to 2 percent if that was our inflation goal over the three-year period.  The difference between alternative A and alternative B is whether we say we might do something versus doing something.  It does seem that, if all of us think that we are not going to get to where we want to go within three years, this would be the time to actually do something.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman", "   MR. HOENIG. Two or three people have mentioned the last sentence in paragraph 3.  I would just like to get a bit of reaction from Governor Kohn or President Yellen.  My concern with putting that sentence in is that you change expectations toward the thing you are trying to avoid. If we suddenly start saying that we are thinking inflation is getting too low and it is not consistent, people then are going to be convinced that it is getting too low and we are going to put more pressure on it.  We ought at least to think about that before we get on a bandwagon here. That is my caution.  I do not know if anyone wants to comment", " MR. LACKER. The spread of views on this is likely to be related to the extent to which we believe our credibility is complete\u2014in other words, if we think that expectations about inflation are so fragile and so changeable that our statement highlighting the possibility of deflation could move them around.  On the other hand, you could take the point of view that they are so well anchored that it will not move them around.  I find myself in the Hoenig and Plosser  camp on this\u2014not viewing them as as well established as we want.  Well, that is consistent with my statement", " MR. LACKER. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I fully support the expansion that we have engineered in our monetary liabilities.  I view our strategy as having expanded them fairly dramatically to provide stimulus now that we are at the zero bound.  I think our strategy going forward is going to be focused on maintaining them at a high level and, while the economy is in distress, perhaps varying the quantity and perhaps increasing it should distress increase, and that seems productive.  When the economy recovers, begin withdrawing that stimulus; then at some time in the future, lift the funds rate off the floor.  I am cognizant that assessing the appropriate magnitude of that expansion is terribly difficult, for reasons that President Bullard and Governor Kohn discussed. We are, in fact, at the limit of our professional understanding of the transmission mechanism, although I think there is a lot that is known that we could fruitfully review and discuss in the Committee on this issue.  I am less supportive of the way in which we brought about this expansion in our monetary liabilities, as you all know.  As I said yesterday and on many other occasions, I think the case for targeted credit programs is weak, briefly put.  They do not address any demonstrable market failure.  They channel credit away from other worthy borrowers, exacerbate moral hazard, and set bad fiscal precedents.   Regarding the exit strategy, I do not see anything inherent in the economics that has motivated our intervention into these programs or that links that to the state of the business cycle and where the funds rate needs to be. So I do not see why it would necessarily be the case that, when we want to lift the funds rate, the perceived needs in any of these dysfunctional credit markets will have necessarily gone away.  I think that is clear just from the way the case has been made and the fact that credit markets can dysfunction in the way they have been claimed to dysfunction in peacetime, in any part of the business cycle. The TALF is our next new targeted credit program to be introduced.  It is on deck to be implemented in February.  I believe that it would be better policy for us not to implement the TALF but instead to expand our balance sheet by buying U.S. Treasury securities.  The effect on credit markets will be more neutral.  It will avoid distorting credit flows across private borrowing segments.  Adverse incentive effects would be minimized, and I think it would maintain more distance between us and redistributional fiscal policies.  Concerning buying Treasuries, I think that monetization is something that I am less concerned with because the way I view it is that the choice should be what we buy, in which case we are monetizing the same amount of stuff. I can appreciate the concern that, coming at a juncture in time in which a large fiscal stimulus is being enacted, there would be a natural risk\u2014and I think it is a risk\u2014that the public would make the inference that our increase in the balance sheet was at the behest of the Administration.  I think we should strive to avoid that.  If we maintain our monetary liabilities flat across this episode for the next quarter or so, we would be able to do that, but I will admit that is a risk. You have had conversations and will have conversations with the Administration about the idea of a new accord.  As I said yesterday, I applaud those.  I think that is another reason to hold off introducing any new program that we might ultimately be considering\u2014and Ithink we ought to consider\u2014transferring wholesale to the Treasury.  For all of these reasons, Mr. Chairman, unless we decide at this meeting to defer the TALF, I would respectfully dissent because I would prefer to expand the monetary base by purchasing U.S. Treasury securities rather than through targeted credit programs.  Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. To complicate this even further, on the one hand this would be a change from December, and there has not been a big change, in our view, since December.  On the other hand, Debbie points out to me that the minutes from the December meeting had exactly this sentence about inflation\u2014that some members saw significant risks that inflation could decline and persist for a time at uncomfortably low levels, and then similar language that relates to being below the sustainable level, and so on.  President Lacker", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes, I think that is correct, although the Treasury right now is scrambling to get their new staff up and running.  So there is some risk that what had been agreed to by the old Treasury now needs to be sort of relitigated with the new Treasury.  That could delay our putting out a term sheet to market participants, which they really need to have several weeks ahead of time for this program to get up and operational.  I think there is a good chance that we are still going to be able to make February or certainly early March, but we probably want a bit of wiggle room there because we don\u2019t have complete control of the process", "  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. So, Governor Warsh, there is an \u201cif\u201d here.  I mean, that certainly implies that our action is conditional on certain things happening that may or may not happen", " MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, the action words are \u201cprepared to purchase.\u201d  Are we going to maintain those in there, or would we change it, keep \u201cevolving,\u201d and put \u201cwill consider purchasing\u201d", " MR. LACKER. I\u2019m sorry.  I missed what\u2019s on the table.  Is it that the economy has weakened further or that the outlook has weakened further", " MR. LACKER. Oh, okay. I guess my attitude toward the longer-run projections is that I remain unconvinced, as I was in our October discussion, that the benefits exceed the costs, and I wanted to use the opportunity here to ask about the status of adopting a numerical objective for inflation", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I agree with you that this has disadvantages and advantages relative to a formal target.  Absolutely. I wanted to thank everybody for the very useful discussion that we had in the videoconference, and I promise not to have a full discussion of inflation targets any time soon because I do think we do have a pretty good sense of people\u2019s views. What I took from the conference call, among other things, was that the Committee was willing to grant me some discretion to try to discuss with the political bodies what their views would be on going forward with an explicit objective.   As I mentioned to you even before the meeting, I had spoken to the Administration, and I have had some follow-up discussions there.  My sense is that there would not be any serious opposition from that side, although I need to continue to talk with them.  But the more difficult question is on the congressional side, and I have a meeting with Barney Frank on Monday, in which I will raise this issue among other issues.  My sense of the meeting was that it was worthdoing some socializing and some exploring of these issues but that we wanted to be very careful and very sensitive at this difficult juncture about not creating new political problems for ourselves but only if we can persuade the leaders of the country that this is something constructive.  So I will continue to try to do that and continue to work on this.  I do think, frankly, that this continued expansion of our projections actually makes it much easier to sell because it creates a context in which the Congress can see that this is only part of a program that involves meeting both parts of our mandate", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes. I guess I am somewhat less than fully enthusiastic about publishing long-term projections at this time.  I could support it, but I just want to make a couple of points. First, I think it is a somewhat awkward time to introduce long-term projections. Our forecasts are almost certainly going to be very wrong, given the level of uncertainty. Moreover, long-term projections may be viewed by market participants as off point.  The economy is sinking rapidly, yet the FOMC is spending its time constructing forecasts for 2011 and beyond. Second, if the goal is to introduce long-term projections to communicate the Committee\u2019s views about parameters such as the NAIRU, the potential growth rate, and the desired level of  inflation, wouldn\u2019t it be better to simply proceed and publish those measures rather than long\u00adterm projections, which are just an approximation of those parameters. Third, I think the individual long-term projections are difficult to link back to the projections for 2011.  If one of the primary objectives of the long-term projections is to provide some background for how the projections past 2011 will converge to the Committee\u2019s goals, you might want to consider different ways of constructing the central tendency forecast. Fourth, I worry a little about what happens when the composition of the FOMC changes.  The long-term projections that result might change because of changes in the composition, not because of an underlying change in view by individual members.  I think it would be hard for market participants to know how to judge those changes over time, quarter to quarter, as the projections evolve. So I can support it, but I am not enthusiastic"], "2009FOMC20090207confcall.txt": [" MR. FISHER. So it\u2019s a moving thing.  In other words, we don\u2019t know whatever first-loss guarantee we might require.  That\u2019s an open door for us.  Or you do not think it is going to be necessary", " MR. HOENIG. Well, Deborah, I\u2019m not sure I understand your answer, because if you have an institution and you do the exam and it has X number of assets in difficulty, which brings its capital down to, say, 3 percent, they would then choose to apply for capital under this program, and then what would you do.  Would you acknowledge their request and provide them that capital, or would you say no because\u2014whatever the reason", " MR. HOENIG. I appreciate that.  I have two more questions.  In terms of the TALF\u2014 just to clarify and maybe take some of my confusion away\u2014in this morning\u2019s paper there was discussion about the TALF encompassing our willingness, as these new asset-backed securities are developed, to actually work through hedge funds, and you had mentioned possibly confining this to commercial banks or broadening it.  Can you clarify that for me, so that I understand whom we would be working through as the counterparty on this, as we engage in the TALF", " MS. DUKE.  Okay, and then a second question.  I worry that this announcement might have actually the opposite effect on the banks. Do we have any contingency plan if this doesn\u2019t  go well and there start being runs on uninsured liabilities at the banks.  Do we have any contingency plan for what we\u2019ll do then", " MS. BAILEY. I don\u2019t have a good response to your question, but there is a separate group working on what steps we might take if, for example, there\u2019s vulnerability, particularly around some of the larger banks, before this program can even get up and running, or if there\u2019s another Friday night phone call. There is an interagency group that is not only working through the steps and clearly thinking about the capital and the wraps that we have done before, but that is also considering what other actions might need to be taken. There\u2019s also a separate subgroup of people who are thinking about the legal changes that need to be made in the regulatory structure to be able to deal with a failure of a large, systemically important financial holding company; now we would have to deal with it through something like bankruptcy, which is not acceptable. So we\u2019re laying out all of those steps\u2014what we\u2019ve done before, what other things we can do. The FDIC is involved in it. We\u2019re trying to quickly put down on a couple of sheets of paper all of those things", "   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. We agree with that concern very much, and we\u2019re going to raise this again with Tim.  I guess there are always these short-run versus long-run concerns.  I think, on the other hand, we do not want to commit to maintaining the existence of every current bank that is operating, and, as I said, one thing I like about this in principle, although the communication is a huge problem, is that it is very market-based and very \u201ctough love.\u201d  The hope is to come out the other side with a banking system which is plausibly well-capitalized and can inspire investor confidence.  But the transition could be very tricky, and we need to think very hard about contingency plans and about our communications. Vice Chairman, you have a two-hander", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes, and I think that Governor Duke raises some very important points, which is why I was here until late in the night last night, to try to improve the messaging. I think there\u2019s another issue, too, which is that there are firms that can be resolved pretty easily within the existing bank resolution framework, and there\u2019s one particular firm that can\u2019t; we are working on how to handle the one particular firm that can\u2019t, but it\u2019s very, very difficult, given the existing tools", "   MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to underscore the questions that Governor Duke has asked, because of the cumulative process here under the previous administration.  I\u2019m not attacking that administration, but the way things were announced and delivered by the Secretary of the Treasury and the whole process made for really a \u201cready, fire, aim\u201d approach.  And I\u2019m very uncomfortable.  I understand the pressure that everybody\u2019s under and that Secretary Geithner is under, but the vagueness here, which you mentioned at the beginning, will  in my opinion just feed upon what was almost a spastic methodology (that\u2019s a gross word, but, in effect, that\u2019s what it was), because we\u2019ve gone through this process before.  So, in a sense, the markets are conditioned to worry whenever something is announced, and I do think we all should be\u2014you should be, the Board should be, and the FOMC should be\u2014prepared for a harsh negative reaction. The lack of specificity here is what they\u2019ve seen before, and I realize that that\u2019s, in some people\u2019s minds, politically wise\u2014to see what the reaction is\u2014but we plant the seeds for a very harsh reaction by being vague.  And I just wanted to add my concern to Governor Duke\u2019s. At least we should be prepared for a very harsh reaction.  My response to this is, it\u2019s just one more uncertain step being taken.  I know how hard we\u2019re working on this, and I know how much thought has gone into that. So we\u2019re learning at every step.  But be prepared for a negative reaction that could be quite harsh, and at least we ought to have that in our contingency planning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me just echo the comment you made at the outset, which I think Governor Duke and others have made.  It will sound in the spirit of piling on, because this is obviously an incredibly tough situation and we\u2019re all doing our very best. I think in terms of market expectations that you and, I think, Bill referenced\u2014these expectations have been raised about what is going to be announced on Monday.  My sense is that this program is both more and less than they\u2019re expecting:  More in that it is broader and more comprehensive; less in that it\u2019s less clear what this is going to mean in effect and with respect to timing.  So I\u2019d say that while the questions are being asked about how this works in practice, we are likely to have markets test that weakness, test that ambiguity, and I suspect they will do that   in this upcoming week, particularly with respect to some of our most systemically important  institutions. So I think for them this will be exceptionally problematic.  I hope that this is better received than my instincts and the instincts of some others on this call suggest, but I do think that we need to be as prepared as we can be to respond to these questions. With respect to how the Congress might react, I think that\u2019s an additional difficulty.  In some ways, I think this proposal is encouraging the Congress to engage in these discussions, engage on lending, engage on capital, which, again, I think will add uncertainty to markets over the course of the next several trading days. A couple of other concerns along those lines: While these questions are being raised, it will be more difficult, not less, for capital markets to get traction separate and apart from financial institution weakness, so I think that some of the improvements that we\u2019ve seen from some of the facilities that have been announced and implemented in New York by Bill and his colleagues might be under increased difficulty during this period.  And then finally, just as a note of caution, I think even apart from those institutions that are going to have the biggest questions with respect to control and creeping nationalization and the intent of the U.S. government, I think there will be implications for the healthier ones who are their competitors, implications for their business model and their deposit base, which we\u2019re going to be put in the position of having to address. So I wish I had easy answers to it, but my sense would be that, in the course of the discussions with Treasury between now and Monday morning, there are really two ways to go.  One is to go narrower at the first and be more specific about particular programs and set expectations about when they will announce the rest.  The other is to try to put some time parameters around when they\u2019re going to answer questions subsequently\u2014so that we don\u2019t just  have a series of leaks and bleeding information that finds its way into the newspapers.  I think the Fed has been remarkably quiet and confidential during this.  My sense is Treasury has, as well. But, if the last week is any indication, the sort of false starts and messages that come from  this process are going to create difficulties.  So let me stop there, but just raise my concerns there as well", " MS. DUKE. President Pianalto is assuming that this means that the others will do the job as well as we did.  You may have all of the supervisory agencies thinking that this means that everybody else will do things as well as they did and the general public thinking that nobody had done the job properly before this", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I think the key question about this aggregator bank is:   Given these private sector investors who are going to have to be compensated for the risks that they\u2019re taking, will the bank pay prices high enough to incentivize banks to actually sell assets to the aggregator bank.  I think at this stage we don\u2019t really know the answer to that.  I don\u2019t think at this point we can really say how well or how badly it will work in practice", " MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some of my questions were the ones that Governor Duke was raising. The capital piece of this seems to be very critical.  In some sense we backed away from the huge aggregator bank or the ring fencing in favor of just putting more capital in there, and I guess we\u2019re sort of forcing the banks to come to us for capital with the scrubbing process. All of that makes sense to me\u2014with a few questions.  It does strike me that this is a new requirement.  Now, I know, as Deborah has taught me, that we have Tier 1 capital requirements, and they\u2019re supposed to be dominated by common, and we\u2019ve kind of slipped from that.  But it does sound like we are putting in place a new capital requirement, and there are all the pro-cyclical problems with that.  Especially if we go to a dollar level of capital, we haven\u2019t had those kinds of requirements before.  We haven\u2019t ever told a bank that it can\u2019t sell pieces of the bank to meet our requirements. I think there will be huge resistance to this by the banking sector.  Now, maybe part of this will depend on the terms on which the new capital comes in.  One prominent banker yesterday said he wouldn\u2019t take any new capital.  He may not have any choice.  But I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of resistance to the capital.  I feel bad, because I don\u2019t have a solution to any of these problems.  I\u2019m just pointing out my concerns", " MS. DUKE.  The capital that we normally want them to hold is private capital.  Now we not only want them to hold that, but we want them to hold ours, because ours is the only capital that they can get", "  MR. WILCOX.  This will be structured with pretty strong incentives to try to get them to buy us out of the position, precisely on that consideration", " MS. DUKE.  I would just challenge the assumption that the equity prices don\u2019t matter, because when the vast majority of the public sees those stock prices going down, particularly to the very low levels that they\u2019ve reached recently, that triggers some concern about the institution.  They don\u2019t have anything else to look at\u2014the only thing they can see is what\u2019s happening to the stock prices, and that\u2019s how they judge", " MR. LACKER. That would be an aggregator memo", " MR. LACKER. I took the broad lesson of the RTC, Japan, and Sweden to be that selling assets has some benefits as well as some potential problems, so I wasn\u2019t quite sure what the attitude was about that. I\u2019m a little puzzled about the incentives in the aggregator bank.  You talked about the private profit motive and paying fundamental values for things.  Yet they\u2019re going to have this huge government guarantee in their liabilities, and I\u2019m not quite sure how we ought to view the incentives of the private equity holders who would control that.  It\u2019s not clear to me that they\u2019re going to be managing it from a socially optimal point of view", " MR. LACKER. I have two questions about the TALF.  One is that I think it would be a good thing if our best estimates are that the probability that the Federal Reserve bears a loss is virtually negligible. There have been analyses like that in the private sector that haven\u2019t come true in the past.  We\u2019re all tied together in the Reserve Banks in terms of these losses, and our boards of directors are expressing an increasingly avid interest in the nature of the risks we\u2019re exposed to on our balance sheets. And here we\u2019re taking the Fed System\u2019s balance sheet from $1.7 trillion or something up to $2.7 trillion\u2014this is a fairly notable increase.  I think it would be useful for us to have access, at a fairly detailed level, to this analysis of the potential losses to the  Federal Reserve that might be involved in the TALF\u2014what kind of analytics determine the parameters, and how they were set, and why we have confidence that the probability of losses is fairly minimal.  I\u2019d be interested in knowing if you could assure us we\u2019d get access to that from  whoever is doing the analysis within the System", " MR. LACKER. I don\u2019t want to shut off the discussion on this point, if there\u2019s more.  But, if not, this is my third and final question.  It\u2019s a comment in addition to a question, and it has to do with where we\u2019re going to come out in the end\u2014a year or two from now\u2014with regard to an accord on credit policy.  I understand that this is an intermediate step, and that you envision further discussions down the road towards a more complete or comprehensive understanding with the Treasury about credit policy. My concern here is that I think that there are a range of possible strategies, and I worry about whether the steps we\u2019re taking now compromise where we might ultimately want to go.  I understand the provision of credit by the Federal Reserve in exceptionally exigent circumstances, where there\u2019s enormous time pressure\u2014we get a call on a Friday night, and convening the Congress on a Saturday afternoon doesn\u2019t really seem feasible.  That\u2019s fine with me\u2014that ought to be a Federal Reserve function. But for programs that take three months to implement, arguably it would be feasible\u2014 perhaps not politically feasible, I\u2019ll admit that, and that\u2019s a separate question\u2014but as a matter of mechanics and parliamentary process, it would have been feasible to ask the Congress to approve the authority of the Treasury to implement the TALF program.  And it occurs to me that drawing a bright line at what is, in terms of timing, feasible for the Congress to authorize the Treasury to implement seems like a logical approach that has a lot of attractive properties for us.   I\u2019m concerned that we\u2019re going down a path that\u2019s taking us in a different direction, and we might compromise something that might be more workable and more beneficial, and we\u2019re doing it without a real discussion of where we want to head more broadly with regard to an accord on Treasury policy. As you describe it, part of the understanding with the Treasury now is that they would accompany us to the Congress in an appeal for a mechanism of one of two varieties for us to be able to sterilize our lending:  One would be the idea of us issuing non-monetary liabilities; the other would be for the Treasury to issue debt and deposit with us under the current program. The concern I have about the latter is what the nature of our understanding would be with the Treasury about who controls those issues. We ask, and they agree to say yes, usually, under reasonable circumstances.  There\u2019s always the possibility that they will retain some implicit leverage over us that would constrain our independence going forward.  On the other hand, having the ability to control our own issues of non-monetary liabilities seems really attractive. But, again, I worry about bargaining power; in an event, knowing that we have that capability, the Treasury and the FDIC would, I think, retain the ability to stare us down and essentially say, \u201cWell, you have the ability to issue non-monetary liabilities that don\u2019t count against the federal debt limit, so you do it.\u201d  I think that\u2019s exactly the dynamic that emerged in the case of Citi and Bank of America, where there was nothing mechanically or legally that would have restricted the Treasury and the FDIC from taking all of the risk, and for us to bear none of the tail risk. But knowing that we had this tricky little mechanism for dressing up a guarantee as a loan, they prevailed upon us to participate and participate fairly substantially.  So I worry that setting up an ability for us to issue non-monetary liabilities that are the functional equivalent of Treasury bills and are outside of the appropriations process and don\u2019t count against  the debt limit would give both the Congress and the administration an avenue, a target, a mechanism that would make it irresistible for them to come to us to finance things that they didn\u2019t want to go to the Congress to finance. In my mind, the discussion about the accord needs to be about where it\u2019s appropriate for government lending to be done.  You all know I\u2019ve raised objections about our lending programs, but this is apart from the advisability of any one program.  It\u2019s about the Congress and the appropriate constraints on circumventing the appropriations process, and it\u2019s about our independence. I worry that we\u2019re going down a path where, as I said, we\u2019re going to be vulnerable to complaints about our inability or our unwillingness to constrain executive compensation or the lavish expenditures that entities that are going to be benefiting from our programs might make.  We\u2019re going down a path where people like Elizabeth Warren are going to be writing reports\u2014 or could be writing reports\u2014about what we do.  I think that\u2019s a very uncomfortable situation to be in, and I\u2019d like us to think clearly about whether that\u2019s what we\u2019re headed towards or whether this compromise is headed towards something that leaves us with a much broader and firmer measure of independence.  So I just wonder what thoughts you\u2019ve given to that kind of question, Mr. Chairman, and the extent to which you view representations we\u2019ve made in these discussions as compromising alternative strategies about a credit accord", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I think your summary of the program was very precise, exactly as I understand the program myself as of late last evening.  I think that we have to recognize, though, that Mr. Geithner still has 48 hours, and the program could change in the meantime.  So if the program turns out to be somewhat different than the Chairman describes, that\u2019s not the Chairman\u2019s doing, that\u2019s the Treasury Secretary\u2019s doing.  It could be a little bit different at the end of the day than what we have right now, so don\u2019t criticize the Chairman if the program morphs a little bit in the final 48 hours.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change, though, to a great degree. I think that the one area of the program that really needs to be nailed down is the  FDIC guarantee program\u2014exactly how they\u2019re going to extend that, whether they\u2019re going to modify the cap, and whether the covered bonds are being included.  I think that most of the work, though, on the program now is really on the message.  And I think that our general view of what we saw yesterday was it was a bit scary, it wasn\u2019t particularly confidence-building, and it wasn\u2019t very clear.   We have a number of people at the New York Fed that are helping with the process, and we\u2019re trying to do three things: Make it less scary; make it clear that this capital-raising exercise is designed to instill confidence in the banking system by ensuring that the banks have enough capital to withstand the stress scenario, above and beyond what we expect to happen; and, as a consequence of that, make investors look at the program as confidence-building rather than confidence-draining. I think the disappointment for a lot of people that have been working on this exercise is that the program is not as clear and definitive as we would like.  But we\u2019re going to try to make the message as clear and as definitive as we can within the confines of the program. As far as the TALF is concerned, I think that people are going to be a little bit confused about how the TALF fits into this program, because they\u2019re waiting for an announcement on Monday about the banking system, and the TALF isn\u2019t really about the banking system per se.  It\u2019s really about expanding the capacity of the private sector balance sheet to take the pressure off the banking system, basically to help market functioning improve and ease financial conditions. So there may be a little bit of confusion with people wondering, well, is this TALF going to take bad assets off bank balance sheets.  I don\u2019t think the TALF is really being built with that in mind.  It\u2019s possible some assets could come off the bank balance sheets as a consequence, but we\u2019re going to need to be clear that the TALF is really not a bank rescuevehicle. It\u2019s really more about improving financial conditions in the general economy.  Thank you", " MS. DUKE.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  We talk about the analysis that we\u2019ve done in terms of the TALF, and we\u2019re really establishing the capital that we think we need to hold on these assets, and it\u2019s presumably based on a loss estimate\u2014not on any estimate of potential market value loss, but of credit loss. The first question is: Are those being done on a stress scenario in the same way that we would apply it to the bank capital needs.  And my second question is:  From an actual and a communication standpoint, when we go in to scrub the banks, might we be looking to scrub the banks particularly from a credit loss standpoint, not necessarily from a market loss standpoint. Based on an estimate of their credit losses, some assets may actually be, in this analysis, worth more than they\u2019re marked on the balance sheet today, and others would be worth less.  Or are we planning to go in there and focus on the worst of both possible worlds, both market value losses as well as credit losses", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. The Treasury could legitimately argue that they\u2019re putting up too much TARP capital relative to their risk", " MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Just a comment, and I\u2019ll try to keep it brief, because I know you\u2019ve been very generous with your time here, but I have to tell you my thoughts as I look at what we\u2019re trying to do and the strategy.  The U.S. economy over the last decade has leveraged up incredibly.  The numbers are dramatic\u2014a doubling of our leverage in the financial sector. Right now we\u2019re going through the deleveraging process.  And as the leveraging went up, there was enormous misallocation of resources.  So those resources are now shifting back and forth, and there is going to be pain with that\u2014I don\u2019t think we can avoid that.  The deleveraging process requires us to acknowledge hundreds of billions of dollars of loss.  The loss is there\u2014we can\u2019t avoid it\u2014and the need to recapitalize by significant amounts is a fiscal action that we have to take. What we\u2019re trying to do, if I understand today\u2019s meeting and other meetings, is to try to temporize the adjustment process\u2014to give us time, or give the Congress time, or give someone time\u2014so that a fiscal stimulus package can help make up the difference, or something like that. It worries me, though, that we\u2019re doing it through the TALF, because it does further misallocate resources, although I know we\u2019re trying to make it as broad as possible.  I am confident that we have a major commercial real estate problem coming, and that will bring us\u2014 again\u2014losses that have to be taken and will put us in the position of having to figure out how we\u2019re going to temporize and lend, and that may in fact further distort things.  So if we can  develop ways that would minimize our involvement, rather than continuing to accelerate it up to $1 trillion, I think we would be well served in the long run, because the loss is there, and the adjustment is going to have to take place.  And if we distort, I think we will only prolong, in the end, some very harsh realities that lie ahead.  That\u2019s my concern, and I know you realize that, but I just have to voice it at this point. Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I disagree with that.  I think that what happened was that they were very slow in adjusting to the financial crisis in the banking system.  I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re referring to, frankly", " MR. LACKER. I know, this could be a long debate.  The scrubbing of the balance sheets is a very strong element in this plan, and I think that it\u2019s well worthwhile. And I think it\u2019s really clever to get around these accrual accounting problems rather than address them head-on.  I think it makes a lot of sense to go in and run a shadow regulatory regime around what those assets are really worth"], "2009FOMC20090318meeting.txt": [" MR. NELSON. As Trish noted, the subscription for the first TALF operation begins today.  The loans requested between now and Thursday will settle on March 25, exactly four months after we first announced the program.  Those months were spent canvassing potential ABS issuers and investors to determine the program design characteristics that would be most successful, evaluating the risks of the program and developing the associated controls, and working out the back-office arrangements. Nevertheless, the size of the initial TALF subscription is going to be modest, in part because potential borrowers are uneasy using the TALF to finance ABS purchases. Potential borrowers and primary dealers have largely been unable to work out mutually acceptable customer arrangements.  A particular sticking point seems to be assigning responsibility for the risk that a potential borrower is determined to be ineligible for the program at the eleventh hour, leaving the primary dealer, who is typically the underwriter, responsible for funding the issue.  Investors are also reportedly concerned that participation in the program will expose them to government interference in their business, a fear apparently confirmed on Friday when it became more widely understood that recipients of 13(3) loans will be subject to tighter restrictions when hiring noncitizens.  We are trying to facilitate agreements between potential borrowers and primary dealers, we are seeking to provide as much clarity as possible on the issue of hiring noncitizens, and we are addressing other issues as they arise. We continue to hope that participants will grow more comfortable with the program over time.  I note that revisions to the FAQs to help clarify some issues are going on right now.   The subscription that starts today is for the TALF program as initially announced.  The New York Fed will be extending three-year nonrecourse loans against newly  issued triple-A-rated auto, credit card, and student loan ABS and ABS guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.  The monthly operations will continue through this December unless extended by the Board.  The program has a $200 billion ceiling and is supported by $20 billion in credit protection from the Treasury. As you all know, the Board is prepared to consider increasing the size of the program up to $1 trillion, supported by up to $100 billion in credit protection from the Treasury. The expansion would entail widening the list of eligible collateral to encompass much of the universe of newly issued triple-A-rated collateralized obligations, for the most part backed by newly and recently issued loans.  Staff at the Board, New York Fed, Chicago Fed, Atlanta Fed, and the Treasury have been evaluating specific asset classes for possible inclusion in the program and have been developing prospective terms and conditions.  We are concentrating first on the largest asset classes and will recommend specific categories of securities for inclusion on a flow basis as we complete our reviews. As a first step in that expansion, we recommend that the Board approve adding four categories of ABS to the list of eligible collateral, starting with the April operation. The four categories are the first to be recommended because they have relatively straightforward structures similar to those already taken, allowing us to evaluate them quickly. Although they are smaller asset classes than the consumer ABS already accepted, they are the largest among the securities that can be evaluated quickly. The first three are the principal types of ABS that were excluded from the initial program because they are not backed by consumer loans:  ABS backed by loans or leases relating to business equipment, ABS backed by leases of vehicle fleets, and ABS backed by revolving lines of credit used to finance showroom inventories.  The fourth is ABS backed by the credit provided by residential mortgage servicers when homeowners miss payments.  Mortgage servicers have found credit increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain.  Accepting the ABS at the TALF should improve the servicers\u2019 ability to work with homeowners to prevent avoidable foreclosures. All the assets proposed to be accepted will have maturities of three years or less, resulting in a good fit for the three-year term of the TALF loans.  The proposed new collateral classes are of roughly equivalent risk to the types already accepted.  After applying the recommended haircuts, which range from 8 to 13 percent, the risk to the Federal Reserve should be similar to the de minimis risk associated with the types of ABS already accepted as TALF collateral. We estimate that accepting the new categories of ABS would increase demand for TALF loans through December by $30 billion to $130 billion.  If the Board approves the additions, we would release revised terms and conditions and FAQs for the program on Thursday. We are also evaluating the other remaining major collateralized asset classes for inclusion under the TALF, for example, CMBS and non-agency RMBS.  Subject to Board approval, terms and conditions for these asset classes could be announced as 2 Materials used by Messrs. Gagnon and Reifschneider are appended to this document (appendix 2). early as mid-April.  Staff members have held extensive discussions with issuers, investors, and rating agencies about several asset categories and have narrowed down the scope of securities that we might recommend accepting.  For instance, CMBS would likely include those backed by solidly underwritten existing mortgages and by mortgages that are being refinanced, and RMBS would likely include those backed by mortgages exceeding the conforming loan limit and possibly mortgages to near-prime borrowers. Because a number of the assets envisioned for the expansion are more complicated than those currently taken or thus far proposed to be taken at the TALF, staff members are planning to recommend that a collateral agent be hired to assist with underwriting and that a portfolio manager be hired to monitor the assets accepted. Staff members are also evaluating the use of the TALF to address the legacy asset problem.  The Treasury has proposed that the Federal Reserve accept at the TALF older securities that were rated triple-A when issued but that may or may not still be rated triple-A. One reason to expand the TALF to legacy assets would be to increase demand for, and hence the prices of, the eligible assets, thereby bolstering the balance sheets of financial institutions. Another reason would be to remove the eligible assets from the balance sheets of their current holders, leaving those firms with cleaner, more transparent balance sheets and an improved capacity to attract new equity from private sources. In the Treasury\u2019s proposed structure, the legacy TALF loans have five-year terms, but in other ways the facility resembles the existing TALF. Staff members have analyzed the feasibility of the legacy TALF proposal for a few asset classes, specifically 2005- to 2008-vintage CMBS still rated triple-A and subprime and Alt-A RMBS rated triple-A at origination.  Our preliminary assessment is that, for many of these securities, haircuts and other terms could be set that would adequately protect the Federal Reserve and the Treasury but would nevertheless elicit sufficient investor demand to be helpful.  We have concluded, though, that it would be necessary in some cases to set haircuts on a security-by-security basis.  Nevertheless, we believe that we could operate the program at sufficient scale and with sufficient speed by hiring an outside contractor.   Joe Gagnon and Dave Reifschneider will now discuss large-scale asset purchases", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Separate from conforming mortgage markets, where we have a different program, all other ABS markets, to my knowledge, are pretty much shut down", "   MS. MOSSER. I also would defer to the supervisors on this.  But we have had conversations with the supervisory teams of a couple of these institutions (not just the one) since we decided that it was worth investigating, and nearly all of them are deleveraging abroad as they are deleveraging here and attempting to reduce their liquidity risk.  I think that eliminating that risk in a really short period of time is probably unrealistic, considering the size and scope of operations, including very traditional banking operations\u2014which, we all know, are subject to runs\u2014that several of these institutions have in many countries.  And many of those countries do not have, for example, the deposit insurance schemes that the United States does, which means the institutions are more vulnerable there.  I think the possibility of completely shutting down and eliminating the risk in a short period of time is probably unrealistic, although movement in that direction is a good idea", " MS. BAILEY. I\u2019m not quite sure how to frame \u201call they can.\u201d  I think the supervisors\u2014 particularly with the company that\u2019s probably the most international of all\u2014have clearly gone through their funding. It has set up appropriate funding mechanisms within those countries where they are being looked at, and they have taken good significant steps to try to address some of the vulnerabilities. They\u2019ve had outreach meetings with the different central banks.  So during the last year, they have actually been taking a lot of aggressive steps to try to minimize the vulnerability associated with that.  But some of the organizations are big purchasers in foreign currencies. We just can\u2019t shut that down that quickly, nor do we expect to.  It\u2019s just not abelievable strategy for that funding mechanism.  But they\u2019re looking more broadly both at the U.S. and abroad", " MR. PLOSSER. I just wanted to go by the rules.  On the large-scale asset purchases, I have a couple of questions about some of the underlying assumptions.  I was struck by the fact that the assumption was that, under an MBS purchase of $500 billion, the rates on corporates and Treasuries also go down. But the net effect of that, given the assumptions you made, was that corporate spreads rise by 20 basis points, whereas under a Treasury bill purchase, corporate spreads fall by 20 basis points. I\u2019m puzzled about what model generates that kind of differential effect, and how much that might be driving some of the stimulation results that you\u2019ve got.  I\u2019m a little puzzled about what drives\u2014well, I know what drives it; the numbers you put down drove it\u2014but I didn\u2019t know whether you thought that was internally consistent or whether there were economic mechanisms that you thought that was consistent with.   The second question I had was about the assumptions about the elasticities.  You\u2019ve got a mortgage-backed security market that\u2019s $7 or $8 trillion, somewhere in that neighborhood, you\u2019ve got a $500 billion purchase\u2014so that\u2019s a little less than 10 percent of the marketplace\u2014 and you get a 75 basis point effect, whereas for long-term Treasuries you\u2019ve got less than $2 trillion total and you do a $500 billion operation, and you only get a 30 or 50 basis point effect.  So there you\u2019re participating in almost a third of the market, and in the other case only about 10 percent. It may be true that those are the right elasticities, but I\u2019m wondering where those came from.  To get any effect in some of this stuff, you\u2019ve got to have some sort of market segmentation going on so that you can play the yield curve game a little bit. The other question on that topic was related to President Lacker\u2019s question.  The presumption of these programs, particularly the mortgage-backed purchases, is that there\u2019s something amiss in the markets, that we\u2019re trying to fix some intermediation problems, or there are some dysfunctions in those markets.  And yet it seemed to me that, as you expanded the so-called spillover effects and they got bigger and bigger and bigger, it goes against the very presumption of why you wanted to be in these markets in the first place\u2014to try to promote intermediation and liquidity.  So I didn\u2019t know how these two assumptions connected or reconciled with one another\u2014how you could get both large spillover effects and maintain the presumption that these markets were dysfunctional. I wasn\u2019t quite sure how those two pieces fit together. On the swaps, following President Lacker\u2019s comments, I had some of the same questions.  It seems to me that you offered three reasons why these swaps might be needed.  One was this issue of not having enough collateral in the foreign country for the central bank to do the lending it wanted to do, and the second reason was the foreign central bank maybe wouldn\u2019t accept the  U.S. bank\u2019s collateral.  But the other reasons really had to do with the solvency of that institution. It seems to me that, from an operational point of view, if a bank is insolvent, it\u2019s not clear we ought to be lending to them in the first place, so I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s a reason to be in this business. And given that it only applies to perhaps four or five banks, if it\u2019s really a liquidity problem, it seems to me that doing this through the discount window is a much more natural way to think about what it is we\u2019re doing and the problem we\u2019re trying to solve.  You offered some concerns about how difficult that would be. I guess none of those seemed insurmountable to me.  And the fact of the matter is that we would probably be doing most of this lending out of New York anyway, so it\u2019s not as if you\u2019re going to have to worry about lots of the Reserve Banks necessarily having to get foreign currency. It just seemed to me that it might be a better way to go because (a) we do not want to lend to insolvent institutions and (b) the discount window seems appropriate for exactly that liquidity problem rather than designing another facility. The last question I have is about the announcement effects.  I worry that this is going to be interpreted by the markets as a veiled or not-so-veiled attempt to support one institution.  I think the markets will see through that very quickly.  I don\u2019t know how to mitigate that if we decide to do it.  It could be viewed as a less than transparent effort on the part of this institution to support a particular institution, and I think that, in turn, may damage our credibility and damage our reputation in the marketplace.  I think if an institution is in trouble and we make the decision to help it in some way, then we ought to do it on its merits and not try to \u201cback door\u201d that solution through another mechanism.  Thank you", " MR. GAGNON. If I could start with the first couple of questions, I think our views have been evolving somewhat as we\u2019ve been working on this.  When I looked at the literature while I was working on the December memo, there wasn\u2019t an agreed-upon way to normalize or scale   purchases like this. So what I did at the time was to take the most common approach, which was to look at the total size of the market across all maturities\u2014and that was about $5 trillion for U.S. Treasuries. The idea was to consider a purchase over a broad range of maturities at the long end, say, maturities of more than three years, but I didn\u2019t fine-tune it to segments or look at just the long end per se. You might want to do that", " MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019d like to congratulate you on being a tough taskmaster, with having us sit and listen to an hour\u2019s worth of briefings without any questions.  I had seven, but I\u2019m down to three now.  [Laughter] And I\u2019ll be jumping around, too, because of that. I\u2019d like to ask a question of Dave Reifschneider first, having to do with exhibit 3 on the inflation forecast under large-scale asset purchases.  Let me mention at the outset that I\u2019ll reveal later on in this meeting that I\u2019m not overly concerned about inflation, but having seen this chart, I\u2019m suspicious of this, and it\u2019s in the way that the analysis is done.  As I read the Bluebook, it seems that the unconstrained optimal policy has inflation rising because inflation expectations rise, and you have inflation expectations depend on errors in the Taylor rule, as I understand it. So I\u2019m guessing that the model is seeing very accommodative monetary policy and translating that into increases in inflation expectations, and that\u2019s why inflation is up.  Now, I\u2019m going to guess that you do not have that same effect in these other forecasts", " MR. EVANS. I like the model analysis.  I think it\u2019s very useful, and I think this is just a limitation, and that\u2019s how everybody should interpret it, because you\u2019re doing a great job on the unemployment rate here.  That sort of tips you off. Let me jump to the balance sheet scenarios, because I looked at those scenarios, but didn\u2019t see one that, in light of disinflation risk, I would like to see. If it were costly to have one  more, I would drop one of the others instead.  The ones that I\u2019d like to see are where the Committee finds itself in a position where we need to raise rates, but we have a lot of sticky assets on our balance sheet, we\u2019re not quite sure how to address that, and we don\u2019t get legislative relief. While I do not put a high probability on this scenario, I think it\u2019s important to understand it. What if inflation expectations rose.  I think it would have to be an exogenous increase\u2014 something that is not currently imbedded in my thinking and in the model analysis here\u2014but, what if.  Certainly a lot of people are out there looking at our balance sheet\u2014I think incorrectly\u2014but they\u2019re looking at it and saying \u201csomething\u2019s going to get out of hand.\u201d  So if we could see a scenario like that, including how we would have to grapple with balancing the conflicts, it would be very informative.  That\u2019s more of a suggestion. Finally, I have a relatively elementary question about the TALF:  What is the value-added of the investor in the middle in this entire transaction.  We\u2019re bringing hedge funds to the table, and I\u2019ve thought, well, they\u2019re going to help with price discovery to make sure that this issuance is really right, but I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s really a strong role.  There\u2019s a lot of private capital on the sidelines\u2014according to what everybody tells us\u2014and they\u2019re going to bring a very small part of it to the transaction.  But what they are demanding\u2014I hear from everybody I talk to\u2014are very high levered rates of return, which hedge funds are typically associated with delivering. This is going to be in relatively low-risk transactions\u2014triple-A.  We\u2019re not expecting to lose on them, but we could. But what does this mean.  We\u2019re hoping this will kick-start a secondary market.  It\u2019s that kick start\u2014I don\u2019t know where that comes from.  There\u2019s capital on the sidelines. What will bring it to the table.  I would guess that they would start by looking at this and saying, \u201cWell, the safest investment has 20 percent rates of return.  So from here on out the risk curve, the rates   should be higher.\u201d I\u2019m already hearing from a lot of contacts that this is very expensive, that they have to deliver this, and they\u2019re not sure if they are going to participate very much. Is the risk\u2013return frontier in some sense being moved up by this program.  Will competition really bring these returns down.  That\u2019s what we always think, but I don\u2019t know where competition is going to come from, because it\u2019s on the sidelines.  I really have to understand why it\u2019s on the sidelines and why it will now be forthcoming", " MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions. The first one follows up on President Evans\u2019s earlier question.  It\u2019s one for Spence. I have been somewhat concerned about exit strategies. I think it\u2019s probably going to be quite a while before we have to worry about it, but I think I\u2019d feel better about expanding some of these programs if we did have that worked out. When I read the balance sheet scenarios, I was comforted at first to see that it\u2019s going to be a very long time before we need to deal with this at all.  But then I looked at it a little bit more carefully.  I thought maybe there was something in the scenario you laid out that was inconsistent, because it was based on the March Greenbook forecast, but that assumed no additional unconventional policies. Then, in your baseline you added $500 billion in purchases of MBS, which, in the staff memos on that program, has quite a bit of macro impact.  It seemed to me that, with the likely impact of a $500 billion program, we would have a stronger economy than in the baseline. We would probably want to be raising rates in 2012 rather than 2014.  I guess that would be about the same time that the TALF was building up and might be difficult to unwind. So my question is: Have I misunderstood that, or have I taken too sanguine a message from your scenario about exit strategies. My second question is for Bill, and it concerns the extension of the TALF from newly originated asset-backed securities to legacy assets.  As I recall, there were just a couple of paragraphs in the memo on that.  But it seems to me to be a very big step, and I\u2019m not sure I really understood it. Is this considered the PPIF program", " MS. MOSSER. There\u2019s a completely different set of limitations, namely, how much the payment and settlement system can handle, depending on how compressed we make these purchases. We have not done this yet for Treasuries, but for mortgage-backed securities, we think that if we tried to buy $1\u00bd to $2 trillion more this year, we would come close to breaking it", "  MR. LACKER. I may be pressing you for things that haven\u2019t been put on the table, but do you envision a public statement with all of these elements in it", " MR. HOENIG. I\u2019m trying to understand this.  The  TALF is for three years, and the way I see it, we\u2019re taking the assets they put into this organization, which you expect to liquidate and recover at least enough to the point where we\u2019re protected.  But how confident are you that we can roll this stuff off our balance sheet in three years.  These are distressed assets.  So we might have to turn them over later, or the market would have to change so much that you could sellthem, and whoever has the 20 percent risk would take any write-off.  I see us as taking the \u201cbad bank\u201d position in a \u201cgood bank\u2013bad bank\u201d scenario", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes", " MR. FISHER. Can I come back to the Treasury\u2019s quid pro quo, particularly the third key element, the public\u2013private partnership.  You mentioned that there was discussion within the Board\u2014what are the concerns as the Board views it", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. On asset purchases, [laughter] I think there are lots of good reasons to escalate:  The economy is weaker; financial conditions are tighter; in addition, the TALF is off to a slow start because of all of the stuff that\u2019s swirling around on AIG and TARP. The broader TALF, I think, is going to come much later.  While there might be an announcement on legacy TALF relatively soon, the actual operationalization of that, I think, is going to take many months\u2014just given that the TALF 1.0, which we\u2019re enacting today, took four months.  And the PPIF\u2014it\u2019s not even clear whether banks are going to be willing to sell assets to the PPIF. Are they going to get a high enough price to engage in those transactions.  So it seems to me that right now it\u2019s on us.  And it\u2019s more on us than it was even a few weeks ago, because I think the political climate has deteriorated significantly, so the ability of the Administration to go back to the Congress and get more TARP money is significantly less than it was even a few weeks ago.   Then the question is: What should we escalate to.  The lines in David\u2019s graph suggest that $2 trillion would put us roughly on top of the unconstrained line.  And, conveniently, the numbers I was going to advocate total $2 trillion, by coincidence rather than by design.  We did not talk beforehand, as David can attest.  [Laughter] I think that I\u2019d want to escalate the agency MBS program to more than $1 trillion, because escalating to $1 trillion through year-end is basically keeping the run rate exactly the same as the program is doing right now, which is essentially $500 billion every six months.  So I think we should escalate the program, and I would suggest $1\u00bd trillion. The market will not give us much credit for just extending the program another six months at the same purchase rate.  I think the market generally expects us to extend the program, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really going to have a lot of benefit. I would increase the agency debt from $100 billion to $200 billion, so I\u2019m at $2.2 trillion, to be honest. But I\u2019m not counting that.  I don\u2019t think the agency debt is really very important or that effective, but I think leaving it out raises more questions than it\u2019s worth raising at this juncture. And I would engage in a Treasury purchase program.  The last time I was here, I argued mostly against it.  But I think the stakes are pretty high right now.  We don\u2019t know exactly how much a Treasury purchase program would do, but, if we start one, we\u2019ll be able to answer that question. There\u2019s a lot of information that we really just don\u2019t have right now.  So I would suggest engaging in a Treasury purchase program, starting immediately, up to $500 billion, concentrating in 2-year to 10-year maturities and buying both nominals and TIPS.  We can also purchase things outside of those maturities to avoid distortions to the shape of the yield curve. But that\u2019s what I would do. One other thing before I give up the floor\u2014I just want to stress what the point of the reverse swaps is.  The point is to prevent some bad piece of news that creates a liquidity run insome foreign market from putting us in a very difficult position in which a foreign central bank is unwilling to lend to a U.S.-owned company because it doesn\u2019t have enough collateral, and we don\u2019t have the ability to get them the money quickly enough to prevent a default.  I think that we want to do this. I\u2019m not sure whether we want to delegate it to the Subcommittee or actually enact it in the FOMC; but it would be really unfortunate if we didn\u2019t do this, and then something happened that caused the exact problem that this reverse swap will address, and then we\u2019d say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we do what we could have done to avert it.\u201d  So it\u2019s a belt-and-suspenders approach, but I think we\u2019re in an environment where we need both a belt and suspenders", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. On the resolution authority, Board staff has been working on legislative language, and Governor Tarullo and others are reviewing it.  I think, frankly, that the Congress will be looking to the Fed and the Treasury to come up with the language, because it\u2019s a very complex set of issues.  And we are working on it.  President Bullard", " MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me confine my remarks to the large-scale asset purchases. I must admit, I am quite uncomfortable with the idea of purchasing long-term Treasuries in size. As the papers described to us, the benefits could well be quite small.  My sense is the costs might not be.  This is an idea that we\u2019ve been discussing for a few months, and as I think about the need that we all feel to escalate, my sense is it has gotten more attractive now because we have run out of some very good alternatives. Let me highlight some of these concerns.  First, I think the nature of the Treasury market is, frankly, quite different from the nature of the GSE markets that we\u2019ve already entertained\u2014 and I think I\u2019d be comfortable entertaining those more.  The long-term Treasury markets are functioning reasonably well; they\u2019re highly liquid and the desire for risk-free assets is still quite high. My sense is, notwithstanding those facts, at this particular moment in time, Mr. Chairman, there are serious questions being raised by market participants and market commentators about the government\u2019s ability to fund new higher expected levels of Treasury issuance\u2014that is, they may or may not, in the market\u2019s view, be able to find buyers at market-clearing prices.  Then if the Fed is perceived to be monetizing debt and serving as a buyer of last resort in the name of lowering risk-free rates, we could end up with higher rates and less credibility as a central bank.  My own sense is this could be self-defeating.Very recent discussions that Nathan Sheets and I had with certain large non-U.S. buyers of Treasury securities confirmed these suspicions.  They note that at times like this we are one government, and if the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have to collude to somehow solve the issuance problem, it could be signaling greater problems about our ability to fund ourselves.  So I would say my concerns are particularly pronounced at a time like this. Now, of course, all central banks are struggling with arrangements between the fiscal authorities and the monetary authorities, as we are.  There\u2019s no easy way around it.  I think the accord is certainly a step in the right direction.  But I fear that if we are perceived to be colluding with the Treasury around this idea, in the name of saving 25 or 30 or 40 basis points in the short term, we\u2019re running serious risks.  Even if our actions lowered long-term risk-free rates for a time, and we got a pop\u2014and I suspect we would get a pop\u2014it does strike me the spillover benefits to lower rates on a broader range of securities are likely to be small, probably smaller than the models would suggest.  The availability of financing is unlikely to change by virtue of our actions. Our actions don\u2019t appear to me to change the universe of institutions or the universe of assets that are financeable, and credit markets would not open to anyone or anything new.  The best that could be said is that we are lowering rates on riskier securities by a very small fraction, and that amount is likely to be overwhelmed by daily moves in risk premiums, as has been evidenced in the last few days, with costs that, as I mentioned, could be quite large. With respect to the U.K. example, which has gotten quite a bit of attention overseas, I think there\u2019s a little less there than meets the eye.  My own sense is, this is more a story of liquidity, by virtue of the government entering markets that are considerably less liquid than Treasuries, and it\u2019s also a bit of a story of a much more activist central bank in the U.K. than the markets had become accustomed to.  So I think that\u2019s probably playing some role as well.   In light of the choices we have, I think it would be preferable at this point to increase our emphasis on mortgage-backed securities, as has been described.  I think we could continue to argue that that is solving a very serious problem, which is that market functioning is still more impaired in that market than we think is ideal.  They are wards of the state, yet they are trading as very poor, imperfect substitutes for the Treasuries.  I think that would be a better option to take at this time.  Thank you", " MR. HOENIG. Mr. Chairman, let me give my comments on expanding our balance sheet by first saying that I agree with those who have said, and I think you have said, that we cannot get the economy going until we get the banking and intermediation process fixed.  And I think that\u2019s an important premise for going forward.  That means we need to focus on resolution, and I think this proposal that\u2019s being worked on using the TALF and using us to help finance a bad bank is actually going to delay dealing with this very serious problem.  Given the comments that President Rosengren and others have made, I think we have an opportunity to get this done with some legislation that would create the ability to put some of these holding companies in receivership and move forward, so that we can get the banking system fixed on a sustained basis. I think that\u2019s important, because I am very concerned about the TALF and growing our balance sheet, even at this meeting.  I think we should pause, because we have the TAF, we have other means to provide liquidity, should it be needed, and we have excess reserves that are sizable. I think we should focus on fixing the banking system and conserve our balance sheet carefully. I wouldn\u2019t want it necessarily to decline dramatically, but I don\u2019t think it would with the TAF, and so forth; we have the mechanisms to provide liquidity. But if the majority decides to go forward with it, then I do prefer mortgage-backeds to Treasuries. I disagree in a sense with President Lacker because I think it would just open us up to charges of monetizing Treasury debt.  And my experience is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re   holding mortgage-backeds or Treasuries; when you try to sell them off your balance sheet, interest rates go up\u2014it doesn\u2019t matter; people are going to be upset.  So we\u2019re better off with mortgage-backeds because it makes a cleaner line for us to say we are not in that business. I also want to talk about excess reserves and Fed bills.  I think that, as the banking industry itself has learned about excess reserves and the payment of interest, it is learning to arbitrage. From a governance point of view and from a simplicity point of view going forward, if the FOMC were made the party responsible for setting the interest rate on excess reserves, we would set the floor and control the fed funds rate.  You don\u2019t need Fed bills if, in fact, the banking industry has learned how to arbitrage it.  I agree with President Plosser\u2014getting us into issuing bills or in a so-called cooperative relationship with the Treasury, where we\u2019re taking Treasury bills, is a very tenuous path for us to go down, and I\u2019d stay away from it.  I think paying interest on excess reserves would go a long ways to managing our balance sheet, or, I should say, our ability to control the fed funds rate. On the swaps, I understand where they\u2019re coming from on that, and I take that pretty much as a given, but hopefully it will be carefully managed and not easily accessed by the institution that needs it. Thank you", " MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, I want to comment on the additional asset purchases, principally. I fully agree with Governor Warsh\u2014in fact, I think he understated the case, and that is that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s advisable to purchase Treasuries here. I\u2019ve sent a note around about that.  For the record, I just want to repeat some of the arguments in there.  To my knowledge, there is no liquidity problem in the Treasury market.  There are no obvious signs of a breakdown in arbitrage across maturities, unless Trish tells us differently.  The spreads between high-grade private issues and Treasuries do indicate that the markets are not functioning normally\u2014I take that for granted, and you can see it every day\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean that lowering long-term Treasury rates will affect private sector rates.  I do worry about the perception\u2014and it\u2019s palpable\u2014that we will be succumbing to political pressure to monetize the exploding borrowing needs of the Treasury. Trish, you gave us some numbers today\u2014if I add them correctly for the fiscal year 2009, it\u2019s around $2 trillion.  It\u2019s an inordinately large number.  I\u2019m preparing for a trip I am about to make to Asia, and I do think that there\u2019s a lot of sensitivity about this there.  (I\u2019m not sure if that is whom you were referring to in your reference, Governor Warsh.)  If we are viewed as the handmaiden of the Treasury here, I believe you might have a negative reaction, not a positive reaction. If the majority decides in favor of increased purchases, I support respecting President Hoenig\u2019s view.  I would prefer that we purchase GSE securities\u2014the number is somewhat arbitrary, Bill, as you pointed out.  I would do it by size, or at least announce that we could go up to a size. The one thing I would caution against is giving a specific date, unless we are absolutely certain we can meet that date. I want to make a general point here.  There is a lack of confidence in the marketplace.  There was reference to that before; we see it with everybody we talk to.  Confidence is a function of competence, and I think we should exercise our muscle where we have proven ourselves quite competent.  We have proven ourselves quite competent, for example, in the commercial paper market, and we are proving ourselves quite competent in the mortgage-backed securities market.  There\u2019s a question mark out there on the TALF\u2014we\u2019re not quite sure.  And it\u2019s not because thestaff isn\u2019t making a great effort\u2014we\u2019re just going through this new process, and it has become enormously complicated.  I want to play to our comparative advantage.  No question we could buy Treasuries\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue\u2014but I disagree with that for other reasons.  But I would support an expanded program on mortgage-backed securities, because we are competent in performing in that area. On the issue of the swap lines, I agree with the comment that this is procedural.  I think we have to be very clear in expressing this. I do worry that it may become quite evident to some that we\u2019re doing this for one particular institution, and I think you could have retribution in terms of price reaction vis-\u00e0-vis that institution and the rumors about others.  But as long as we keep that in mind and express it clearly, then, were I a voter, I would vote to proceed. On the issue of Fed bills and special Treasury issuance, initially I indicated that I would be against the issuance of Fed bills.  I\u2019m somewhat more enlightened now that the maturity that you described is in terms of one year or less.  I have been worried that a CDS market would develop around the Fed, which would be a negative development, particularly if there was a long maturity.  I still have doubts about the concept.  I\u2019m not as clear in my own mind, as President Hoenig just expressed, as to the alternative, but I do worry about the eventual assumption that we might grow that program rather than rein it back in.  Therefore, if we were to proceed with issuing Fed bills or an alternative, I would want to have a clear sense of provision.  Otherwise, I think the expectation would be that we would continue to expand the program, and, therefore, give rise to these doubts about the further purchase of Treasuries.  Thank you", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I just had a question about the liquidity of the Treasury market.  People have said a couple of times that the Treasury market is really liquid.  I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s all that liquid.  Trish, did you have a comment", " MS. MOSSER. Yes", " MS. MOSSER. That\u2019s a very hard question to answer.  I am concerned that a very small quantity would be seen as ineffective, and part of this is about the announcement effect, not to mention the liquidity effect.  Could it be less than $500 billion. Yes.  We calculated about how much we would have to buy every week, and we\u2019d go in two or three times a week with several billion dollars every time.  So these would be sizable transactions from our perspective.  It could be scaled back a bit, but I wouldn\u2019t want to put it at $100 billion or $200 billion, not over a nine-month period. I\u2019m afraid it wouldn\u2019t be effective", " MR. STERN. Yes. Dave, the Administration has asserted that the fiscal policy package will preserve and/or increase jobs by 3 to 4 million in the next couple of years.  I was trying to figure out from your fiscal policy analysis what the comparable number was.  I couldn\u2019t quite get there, although my rough calculation was maybe 2 or 2\u00bd million", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are more than a year into this recession, and yet the decline in GDP and deterioration in labor markets continue unabated and, indeed, continue to surprise on the downside. While I\u2019m hopeful that our actions and the fiscal stimulus package will help to stabilize the economy in the second half of the year, the downside risks to our forecast remain my primary concern.  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed forecast expects that the unemployment rate will remain well above full employment, and inflation will remain well below my target throughout the forecast horizon.  Indeed, the Boston Fed forecast implies a high probability of a deflationary period if aggressive action is not taken. Concerns with credit availability continue to be a dominant theme when I talk to businesses of all sizes. Lenders are looking for opportunities to tighten terms of lending agreements, and rollover of financing agreements remains problematic.  In anticipation of continuing financing difficulties, firms report that they are restricting operations.  Even organizations that normally would build through a downturn, such as hospitals and major universities, have halted projects, leaving holes and half-finished buildings at many construction sites in Boston. I see several worrisome near-term concerns that are likely to impede more-normal financial market functioning.  First, once we have reworked the initial submissions of the stress tests, the results for several major banks are unlikely to be consistent with public pronouncements by some major banks that additional capital is not necessary.  As our baseline forecast is quickly converging to the stress scenario used in the exercise, there is a real risk of loss of public credibility as it becomes apparent that some large banks will need substantially more capital, which in the current environment can only be supplied by the government.  I am concerned that stock prices and credit markets may suffer additional setbacks and make some of our forecasts for the stock market going forward a little more problematic. Second, the delays in removing problem assets will continue to cast a shadow on many asset prices. We may need to move to simpler, more straightforward solutions for removal of problem assets, possibly in conjunction with the additional equity infusions at the end of the stress tests. Third, like President Lockhart, I\u2019m very worried about the commercial real estate sector, which is rapidly deteriorating. Neither the CMBS market nor banks are likely to provide much support for the rollover of commercial real estate financing.  And I\u2019m increasingly concerned about life insurance companies, which have traditionally been significant investors in commercial real estate, as share prices of the major publicly held life insurers are now for the most part selling at less than one-fifth of what they were six months ago, likely resulting in a limited financial capacity to provide commercial real estate financing.  In addition, the decline in commercial real estate prices is putting many commercial properties under water, adding to financing constraints. While we normally do not consider life insurers to be a source of systemic concerns that would have significant impacts on markets, that assumption may be tested over the course of this year.  Finally, stabilizing the housing sector is critically important.  While a small component of GDP, the impact of housing problems has been disproportionate to its weight in GDP.  Declines in housing prices continue to limit borrowing capacity for households, cause large losses in household wealth that slow future consumption, and contribute to the significant losses embedded in mortgage instruments and related derivative products for a variety of financial intermediaries.  While recently announced federal programs should help, those programs may not fully reflect the new reality that job losses are likely to be the primary reason that borrowers cannot make payments.  We held a mortgage foreclosure event in Hartford, Connecticut last month, attended by roughly 900 borrowers. Discussions with the borrowers at the event, and subsequent survey results, indicate that job losses among one or more family members were already a key driver in pushing borrowers to foreclosure.  Taking aggressive action to stabilize housing and employment may be particularly important at this juncture.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The reports from my contacts have been very weak for months now.  In order to get a better sense of the outlook, I asked some of my contacts some questions focused on whether their responses thus far to the recession have been enough to prepare them for the weakness that they are anticipating in their markets.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of them said that they had not done enough and that they continue to curtail their activities and investments at a very quick pace.  And their confidence in a recovery later on this year is dwindling. I am concerned that this lack of confidence is translating into actions that will further dampen our prospects in coming months.  I was surprised that even some of the more successful manufacturers in my District, such as Eaton, Lincoln Electric, and Parker-Hannifin, are all implementing further cutbacks in investments, hiring, and production plans.  In several cases, these further cutbacks have been motivated by this deepening retrenchment that we are seeing with our foreign partners. But some of my contacts are losing confidence in the policy responses to the recession. Several of my directors noted last week at our meeting that public confidence is obviously critical to our recovery plans, yet the public is increasingly finding the government\u2019s   response confusing and incomplete.  This lack of confidence is weighing on their expectations for growth this year and even next year. Now, my directors are certainly supportive of the actions that the Federal Reserve has taken, particularly the stress-testing that we are doing of banks and the long-term asset purchases.  However, they are concerned that the communications about some of the other government programs\u2014some of the Treasury plans\u2014have been unclear, and, therefore, are hampering the recovery.  Mr. Chairman, I think that your interview on 60 Minutes played a helpful role in clarifying some of these programs, and I did receive many calls from directors and business contacts saying that they thought the interview was well received. Like the staff, I revised down my projection for output and inflation based on the incoming data, and, obviously, the weakening global outlook.  My projection is very much in line with the Greenbook baseline, although in my projection the unemployment rate peaks at 10 percent, because I don\u2019t anticipate as much of a cutback in the participation rate as the Greenbook does. Also, I do think that the outlook calls for a larger policy response.  In my baseline, I\u2019ve incorporated the simulations on additional nontraditional policies.  I know the Greenbook hasn\u2019t, because they are obviously difficult to include in a numeric projection.  But at this point, I have included some of that policy response in my outlook. In my view, the risks remain very much weighted to the downside for both output and inflation. Given the repeated markdowns that we\u2019ve made to our projections, I think more downside misses are likely to make it more difficult to restore confidence that we are dealing with the economic crisis appropriately.  At this point, neither the projections nor any of the anecdotal reports that I have received are likely to make a difference in or shift our policy response. We are in the midst of an economic decline that doesn\u2019t have concrete signs of a  developing recovery. I think we need to react to the current crisis thoroughly, but also with as much as clarity as possible. I know we\u2019ve talked a lot about the focus on our communications of what we are doing. I do think that is critical at this point.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Not surprisingly, my assessment of the economy and the financial sector converges with those that have already been expressed.  So let me just quickly make a few additional observations that support the hypothesis of an even longer period for stabilization and recovery than reflected in the Greenbook forecast and, thus, even greater vulnerability for the economy for some time to come. I begin with an admittedly speculative point about the domestic labor market, but one that complements some earlier comments by Presidents Yellen and Evans.  It appears to me that an unusual number of industries will be undergoing major structural adjustments during the course of this downturn and, as a result, may not rehire at the rate that might be expected in a cyclical rebound. These industries are two groups. One consists of industries like construction and financial services that were directly involved in the asset bubbles associated with the financial crisis. It seems likely that overcapacity in those industries so far exceeded sustainable demand that the post-recession employment profile will be substantially, rather than just moderately, below pre-crisis levels. A second group consists of industries that, even in the middle part of the decade, had seen significant pressure on their business models.  Companies and sectors as diverse as autos, media, legal services, and retail were already in the process of consolidation and/or downsizing. This process has clearly accelerated under the weight of the contraction in real GDP. There are good reasons\u2014anecdotal, I admit, but good reasons, nonetheless\u2014to believe that, to a greater or lesser degree, each of these industries will emerge from this recession permanently leaner than they were, and some may be fundamentally changed.  This observation is, as I noted, to date unsupported by even raw data, much less by systematic comparison with earlier severe recessions.  But if my intuition is buttressed by such an analysis, elevated unemployment levels may be stickier for a longer time than we now anticipate.  The emergence   of new firms and industries that might normally be expected to pick up some of the slack will, at the same time, be hindered by continuing dysfunction in financial markets. I have some very different observations about the international economy, but, I\u2019m afraid, with similar implications for the shape of the GDP growth curve.  The downward revisions of economic performance abroad do not seem to have been met with a sense of policy urgency in many countries, particularly with respect to non-monetary policy measures in the advanced foreign economies.  Indeed, my conclusion from my week in Europe was not dissimilar to that of Governor Warsh. I observed, in addition, that there has been a kind of collective decision among policymakers to put on a relatively happy face publicly, while being unable privately to offer any grounds for optimism.  In formal comments and public utterances, a number of policymakers made reference to wholly adequate stimulus measures.  They discounted the significance of increased bank CDS spreads, or, in at least one case, commented on the wonderful bargains available to those who still had jobs.  This attitude is of particular concern because, as Steve Kamin mentioned, the effects of stimulus measures in many advanced foreign economies are substantially front-loaded into 2009. Whether because of policy paralysis in the face of daunting challenges or, in some cases, because of the weak political circumstances of incumbent governments, too many countries seem unable or unwilling to elevate their responses to rapidly deteriorating conditions.  I worry that a similar hesitancy to take forceful steps could lead to inadequate responses to contingencies, such as widespread banking problems in emerging markets.  An absence of confidence in the political strength of the government can also push officials towards more serious consideration of measures, such as shifts in foreign exchange policies, which may relieve a certain amount of domestic pain by shifting it elsewhere in a neutral or even negative-sum fashion.  My concerns about this issue have increased dramatically in the last week.  Many emerging markets have limited capacity to help themselves, given their own fiscal and monetary constraints. One major exception, of course, is China.  Yet even China seems to be relying in the medium term on a rebound in advanced foreign economies that would restore many of the exports lost in recent months.  While that approach worked well for countries coming out of the Asian financial crisis in 1999, it was built on the strength of largely unaffected American and European economies.  Obviously, demand in our economies will be weak for quite some time.  Moreover, the continued problems in our financial sectors imply that capital flows to emerging markets are unlikely to pick up, as they did following the Asian financial crisis. Despite these impediments to a reasonably fast-paced return to conditions promoting rapid emerging market growth, there\u2019s little indication in China or elsewhere that policymakers have used the crisis to accelerate shifts in their own growth models away from a high level of export dependence. Coupled with what is, at least for the present, a somewhat passive policy instinct in some advanced economies, international developments may, like our domestic employment situation, suggest a more prolonged and shaky recovery period.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. MADIGAN.5  As indicated by the Greenbook and by your discussion this morning, the economic outlook has deteriorated markedly over the intermeeting period. At the same time, the options for applying additional stimulus quickly appear limited.  It now seems likely that the TALF will lift off only slowly.  And prospects for the enactment of additional fiscal stimulus, at least in the near term, appear dim. In these circumstances, consideration of further monetary stimulus through large-scale asset purchases would seem to be warranted.  The Bluebook presented two policy alternatives, A and B, that involved additional asset purchases and one, alternative C, that would not involve further stimulative measures.  I will focus my remarks this morning on alternatives A and B.  This morning, we have proposed revisions to the draft statements; the revised statements are provided in the package that was distributed to you earlier labeled \u201cMaterial for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.\u201d I will begin with alternative A, on page 2.  Under this alternative, the rationale section\u2014paragraphs 1 and 2\u2014would note that the economy is undergoing a severe contraction and that the near-term economic outlook has worsened.  It would point to a number of indicators of the economic weakness.  Paragraph 1 would end on a note of some optimism by stating that the policy actions taken to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth.  Paragraph 2 would note the Committee\u2019s expectation that inflation will remain subdued, dropping the phrase \u201cin coming quarters\u201d that was used in the January statement, consistent with a view that inflation could be low for some time.  Indeed, it would again cite \u201csome risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.\u201d  As President Fisher noted, the rationale section provides a rather downbeat reading on the economy, but perhaps one that is realistic. In the policy paragraph, alternative A would again indicate the Committee\u2019s intention to employ all available tools.  It says that the Committee will hold the federal funds rate range at 0 to \u00bc percent and indicates an expectation that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate \u201cfor an extended period.\u201d This phrase would suggest a longer interval than the phrase \u201cfor some time\u201d used in January and suggested for alternative B.  To provide additional economic stimulus, the Committee would take three policy actions under alternative A: increasing the amount of its agency MBS purchases by $500 billion to a total of $1 trillion this year; increasing the amount of its purchases of agency debt securities by $100 billion to a total of $200 billion this year (the boost to agency debt purchases is an addition relative to the alternative presented in the Bluebook); and initiating purchases of longer-term Treasury securities that are to total $300 billion over the next six months. This paragraph would also note that the TALF has been launched.  The statement would conclude by indicating that the Committee will be carefully monitoring the System\u2019s balance sheet and by suggesting some predilection toward stepping up its balance sheet expansion by noting that \u201cit will be assessing whether a faster pace of asset purchases would be helpful in improving credit market conditions and supporting economic activity.\u201d  A possible downside of including such language is that it suggests a possible course of action that the Committee may end up not pursuing. Alternative B, on the next page, begins with a rationale section, paragraphs 1 and 2, that is identical to that proposed for alternative A.  However, under alternative B, the Committee would not initiate purchases of Treasury securities.  Rather, it would more than double its purchases of agency MBS securities, to a total of $1.25 trillion this year, and double its purchases of agency debt securities to $200 billion.  This alternative would not include anything comparable with the final clause of alternative A indicating that the Committee was inclined to further step up its asset purchases. In summary, alternative A would constitute a somewhat more aggressive expansion of the FOMC\u2019s asset purchases than alternative B.  The differences in terms of total asset purchases are small:  Alternative A would commit to an expansion of your asset purchases by a total of $900 billion, whereas the increase under alternative B would be just slightly less, at $850 billion.  However, as I noted, the language of alternative A would be more forward-leaning with respect to possible future increases in asset purchases.  And the initiation of Treasury purchases might suggest to market participants that the Committee\u2019s operations could be expanded particularly in that direction in the future. The key difference between alternative A and alternative B really is whether or not to purchase Treasury securities.  To review the arguments for and against such purchases, you might be inclined to proceed with purchases of longer-term Treasury securities if you: believe that the economic situation had deteriorated so substantially that you did want to apply \u201call available tools\u201d as indicated in your previous statement; feel that it might be helpful to diversify the tools that you are applying to the situation; believe that purchasing Treasury securities rather than private securities is preferable to minimize the Federal Reserve\u2019s involvement in credit allocation; or think it might be easier to unwind in the future holdings of Treasury securities than   holdings of private securities such as MBS, which might be less liquid or might be seen in the future as tied particularly to primary mortgage market conditions. On the other hand, you might be inclined not to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if: you think that purchases of private securities such as MBS would more effectively improve conditions in private credit markets and thus provide better support to private spending; or you are concerned that market participants might believe that you are monetizing the federal debt, a perception that might lead to adverse effects on term premiums or, perhaps, on inflation expectations. Under alternative C, page 4, the Committee would make no adjustment to the policy tools that it is already implementing, and it would not reference any modification to the Federal Reserve\u2019s liquidity programs other than those that have been previously announced.  Instead, the statement would indicate that the Committee decided to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to \u00bc percent and indicate that it continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.  The second paragraph would note that the near-term economic outlook is poor but indicate that the Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, subject to significant downside risks.  The final paragraph of the announcement would note the range of policy actions that are already in train. The Bluebook also presented an alternative structure for the FOMC statement, based on a suggestion provided by President Bullard.  Applying that structure to alternative A, and incorporating this morning\u2019s suggested revisions to the policy actions, is shown on page 5 as alternative A\u2032. A\u2032 is substantively the same as A, but it reorders the statement such that the Committee\u2019s actions are presented first.  In particular, the first sentence of the statement indicates that \u201cThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet further by purchasing $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months and by acquiring an additional $500 billion of agency MBS and $100 billion of agency debt securities this year.\u201d Obviously, this approach gives greater prominence not only to the actions themselves but also to their effect on the Committee\u2019s balance sheet.  Conversely, this approach gives less prominence to the very downbeat summary of the economic situation in paragraphs 2 and 3, a possible advantage of this approach. However, the flow of the statement may be seen as a bit less logical, in that it presents the Committee\u2019s actions before discussing the economic conditions that motivated them. Alternatives B\u2032 and C\u2032, pages 6 and 7, apply the same structure to alternatives B and C. The final three sections of the package provide draft directives for the three basic alternatives and their primed variants", " MR. EVANS. Is it likely that the Committee would be willing to see this as large enough to put us in a good position and we\u2019d just wait for confirmation of the outlook.  Are we even close to that", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Do you think the front-loading is more important than the announcement effect", " MS. MOSSER. Yes", " MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I raised some issues yesterday about asset purchases and policy. I think some of the things that remain questions for our policies going forward include, for example: How do we evaluate the merits of the various programs we have. What are the tradeoffs.  Which ones work best.  Which ones don\u2019t.  How do we equate the programs at the margin to get the most bang for the buck as we use our balance sheet. I think a lot of the discussion yesterday about Treasuries versus MBS had a mixed tone to it, in the sense that part of it was a desire to use monetary expansion to support the economy at large, while some people wanted to use the asset purchases for liquidity purposes or to bring mortgage rates down or to target credit market interventions in certain markets.  Certainly, part of the debate about whether to use Treasuries or MBS depended on which side of that fence you were on. So I think we still have some work to do about deciding the policy mix. But I\u2019m going to throw a monkey wrench in the works.  Yesterday the Chairman asked for alternative ways of saying some of this.  One of the issues we discussed, and it came out, I think, loud and clear, was that there\u2019s a lot of concern about the path of policy.  When we  announce policy actions\u2014whether they be the TALF, MBS, or what have you\u2014we tend to announce them as quantities.  As a result, it\u2019s not very clear what happens when that quantity is reached. What happens after that.  What will be the next market.  What will happen going forward.  I think there\u2019s an argument that conducting policy in that manner creates a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace about what\u2019s going to come next.  Are they going to do it again. And, if so, how big would that be.  Another issue when we target specific volumes is that the conditionality of those interventions doesn\u2019t come through very clearly.  It may seem that we are going to do the $500 billion no matter what else happens. So President Bullard and I\u2014I\u2019m going to implicate him as well\u2014wondered, \u201cWell, is there another way to do this that might be helpful.\u201d  We put together a new version of the statement, with the idea that we want to get beyond just announcing one-off programs that we may or may not do again and move toward thinking about saying that we\u2019re going to have a plan to increase the size of the balance sheet or increase the size of certain components of the balance sheet over a period of time, and that we\u2019ll adjust those growth rates, if you will, as needed, as the economy either worsens or improves. The proposed wording was passed around\u2014we\u2019ve called it alternative B\u2032\u2032.6  The idea here was to address the question, \u201cOkay, how else could we communicate to the markets about what our plan is.\u201d  Paragraph 1 basically becomes, \u201cThe Federal Open Market Committee decided today to continue to increase the Federal Reserve balance sheet through the purchase of agency MBS and Treasury securities.  The Committee expects the growth rate of the MBS and Treasury components of the balance sheet combined to average about 10 percent a month.  The Committee will carefully monitor macroeconomic and financial conditions and adjust this rate of expansion as warranted.\u201d 6 The statement distributed by Mr. Plosser is appended to this document (appendix 6).Now, we came up with 10 percent a month.  Basically, that would get us to the $1 trillion over the course of the year, which we were talking about yesterday.  It\u2019s ambiguous about whether it ends up being Treasuries or MBS.  It then says we will carefully monitor this expansion at each meeting and adjust it as we deem appropriate\u2014if we need to ramp it up, we can do that, and if we want to bring it down, we can bring it down.  The rest of the statement is pretty much the same as the original.  We took the rest of what was paragraph 1 and made it paragraph 2, which is basically a discussion of the TALF and the other programs that we\u2019ve initiated. So it is the same there, and the rest of the statement basically follows B.  Again, our view is that we were looking for a way to get us out of thinking about one-off programs or volumes of purchases that we\u2019re going to make, and instead we were trying to set a target or objective for a growth rate of some set of quantities.  I think there can be debate about whether it should be Treasuries plus MBS. I think President Lacker would probably prefer it to be targeting the base to get the same outcome. But we wanted to put this on a table as kind of a straw man to get the Committee thinking a little bit about different ways to help us manage expectations better.  It\u2019s also contingent on economic conditions, which we think is important. So, Mr. Chairman, I know we surprised you with this, but you asked us this question, so we thought we\u2019d try to come up with an alternative that\u2019s worth discussing", " MR. LACKER. I am not sure I understand one point about this.  Presidents Bullard and Plosser propose a geometric path.  But why not pick an endpoint and go linearly to that.  That is what we are doing with the MBS so far. Doesn\u2019t that make more sense.  We could still call that 10 percent per month", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. First, Trish and Spence, would you folks think about a sentence that could be added to one of the directives, to the effect that \u201cThe Desk will strive to ensure that the monetary base\u201d or \u201cthe size of the portfolio,\u201d or something like that, \u201chas a positive monthly growth rate,\u201d or whatever you think would be realistic or manageable.  We don\u2019t want to put in something that, just for operational reasons, doesn\u2019t work", "MR. HOENIG. Thank you. As we talk about this statement, I think it\u2019s sadly ironic that, after we\u2019ve doubled the size of our balance sheet, we\u2019re having a conversation about being worried that it may shrink a little bit.  It\u2019s incredible to me that we would have that.  And I agree with what Governor Kohn said in that I don\u2019t think we should start talking 10 percent monthly growth or whatever it is. We\u2019re trying to deal with a broken intermediation and banking system at the same time, and I don\u2019t think we can turn it into a monetary policy instrument in terms of how much we expect the balance sheet to grow at this point. With that, I would say I am much more in favor of statement B as we had it.  I would admit that the banking system is broken.  That\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re doing the TALF.  If we\u2019re going to expand and we\u2019re going to address the broken intermediation process, we should focus on mortgage-backeds.  That\u2019s what the idea was to begin with.  Let\u2019s stick with it. If we now introduce Treasuries into that (1) I think it\u2019s only going to be confusing, and (2) I think we do have to look long term. Our introducing purchases of longer-term securities farther along the yield curve sets a precedent, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy to back off from that once we get through this mess we\u2019re in right now.  So that\u2019s why I prefer B. I also want to take just a minute and talk about the legacy TALF.  There\u2019s reference to populist reaction to this, and I actually think that this reaction is justified in important ways.  We ought to think about that, because people are now confused between TARP and TALF, and I think when we add the legacy TALF, it\u2019s going to confuse things even more.  The reason that they\u2019re reacting to it is TARP.  I agree that it was necessary to keep from having a meltdown, but the execution of it was so confusing and so inequitable across the system that it created great backlash. Some of the backlash was very justified\u2014for example, when you have some banks being told, \u201cYou\u2019re going to take it,\u201d and a thousand other banks being told, \u201cYou can beg for  it,\u201d and following that up with changing the rules, you\u2019re not going to get anything but a backlash. I think that\u2019s important to keep in mind. So as we think about going forward, I come back to President Fisher\u2019s point about needing a decision tree on how we\u2019re going to deal with these legacy assets.  Our getting involved in the legacy TALF, as I\u2019ve heard it described to this point, is, I think, very risky\u2014very dangerous, almost\u2014in terms of what the outcomes might be, because there aren\u2019t clear, defined decision trees indicating who\u2019s really going to be accountable for what.  We need to get that clarified before we have another reaction like the one we had recently. Finally, I do want to come back to something Governor Kohn mentioned yesterday in reference to my comment about using excess reserves to help manage the balance sheet and set the rate floor.  I know that it got off to a rough start, but I think we are getting our sea legs and the industry is getting their sea legs.  If we start issuing Fed bills, I think we are introducing another tool that will start out with the best intentions, but expectations will be raised, how we use it will be brought into account, questions will arise about trying to get around debt ceilings and so forth. I think we should try to avoid that if we can and see if we can use our interest on excess reserves as a management tool.  So with those comments, I\u2019ll again say I\u2019d go with B.  Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. President Evans", " MR. KOHN. I think what I heard around the table, Mr. Chairman, was not much confidence that market forces are moving in that direction and might even be moving in the other direction", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

But if that would suffice, we think that would work best from our perspective"], "2009FOMC20090429meeting.txt": ["  MR. ROSENGREN. I have a question on the mortgage-backed-security purchase program, in particular looking at figure 13 and figure 14.  Figure 13 shows that the mortgage rates have come down as you discussed, and what\u2019s striking to me is that it looks as though we accounted for roughly 80 percent of the issuance of mortgage-backed securities over the first four months of the year.  If we had been willing to buy 100 percent of the issuance, I assume that we would have been a price setter in that market and we would have had the ability to push rates even further down. So my question is, (A) Is that accurate, and (B) if our guidance to the Desk was to try to get the retail rate between 4 and 4\u00bc percent, do you think we would be able to do that for the new issuance.  As you\u2019ve highlighted, we account for most of the coupon purchases between 4 and 5 percent. So if, instead, we had instructions that we\u2019re really intending to try to get that rate down, would you be able to hit it", "MS. MOSSER. In the short run, they probably take some capital gains, in point of fact.  The big question is when they would come back and how quickly.  The experience of central banks completely taking over markets to the point that the market is effectively shut except for what the central bank is buying is not so pretty from a liquidity standpoint.  For example, in Japan it took a year and a half to get their money market to work again in any kind of normal way, and that was a money market, not a relatively complex product like MBS. I think the big question is, if we completely dominate the trading in this market, we can probably set whatever price we want, but if there are no other buyers that will complicate things for the originators in the following sense.  Originators will have to be very certain about how much we\u2019re going to buy, the price, and the point at which we\u2019re going to exit.  As long as they\u2019re very certain about the price and we buy absolutely everything, they\u2019ll have no problem originating at low rates. But the minute there\u2019s any hint that we\u2019re not going to buy every last dollar, there\u2019s uncertainty about what they can sell to someone else.  At that point it\u2019s going to be much harder for them to hedge their pipeline, and the spread between the secondary rate and the primary rate may be wider.  So I think there\u2019s a concern that perhaps the spread could widen out despite our best efforts to drag the secondary rate down.  The short story is that there is a bit of a tradeoff between how low we can push the secondary-market rate and how much we want to preserve some liquidity in the market so that we have an exit strategy", " MS. PIANALTO. Mr. Chairman, this obviously may be an issue for discussion in the policy go-round. But if there is a lack of confidence that we can expand our balance sheet with the TALF program, at what point do we talk about other ways to accomplish this.  Thank you", "  MR. KOHN. So move", " MR. MADIGAN. I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u201cpush through", "\u201d   MR. LACKER. Well, they are holding reserve balances of $800 billion, $900 billion, plus $1.2 trillion in the stuff that is kind of a perfect substitute for it.  We are going to make reserves bigger than that sum.  So something has to give, and we struggle with what that is going to be and what kind of stimulative effect that might have", " MR. MADIGAN. I think the question is whether the banking system as a whole is acting as though it\u2019s constrained by capital and whether we expect that it will continue.  Now, we certainly think that that\u2019s the case.  Bank credit overall is contracting pretty markedly, and of course, we all know about very low bank share prices and the difficulties in raising capital.  So I think the implicit assumption here is that, at least for some time going forward, the banking sector as a whole will remain capital constrained.  I agree that there is some scope for shifting  credit around among banks, but at least the current experience with the behavior of banks strongly suggests that the system as a whole is constrained", " MS. MOSSER. They can simply buy it and hold it, but that doesn\u2019t show up in the reported funds rate. The reported federal funds rate that you see every day is on the broker trading volume, and the vast majority of the people who bother to trade are the GSEs", " MR. BURKE. The GSEs are selling fed funds, and banks are buying them, holding them, and arbitraging the rate as you\u2019re suggesting. But roughly speaking, 80 percent of the brokered volume that we\u2019re seeing in fed funds is GSE sales.  So in terms of what we\u2019re seeing as actual rates being reported and why those rates are where they are, I believe it\u2019s a function of  GSEs  selling and banks buying, where banks buy at 15 and hold at 25 and make that arbitrage.  But that doesn\u2019t answer the question of why more banks aren\u2019t buying more and then lending and making an even bigger spread.  The anecdotal evidence that the Desk has gotten from the banks is that it\u2019s a leverage ratio constraint", " MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions, but first, I want to thank the staff for a very careful, thorough investigation of the role of inflation expectations in the simulations, and the simulations in general.  I don\u2019t think this is a very important issue for today, but in terms of the modeling strategy, I was somewhat surprised about the way that you came out in favor of the adaptive expectations for modeling medium- or long-term inflation expectations.  Especially at a time when we\u2019re concerned about the possibilities that our extraordinary monetary expansions might make some people uncomfortable with the expectations, I thought that you would at least have a channel in there that we could activate and see how that affectsthings. As I say, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really very important for discussion today, but it will be as we start going forward on that.  I don\u2019t know if you want to comment", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. I think we made a change, as you\u2019ve said, this time.  We also said in the memo that we were continuing to work on it.  We are definitely leaving it open.  I hope it was clear from the memo where we are.  We\u2019re very uncertain about it, and at the moment we have a number of people working on trying to figure out a new way.  There are a couple of things. First, I suspect that you probably will be changing things over time.  Where we locked it in this time is just for the moment. Second, I assume that, as we go forward, we will continue to do the sort of thing we\u2019ve done in the past, which is to present you with alternative ways of thinking and alternative ways of how this might play out.  Even when we\u2019re through the episode, we probably won\u2019t be able to tell exactly what truth is.  But certainly as we\u2019re going through the episode and we definitely don\u2019t know what truth is, we\u2019re going to provide alternatives", " MR. STOCKTON.  You are correct.  It doesn\u2019t. We\u2019re using several imperfect measures of financial stress to fix a misspecified model.  So the exact kinds of concern that you have about the bank channel into overall lending and spending are really missing from the staff\u2019s large-scale model. What we\u2019re trying to do is gauge some of these imperfect measures\u2014first, from some measures from the capital markets and principal components of various measures of volatility, spreads, and so forth and, second, from the principal components of the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  We\u2019re still going to have to apply a lot of additional judgment to the forecast going forward as we see bank lending conditions changing in ways that maybe those measures are not capturing. I just think this is just one additional area that we\u2019re going to be struggling with going forward", " MR. ROSENGREN. There have been some initial signs that the recession may be approaching a trough.  It is too soon to tell whether the trough of the recession has truly been reached. Whenever we do reach the trough, the economic recovery is likely to be anemic.  Consumers have experienced significant wealth loss despite the rebound in the stock market since March, and consumption is likely to be restrained by further job losses.  The rising fraction of homeowners who find themselves underwater makes it difficult for them to move around, and unless job prospects improve, they are going to have a difficult time moving.  These continued constraints in the recovery have influenced my forecast for the economy.  I expect unemployment to peak somewhat higher than in the Greenbook and improvements in the labor market to be more gradual than in the Greenbook.  The significant slack in the labor markets will continue to place a lot of downward pressure on inflation, and there remains a significant risk that deflation will not be avoided. I continue to believe that the risks around this outlook remain on the downside.  My primary concerns are that the reaction to the stress test is unpredictable.  Contacts through the AMLF have noted that they are concerned that the stress test could lead to downgrades in asset-backed commercial paper to below the A1/P1, rendering them ineligible for the AMLF program.  In addition, they note that money market funds have been more transparent with their public holdings so that there could be another surge in redemptions for money market funds that hold   paper and for banks that perform poorly on the stress test.  Second, I have my own concerns about the results of the stress test. President Evans\u2019s question highlighted that institutions undergoing the stress test may behave more as if they are capital constrained than they would in the absence of the stress test. I share that concern.  I think there is a very strong desire right now to avoid government capital infusions, and that desire seems to only be growing. Even banks that do not have the mandatory convertible preferred (MCP) are likely to be affected. Banks outside the 19 banks undergoing the stress test will pursue the same conservative asset-producing strategies, concerned that the same criteria might be applied to them.  Among the 19 that will not need the MCP, it may be rational to slow their own organic growth so that they can take advantage of asset sales or acquisition opportunities.  If I am right and the structure of the stress-test program discourages the expansion of lending, all business lending, particularly commercial real estate lending, could be adversely affected.  Contacts with insurance firms note that insurance regulators have not made clear how they will react to FASB rules on valuing illiquid assets. This uncertainty may cause insurance companies to further shrink their balance sheets at the same time that banks are doing the same thing.  Thus, although there have been some positive signs on the economy since the last FOMC meeting, I remain concerned that the financial headwinds may not have abated yet.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  MR. HOENIG. Let me start with the District, and I\u2019ll be brief.  I have talked to several dozen people in the region, and I have not had a single one tell me that they think things are improving.  But what I do hear is that things are not getting any worse except for a couple of areas. One of those areas is natural gas production, which if those rigs are moving your way, I\u2019d look at them pretty carefully before I put them in production, given the price of natural gas right now. The other is commercial real estate. There is a lot of angst about commercial real estate in the region. It is under pressure. Projects are on hold and have been stopped.  A lot of banks are holding this stuff, and a lot of them have pretty heavy concentrations of it, which gives me pause.  On the other hand, when they say things are not getting worse, there are some indications of manufacturing beginning to stabilize, some retail sales beginning to stabilize, and even some of the housing, even though it is down from a year ago, in the last couple of months has shown some stability as well in the region. About the national outlook\u2014I think that, as we go through the rest of this year and into next year, we will see things improve.  There are a couple of positive forces and then one thing that I consider a real negative.  The two positives are that, as we see inventories and values adjust, people then will begin to move forward.  Complementing that is the fact that the stimulus package is starting to flow.  We\u2019re seeing a lot of highway projects really getting going, especially in our region.  The one thing that I find interesting is the value of subsidies because, as the ethanol industry is collapsing, we are now in the wind tunnel\u2014seeing enormous amounts of investment on wind energy being placed there.  There is no way to get it out yet, but they are building these towers by the thousands, and that is adding a lot of activity in the rural areas, particularly of our region.The negative is the credit and banking conditions.  There is a fair amount of capital in these banks, but when you see their asset issues and their uncertainty around those assets, they are conserving that capital and they are holding back on lending.  Another part of this is, as we have introduced each new plan\u2014whether it was the PPIP or whatever\u2014money has gone to the sidelines to see how that is going to evolve.  That has made things slower than they might have otherwise been, and I think we need to be aware of that. As you boil all of this down, I think the stimulus will be a big plus as we move through this year and into next.  As we stabilize, there\u2019s a real upside, but the credit market banking level is a big risk going forward. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve begun at all to address the commercial real estate problems that are just wreaking havoc.  Thank you", "  [Laughter] MR. STOCKTON. As you know, there are areas of missing data in this advance estimate.  In two areas, the BEA wrote down assumptions for the March missing data that are different from ours. One is imports, for which it wrote down a weaker figure for March than we are, and the other is inventories, for which it wrote down a weaker March figure than we are.  The GDP consequences of those two different assumptions, in fact, are just about offsetting.  We would be inclined to stick with our estimate at this point.  We don\u2019t really think that the BEA  knows anything more than we do about those particular pieces of data.  But, sticking with our assumptions, the consequences for the top line would be roughly offsetting.  Finally, on prices, you can see that the BEA is a little lower on core prices\u20140.2 percentage point lower\u2014than our Greenbook estimate.  I don\u2019t think we would have any reason to second-guess them on that.  So that is the end of the report, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, listening to your presentation and some of the discussions yesterday, I am a little confused about the way the policy options are presented. I know there will be a discussion about the rate of purchases, but it does seem as though the policies that we are implementing, as I was talking about with Vice Chairman Dudley beforehand, have a cliff-like nature to them in the sense that we have a pace for purchases and then we\u2019re just going to stop under the current implementation by the Desk.  The Desk, I suppose, is charged with the responsibility of inferring a path that the Committee hasn\u2019t really specified, and it feels very incomplete.  We are almost surely locking ourselves into a future action in order to smooth that cliff-like purchase behavior, which we just haven\u2019t discussed.  I am not saying that I disagree with any of that, but it feels different from the way we have always talked about the funds rate policy in the past, when we could take an action and choose to not do that the next time.  There seem to be future ramifications from these actions.  So do we leave it to the Desk to infer how to implement the additional, say, $300 billion of Treasury purchases as opposed to telling them that, in addition, there is a plan that, if this is the entire amount to be done, it should tail off in some smooth fashion", " MS. MOSSER. I showed the average. Our dealer survey had an average of the program that the sizes total to approximately $500 billion, but their estimates there are quite skewed.  A number of individuals expect that the program will be $750 billion, along the lines of what it is in alternative A. In fact, I would also say that, in the dealer survey, we asked economists for their opinions. If we asked the Treasury traders for their opinions, I think we would probably get an average or a median expectation that the Treasury program would be even larger than $500 billion. But it is the one program that all market participants say will be both extended, partly because its terminal date is earlier than the mortgage and agency one, and expanded by a sizable amount", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I have just one small comment.  I appreciate your doing what I asked, which is to work in advance and provide a concrete alternative, which I think is very helpful. I have a question about B\u2032\u2032 versus B\u2032\u2032\u2032\u2014the 18 to 20 percent versus the $160 billion per month.  I think a problem with the 18 to 20 percent is, of course, that if we follow our plan, a week from now we\u2019ll be announcing 15 to 18 percent or something, and that could be misconstrued as a change in our strategy.  It isn\u2019t quite as transparent in that respect.  So in doing this, my inclination would be to go with the dollar number.  But I just raise that point", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. It would do less, though, to bring down mortgage rates.  So it really depends a little on why you are purchasing the Treasuries. Are you purchasing the Treasuries to bring down mortgage rates, or are you purchasing Treasuries to steepen the yield curve", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.  I think doing it means that you like what you\u2019ve done. You want to do more, and it opens the door for doing even more at subsequent meetings", "   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I think part of the confusion here is that we do a program and the market is also evaluating whether the program is effective, and then how are we going to react to the perception of the effectiveness of the program.  So if we do a program and the market responds in the way that we want the market to respond, the market participants are going to assume that, gee, it worked pretty well for the Federal Reserve, so of course the Federal Reserve is likely to want to do more of it.  Their view is conditioned not just on the macroeconomic outlook but also on how the markets respond to the program.  In this particular case of the Treasury securities, I think that the market expects that the program is going to be expanded because (1) we did expand the MBS purchase program and so they\u2019ve already seen that, when the market seems to get the desired response, the Fed has responded by increasing the size of the program and (2) they\u2019ve seen that the Treasury program seems to have worked in the desired way that we intended. So all of those things point to an expectation that they expect the program to be expanded", " MR. LOCKHART. By emphasizing, as the Chairman just did, the ability to increase, slow down, extend, and so forth, it sounds to me like a very tactical approach.  The directives that come every six or seven weeks from the Committee, are they a mode of guidance to the Desk that\u2019s going to be enough for you to interpret how to make those adjustments, or are we talking about a more frequent consultation with the Committee in order to be able to respond tactically", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had hoped that the actions taken at the last meeting would have had a larger impact on long-term rates, particularly the 30-year fixed mortgage rate. Our rates may fall further as the backlogs at mortgage brokers subside.  I\u2019d like to encourage the Desk to consider what additional institutional feature might facilitate pushing mortgage rates down further faster using markets in which we don\u2019t have much experience.  As Trish highlighted in yesterday\u2019s discussion, there are a number of things that we don\u2019t directly affect, but we may be able to affect them indirectly.  In fact, that may be more efficient than increasing purchases\u2014to think about some of those institutional features and whether we can help adjust them. In terms of the policy options, I prefer alternative B.  I\u2019d like to understand better the effect of existing programs before deciding what additional actions are necessary.  If our mortgage-backed-security purchase program is successful in significantly lowering mortgage rates, that may have the stimulative effect we desire.  However, even if that program is successful, the Bluebook simulations as well as those done by my staff make it clear that the optimal policy simulation would indicate that further actions are necessary.  Like President   Yellen\u2019s, my forecast remains far from the goal for either inflation or unemployment.  So the question for me is, What is the most effective way to try to get closer to achieving those goals. It\u2019s not clear to me right now what the most effective use of our balance sheet is if the goal is to reduce borrowing costs to consumers and businesses.  I\u2019m a little uncertain whether that\u2019s through more large Treasury purchases, whether that\u2019s more actions in the TALF, or whether that\u2019s doing something different in the mortgage market.  Thinking that through might be more useful than expanding our balance sheet further at this time.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. STERN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Well, on the consideration of A versus B, I prefer B for several reasons, which I will try to summarize quickly.  First of all, I do think the economic outlook has improved a bit.  Maybe it will turn out to be a false dawn, but maybe it will continue to improve.  We will just have to see how that goes.  More important, I think that policy has already done a lot, if you take a broad range of things that we have been engaged in and have introduced since the fall of \u201907. That is not to say that we can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t do more, if appropriate, but I think we need to bear in mind that we have been aggressive and reasonably timely, certainly over the last year or more.  And I am not sure that there is all that much more we can do with regard to the outcomes associated with the dual mandate between now and the end of 2011\u2014two and a half years. I am just not persuaded that a lot more activity on our part is going to have a major effect on how those numbers are going to look over that time frame.  I also am a little concerned, or I wonder, whether we would continue to get a lot of bang from increased asset purchases along the lines that we seem to think we have had so far.  This can\u2019t be a free lunch. At some point, there have to be both a diminishing response in the market and increasing risks of adverse consequences for inflation or other things going forward.  I think we need to bear that in mind, if and when we decide that we want to scale these things up even further. So for those reasons, at this time, I favor alternative B.  As far as language is concerned, I would be equally happy with B or B\u2032\u2032\u2032. I think either of those is fine, and I do think that tying our policy more explicitly to our inflation objective, along the lines that President Fisher or President Plosser suggested, would be constructive for the reasons they suggested.  Thank you", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have some sympathy with President Yellen\u2019s case for expanded purchases, but I think that we have to recognize that these purchase programs have costs as well as benefits.  Speaking for myself, I would really feel more comfortable if we had a more formal evaluation of what those costs and benefits were regarding what we have done up to now. One cost that I don\u2019t think we have ruminated on very much is the interest rate risk that we are actually taking on the Fed\u2019s portfolio.  One thing I have wondered about is, if the balance sheet were to get $6 trillion and most of that was Treasuries and MBS, what would happen if short-term rates rose above the yield on our portfolio.  What would happen if we were asking the Treasury to pay us money because we had negative interest.  In a way, we are turning ourselves into a kind of S&L in terms of our balance sheet structure, and we really need to think about what the implications of that are for the medium and longer term.  So I would encourage the staff to do analysis on those kinds of issues for the June meeting. The second reason that I don\u2019t think it is appropriate to do it right now is that it would send an odd signal to the market.  We are saying that things are better, yet we feel the need to  expand our purchase programs in a way in which the market was not anticipating us to do.  So I think it would be a little confusing to the market.  I think the market is expecting us to do something in June about Treasuries because of the cliff question.  In other words, what happened.  It is a six-month program.  The market is going to start looking ahead to what happens at the end. We need to do more to get clear on how we think about these cliff effects.  It is not quite the same as the federal funds rate because you could argue that ending the purchase program is de facto tightening.  You are taking away something that is pushing down rates, so I don\u2019t think it is quite the same as specifying the federal funds rate path.  It is a lot different, too, because there is so little experience with it.  We have had many, many economic cycles in which to get a sense of the federal funds rate\u2014you know, market prices, futures expectations, et cetera\u2014but I think we need to do some more work on this whole cliff effect.  I think the market implicitly assumes that we are going to taper off and smooth the rough edges.  I notice that, in the balance sheet simulations that were put forward yesterday, it went to the end and just ended abruptly. I don\u2019t think that is really what the market expectation is.  I think they expect us to round those off. But we haven\u2019t really discussed that formally as a group, and we need to come to some conclusions on that. As far as the choices for the statement, I favor the B alternatives\u2014you know, B\u2032, B\u2032\u2032, and B\u2032\u2032\u2032. I am not sure what is gained by the added details.  The market participants can already calculate the monthly purchase rates by just taking what we have announced about duration and magnitude.  I also think that writing down specific monthly purchase rates implies that the growth rate of the balance sheet is the prime metric driving our thought process.  I don\u2019t really think that is right. We are really thinking more about the effect on financial conditions.  And I don\u2019t think a dollar of Treasury purchases is necessarily the same as a dollar of agency purchases   or agency MBS or some other things that we are doing with our balance sheet.  So I don\u2019t want to suggest that a dollar of the balance sheet is created equal across all our different facilities.  Finally, if we added some more detail, it would be a little confusing to people because they would say, \u201cWell, why are they telling us this now.  Why didn\u2019t they tell us this a meeting ago, two meetings ago, or three meetings ago.\u201d  So I think it would be more confusing than illuminating to the markets.  Thank you", " MR. PLOSSER. My concern was that we wanted to link our policy actions that we believe are consistent with our objective of price stability.  Mr. Chairman, your suggestion doesn\u2019t link the two necessarily. It just places it in a context.  I am struggling a bit with what the right language might be", " MR. LACKER. The word \u201csomewhat\u201d in the first sentence just snags my brain", " MR. FISHER. I am concerned about the releasing of names and Don\u2019s point, that you can\u2019t renege on assumptions and promises made earlier.  Tactically, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re planning to say next week, but I would rather be viewed as being forced to do this rather than suggesting it terms of releasing names prospectively going forward because one of the great concerns is\u2014we\u2019ve seen this with the TALF and with the PPIP and everything else\u2014the rules keep changing. I don\u2019t want to be viewed as one of the agents of changing the rules in a way that upsets people who have banked on us to be a steady institution.  I would just suggest that we be very careful about that and think that through.  Now, the Congress has its prerogatives.  I\u2019m not sure we want to feed that one. I would rather almost be in a responsive mode. I am a little worried that, if we don\u2019t respond sufficiently, they could be extremely harsh, and maybe\u2014Don, you summarized an awful lot there.  We were talking about feeding the monsters of the market earlier.  Feeding the monsters of the Congress is also saying that you can never really satisfy them.  I\u2019m not calling them monsters for the record, but they have a voracious appetite. I would be really careful on this business of suggesting that we release names.  If we\u2019re viewed as the one who suggested it, it might upset the people whom we serve and who are important to our ability to function.  So I\u2019d just ask you to consider that. The other obvious trap\u2014and I saw this on the visiting committee overseeing Harvard\u2019s investment debacle\u2014whenever you talk about what you\u2019re spending on something in the private sector, it\u2019s always going to be too much.  So just get ready for that one because you can\u2019t satisfy people very easily on that. It is always too big a dollar amount.  But that\u2019s obvious"], "2009FOMC20090603confcall.txt": ["   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I talked to the senior people from S&P this morning about this issue. What is happening is that they are changing their methodology, so the actual credit quality of the CMBS tranches that we are talking about isn\u2019t changing; it is really that they are changing how they characterize them.  And we are going to have to make a decision, frankly.  If their characterization is way outside what we think is appropriate, we may want to modify our criteria. For example, let\u2019s imagine a situation in which there are five rating agencies, and four rank a given tranche triple-A, and S&P is the outlier.  If we really judge that the outlier is inappropriate\u2014in other words, that there isn\u2019t a lot of credit risk associated with that tranche\u2014 we might want to change our criteria to allow one exception among the credit-rating agencies.  So that is something that we are going to have to evaluate.  We are going to have to see what they do and then (1) evaluate what that means for the size of the eligible market and (2) consider what it means, if we modified the criteria, in terms of what sort of credit risk we would be actually taking. So we are going to have to wait and see what they actually do in terms of what the impact is and then feed that into what is appropriate for the program.  But it is not a change in their perception of the actual underlying credit quality; it is how they are characterizing that credit quality because they are changing their methodology", "   MS. MOSSER. One other notable difference is that with TALF 2.0 we have been fairly clear in the information we have released to the public that we are going to do much more credit analysis ourselves and we are going to hire a collateral evaluation agent to give us an independent, security-by-security evaluation of the quality of the collateral.  One of the reasons for that was, frankly, concern among the team working on the TALF that we might run into a situation like this, where there were potentially significant disagreements across the rating agencies, and we really do want to have more control of our destiny, as Bill calls it.  So no decisions at all have been made, and this is one of the things that the team is working on very actively", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Another whole issue about the question of credit rating is that, when you are talking about a new securitization selling at par, the ratings are comparable across different assets, but when you are talking about a legacy security, where the security might be selling at a very big discount to par, it is not really clear how that price and rating map into actual credit risk. In other words, if I could buy a double-A-rated CMBS that is selling at 5 cents on the dollar and then I am haircutting it on top of that, the risk I am taking is probably de minimis.  So it is very important to recognize that there is a whole second set of complications when you are talking about legacy securities because a lot of these securities are not selling at par. They are selling at deep discounts to par, so a lot of the risk is already embodied in that price. But the rating agencies don\u2019t think of it that way.  They are rating it as if it were an instrument trading at par, and the risk of taking actually any losses whatsoever on that", " MR. BULLARD. Yes, a question for Bill Dudley.  Wouldn\u2019t the other rating agencies follow suit and then change their methodology eventually, so the idea of having just one outlier maybe isn\u2019t that realistic over a medium term", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. That is certainly possible.  I think that, in our conversations with the different rating agencies, we have felt the least comfortable that S&P was up to snuff in how they rate the commercial mortgage products.  So you are absolutely right. Everyone could converge to S&P\u2019s new standard\u2014or maybe not.  But at the end of the day, what we really have to think about is that this shouldn\u2019t be driven by one rating agency.  It should be driven by what we are trying to do with the program and what is an acceptable level of credit risk to us. Now, obviously, the acceptable level of credit risk to us is de minimis.  So I am not suggesting that we are going to be widening the program to take on a lot more risk, but I don\u2019t think we want to absolutely pre-commit ourselves to go wherever S&P drives the bus.  That\u2019s all"], "2009FOMC20090624meeting.txt": ["MR. FISHER. Trish, our stated objective was to lower private credit rates and to increase credit availability, and further in your presentation you mentioned two specifics on that.  One was obviously mortgages and the other was corporate credits.  So we might conclude that we have been successful on the corporate credit front.  Is that a fair assessment, or is it too early to tell.  When you talk about lowering rates in your presentation, Trish, I\u2019m a little confused.  Our objective as I understood it was never to seek to lower rates on Treasuries deliberately.  It was to have an effect on the private credit markets.  Do I understand that correctly", "   MR. CLOUSE. I will comment.  Spence may have some other points.  The existing regime for reserve requirements is very hard to rationalize.  It\u2019s based on the monetary policy implementation of the early 1980s and very much focused on transactions deposits.  I think that using that kind of creaky, old structure to generate a huge increase in required reserves would be a little awkward. And then there are the communications challenges associated with why we would be raising reserve requirements by a huge amount, even though they are being remunerated\u2014it still might be awkward to explain.  Spence may have some further comments", " MR. MADIGAN. Very much so, I would say", " MR. FISHER. I\u2019m just wondering if we\u2019ve thought about the politics of this, now when they\u2019re a little bit sensitive about a new consumer protection agency and so on", "   MR. MADIGAN. Possibly increasing the penalty. I think that is open for discussion at this point", " MR. FISHER. That would be one of my concerns\u2014the optics of having a facility, which we, at least, have seen used by foreign branches, and maintaining it even though you might make it a little bit more difficult, while at the same time phasing out something that helps smaller and regional banks. I just wonder if there isn\u2019t a conflict there", " MR. ROSENGREN. I have a question for Brian and Trish about your figure 5 on the large-scale asset purchases.  It\u2019s interesting what a straight line that is.  Over the last six months, obviously, the economic forecast has changed\u2014interest rates have moved, financial conditions have changed\u2014and yet our program has been invariant to all of those changes.  So my first question is whether you think that you\u2019re restricted from being able to do anything other than a straight line program.  I thought you had more flexibility, but I want to get your sense of whether you have the flexibility currently to be able to vary the amount that you\u2019re purchasing or not.  I would say that, in talking to people in the financial community in Boston, one of the surprises was that the purchase program was invariant to the rise in interest rates that we\u2019ve recently experienced, which certainly sent quite a message.  Did you debate whether you had the  flexibility to do anything to, in effect, resist some of that increase, both in the Treasuries and the mortgage-backed securities", " MR. SACK. We have interpreted the directive as having some flexibility, but it is relatively limited, in that we varied the approach that we take to purchases and the pace of purchases to respond to problems with market functioning.  So we do vary the purchases to ensure that markets can continue to function and that we\u2019re not causing too much strain in the markets.  One concrete example of this is that the approach to agency debt purchases has moved to a somewhat more flexible one that has reduced the pace and that raises the possibility of not getting all the way to the $200 billion because of what we\u2019ve seen in the development of the functioning of that market.  So we\u2019ve taken some limited flexibility in terms of responding to how markets function.   I think the more difficult issue is whether to exercise any flexibility in response to changes in market interest rates\u2014that is, beyond the reaction to market functioning, whether the Desk should respond and try to resist increases in, say, MBS rates or Treasury rates.  There I think our view is that we certainly don\u2019t have enough guidance from the Committee about the extent to which that responsiveness should be implemented or the yield levels at which purchases would ramp up.  We have not taken a dynamic market-responsive approach in that regard, and that\u2019s why this is one of the issues that Trish raised in her briefing, namely, whether the Committee would like to consider moving to a more flexible approach.  She raised the issue of doing that across asset classes, but she also raised the issue of doing that within an asset class to be more responsive to interest rates", " MS. MOSSER. One follow-up remark to that:  On a daily basis in implementing the MBS purchase program, particularly during the refinancing wave, we were sensitive to supply   and spreads, and we would buy somewhat more on certain days and a little less on other days.  But, to be honest, that shows up as a very tiny bump in the overall pace of purchases.  As long as spreads were continuing to narrow overall, we did not make very large changes from week to week and month to month in quantities.  Even though there was some daily movement, the changes we made were small ones. In the Treasury program, quite honestly, given its relatively small size, we didn\u2019t feel that we had the flexibility nor that flexibility was necessarily a wise approach, since, frankly, it would not be credible, given chart 7\u2014the size of it is just too small to have an appreciable effect on the level of yields. When we were being flexible in agency MBS, it tended to be in response to spreads more than to the level of yields", " MR. ROSENGREN. Well, we could always reload.  So there is an option", " MR. ROSENGREN. We do have a long tradition of leaning against the wind, and this program seems not to be very interested in leaning against the wind.  I thought you had enough flexibility to do that. Personally I would hope that you would have the flexibility to do that and that we might do a little bit more of it. In terms of your hybrid, I think it\u2019s a very good proposal.  You did note it\u2019s a very small part of the market, and, looking at data from McDash confirms that it\u2019s an extremely small part of the market.  That is a part of the market where, if we wanted to push rates down more aggressively, we could do so with relatively low costs.  It seems that $1\u00bc trillion in mortgages is a lot to support market functioning.  So I actually have a broader goal than market functioning, which is to get the cost of housing down for people who might want to purchase houses. If we\u2019re worried about market functioning in the 15- and 30-year area, it does seem that the 5- and 7-year area is one where there\u2019s virtually no activity now; earlier this decade you could get a 7-year ARM for 4\u00bd percent, no points, no closing costs.  We haven\u2019t hit anything close to that in this period.  Given where the economy is, I don\u2019t quite understand why those ARMs haven\u2019t come down and why they\u2019re not priced more favorably.  It may be reputational effects from the subprime market.  There might be a reason to stay away from 3-year ARMs, because the \u201c3-27\u201d has some connotations.  The 5-year and 7-year ARMs have the advantage of   being longer term while still meeting some of our balance sheet issues.  So you might want to give some thought to the politics of the choice between 3-year and 5- or 7-year.  But it would seem with the 5- or 7-year, we could lean against the wind and actually do more\u2014we could actually try to push the rate low enough so that, if the 30-year mortgage were very high because of what was happening in the Treasuries, it would actually encourage housing purchases in that market without changing the magnitude of what you\u2019re doing.  So I would like you to have a lot more flexibility to do that and possibly to push those rates down more aggressively than we\u2019ve been willing to do with the 15- and 30-year rates", "  MR. LACKER. So you made the same assumptions", " MR. HOENIG. Thank you, and this is a question for you, just to clarify.  I understand where Jeff is coming from, but when I read these papers and I listen to these presentations, I think we have more than an exit strategy discussion going on here.  Eric has kind of drifted onto one discussion about managing rates.  Another is around managing the portfolio\u2014how we adjust. Then there is the exit strategy, which has two dimensions, but I think we are only discussing one. The first dimension is the traditional monetary one of how you get the fed funds rate up. The second is around large-scale asset purchases, which we\u2019re not really talking about today, since we still have this line showing our holdings going up and the only thing is how we are going to adjust the line going up, but that is not an exit strategy.  That is about how we are going to manage going up that line; that is the concern, I think.   So I wonder if it would help to split these up when we are talking.  I mean part of this is about managing the rate, which is different than exit strategy, and it would help clarify when we get into the discussion part of the meeting to say which one we are going to focus on first.  Right now I think we are focusing on all three intermittently here and back and forth, and I think that will cause maybe more confusion", " [Laughter] MR. CARPENTER. That sounds like a profit-sharing plan for the Fed employees.  The accounting treatment is that once there\u2019s no net income after paying dividends and that sort of thing, we stop remitting money to the Treasury.  What happens if we can\u2019t even make the dividend payments to the member banks.  The Reserve Banks would not pay their dividends to the member banks, but they would have to make that up in subsequent years", "   MR. KOHN. Are they forced not to pay dividends, or is that a choice", "  MR. CARPENTER. Just to clarify a bit, what we sidestepped in the analysis was the fact that the remittances are actually made currently by individual Reserve Banks, and it is very, very common for an individual Reserve Bank not to have sufficient capital to equate with surplus and to make a remittance to the Treasury.  Over the past decade or so, it\u2019s been something like 40 weeks per year that at least one Reserve Bank hasn\u2019t made a remittance to the Treasury.  So it\u2019s not as though this is something that is completely unprecedented for the Federal Reserve.  What would be very different here is that it would happen for the Federal Reserve System as a whole", " MR. EVANS. We will lose money on them, though, right.  Because presumably the interest rate we have to pay on the repo is going to be higher than the income that it\u2019s earning", " MR. HOENIG. Just quickly, I want to go back to Governor Kohn\u2019s original question on the accounting. In this document there is a discussion about investments held in consolidated variable-interest entities, with a conservative assumption that we could take a $5 billion hit and then no more losses after that, even if interest rates went up pretty significantly.  Is that a conservative assumption.  That is, if interest rates went up significantly, wouldn\u2019t you expect more losses out of that", " MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a few questions. Some of them have been touched on already, but let me just see if I can get some clarifications.  One question is for Brian, and it\u2019s related to your conversation with Eric about SOMA lending of agency debt and the liquidity in the market.  You said that one of your reactions so far has been that you have kind of slowed down the purchases. In fact, if you\u2019re worried about the liquidity of that market and we\u2019re soaking up all of the liquidity, what\u2019s wrong with another option, namely, to stop buying.  Why create a program where we\u2019re buying them and lending them back out again. Why not just not buy them in the first place and let the liquidity of the market deepen as we move forward.  Is there something wrong with that strategy", " MR. PLOSSER. What I was thinking about was the pace.  Take the TAF, for example\u2014 the recommendation is to cut from $150 billion to $125 billion, and maybe or maybe not to raise the minimum bid rate.  Why don\u2019t we cut to $100 billion immediately.  It\u2019s undersubscribed by a substantial amount. Why not move the minimum bid to something closer to the interest rate on excess reserves rather than making it so far below it that we\u2019re subsidizing, at least in the current environment.  We\u2019re sort of mixing those two things up, trying to figure out what the right balance and strategy are, or how aggressive one wants to be in this process", " MR. PLOSSER. I have a very brief intervention, because it\u2019s related exactly to this point. Brian, a little earlier when I asked you the question about agency debt, you said that you presumed we were going to go to the limit on that.  Is it the expectation of the Desk and the markets that the operative words of \u201cup to\u201d certain amounts in our policy statements are basically irrelevant, and that, in fact, we\u2019re viewed as committed to going to those amounts and we wouldn\u2019t consider doing less", "   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I think many of us on the Committee would be looking to you to tell us if you think there\u2019s a strategy that, for a given amount of purchases, would achieve better results, and, if so, what that is and how you would recommend communicating about it.  I think we have to rely on your market knowledge to do that.  So if you do believe that\u2019s the case, perhaps for the next meeting or before then, you could present us with some alternatives.  But if you think where we are now is fine, that\u2019s good, too.  But let\u2019s not fail to take advantage of some improved operating process, if it gives us better results", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Another alternative may just be to clarify in the Humphrey-Hawkins report, rather than coming up with a whole new vehicle.  It could just provide a bit more language about what the intent of the programs is and about our thought processes. From my perspective, the statement and the minutes are not great vehicles for communicating about this", " But if we\u2019re departing from what we\u2019ve been doing, we want the Committee to\u2014 VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I\u2019m assuming that we\u2019re going to stay on the same path.  I still think it would be useful to have something in the Humphrey-Hawkins report that explains what this is. And then, if we depart, I agree, I think we\u2019d have a different directive", " MR. SACK. The statement is conditioned on anticipated further improvement that hasn\u2019t really been defined. So I think it leaves open some issues.  If conditions just stay where they are, does that mean the programs will be extended.  How much improvement is expected.  And so on. I would just say it\u2019s complicated to signal that so far in advance", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I think it\u2019s mixed\u2014there are extensions going on as well as some trimming back", " [Coffee break] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. The floor is now open for people who\u2019d like to make comments on the three topics I mentioned before the break or anything else that the presentations brought to mind.  I want everyone to have a chance to speak, but I do hope we can get to the economic presentation today.  If we can do this in 45 minutes or so, that would be very helpful.  Would anyone like to start off.  Governor Warsh", " MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think I agree with everyone else.  We absolutely need a framework that people can have confidence in for how we\u2019re going to exit the current balance sheet and raise interest rates.  But as we\u2019ll discuss tomorrow, I think it\u2019s way too early to begin that exit, and I do worry about signaling an exit before the economy is really ready for it. But we do need to have the framework.  In that regard, I\u2019m comfortable with the liquidity facilities proposals in Brian\u2019s memo.  I think basically they recognize and validate what\u2019s already happening in the market, and that\u2019s fine.  And I was comfortable with the sentence you read, Mr. Chairman.  I think it was sufficiently conditional, and I wouldn\u2019t strengthen it.  My concern is that, if we find ourselves in a position where we don\u2019t want to wind down, we haven\u2019t already told people we are going to wind down, but rather we have told people we are going to be looking at things.  I came in a little like President Fisher, looking for perhaps raising that TAF minimum bid rate, thinking that, unlike all the other facilities we have, that\u2019s one that doesn\u2019t quite wind down as automatically as markets improve.  My mind is still open on that.  I haven\u2019t heard a lot of support for that, but I thought raising that would reinforce the winding down.  I appreciate Brian\u2019s point that it\u2019s an auction facility\u2014they can always cut the amounts rather than raise the price; but raising the price would reinforce that.  So I guess, on balance, I would be slightly in favor of raising the TAF penalty rates. On exit tools, I was actually encouraged by the presentations by the staff\u2014Spence, Trish, and others\u2014which indicated that we do have a lot of tools.  And, like President Evans, I see these tools for sterilizing or reducing reserves working together with interest on reserves, and I feel more confident than before I read the memo that we can accomplish a lot.  I guess you\u2019re going to have to work on these reverse RPs\u2014who the counterparties are (including the GSEs) and whether you need to diversify past the dealers.  I\u2019m not totally convinced you do need to; the dealers are there to be intermediaries, and they can play that role.  Anyhow, that would be a good thing. And the time deposits I thought also were a good thing. I wouldn\u2019t rule out selling assets quite as much as some of you would.  We took these special actions to lower rates\u2014I will come to that next\u2014but if we\u2019re in a situation where we are worried about inflation, we can undo them, although maybe not in huge size.  I would think selling some of the portfolios, depending on the circumstances, might not be a bad idea.  That brings me to the LSAPs.  My objectives were different from yours, Governor Warsh. I voted for this in order to lower interest rates, or at least to make interest rates lower than they otherwise would be. It was keyed to the macroeconomic outlook last March, which was pretty dire and getting worse all the time, and we had run out of fed funds ammunition in December.  So I was not uncomfortable. I was in favor of diversifying our portfolio of purchases into Treasuries. I think the monetizing problem is keyed to the fiscal deficit outlook.  If that weren\u2019t so uncertain and looking so unsustainable, I don\u2019t think people would be worried about us. But it is uncertain and looking unsustainable, so I think we need to be careful about the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy.  Therefore, I would not be in favor of increasing those purchases at this time. I came into the meeting thinking about some flexibility across instruments within the total amount and across time.  But I\u2019ve been discouraged by the discussion at the meeting.  I think we can set a price or we can set a quantity, but setting the relationships of price and quantity in a clear way is just very, very hard. So I think I\u2019d stick with what we are doing now. I would be okay with small purchases of hybrid ARMs.  I think it might encourage that market a little bit and help the mortgage market, which has been adversely affected by the uptick in Treasury rates. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we have to be really careful about our communications in terms of discriminating between our ability to exit smoothly and implying that we\u2019re about to exit.  I will probably come back to this point tomorrow.  The anxiety that I have about inadvertently implying to the market that we are exiting soon is particularly high now, because the market has already priced in a lot more tightening than most of us think is likely over the next year or two.  That said, of course, we have to be prepared for exit, and I think being prepared for exit and articulating that is really, really important in keeping inflation expectations well anchored, and also in keeping the dispersion of inflationexpectations compact.  So I think we definitely have to do that, but I think it\u2019s tricky to do one without implying the other. In terms of Brian\u2019s recommendations on the facilities, I\u2019m pretty comfortable with all of it. I do want to make sure the language stays where it is, though, and doesn\u2019t get more definitive about what happens in February.  I think February is a long time away, and I wouldn\u2019t want to prejudge what we\u2019re going to want to do or not want to do in February.  I think where we are right now in terms of the language is about right.  It basically says there\u2019s a possibility that we might not extend it, so the market is put on notice.  But it doesn\u2019t necessarily commit us to ending the facilities. On the TAF, I am on the other side of that issue from Don on the rate rise.  It\u2019s not a big deal for me, but let me just explain why I am on the other side.  I think raising the rate on TAF will be seized upon by some as the beginning of raising interest rates.  So it\u2019s not the TAF rate rise that bothers me per se.  I can certainly understand the argument for doing that in the small, but I\u2019m a little worried that if we do it, people will say, \u201cOh, look, this is the very beginning of the rate hikes, because they have now raised the rate on the TAF.\u201d  There\u2019s also a second, more subtle issue on the TAF, if we are actually going to go to the sporadic TAF auctions over the longer term.  We probably can\u2019t really do that in a normal environment with a penalty rate.  If you think of the transition on the TAF, we\u2019d have to move to a penalty rate, and then later on, as we go to the sporadic auctions, we\u2019d actually have to lower the rate again.  That just seems a little confusing to me.  But my main concern is the signal in terms of monetary policy that people might draw from raising the rate. On the LSAP, I don\u2019t feel very defensive about what we\u2019ve been doing.  After all, we did get a really good mortgage refinancing wave\u2014that was the point of the exercise.  It\u2019s hard toknow how much of it was MBS versus Treasuries, and we\u2019ll never really know for certain.  But I feel pretty good about basically having achieved that objective. In terms of Treasuries, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any appetite for going much larger.  I think the choice is really between standing pat and going to, as President Yellen said, $450 billion and extending it through year-end. The advantage of the latter is that you don\u2019t have to make up your mind quite so soon, but the disadvantage is that it seems like a pretty weak response.  It shows a lack of sort of confidence in what the Fed is doing with this facility.  So I guess I\u2019m slightly leaning toward standing pat, because I worry that the other option would be viewed as too little to be significant. I think the suggestion about hybrid ARMs makes a lot of sense.  In some ways, if we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re basically distorting the relationship between the fixed-rate agency MBS and the hybrid ARMs, and it\u2019s not really clear why we would want to do that", "  MR. FISHER. I just have some questions of Nathan.  You mentioned the Baltic Dry Index in the context of Chinese iron ore imports.  Chinese iron ore imports are far exceeding steel production, as you know. So my question is:  How sustainable, in your opinion, is this recovery", "  MR. SHEETS. We have reason to believe that these Chinese purchases are playing a very special role here. What is China doing with all of these commodities that they\u2019re purchasing. I think the answer has three parts.  First, some of these commodities are actually  being consumed by Chinese firms in association with the fiscal stimulus that\u2019s being put in place.  Second, some are being used to replenish inventory levels.  In the fall, when the Chinese and global economy hit something of a wall, many firms just backed away entirely from commodity purchases, and that is one of the reasons why the bottom fell out of the commodity market.  So those inventory levels are low, and they\u2019re being brought back to normal levels.  Third, I think that there is some strategic purchasing going on in the Chinese economy right now.  Commodities are cheap, and they\u2019re pretty confident that at some point they\u2019re going to need to use them, so they\u2019re buying things and stockpiling them. My sense is that, of those three causes, the first one is indicative of early stages of a recovery in the Chinese economy.  I think that\u2019s probably sustainable.  These inventory-based explanations are less sustainable, so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if, over time, Chinese purchases flattened out, or even came back from where they are today.  Now, if that happens in the context of a broader global recovery, less demand for basic materials from China would be offset by increased demand from other countries.  But I think there is a risk that the commodity markets have gotten ahead of themselves and that the Chinese will stop buying at this furious pace, and we\u2019ll see a little bit of unwinding of the increases in commodity prices that we\u2019ve seen over the last few months", " MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question. I appreciate the discussion about measures of slack and output gaps, and I was particularly struck by the measures that were produced by the EDO model.  In the Bluebook, your description of the construction of the output gap is not the way I normally think of it\u2014it looks like some long-run trend or steady-state model.  Most of these stochastic, general equilibrium models think about equilibrium output being at a point in time, and then you get shocked away from that.  The   difference between what might be produced by a sticky price model versus a flexible price model gives you some measure of the difference between what\u2019s feasible and what you actually get.  But you\u2019ve defined the output gap in a much different way, using what looks like some concept of steady state, and I was a little puzzled by that choice.  Of course, in your discussion you highlighted the fact that that actually led to the EDO model having a very large output gap rather than a somewhat smaller one.  Most of these DSGE models lead to much more volatile measures of what you might think of as equilibrium or potential output at a point in time.  If you sort of rethink, then, the range of where potential output might be in terms of what different models give you, I guess I wouldn\u2019t have selected that subset, I would have selected a little different subset", " MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The reports from my District have revealed lingering concerns about how the economy will evolve over the rest of this year.  Most of my contacts agree that their worst fears for the economy seem less likely to be realized now, but they are still far from optimistic.  Expectations for the remainder of the year varied from further reduction in activity levels to a very moderate resumption in economic growth.  Reports of hiring are still rare, and several contacts from larger companies suggest that they are working on another round of layoffs. From my District vantage point, it still looks like a very gradual recovery process. The inflation picture is mixed.  I am hearing a growing number of contacts expressing fears of inflation driven by rising commodity prices and ballooning fiscal deficits, but I am also hearing widespread reports of downward pressures on wages and benefits.  Synthesizing these reports and the incoming data into an outlook continues to be challenging.  I have revised up slightly my output forecast from the April meeting, as business fixed investment, although still a considerable drag on growth, declines less steeply than in my previous outlook. While business spending on equipment is likely to pick up in the second half of the year, spending on structures, as was mentioned yesterday, will probably take longer to recover. Some recent favorable readings from the housing indicators have also attenuated the near-term decline in residential investment in my outlook and have raised the prospect for a turnaround in housing in the second half of the year.  My forecast still has the unemployment rate peaking at just over 10 percent in early 2010.  The continued rapid rise in unemploymentcertainly remains an important drag on the economy as new jobs are hard to find for many of the workers who were laid off. I revised up my inflation forecast for 2009, but I left my longer-term inflation projection on a gradual path towards 2 percent. As we discussed yesterday, the latest Survey of Professional Forecasters has a broader variance around the longer-term inflation trend, but the median inflation projection is largely unchanged.  And, as we said yesterday, we have seen an unusually wide range of inflation projections in this round of the Committee\u2019s submissions. We know that the liquidity problems in the TIPS market have made that a more difficult indicator to use to deem where inflation expectations are.  We have done some work at the Cleveland Fed using a different method of looking at the TIPS data, and those results suggest that inflation expectations have returned to pre-crisis levels.  Apparently, these results have been confirmed by the staff of the San Francisco Fed, who used a different methodology but came to the same conclusion.  Consequently, although inflation expectations are still volatile, I do think that it is reasonable to characterize them as anchored. In my view, the risks to the forecast remain to the downside for output, because the improvements in the real economy that we are seeing remain nascent and, I think, fragile.  However, I did revise my views of the risks around the inflation forecast to \u201cbalanced\u201d\u2014they are large but symmetric. This remains a very challenging period to evaluate the incoming data, and even a smaller gap doesn\u2019t mitigate the fact that the economy is still contracting in the current quarter, and most projections show limited growth for a considerable period.  Despite my forecast for higher inflation compared with the Greenbook, my overall outlook leaves the economy a fair distance from needing a tighter monetary policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the Greenbook, the Boston Fed forecast now expects that we will reach an unemployment rate of 10 percent.  Unfortunately, this statistic probably understates the degree of weakness in labor markets.  In discussion with small and medium-sized businesses in New England, it is striking how many firms have placed workers on part-time schedules and how many firms have reported reducing nominal wages to avoid further job cuts. If New England\u2019s firms are representative of the wider economy, these practices may have implications for the recovery.  First, firms are likely to defer hiring not only until they are confident that the recovery has firmly taken root, but also until they have restored hours to those workers whose hours they have already reduced.  Second, wage pressures on inflation are likely to continue to be subdued, as firms in weak sectors of the economy defer wage increases until demand for their products increases. In my forecast, the recovery is quite restrained, making it unlikely that we reach full employment during the forecast horizon.  The recovery will be slower if mortgage rates do not encourage buyers back into the market.  While the 30-year mortgage rates have come down somewhat from the recent spike, they remain well above the rates earlier this spring.  Not   surprisingly, loan applications have slowed, and Realtors report diminished foot traffic after the rates increased.  But higher rates may slow the recovery even further.  Higher rates will likely put downward pressure on housing prices.  This, in turn, will further diminish household wealth, reducing consumption as households seek to recover from already large wealth losses.  In addition, lower house prices will likely add to the many households who struggle with the potential of home foreclosure.  As I discussed briefly yesterday, an interesting aspect of the mortgage market during this recession is that five- and seven-year ARMs are not priced as attractively as they were earlier in this decade.  If longer-term mortgage rates remain high, improved pricing of longer-term ARMs does have the potential to bring some borrowers back into the market. While financial markets have improved, they remain fragile.  The municipal bond market could still be roiled by the lack of political will by some states and municipalities to address their financial problems.  Bank lending could be affected if commercial real estate and consumer loans continue to deteriorate, forcing higher loan loss reserves, which, for many banks, are still moving slowly relative to the growth of nonperforming loans.  While the securitization market appears to have improved somewhat as a result of the TALF, it is unclear how the eventual removal of TALF financing and the possible legislation on securitization are likely to affect the recovery in this market. Overall, my forecast is not much different from the last FOMC meeting, and, frankly, that forecast implies uncomfortable outcomes for both unemployment and inflation.  Higher mortgage rates have caused me to push out the housing recovery, and the recent labor report has raised my path of unemployment.  Many banks remain capital constrained, and I expect many more to be constrained as they need to increase loan loss reserves.  Thus, I place a low   probability on rapid expansion of bank lending over the next two years.  Even by the end of 2011, I expect that the unemployment rate will be well above full employment and inflation will be well below my target.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In the Eighth Federal Reserve District, the decline in economic activity is slowing or stopped.  Still, there are no immediate signs of improvement during the summer or fall.  Business contacts are definitely subdued.  I might even describe them as resigned to sluggish economic performance for the foreseeable future.  In recent calls that I made, there were some reports of slower activity in the second half of May and into June, so we\u2019ll see if that shows up in the numbers going forward.  That worried me a little bit. On the national scene, my sense is that markets may have jumped ahead of the reality of the economy during the last 60 or 90 days.  That said, I am hoping for some improvement in the second half, but I think there\u2019s a tremendous amount of uncertainty about where the economy will be going forward.  I think we\u2019re vulnerable to further shocks.  Shocks are unpredictable, so I don\u2019t know where they would come from.  But when you\u2019re down, other things can happen.  I also think that the longer that the recession drags on, the greater the likelihood that new problems can arise that would not have been problems if the economy had turned around sooner.  And I just wanted to say I remain concerned about the global nature of this recession, which I think is largely unprecedented in the postwar era.   I\u2019ve been concerned about possible deflation and a deflationary trap, that is, a steady state that we could actually get stuck in. If we were to enter such a trap in 2009 or 2010, we would have a very hard time getting out.  The first priority for me has been to avoid this outcome, and that means building up inflation expectations.  I think the probability that this will happen has  fallen some.  For instance, the five-year TIPS inflation compensation has increased\u2014it\u2019s about 125 basis points now. I know there\u2019s a lot of analysis about exactly how to look at that.  If you just take it at face value, it has improved a lot from very negative values in December and January, but it\u2019s still not a lot of inflation over the next five years.  It\u2019s below our inflation target, and you\u2019d like to see it higher, I think.  Also, the Greenbook forecast has inflation declining further, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019re out of the woods on the deflation threat, although the outlook has improved a lot from what it was in the December-January time frame. I think we\u2019re entering a period of volatile expectations in markets.  The markets are just not sure what to think about the unprecedented policy environment.  They\u2019re looking at numbers that they have not seen before, and they\u2019re not sure what to think\u2014large budget deficits where the longer-term outlook is very unclear.  Given that, I think our purchase program looks like\u2014 and I put that in quotes: \u201clooks like\u201d\u2014debt monetization.  I don\u2019t think anybody involved wants to go there, but that\u2019s the appearance. And you\u2019ve got legislation pending that may appear to threaten Fed independence.  I think the hard thing about our debt markets is that they\u2019re global markets, so especially for those outside the U.S. who may not understand the subtleties of our politics, this just looks like a lot of debt issuance by the Treasury and some purchases by the central bank.  It\u2019s just very hard to get away from that perception, and that has made me pessimistic about further expansion of our large-scale asset purchases. I think current policies are pushing very hard on our credibility.  As I mentioned before, I don\u2019t think we could get away with these policies if we were a smaller developing country.  Fortunately, we do have a large stock of credibility to draw upon, but we need to be careful.  Just because everything has gone well for a long time in the U.S. doesn\u2019t mean it will continue to do   so this time around.  Again, the policy response to this crisis has been unprecedented, so the current situation may not produce the outcomes that we hope for. I\u2019m also concerned, along with President Plosser and others, about the emphasis in the narrative on a large output gap keeping inflation at bay into the indefinite future.  I don\u2019t think inflation is a near-term problem, but it could be a medium-term problem.  I also think there are conceptual difficulties with the traditional output gap measures.  The empirical relationships are not that great. So the moment is really ripe for a possible policy mistake along this dimension, since we\u2019re coupling that with our unprecedented policy action.  I think that\u2019s going to remain an issue for the FOMC for some time to come.  Thank you", "   MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019ve already highlighted some of my views on policy yesterday and earlier today.  Let me just sort of clarify.  My view of the outlook for the real economy is really not much different from most people\u2019s around the table\u2014near-term  weakness, with modest growth returning in 2010.  In fact, my own forecast is for less growth in 2011 than the Greenbook\u2019s\u2014a slow recovery in the economy in many respects.  I don\u2019t disagree with that.   Where I disagree has more to do with the nature and the specification of the Phillips curve and how that guides both our inflation forecast and its implications for policy.  I don\u2019t believe that the empirical relationship with gaps or slack is nearly as tight and predictable and reliable as oftentimes we think it is, so my concern is that we have to be careful about that.  I would remind the Committee that, between 1991 and 1996, the staff, according to the chart they handed out yesterday, had substantial output gaps ranging from 2 to 4 percent for most of that period, and inflation hardly budged\u2014it remained between 2\u00bd and 3 percent during that whole period. So while I don\u2019t want to rely on anecdotal information, it is true that this link between output gaps and inflation is not a very strong one.  I think we have to be cautious about relying too heavily on that. My skepticism about the measurement of those gaps and the relationships with inflation is most relevant for the deliberations we will have about when it\u2019s time to reverse course and how we decide when that time is.  I think that\u2019s going to be a very difficult choice, given the uncertainty surrounding these relationships. A tightening cycle will inevitably occur, and   choosing the right time to do it is going to be important for our future ability to achieve price stability. I also think that, historically, this institution has been somewhat slow on the uptake many times.  If we rely too heavily on measures of slack in labor markets or unemployment rate gaps, we will inevitably find ourselves behind the curve, because we know unemployment rates take a long time to turn around, and the economy will turn around before that.  If we wait until the unemployment rate becomes an unacceptable level to reverse course, I\u2019m fairly confident that we will be well behind the curve. So my point is really about the nature of the Phillips curve, and about the reliability of those estimates, and about our ability to rely on them for policy decisions during this critical time. I believe the economy is in this sort of bumpy transition from dramatic contraction hopefully to expansion. I agree with everyone that there are substantial risks to that forecast, and we need to be conscious of those risks and those concerns.  I\u2019m very supportive, as I said yesterday, of the staff\u2019s proposals on winding down the facilities.  I am opposed to increasing our large-scale asset purchases.  I think we need to be very cautious in that effort.  We still have a ways to go, so we still could increase purchases if we chose to do so.  And I don\u2019t believe we ought to make decisions about adding to that volume very precipitously or quickly.  I would also hope that the argument is symmetric; that is, if the economy improves and evolves in the way that many of us are hoping it will over the course of the fall, then we may not necessarily have to go to the full limit on some of these programs.  I think we have to make that clear to the public as well. A major issue I see in the policy decision today has to do with language\u2014I think it\u2019s the communication effort that\u2019s going to be so difficult.  I think ultimately we are going to have to  find a way to extract ourselves from the current language of \u201cexceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.\u201d That\u2019s why I am somewhat sympathetic to the first part of paragraph 3 in alternative C, although I wouldn\u2019t be nearly as explicit about the timing in that paragraph: \u201cuntil late this year.\u201d  I would sort of strike that and just say, \u201cfor some time.\u201d  Even if we raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, it\u2019s still exceptionally low, so I\u2019m not sure that the difference between level and changes here is important. Given my hesitancy and skepticism about tying our inflation forecast too tightly to slack measures, I actually am happier with paragraph 2 in alternative B than I was before, in the sense that both the persistence and size of the output gap become somewhat less dominant.  I would prefer C in that regard, but I think paragraph 2 is better than the version in the Bluebook that we saw, so I\u2019m happy with that. I think we have some difficult choices before us in the coming quarters, and it would be helpful if we could continue to push for our inflation targeting goals.  I hope that that is not off the table and will continue to be pursued.  But I do think that in the coming months and coming quarters we are going to have to make some very difficult economic decisions, and we could face considerable political pressure in the face of that.  We need to prepare ourselves for that and prepare the markets for it.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we should continue now with the announced schedule of asset purchases. I don\u2019t think expanding our purchases makes any sense now, given the stabilization of the economy, the diminution of concerns about deflation, and the emergence of some scattered concerns about inflation.  I agree with you that we\u2019ve sort of   normalized inflation and inflation expectations at this point, and we\u2019re okay where we are.  But given that, I don\u2019t think it makes sense to provide more stimulus.   It\u2019s true that our credit programs have run off more rapidly than we expected as of the last meeting.  As I discussed yesterday, it means our balance sheet is smaller, so you might think that it provides less stimulus than you would otherwise expect.  I outlined another perspective, where some components of borrowing respond endogenously, as sort of a residual.  This perspective is based on the notion that the demand for reserves isn\u2019t perfectly elastic at current rates. That would suggest that the degree of stimulus hasn\u2019t turned out to be much different from what we expected it to have been. I\u2019m happy that the Desk didn\u2019t attempt to offset the shortfall in the balance sheet, as the discussion at our last meeting might have led them to think I would have desired. I\u2019m broadly apprehensive about the increases in reserves implied by completing the path of asset purchases we\u2019re on.  As I\u2019ve indicated, I think the impact depends on the nature of the demand for bank reserves.  If what I outlined yesterday has some validity, then, at some point, all that buffer of borrowing from us goes away, and then the nature of the impact of our balance sheet expansion shifts qualitatively. Now, whether it\u2019s quantitatively important or not, I don\u2019t think we know. We have all known that we\u2019re sort of groping in the dark here as to what the exact analytics are of this balance sheet expansion as monetary stimulus.  But I think the kind of thing I outlined yesterday deserves some consideration, and it makes me apprehensive about following all the way through on the purchases. Now, I\u2019m not saying I have any idea about when we\u2019re going to want to withdraw stimulus, or how the economy will play out.  It just strikes me as plausible that we get to a state where we need to think about exit. I don\u2019t know when that is, and I can\u2019t pretend that I do.  But I think that, when we do get there, we\u2019re going to need to be cognizant of the elasticity of demand   for reserves. In consequence, I think we ought to give some consideration at the next few meetings to lower paths for our asset purchases.  If we get outcomes that are on the good side of what we are expecting, in the fourth quarter we could find ourselves in a situation where we want to pull back on what we\u2019ve planned. I also think maybe a less gradual unwinding of the assets ought to be on the table. I applaud the staff again, by the way, for all of the good work they\u2019ve done so far on our exit strategy. But I think we\u2019d all admit we have a little more to do. I\u2019m happy with alternative B.  I\u2019m happy omitting the bracketed sentence at the end.  I\u2019m not quite sure what it means.  I\u2019m not quite sure about the extent to which we have taken account of ensuring that our policy accommodation can be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.  So I\u2019m not sure how we\u2019d explain it to people.  And, besides, I think it\u2019s a little too soon to convey, as I think the sentence would, that we think of exit as likely to be imminent enough to warrant our mentioning it in the statement.  At the same time, I do think it\u2019s important, as I said earlier, to convey in the Monetary Policy Report, or elsewhere, that we have a grasp on this and we\u2019re working hard on it. Also, I\u2019m happy omitting the statement in paragraph 2 about inflation being at low levels\u2014I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge the shift in inflation outlook.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B, although on purely policy grounds I think that a strong case exists for further monetary stimulus.  The economy appears to be stabilizing and downside risk has declined, but it will be many years before the economy is close to operating at full employment.  Not surprisingly, the Bluebook optimal policy simulation shows that the stance of policy is not even close to the optimal degree of accommodation. As the Bluebook points out, unemployment is anticipated to run around 1\u00bd percentage points higher on the constrained path than on the unconstrained path for the next three to four years, and this translates into a cumulative loss on the order of 10 percent of GDP, or $1\u00bd trillion, and creates a very strong case for doing everything possible to stimulate the economy.  The problem is that the obvious remaining tool, large-scale Treasury purchases, may be less effective than hoped and may entail a variety of unquantifiable costs, as we have discussed. I wouldn\u2019t want to take an expansion of this program off the table if the economy were to worsen, but I wouldn\u2019t push for an expansion now. The bottom line for me is that we likely will need to maintain the current stance of policy for a very long time to get back to full employment, and my main concern is that markets will anticipate and we may be tempted to withdraw our accommodation too soon, thereby aborting the recovery.  Christina Romer recently wrote a pertinent essay for The Economist on \u201cThe Lessons of 1937\u201d that you may have read.  As many of you know, in that year, following two years of robust recovery, the Federal Reserve tightened policy too soon because it was worried about large quantities of excess reserves in the banking system.  The economy plunged back into depression, and I believe that a parallel can be found in Japan\u2019s experience of the 1990s as well.  So I think we need to do all that we can to avoid creating the impression that we intend to raise the federal funds rate any time soon.  For this reason I definitely prefer to drop the final sentence in brackets in B concerning exit strategy.  By bringing this issue up in the policy statement, I am afraid we will reinforce the market\u2019s impression that we may begin to tighten policy sooner rather than later.  I think discussions of exit strategy would be better handled in testimony or speeches by the Chairman.  In the event that a reference is included in this statement, I have a very small wording change to propose.  Currently the statement refers to taking \u201ccareful account of the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn.\u201d The phrase \u201ccan ultimately be withdrawn\u201d sounds to me like we\u2019re not sure we can do it or that we may refrain from easing policy in particular ways later on because of our concern about our ability to withdraw. So if it is included, I would prefer a more confident wording, namely, \u201censuring that policy accommodation is ultimately withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time.\u201d  So I would essentially change \u201ccan be\u201d to \u201cis.\u201d I also have a wording suggestion to make in paragraph 1 concerning the outlook, and my objective here, again, is to make the statement slightly less optimistic, slightly less able to be interpreted as saying that we are anywhere close to withdrawing stimulus, and, in my view, slightly more balanced.  I propose adding to a sentence in paragraph 1 of B to recognize that even though financial conditions have improved on balance, which is a net positive for the outlook, the increase in mortgage rates we have seen has the potential to impede recovery in the housing market.  In particular, I would propose the following language:  \u201cConditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months, although the sharp rise in mortgage rates has the potential to impede recovery in the housing market.  Indicators of consumer and business sentiment\u2026\u201d and so on.  I think the increase in mortgage rates has been substantial.  It is one of the most important and most discussed developments since our last meeting, and it does create a risk to the outlook.  I think it deserves mention in the statement as a negative factor that partially offsets what is a net improvement.  I also would argue for including it for the sake of balance.  I think it parallels our discussion in the very next sentence that says that there are some factors restraining household spending, and again, in the inflation section where we mention increases in the prices of energy and commodities as an offset to our view that inflation will remain generally subdued.  So that\u2019s a concrete suggestion", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The forecast has high unemployment rates and low inflation rates through 2011, and the Greenbook forecast expects an undesirably low inflation rate even at the end of 2013. Missing both elements of the dual mandate through 2011 and possibly beyond strongly suggests to me that we should attempt to provide more   stimulus both to avoid a multiyear elevated unemployment rate and to avoid a prolonged period of lower than desired inflation. Mortgage and Treasury rates have risen despite our large-scale asset purchase program.  The increase in Treasury rates likely reflects the reduced precautionary demand for that asset as financial markets have improved.  However, the increase in mortgage rates is likely to slow both residential investment and consumption relative to what they would be if we were pushing rates lower. There has been a reluctance to intervene more aggressively in the thirty-year mortgage market because it is felt that this would disrupt market functioning.  But if our LSAPs cannot produce mortgage rates that are low enough to spur refinancing and new construction, then we have dramatically expanded our balance sheet with little to show for it. I believe we can and should do more.  While I support alternative B, I would encourage the Desk to further reduce mortgage rates relative to Treasury rates.  Furthermore, since the market for five- and seven-year ARMs is already quite limited, aggressive activity in ARMs would restore the market and provide a low-cost alternative for some homebuyers willing to float after five or seven years.  Because of the lack of activity, setting a low rate in this market and increasing volume would not disrupt market functioning.  In fact, it would resuscitate the market.  These ARMs also have some appeal for our balance sheet since they mature relatively quickly, making the exit strategy easier for these assets.  Acting more aggressively to restore the ARM market and to further reduce the spread relative to Treasuries for longer-maturity mortgages seem like appropriate steps to gain greater confidence that we will achieve both elements of our dual mandate within a reasonable time horizon. I would emphasize that the experience of the past seven years has taught us that conducting monetary policy in a very low-inflation environment is not as straightforward as we  might have wished.  At some point, we should have a fuller discussion of our inflation goal in light of the probability of reaching the zero lower bound in the future and the difficulty in conducting monetary policy when we are at the zero bound. In terms of what\u2019s in the statement, I actually would not be for having the final sentence.  We have not been communicating the path of the LSAP program.  I think we can taper as appropriate without necessarily having to discuss how we\u2019re going to taper it.  I do prefer President Yellen\u2019s language\u2014I do think it\u2019s appropriate to mention the rise in rates, because it has been quite appreciable, and it has been probably the biggest news that we\u2019ve had in the last month in terms of what has been going on in the financial markets.  Thank you", " MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I noted at the end of my remarks, I don\u2019t think the central tendency that we\u2019ve submitted is really a satisfactory outcome for the economy.  We\u2019re looking at an unemployment rate\u2014just considering the center of the central tendency\u2014of about 8\u00bd percent in two and a half years and an inflation rate of 1\u00bd percent, which is below the 2 percent that most of us have favored; and that\u2019s probably headed lower unless the economy picks up steam very, very fast after that.  I think that\u2019s why most Taylor rules and the optimal control simulations that President Yellen mentioned call for negative nominal interest rates now. Moreover, I think from a risk-management perspective, which we used to talk about around here, even though the risks are more balanced on either side of this sluggish recovery now than they were, I think the cost of a shortfall is greater than the cost of an overshoot.  We know how to counter inflation. We\u2019ve done it before and we can do it again.  But this central tendency tells me that, given the size of the shock, we\u2019re having trouble getting satisfactory outcomes for output and inflation.  I think the risk, as President Bullard pointed out, is that we could be caught in a high-output-gap, low-inflation or even deflationary environment.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen, but I think there\u2019s a risk there, and if we get caught in that, I think it\u2019s very, very difficult to figure out how to get out of it.  This seemed to be much easier, Mr. Chairman, when we were lecturing Japan than when we\u2019re doing it ourselves.  [Laughter] Everybody had a solution for them, and somehow when you\u2019re there, there are a lot of complications, aren\u2019t there. So of the two possible policy errors\u2014moving toward tightening too soon and moving too late\u2014I\u2019m more worried that we\u2019ll move too soon than that we\u2019ll move too late.  I think we can correct that latter one. I don\u2019t think there is anything we can do about this now, despite the lack of satisfactory outcome.  Because of inflation sensitivity, because of exit worries, because of concerns about monetization of the debt in the presence of a large and uncertain fiscal path, I\u2019m not advocating more policy action today.  I think we should continue with our purchases.  I would go up to the limits that we\u2019ve set, and I would include the ARMs\u2014at least a small amount of the ARMs\u2014in those purchases, hoping to have a positive effect on mortgage markets.  I hope our next decision is how and when to remove accommodation, to remove the quantitative and interest rate accommodation, but I don\u2019t rule out the possibility that we could take future easing actions if circumstances called for it\u2014that would be more large-scale asset purchases, possibly,  and, to my mind, lowering the interest rate on excess reserves would help as well.  So I would be careful not to say something that rules out the possibility of doing something more later.  In response to President Stern, I\u2019d be concerned that putting that sentence in here would cast doubt on whether we\u2019re willing to use all of the tools available under the circumstances. I think that it\u2019s far too soon to signal that the exit is drawing closer; furthermore, if we\u2019re seen as worried about the exit and looking carefully at it, it will undermine our effect.  I agree with everyone else\u2014we need to be very, very clear that we will be able to exit when we decide to exit. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere close to making that decision.  So I support the language of alternative B without the bracketed sentence.  I do think removing this sentence about inflation being less than desirable from the second paragraph will be seen as a little bit more hawkish, a little bit more worried about inflation than we were before.  I think we could justify keeping the sentence based on the forecasts that we have from the Committee, but the forecasts have been revised up and certainly the degree to which the Committee expects inflation to be less than it ideally should be has been reduced to some extent. I think it\u2019s especially important to keep in the sentence about continuing to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for a time.  I think we need to signal to the market that, even if they\u2019ve changed their expectations for future interest rates, we have not, at least not appreciably.  And finally, on President Yellen\u2019s point, I guess I\u2019d be concerned that putting in her whole sentence would really undermine the sense that financial conditions had improved and that the economy was in the process of bottoming out.  If we did anything, I would just add something like, \u201cAlthough mortgage interest rates have risen, conditions in financial markets have improved on balance in recent months.\u201d  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m going to be quite repetitive, so I\u2019ll be very brief. I, too, am troubled by the projections not being consistent with our dual mandate.  However, with Treasuries as the only option for expansion, I\u2019m not at all convinced that a modest increase in our Treasury purchases brings us that much closer to our objective.  And I am concerned about the difficulties with exiting an even larger balance sheet.  So I support alternative B, and I would omit the final sentence in light of the risk that the interpretation would be that our exit is imminent.  Finally, I would echo President Rosengren\u2019s and Governor Kohn\u2019s support of option ARMs. Thank you", " MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I must confess to being somewhat discomfited by what I see as a disconnect between the analyses of the economy, which I alluded to in the earlier go-round, and the fact that when it comes to policy there seems to be more concern about the potential for inflation some years out than there is with the serious underperformance of the economy today and for the foreseeable future. I understood our action in March to be an effort to provide further accommodation in the circumstance of zero-bound rates.  I think it\u2019s very difficult to make a judgment now as to exactly what effect that has had.  It does seem, as President Yellen mentioned earlier, that there is a strong theoretical case, that the counterfactual is difficult to come by, and that it is, other than statements of future intentions, really the only policy tool available to us.  I was somewhat attracted by not an option in the Bluebook, but an option included in the June 16 memo from the two Brians, which was to modestly stretch out the Treasury purchase program until the end of the year.  I was attracted to that for a variety of reasons.  One is that it just created a certain time symmetry in our decisionmaking, because the MBS and agency debt programs go through the end of the year.  That, in turn, avoided what I fear is now going to be an enormous spotlight placed upon us at the August meeting, which is going to be interpreted as the moment of truth in deciding what happens now with the large-scale asset purchase programs.  I also thought that it might offset, to some degree, what I continue to fear is going to be the interpretation of market actors and economic observers more generally\u2014not simply that we failed to expand today, but, within the context of the announcement to come tomorrow, the announcement likely to come from the FDIC, and, precisely as President Fisher has noted, because there seems to be a demand that we talk about scaling back the program, that this inaction will be seen as a beginning response to those demands, which, for obvious reasons, I think is misplaced as a policy matter.  Having said all of that, I note that there is little or no appetite in the rest of the Open Market Committee for even this action and certainly not for what was included in the Bluebook as alternative A, which I actually wouldn\u2019t favor at this point either. So I would be prepared to go along with alternative B.   Let me now turn to the language issues in alternative B, which, as you can imagine, also reflect some of my concerns.  Like some of the earlier speakers, I find that the first paragraph is a bit too upbeat, not just for the way that I read the economy, but, again, for the conversation we had around this table earlier this morning.  It\u2019s not that there\u2019s anything in there that\u2019s wrong or that I disagree with. It\u2019s not what is said\u2014I guess it\u2019s more what was left unsaid.  I was trying to figure that out overnight following dinner at the embassy and the baseball game later on in the  evening. It lacks a reference to what so many of us commented on, which is our expectation of just how slow the recovery will be when it comes.  You see gradual resumption of sustainable growth in there, but the likelihood of a long period, and a rather halting one at that, is what came through in much of what all seventeen of us said earlier in the day.  I would welcome any suggestions from anybody else as to how we might add that idea.   The more important issue to me is the potential inclusion of the final bracketed sentence, which I think would be a significant policy mistake.  And I think that for several reasons. One is my substantive policy views, which I described earlier.  But, probably more importantly for the rest of you, I think it would be a mistake precisely because of the way these statements are read, so I\u2019m elaborating a bit on what Governor Warsh has said.  As everybody knows, anything regarded as new in these statements is invested with enormous significance.  By and large, the statement goes a little bit by increment\u2014a word is dropped here, a phrase is added there, and people kind of masticate those changes.  If you\u2019ve got something that is brand new, something that appears to be satisfying a demand from a certain group of market actors, I think that will be invested with enormous significance.  Under the circumstances, I don\u2019t see that the policy position of the Open Market Committee is there, and I, for one, don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to actually get there anytime soon.  I also agree with President Lacker in that I have difficulty understanding what that sentence actually means. It\u2019s either a tautology, in which case it\u2019s not particularly helpful, or it\u2019s suggesting something that I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually done in a policy sense. So I think it\u2019s both appropriate and important for the Chairman and others, either in public testimony or on background, to explicate the various considerations that were reflected in the very useful memos distributed by the staff.  But I do think that this would be the story of this Open Market Committee meeting if it were included.  Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you, everybody. I think that most of us are agreed that, given the improvement in the economy, there\u2019s not much need to change our policy stance today, so we should keep our programs in place on the schedule that we have already announced. That would bring us to alternative B, which I think is the right choice.  Most of you were in favor of striking the last sentence. I think that\u2019s the right decision.  I\u2019m reminded of an experience I had when I first took this job, when we were still raising interest rates.  Remember that.  I told a congressional committee that the time would come, eventually, when we would have to stop raising interest rates.  Of course, the expectation of an immediate rate change went right through the market, and I was completely flabbergasted by the inability of the markets to understand plain English.  [Laughter] But, unfortunately, that\u2019s reality.  So I think there would be a risk of suggesting that we were preparing to exit.  In this case, we are taking very substantial steps to address this particular issue, not just in testimony.  Our current plan is to have a significant description of exit strategy, tools, and so on, in the Monetary Policy Report, which would obviously be available to everyone in more detail than I could give in a short testimony.  So I would recommend dropping the last sentence.  We had some original language on tapering, and I think the problem that we were having with it was there\u2019s no way to describe our plans to taper without essentially determining at this point that we are almost certainly going to stop.  We may well do that, but I think if we can maintain that optionality for one more meeting it would probably be a good idea.  I think we could stop the Treasury program flat, or we could say we are doing $30 billion a month the rest of the year, or whatever, but I don\u2019t think that we need to take that decision yet. Two related things. President Yellen, supported by President Rosengren, brought up the mortgage rate issue, and I think she had two objectives.  One was to point to an important factor; the other was to kind of tone down the cheeriness of the first paragraph.  I have a specific concern with the mortgage rate sentence\u2014if we say that mortgage rates are a big problem, that\u2019s going to signal something about our asset purchase program, I\u2019m afraid, so that\u2019s a concern that I would have. But I do understand the issue about general tone.  Let me just raise this for consideration. The second sentence in alternative B, \u201cConditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months, and indicators of consumer and business sentiment have risen,\u201d is obviously a very positive sentence and one that has no parallel in the April statement.  We could, if people like, either strike the sentence entirely, or, perhaps to recognize that there has been general improvement in financial markets, strike the second part about consumer and business sentiment, which would change the tone a bit.  I don\u2019t know if that would satisfy the need. Governor Tarullo mentioned this as well.  Is there any response to that thought", " MR. TARULLO. I would find striking the sentence useful.  I think it would balance it a little bit better. Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Striking the whole sentence, is everyone okay with that"], "2009FOMC20090812meeting.txt": [" MR. BULLARD. I am looking at exhibit 4, figure 24, on mortgage spreads.  I just want to understand your interpretation of this chart.  I see toward the end here that conforming spreads come down dramatically and the ARMs come down dramatically, but you said that you thought  the purchase program did not have an effect on the ARMs.  That means just that the level is high", " MR. PLOSSER. I would like to go back to the point about the 3/1s, 5/1s, and 7/1s and whatever\u2014how that affects the credit scores, a point that President Fisher raised.  If we were to go in and concentrate our purchases in some subset of these ARMs, hence driving their rates down, then we expect the market response to that would be that maybe those credit scores wouldn\u2019t stay the same, that there would be a response where mortgage brokers and others would help direct people into those products for which we are trying to drive down the yields and make them more attractive.  I think there is going to be an endogenous response to that, and we have to be careful that we don\u2019t put ourselves in a position by which we are creating even more distortions than we already are by picking products in individual securities and trying to affect their individual prices and not others.  I think that is a very dangerous position for us to be in, and we end up perhaps aggravating problems and actually preventing markets from doing the healing that they need to do rather than just helping them along. My point is that there will be a demand response to this price change and that we cannot necessarily assume that we won\u2019t be, in effect, driving people to particular products and away from others, and I think that\u2019s something we have to be very, very careful of.  So I just think we should be very dubious about our strategy here in terms of making this work.  Also it runs a risk politically\u2014not economically, but politically\u2014and I think this is probably what President Fisher was suggesting. Actually the staff memo raised this issue.  Politically it looks as though we\u2019re going into something that everybody has been condemning as part of our problem, and I think we should be very, very careful about that. So I\u2019m just wondering, Eric, do you really think there wouldn\u2019t be a demand response to our driving. If Brian is right and we can drive down the yields on the 5/1s and 7/1s by 100 basis points, do you think that there wouldn\u2019t be a demand response to that and, therefore, that credit scores might, in fact, decline as opposed to being high", " MR. LACKER. But did you include the level of the yield curve.  This goes back to President Bullard\u2019s remark that it certainly seems as if you could look at the data and be forgiven for thinking that, when the overall yield curve is low, there is an effect depressing ARM rates because people think it\u2019s going to be mean reverting rather than just a random walk", " MR. LACKER. If I could follow up, Mr. Chairman\u2014you used the word \u201cdisrupted\u201d about the agency ARM market.  I am assuming that this yield spread and the quantities are part of the evidence that you would use to bolster that case.  So here is the question: It could be the case that you have qualitative observations bolstering the characterization as \u201cdisrupted\u201d\u2014things like market makers who have left the market, wider bid\u2013asked spreads, and the like.  But if it is just quantities and these spreads, I guess I find this less than compelling to qualify for the word \u201cdisrupted,\u201d the way I usually think of that. More broadly, we did intervene in the fixed-rate securitization market.  We would have predicted that the intervention would increase the flow of credit to that sector and reduce the flow of credit to other sectors.  It is exactly what we would have expected. So there is going to be an endless supply of other sectors that, because of our intervention, now are seeing less credit than they otherwise would.  So are we on a treadmill here that we will do this and then we will find that interest-only ARMs really deserve some help, and we will do that.  What are the criteria here for drawing a boundary between where we are intervening and where we are not.  I am not sure I see it in the way you have laid out the pros and cons\u2014it makes it seem as if we just assemble a pro and con list and see what wins each time", " MR. LACKER. Well, I think the bid\u2013asked spread in any market would go up if the volume went down.  I wonder what happened in \u201998, \u201999, and 2001 to the bid\u2013asked spread.  Do you have a benchmark against which to compare those bid\u2013asked spreads and view them as too high, or is it just a byproduct of the low issuance", " MR. SACK. We don\u2019t have a nice time series of bid\u2013asked spreads.  In part because there is no electronic platform, we don\u2019t have a nice data source to give us a long historical perspective", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Let the record show that President Lacker\u2019s reference to ARMs dealers had to do with mortgages and not with other things.  [Laughter] A short intervention, President Plosser", " MR. HOENIG. In a sense this is going to carry the discussion where it has already been, but if I remember right, we had some discussion of this at the last FOMC meeting and went against going forward with it at the time.  And given my sense of things, although things remain fragile in the housing market and elsewhere, things have improved.  They are better than they were. It is not that I mind having it brought back, but I am wondering, Brian, what has happened between the last FOMC and this FOMC that makes this worth bringing back for discussion.  The market is not perfect yet.  We still have this distortion in the ARMs, but there is some improvement showing.  I think that the markets will straighten out with time, especially if the economy is on a healing path.  Is there enough need for this to accelerate the recovery or settle out the markets to bring this back and reconsider it at this meeting", " MR. LACKER. Yes. This has to do with our asset purchase program.  I want to refer to chart 25, \u201cBalance Sheet Assets by Category,\u201d on the last page of your presentation.  It looks as if, when we buy our large-scale assets, short-term liquidity facility usage goes down.  That suggests that maybe banks have a certain amount of reserves they want to hold, and when we buy stuff, they have to borrow less to have the reserves they want to hold.  In fact, reserves went down in the last intermeeting period, and we keep missing the forecast of reserve balances and short-term liquidity facility usage on the low side as we ramp up these purchases.  My understanding is that you go around facility by facility and construct these forecasts, and then reserves sort of pop out as the residual. Now we are going to keep purchasing assets, and my understanding is that the forecast says that we are going to take reserve balances from $700 billion to $1.4 trillion.  There is an interesting memo by Charles Sims and Kevin McDonald on the MarketSource website that forecasts balances for the large banks and for various bank categories like community banks.  My sense is that there is a sort of judgmental forecast as to how the shares of total reserve balances are going to change, but it has Bank of America\u2014this is the largest holder\u2014going from $140 billion to something over $250 billion.  I checked this morning.  They are planning to reduce their reserve balances over the next several months, and the reason is that the cost of carry is too high.  I mean, it is valuable to them in terms of the liquidity it gives them; but at 25 basis points, it is below their cost of funds, and they are planning to shift funds into cash equivalents, like Treasuries and agencies, that are higher yielding and have a lower cost to carry. So my question is, What effects do you expect, if this hypothesis is true, of our expanding large-scale asset purchases enough that short-term liquidity facility usage is driven to zero and yet reserve balances keep going up.  What yields are going to change to get banks to hold this. How does that square with the Greenbook\u2019s forecast that yields increase rather than decrease over the period.  And how much stimulus does that provide, in some broad sense.  I realize that is a tall order, but I am just raising the question of whether there is a discrete change in the sense of the stimulus we provide as we cross that threshold", "   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. This is how quantitative easing works.  You induce banks to substitute away from reserves, but they have to hold the reserves in the end", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Well, these asset-purchase plans are not set in stone.  We began them in March at a time of very weak conditions.  We have reviewed them at each meeting.  And if we decide there is too much stimulus in the economy, given our projections, then we can reduce them. So they are a choice variable at each meeting.  But you have just described exactly the way the quantitative easing part of this is supposed to work", " MR. LACKER. Yes, I know. But is this consistent.  I mean, this suggests that, when we cross this threshold, there will be a discrete downward effect on these longer yields.  We may want that; we may not", "   MR. MCANDREWS. Thank you, Seth. I will update the Committee on the possibility of creating reserve collateral accounts as a means to achieve better control of the federal funds rate using interest on reserves.  As you know, the effective federal funds rate has generally been lower than the interest rate paid on excess reserves since October 2008, and the size of this divergence has fluctuated over time. Competition among banks might be expected to narrow that divergence because buying funds and placing them on deposit at their Federal Reserve Bank is both relatively inexpensive and completely risk free.  One explanation for the divergence is that imperfections in the fed funds market short-circuit the competitive process by which the fed funds rate would be bid up.  Some banks are paying, for example, 15 basis points to borrow and then earn 25 basis points at the Fed, but other banks are not bidding up the rate to 16 basis points or higher.  Reserve collateral accounts are intended to facilitate competition that would bid up the rate and generate a tighter link between the interest rate paid on excess reserves and the market rate.  Creating this tighter link now would help dispel doubts about the Fed\u2019s ability to use interest on excess reserves to raise the fed funds rate when the time comes. Why isn\u2019t competition bidding up rates more efficiently.  One possible reason is that counterparty credit risk impedes rate-based competition.  Fed funds trades are uncollateralized loans. Consequently, a firm must carefully select its counterparties and limit the amount lent to each of them.  These restrictions limit competition for funds. If a firm could be freed from concern about its counterparty\u2019s credit quality, it could search among a wider set of firms for higher bids and for larger trade sizes.  Reserve collateral accounts, or RCAs, would create the possibility of collateralized fed funds trades, which would allow many more banks to bid for funds in the market. How do RCAs facilitate collateralized fed funds trades.  To begin, note that an analysis of data from Fedwire suggests that, in July 2009, approximately half of the daily average of $125 billion of fed funds trades consisted of GSEs lending to banks, with the other half consisting of bank-to-bank trades.  So suppose that two firms, a GSE and a bank, agree to use RCAs to conduct collateralized fed funds trades.  The bank would request that its Federal Reserve Bank create an RCA, separate from the bank\u2019s master account.  The account would have a unique feature:  The bank could not wire funds out of its own RCA. The funds in the account would, however, earn interest on reserves for the bank paid at the rate on excess reserves.  Under the terms of their collateralized fed funds trade, the GSE would wire funds into the bank\u2019s RCA, and the next day, the GSE would pull the funds out of the bank\u2019s RCA back into its own account, using the operational capabilities of the Fed\u2019s National Settlement Service.  So the account can be thought of as a locked box into which funds are placed and to which the GSE is given the key.  The funds are put into the box by the GSE at night, they earn interest for the bank, and the GSE retrieves the funds the next day. Separately, the GSE and the bank agree on what interest rate the GSE would earn from the deal.   This arrangement would be governed by agreements among the Federal Reserve Bank, the GSE, and the bank, in which the Fed would acknowledge that the GSE has a lien on the funds in the RCA. That acknowledgement would allow the GSE to perfect a security interest in the account.  As a result, if the bank with which it was doing the deals failed, the GSE would still get back its principal, as the funds in the account would be collateral for repayment.  With the infrastructure of RCAs in place, we could expect the GSEs and other firms, perhaps including banks, to establish RCAs with banks if they can earn higher rates by doing so.  Parties to RCA agreements would be free to borrow or lend on an uncollateralized basis; this possibility should help in aligning short-term rates through arbitrage activity. Another possible impediment to competition for funds in the current environment might come from banks\u2019 balance sheet concerns.  Some banks might fear that their buffer of capital to assets above minimum levels is too low for them to bid aggressively for funds. Establishing an RCA would be most attractive to those banks with the least balance sheet concerns, because they would be willing to pay the highest rates. In this way, RCAs would allow market prices to be determined by the banks that are best positioned to purchase funds, which would further reduce the divergence of market rates from the interest rate paid on excess reserves. Our next step would be to approach a number of the GSEs and some banks to gauge their views as to the feasibility of RCAs and their attractiveness.  If a sufficient appetite for these arrangements appears to exist, Federal Reserve staff would then plan to establish a Systemwide steering group to form a precise timeline for all the implementation steps and to determine if any remaining unforeseen impediments to the creation of RCAs exist. I now turn to Bill Nelson, who will update the Committee on issues in the TALF program", " MR. BURKE. Our main tool for measuring the fed funds rate is the \u201cfed funds effective,\u201d which is looking at just that subset of fed funds transactions that are brokered.  And in that market, the GSEs dominate.  They are 80-plus percent of those transactions.  So when you start talking about doing something to those transactions, that is the backdrop to my statement that, if you remove those, you leave a small and potentially idiosyncratic market from which you are then calculating an effective fed funds rate.  So, to Seth\u2019s point, a $75 billion program  targeted at them is not much with a backdrop of $700 billion or $1.4 trillion in excess, but it may be that their role and where they are trading and the visibility of their trades imply another transmission mechanism affecting just them.  That is one of the things that we are trying to puzzle out", " MR. BURKE. We have been working with our payment systems folks in New York, who have been working on identifying the issues with the triparty platform and working on alternatives to the triparty platform, which is, as you noted, based on those two institutions.  As we know with Bear and Lehman and the outcomes there, there are clearly issues with that system.  So, yes, we are somewhat concerned.  And I think, with the PDCF sunset date coming and the role that it is playing in backstopping triparty, clearly some issues are there.  A number of ideas have floated around. Some are less difficult to implement than others, but we are going to follow along with that work and, I hope, piggyback on that. We have started to think a bit about alternatives.  The scale of our program is such that it is going to carry a lot of weight whatever we do, so we are being quite cautious.  But depending on who our counterparties end up being, it is entirely possible that we could create our own sort of mini triparty with another clearing bank, say a State Street or something along those lines.  There are an awful lot of issues with that.  For that piece of the program, we would end up with a single clearing bank that was working on it. So it is absolutely an issue, it is a concern, and we are concerned about it, but we will continue to follow the progress of other groups", "   VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Then you don\u2019t have to worry about the GSEs contaminating your observations of the brokered funds market.  You know, a lot of this is an effort to take the GSEs and the fact that they are contaminating that market.  There might be an easier way to ignore that market and go to the broader market", " MR. SHEETS. I think it is very much the intention of the Chinese authorities to continue these policies until they see the pickup in external demand.  Governor Tarullo used the analogy at the last meeting of the Chinese being in a holding pattern, waiting for the global economy to pick up, and I think that is exactly the right analogy.  I guess what I am wondering and what I am questioning is whether they can calibrate this stimulus, particularly the awesome monetary stimulus, in such a way that they are able to build a bridge from where they are to the time when global demand picks up and whether there might not be some significant imbalances that manifest themselves between now and that point in time. One way to articulate this concern very concretely is that I very much doubt that six months ago the Chinese authorities came to the conclusion that in the second quarter of the year they wanted to put in stimulus such that the economy would expand at an 18\u00bd percent annual rate. The fact that they got this outcome really emphasizes the blunt nature of the policy tools they have. If they overshoot in the second quarter, I see that there is a risk they may further overshoot on the upside or significantly undershoot on the downside. So I just don\u2019t fully see what the exit strategy is.  Earlier this decade, people were very concerned about a hard landing in China, and they were able to thread the needle.  Maybe they will be able to do that again.  In fact, for what it is worth, that is what our forecast has written down as a baseline against which to talk about these risks.  So there is a chance that they will be able to grow at 9 percent on average for the next six quarters or the next couple of years.  But I for one am very concerned.  I see this rebound in China as really being the key driver of a lot of what we have seen in the global economy, certainly in emerging Asia and Japan and even echoes   of it in certain places in Europe, such as Germany, where exports are picking up.  So if the pace of Chinese recovery steps down, we are looking at a much softer global outlook than we are with a stronger China or a Chinese growth path similar to what we have in the forecast", "   MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Having exhausted my limited stock of witticisms about coming last in line before the Chairman, I asked Debbie to move me up.  [Laughter] But I also wanted to come a little earlier because, even in the five months since my first FOMC meeting, a lot has changed.  At that time, we were contemplating essentially two scenarios, very bad and even worse. In no small part because of the various actions of the Federal Reserve, the financial system and the economy have largely stabilized, albeit at historically lower levels than we would certainly like to see. It seems very likely now there will be positive, perhaps quite positive, growth in the second half of this year. As for 2010, more upside risk has crept into many people\u2019s forecasts.  So in thinking about our policies going forward, we may be at a point at which it is useful to consider alternative outcomes in a roughly probabilistic fashion and to test how readily we can craft the narrative that leads to each outcome.  It would be a bit quixotic of me to undertake this task for all seven of the Greenbook scenarios to which Larry alluded earlier, so let me distill the manifold possibilities to just three.  One, grind it out\u2014a gradual, somewhat halting recovery that leads to 2010 growth somewhere in the vicinity of trend but below what one might expect in a rebound from a severe slump.  Two, relapse\u2014a significant stumble for the recovery next year, with GDP growth again dropping significantly below trend.  And, three, rejuvenation\u2014a much more robust recovery, with GDP growth significantly exceeding trend, not quite a V-shape perhaps but a reasonably steep slope on the way up. So just to put my cards on the table, I would assign roughly even odds to the first possible outcome, the grind-out scenario.  Not coincidentally, I regard the Greenbook extended baseline to be consistent with this outcome.  Although I am somewhat less optimistic about next year than the staff is, I note that their forecast for the second half of this year is pretty conservative.  So ifone averages out their forecast over six quarters, it yields something akin to the first outcome.  Of the remaining two, I see a somewhat greater chance of relapse than of rejuvenation, though I should say that I now regard the odds of the two alternative outcomes as considerably less skewed than I thought as recently as the June meeting.  So clearly I find the story of measured recovery the easiest to tell, in part because the very factors that augur well for the remainder of 2009 may not have sufficient staying power to maintain a healthy pace of recovery through all of next year. The salutary effects of the fiscal stimulus package will start tapering off in the first part of next year. The undoubted need for firms to replenish their inventories will lead to sustained production increases only if consumption increases can themselves be generated and maintained.  The case for a steady increase in personal consumption expenditures is certainly plausible, but it is hardly compelling. According to the reported employment cost index, private wages and salaries have been decelerating. With large and still growing slack in labor markets, there is good reason to believe that personal income will continue to suffer from rising unemployment and suppressed wage gains. Moreover, there remains, as Larry mentioned, the important question of what saving rate we will see once incomes do begin to rise again.  The Greenbook makes a reasonable case based on past experience for a 4 percent rate, but the present crisis may contain the seeds of a behavioral shift among some classes of consumers that could move the rate up a percentage point or more. It appears that even the new normalcy in credit availability, both retail and wholesale, may be some way off.  The progress in the corporate bond markets, and to a lesser degree short-term funding markets and plain vanilla securitization markets, has not extended to credit markets more generally. In particular, the rate of decline in bank lending has been accelerating during thespring and summer.  There will doubtless be multiple revisions to the July figures, but the preliminary estimate of a whopping 18 percent decline spread across all forms of lending is a sobering reminder of the difficulties ahead.  While a considerable part of this drop is surely attributable to the decline in demand and cautiousness in underwriting that are typical of recessions, it seems likely that there are also structural factors in both bank lending and credit markets, such as capital impairment and business model challenges, that will weigh on credit markets for some time. I can certainly tell the other two stories\u2014though with less conviction and, in the interest of time, more briefly.  A relapse could occur if privately generated demand cannot adequately fill in behind the waning effect of fiscal stimulus, given such factors as the expected persistently high levels of unemployment; the potential for more-rapid efforts to repair personal, corporate, and financial balance sheets; and the severe retrenchment of sub-federal government spending that is coming in the next two budget cycles.  If commercial real estate markets turn out to be even moderately worse than currently expected\u2014bad enough\u2014loan losses at many regional and community banks could become truly debilitating.   Rejuvenation might come if both confidence and wealth are significantly boosted by a continuation of the equity market rally and a more rapid recovery of housing markets.  The latter of course would also prompt a greater rebound in construction.  Along with the effects of pent-up consumer demand for durables and other items, these developments could provide not just a substitute for fiscal stimulus but a boost beyond the temporary effects of cash-for-clunkers, infrastructure investment, and the various income transfer features of the February legislative package. Global economic recovery, particularly in Asia, may proceed more quickly with an attendant boost to U.S. export growth.  While I can sketch out this more optimistic path, each of   its elements seems quite a bit less likely than those supporting the more sluggish outcome and modestly less likely than the catalyst for relapse. I will be interested to hear if some of you can tell this last tale more convincingly.  For the present, though, what I think is most important in my little exercise is that the chances of next year being somewhere between tepid and bad appear to me somewhere north of 75 percent in the absence of further monetary or fiscal policy measures.  Where exactly along that spectrum the actual outcome falls will probably not become much clearer for some time.  If this is a reasonable way of looking at things, our best-advised posture for at least a few more, and maybe more than a few more, meetings may be the somewhat unsatisfactory and awkward one of neither lifting another implement out of our toolbox nor closing the box up and declaring the job finished. Mom was right at least sometimes:  Patience really can be a virtue.  [Laughter] Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The data since the last meeting have been broadly consistent with what we expected in our June forecast.  We have received confirmation that the economy has improved significantly from the sharp declines in the first quarter. Economic growth in the second half of 2009 is likely to be positive, albeit too slow to prevent further job losses. Our forecast still expects a weak recovery as the balance sheets of consumers, businesses, and banks slowly improve.  The improvement is, of course, contingent on no significant adverse shocks appearing over the next year.  It also assumes that households and businesses will increase spending, as the stimulus provided by the variety of fiscal and monetary programs subsides\u2014a component of the forecast that remains quite tentative at this point.  That the rate of decline in payroll employment in July was much slower than earlier in the year is welcome news.  However, the unemployment rate is quite high and is likely to remain quite elevated for several more years.  With many workers on reduced hours and much of the labor force still concerned about their job prospects, workers are accepting much lower growth in wages and benefits. Models run by economists in my research department that estimate inflation as a markup over labor costs, as well as many specifications of traditional Phillips curves used to forecast inflation, imply outcomes closer to the disinflation scenario in the Greenbook.  Thus, there is a significant downside risk to the baseline forecast to inflation. Significant impediments to the recovery, of which I will highlight just two, also remain.  Until recently, most complaints by businesses in New England regarding credit availability were from customers of large, out-of-region banks that needed TARP capital.  However, there are increasing complaints that small and medium-sized banks are now behaving as if they are capital constrained, despite New England\u2019s smaller exposure to the real estate and auto-related problems that plague many other parts of the country.  The problem appears particularly acute for commercial real estate. Part 2 of the Greenbook characterizes commercial real estate as dismal.  Most of my contacts are using much more colorful language.  Problems with commercial real estate look likely to get worse, and many banks\u2019 loan loss reserves already lag with the growth in nonperforming loans. Tight credit conditions are likely to make it difficult for businesses and households to finance spending critical for the recovery.  A second potential concern is the unintended consequences of some of the remedies to recent problems.  One example is money market mutual funds, which have experienced declines in assets as investors have increased their risk appetite, as Brian highlighted. At the same time, the SEC is considering measures that would   reduce the risk of mutual funds, including potentially prohibiting purchases of asset-backed commercial paper and A2/P2 commercial paper and reducing the weighted average maturity of holdings. While reducing the risk of mutual funds is desirable, if poorly implemented it could disrupt asset markets where mutual funds have been key players.  Although I am cautiously optimistic that the recovery is beginning, the situation remains quite fragile.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook for the economy has not changed materially since the last meeting.  I think we\u2019re in the beginning stages of what is likely to be an exceptionally slow recovery. In the period since the last FOMC, we engaged our contacts in the Sixth District and elsewhere around the country on the questions of slack in the economy, inflationary pressures, the inventory situation, and the state of the real estate sector, particularly commercial real estate. In residential real estate, we are seeing more stability in sales and prices in our District, even in the Florida markets.  The exception to this improved picture is the market for condominiums in large urban areas, which remains burdened by oversupply and very slow sales, due in part to very limited credit availability.  The commercial real estate sector is still deteriorating and poses a threat to recovery in its potential drag on the credit system.  Our  District contacts reported rising vacancy rates across every significant market and property type, resulting in widespread rent concessions.  Financial contacts opined that so far delinquency, default, and valuation problems have been managed through restructuring but pointed out that much of the refinancing calendar is ahead. The Southeast has a sizable leisure and hospitality industry, which is suffering from a slow tourist season. Even with pervasive rate concessions, hospitality and resort vacancy rates are high. We asked a number of contacts about inventory levels and the direction of inventories.  We got the sense that inventory reduction has a bit further to go before firms align their inventories-to-sales prospects.  Business contacts at all points along the spectrum from materials manufacturing to retail claim that they are still cutting inventories.  Furthermore, based on these conversations, I doubt that inventories will be replenished to pre-recession levels as the economy improves.  This projection of businesses running on leaner inventories on an extended basis contributes to my view that the recovery will be exceptionally weak. In the latest round of calls made in preparation for this meeting, we probed contacts about their perceptions on available production capacity and willingness to rehire in a recovery.  We heard that a large share of what is counted as excess production capacity should not be considered standing ready to be brought back into service.  Contacts expressed unwillingness to bring previously idled capacity, including permanent hires, back on line without much stronger buyer commitments and better margins.  This suggests much less disinflation potential in a slow-growth scenario than would otherwise be the case. In this cycle, our financial market contacts exhibited much more confidence and described an unwinding of the flight to quality based on the view that a catastrophic scenario has been avoided. These contacts reported that they believe markets in general have confidence and,   more particularly, that the Fed has the tools to engineer an exit strategy as recovery proceeds.  A widely held concern, however, is the timing of exit and the risk of a premature exit.  In preparation for the meeting, we had a long conference call with several representatives of the American Securitization Forum in an attempt to gauge the rebound of the securitization sector and its ability to support consumer activity.  We talked about the TALF earlier today, and they said that the TALF had been successful in bringing back the triple-A segment, but they cited a number of factors that pointed to a protracted period of less securitization.  This adds to my view that consumer spending broadly will be constrained over at least the medium term.  I think it\u2019s plausible that a major shift in household spending appetite is under way.  But even if no structural change in consumer behavior is building, consumer credit markets seem to be weighed down by a still-compromised securitization process and constraints on credit card terms and issuance. My view of the outlook is less optimistic than the Greenbook\u2019s baseline scenario.  There are elements of the Greenbook\u2019s \u201chigher saving rate\u201d and \u201clabor market damage\u201d scenarios in my current thinking about recovery. I see an economy burdened by voluntarily restrained and credit-constrained consumer spending, a still-challenged financial industry that will be slow to expand credit, weak re-employment prospects, and what we believe is lower growth potential during a period of necessary structural adjustments.  In light of this expected sluggish pace of recovery, I see the risks to economic growth as still weighted to the downside.   My view of inflation risks is roughly balanced.  I do not get a sense that inflationary pressures are on the rise, and I don\u2019t see any indication that businesses and households are acting on inflation concerns in any way that would suggest that inflation expectations are currently on the rise. That said, in almost every venue I am hearing strong concerns that inflationary  pressures will develop in the intermediate term as the economy recovers.  And to anticipate the policy discussion just a bit, I don\u2019t think these concerns warrant an immediate policy response, but they do tell me that our messaging is dealing with challenging crosscurrents and is particularly crucial at this time.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My contacts are growing more confident that the sharp decline in economic activity is in the process of ending.  Auto producers are benefiting from the very popular cash-for-clunkers program.  The success of this program is now showing up not just in sales but also in plants restarting or increasing production.  Similarly, housing markets in my District appear to be stabilizing, with starts actually heading up.  This, of course, is welcome news to the producers of building materials, who have been waiting a long time to see any signs of a recovery in housing. Still, it would be hard to characterize the mood of business executives in my District as good. \u201cResignation\u201d is a better summary.  The declines in their activity levels have been so large that the uptick in growth that they are now experiencing is easily being met either by inventories or by only incremental increases in production.  Most of my business contacts anticipate that their surplus capacity will continue for months or even years to come.  They agree with President Fisher\u2019s view that there is too much of everything relative to demand. The auto industry remains a clear example.  A number of assembly plants in my District are not going to survive the restructuring that has already been announced.  When I consider only the plants in my District that are going to continue to produce after the restructuring is completed, I find that those auto assembly plants produced 2.3 million cars and light trucks in 2007. Toyota and Honda plants account for over half of the total.  Now, to give you an example of how low production has been for the past few months, in June these same plants collectively produced less than 36 percent of their 2007 output.  Honda and Toyota were operating at well less than two-thirds of their 2007 levels, while the Big Three were at roughly 10 percent of their 2007 levels. The cash-for-clunkers program has been viewed as a national success, boosting July auto sales by 16 percent above June sales. Nevertheless, while this was a sizable percentage increase at the national level, this represents just a month\u2019s worth of 2007 production capacity for the surviving plants in my District.  This is hardly a dent in the excess capacity available in this entire industry. The problem is not limited to autos.  Primary metal producers, as an example, are operating at less than 50 percent of their capacity.  One community banker in my District who noted improving economic conditions cautioned that every plant in her region is operating on some form of reduced workweek.  In fact, the dominant reaction of business people in my District to date has not been to close plants permanently but rather to hunker down and manage output levels to match current demand by cutting back on labor or other variable inputs.  Workforces have largely accepted a variety of pay and hour cutbacks to make these lower levels of output possible. This downward pressure on wages is showing up strongly both in the employment cost index and, as we saw, in yesterday\u2019s unit labor cost numbers.  While this pattern might sound as if it is limited just to the Midwest, international producers report similar experiences in their locations worldwide.  From the producer standpoint, it is just hard to see an impending acceleration of prices, although the growing stability in output does seem to have been enough to limit further discounting. To gain further insight on the output gap, I met with a group of academic advisers who worked on different models that try various approaches of evaluating the output gap over the business cycle.  They all essentially agreed with my business contacts\u2019 opinions that it is likely to take a long time before this output gap is absorbed.  Combining their perspective with the information that I gathered from my business contacts, I ended up leaving my output projection largely consistent with my forecast at the last meeting, which has been broadly consistent with the Greenbook\u2019s viewpoint on output. I expect output to grow slowly in the second half of this year, followed by a return to more-solid growth rates next year. Although I expect inflation to dip in the coming months, my outlook for core inflation calls for a gradual climb back toward 2 percent in the next two or three years.  My inflation outlook runs a little higher than the Greenbook baseline, largely because of differences in our views of where inflation expectations will settle out.  And although the large output gap in my outlook does serve as a disinflationary pressure, the research on this issue leads me to be cautious about how much effect this output gap is going to exert on my inflation projection. So the risks to my outlook remain to the downside for output because the improvements that I have seen, notably in housing and auto sales, have relied on stimulus programs that may be quickly depleted and a still uncertain recovery in consumer spending.  My talks with both researchers and business people leave me with a lot of uncertainty about the inflation trend, and I see those risks remaining symmetric.  So while the news has been encouraging, I think watchful waiting seems like the right course for monetary policy to me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, favor alternative B (revised). Despite the series of positive surprises that President Stern pointed out yesterday, since March the center of gravity of expectations around this table is for a slow recovery\u2014maybe a little faster than the Greenbook but not much\u2014and damped inflation.   I think it is way too early to signal that we are thinking about withdrawing or cutting back on stimulus, so that leaves one with two consequences.  I would keep the \u201cextended period\u201d language in there unchanged, and I would not curtail the large-scale asset-purchase programs.  I would complete our announced purchases, with the possible exception of the agency securities, as that market is not liquid enough.  I would taper off those mortgage-backed security purchases over the fourth quarter and maybe into the first quarter to get up to the total, but I am okay with waiting until next meeting to tell the public what we are going to do there.  I think the public is expecting something like alternative B (revised).  They won\u2019t miss it, and we can do that next time.  I am okay with winding up the Treasury purchase program.  The economic situation is improving.  There are some costs in terms of concerns about the exit strategy and our ability to keep inflation low. But I wouldn\u2019t rule out anything for the future, including resuming the purchases under certain circumstances.   I think we need to keep all our options open.  As President Rosengren just said, the central tendency itself isn\u2019t a really satisfactory outcome relative to our legislative mandate.  There is huge uncertainty. And while there is upside risk, there is still a lot of downside risk as well. And, there are nontrivial odds on whether we get a slow recovery, inflation begins to abate, unemployment rises, and bank losses mount further, and we are back into a kind of adverse feedback loop in the financial markets.  I don\u2019t think that is what is going to happen, but I think there is some possibility.  There are lots of things we need to think about if the economy starts going down and if we start getting into a deflationary situation. In that case, if we were to resume Treasury purchases while inflation was going down and while the economy was weakening, there wouldn\u2019t be adverse consequences for inflation expectations.  So all of those things lead me to want to keep all of the options open, and I think alternative B (revised) does a good job of that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we need to be very careful going forward and watch the banking system very carefully as we continue with our large-scale asset-purchase program, as we discussed yesterday.  I don\u2019t think of discussing cutting back on additional purchases as withdrawing stimulus so much as reducing the size of the planned increase in stimulus.  Our understanding of just what will happen when we reach this discontinuity, when our asset holdings drive short-term liquidity facility usage to zero, is significant.  And there is a chance that we may inadvertently at that time begin increasing our stimulus quite powerfully and more than we expect and more than we intend, just at a time when we are starting to consider withdrawing stimulus or reducing the amount of stimulus we provide in light of a strengthening economy. I see some merit in alternative C for this reason\u2014to hedge our bets somewhat with the economy turning and downside risk moderating.  In addition, I think there are abundant reasons\u2014at least, I see abundant reasons\u2014to be deeply uncomfortable with large-scale holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities. There is a sense\u2014and I think this was explicitly acknowledged in the design of the program\u2014that it is impeding a structural transition to whatever is next by way of the configuration of our housing finance system.  But it also involves some very serious political entanglements that I have alluded to before and that give me pause about our ability to flexibly shed that portfolio should we find the need to do so. However, I am prepared at this meeting to support alternative B (revised) for now.  Along with President Stern, I think it is a little premature to scale back our announcement about what  we intend with mortgage-backed securities.  But, again, we need to be very watchful of what is going on in the banking system with reserve holdings, and it might be good to mount an effort to do that on a very systematic and granular basis.  More broadly, with the economy turning, I think it is time to stop looking around for credit spreads to fix.  As I said yesterday, our interventions in some segments of the credit market have reduced the supply of credit to other segments, and there are always going to be markets in which some spreads are elevated compared with the spreads that prevail in markets in which we have intervened.  That is just always going to be the case from now on.  Moreover, continuing to add market segments or to extend the life of programs beyond this point in the business cycle could be mistaken for an intention that we will extend our intervention deeper into the next expansion.   We have talked a lot about exit strategy. But when we have done so, it has been in the narrow sense of the capacity to manipulate our balance sheet and our policy tools in a way so as to raise the federal funds rate. Mr. Chairman, you have done a very good job of articulating our capacity and the tools we have for doing that and, I think, have allayed a lot of concerns in the public\u2019s mind about our ability.  But one byproduct of the way in which we have done that is that some of the means of doing so allow for the continued coexistence of fairly broad and deep intervention\u2014in other words, a large balance sheet and raising interest rates on reserves and so raising the funds rate without reducing our balance sheet.   That leaves open the broader question about our intervention in credit markets.  I think the other sense of exit strategy that we need to ponder is the nature of our engagement in credit markets and what transition that is going to display over the next couple of years.  I am assuming\u2014I may be wrong as we haven\u2019t talked about this\u2014that at some point in the expansion we will want it to be the case that we are no longer intervening in any market, even MBS.  And Ithink that communicating about that transition would be useful and thinking about it would be useful as well. We have intervened on the basis that emergencies in credit markets warrant protecting the economy from damage from credit market malfunctions.  And when the economy recovers and is growing strongly, it seems to me that the compelling need for that will be diminished.  On the other hand, it is not clear that we have articulated principles that would necessarily lead an observer to believe that in an expansion we wouldn\u2019t be intervening.  I refer again to the list of pros and cons that we heard yesterday about agency ARMs that make it seem as if elevated credit spreads are a primary consideration for a lot of these programs.  So I think it would useful for us to think more broadly about the transition we intend to make from the current level of engagement and intervention in credit markets to whatever the sort of normalcy is beyond that. This sets aside what we want people to expect from us in the next recession, which is another problem as well and another set of issues we need to grapple with at some point. But, again, I can support alternative B (revised).  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Any other questions or comments.  Yes", " MR. LACKER. Excuse me, I just want to be clear about the question.  You have described the forecasting procedure that goes program by program and neglects any consideration of the demand for reserves. And we keep missing on that basis in a way that suggests that the demand for reserves is driving demand for liquidity facilities, not the other way around. So I just raise the question. That is why I was asking.  Mr. Chairman, you called for a robust discussion next meeting of the MBS program; I think that is great.  This consideration,which we have been discussing, deserves some attention there, too.  What staff work could be done on that might be useful as well"], "2009FOMC20090923meeting.txt": [" VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I just want to amplify on Brian\u2019s answer.  First, I think the effect would be 15 to 30 basis points at a minimum, because by the end of this week we\u2019re going to have done about $895 billion of agency MBS purchases. So to cap it at a trillion means you are only doing $105 billion as opposed to $355 billion.  So it\u2019s a pretty sizable discrete difference. Second, the market would take it as an independent signal about how concerned or unconcerned the Fed was with the economic outlook.  They probably would also pull forward the timing of Fed tightening.  So there\u2019d probably be a separate channel in terms of the effects on   yields. I think Brian\u2019s 15 to 30 basis points is conservative, if you add those two effects together", "   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Other questions.  Let me just recognize you, President Bullard. But let\u2019s not get completely into the debate at this point.  [Laughter] We\u2019re still in Q&A mode.  President Bullard", " MR. PLOSSER. I\u2019d like to go back to this estimate of the effects of cutting back purchases from $1\u00bc trillion to $1 trillion. I\u2019m looking at exhibit 4, chart 20.  The effect on yields is somewhere\u2014let\u2019s just take a modal number\u2014between 50 and 75 basis points.  I thought the argument had been that it is the stock that matters, not flow so much.  If we cut from $1\u00bc trillion to $1 trillion, that\u2019s one-fifth of the total stock.  If you do a back-of-the-envelope calculation\u2014divide 75 basis points by five\u2014that would suggest somewhere between 10 and 15 basis points, not somewhere between 25 and 50 basis points.  So I\u2019m not quite sure I understand the argument that by cutting the program by one-fifth we\u2019re going to take away as much as half or three-quarters of the basis point cut that the dealers seem to think there has been. Could you clarify that for me", " MR. SACK. We try to retain some flexibility for varying the flow of purchases in response to market conditions and in response to the kinds of offers that we receive.  That\u2019s the main answer.  I think it would be problematic if the market had no sense of what our pace of   purchases was going to be, or what kind of target we were trying to get to.  But they know all of that, so we just afford ourselves some ability to vary over time in response to market conditions. We do exercise discretion in terms of how much to push the markets on any given day, especially in the MBS program and in the agency debt program.  We will have a target for purchasing, currently around $25 billion a week for MBS, but what we actually realize in a given week depends on the market conditions that we see and how much we seem able to buy without causing problems in market functioning.  So the main answer is that we don\u2019t commit to a schedule of purchase amounts, because we want to retain that flexibility", " MR. SACK. But we don\u2019t pre-commit to the size\u2014that\u2019s what I meant.  In the agency market, a lot of the feedback is anecdotal.  We look at trading volumes, we look at bid\u2013asked spreads, but we also rely a lot on discussions with market participants.  And we see a number of things. For example, for a time we weren\u2019t buying on-the-run issues.  We were only buying off-the-run issues. And what we saw was actually a reverse on-the-run premium develop, in the sense that the on-the-run yields were actually higher than all of the off-the-run yields. So we certainly look at this market and say, \u201cWell, our purchases are really pushing prices a lot. They are taking a lot of the floating supply in the market.\u201d  And we hear back from dealers that they are affecting dealers\u2019 willingness to short issues out of fear that there is not enough floating supply to cover those positions.  So we look at a variety of evidence. This isn\u2019t too controversial. We are very big in that market.  I think in the last briefing I indicated that our purchases were something like ten times the net issuance in the agency sector that we expected over the program.  So we are very big relative to issuance and the size of that market, and it\u2019s quite clear that that\u2019s causing some problems for marketing functioning", " MR. SACK. For the Treasury purchases and the MBS purchases, I would say the answer is yes, I think we\u2019ve had a substantial effect on market interest rates.  Assuming your objective was to lower market interest rates and simulate economic activity, I think those programs have been very successful. It\u2019s less clear how the agency debt purchase program has led to those effects. Obviously, there are indirect channels through affecting the agencies\u2019 ability to finance themselves and maybe their purchases of mortgages.  But they\u2019re not expanding their balance sheets, so I would say the benefits of that program are less clear to me", "  Internally, the RCA concept has been discussed with the System\u2019s Accounting Management Steering Group (AMSG)", " MR. LACKER.  So if they say they weren\u2019t going to change lending terms, would you interpret that to mean they wouldn\u2019t change the spread", "  MR. LACKER. Did you say they\u2019re putting it through their standard new product evaluation.  [Laughter] And finally, a point about term deposits.  You were talking about some features that would make these pretty liquid\u2014they\u2019d be able to pledge them at the discount window and withdraw them without penalty. If you make these things really accessible, then I\u2019m not sure why draining reserves and putting them there would have any effect.  Why would you expect that. Don\u2019t you need some stark, sharp, constraining differences in order for them to have any sort of monetary effect", " MR. ENGLISH. I think that\u2019s the first peak", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two questions.  The first is for Bill and the second one is either for Bill or maybe for Brian Sack.  When you presented the simulation results, I had been conflicted in reading the memo and responding to the fact that the banks were saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve got these excess reserves.  We\u2019re really not intending to lend them out.\u201d  You did the simulation\u2014I guess that\u2019s kind of natural to look at the implications of lower short-term rates, and that would presumably be more accommodative.  But I\u2019m wondering if you learn something else from the survey\u2014that there might be added dysfunction in the lending channel if the banks aren\u2019t looking to lend out excess reserves that they currently have available to them.  Did we learn more about their lack of intention to stimulate the economy through more lending, or is it pretty much the way we had thought about it before. And that led me to think about the second question. Earlier in the year, we talked a pretty good amount, I thought, in terms of market segmentation and how effective our various programs would be depending on how clogged up markets were.  Arbitrage kind of disperses funds that we would put into the financial system, but when it\u2019s more segmented, we have a larger effect.  So I guess I\u2019m back to the MBS question. Do you think that that program is more effective in a price sense.  Do we have more segments. I don\u2019t think we have more segmentation.  Do we have less segmentation.  Regarding the rate effects that we might have estimated early on, would they be smaller now because these are more dispersed.  I think that\u2019s what President Lacker was trying to get at with Treasuries, but I\u2019m not exactly sure. And then there\u2019s the next part of this question, which you can answer either today or later.  Do we have an idea of what an estimate of the MBS rates will be when we\u2019re done with the LSAP programs if itwere the full $1\u00bc trillion tapered at the end of the first quarter, and if we did what President Hoenig suggested, only $1 trillion tapered to the end of the fourth quarter.  What would those rates look like at the end of the first quarter.  I\u2019m not sure I understand the different implications, or at least our thinking on that", " MR. EVANS.  Well, I was thinking about it differently.  You can do the MBS. You can do the Treasuries. If they\u2019re segmented, they\u2019re different.  If there\u2019s no segmentation, there\u2019s going to be some arbitrage across the different markets, so it almost doesn\u2019t matter where you dump those funds", " MR. EVANS.  But in March we were stymied by the segmentation, I thought.  We thought it was really big, and now things seem different.  So I would guess that the estimated effect would be smaller", " MS. DUKE. My question revolves around how your analysis and your conclusions would have been different if the banks had expressed a stronger willingness to lend some time in the near future.  It seems to me that when we started down this path, we did expect the rate we were paying to be a floor on the fed funds rate, and it turned out not to be.  But if the banks were strongly interested in lending and chasing loan funds, it seems as if that would be the point where it would turn out to be a floor.  Am I thinking about that correctly or not", " MR. ENGLISH. It might well push up short-term rates, as banks were less likely to run off deposits and manage liabilities because they saw better lending opportunities.  In terms of the simulation that we did, one of the knobs we didn\u2019t turn was an easing in credit.  If you turn that knob, you\u2019d get a bigger effect on output and unemployment\u2014still not huge, but a larger effect for sure.  So I think that, if the banks had been telling us, yes, we\u2019re likely to ease our lending standards and terms early next year, then our exercise would have showed a bigger effect on output and probably a smaller effect on rates", " MR. LACKER. Yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much debt.  I think agency MBS. Brian, I have a question about your yield effect estimates: Shouldn\u2019t that depend on how they are financed, like what we do on the other side of our balance sheet, right.  If our early purchases were essentially sterilized by offsetting reductions in borrowings, that\u2019s going to have a different effect on agency yields than if we add enough to reserves that it induces those yields to fall. Do you see what I\u2019m saying", " MR. LACKER. I don\u2019t see how you can say that.  Earlier in the year we were buying MBS, and you kept forecasting increases in reserves.  They kept not happening. Borrowing kept falling. It looks as if they were sterilized", " [Laughter] MR. LACKER. I just have a question about SFP.  If you want to talk about this more tomorrow in your presentation, and tee it up to do that, I\u2019m fine with that, but it sort of gets to a broader issue. The SFP is now projected to fall, consistent with the Treasury\u2019s announcement, and then rise again. I noticed that in our previous Bluebook it had been projected to stay longer where it is now, fall, and remain at zero permanently.  I was confused about the shift in the forecast after this intermeeting period, and I wondered what that represents", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, let me comment on that briefly.  First of all, I think it\u2019s important for us to be able to do what we need to do without relying on the Treasury.  Obviously, we need to maintain that independence and that flexibility.  Whatever help they can provide, of  course, is a bonus. I\u2019ve had some discussions with Secretary Geithner and others, and the view was that because the debate on the debt ceiling\u2014which will probably be toward the end of the year\u2014could be contentious for a lot of reasons, it would be a good idea for us to have a low profile and not be part of this discussion. For that reason, I suggested to him that they run it down to a very low level until such time as all that discussion was completed.  Once the debt ceiling is raised, they are perfectly comfortable bringing the SFPs back up to some level.  Of course, at one point, it was over $500 billion\u2014is that right, Brian", "  MR. LACKER. You took into account the monetary policy effects when you discussed this with the Secretary", " MR. LACKER. I\u2019d just like to second the notion that the minimum bid rate is a policy parameter that we set, and I fail to see why an auction would be inconsistent with raising that to a penalty rate. And it\u2019s a little odd that the term structure is inverted for those funds", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Yes, I actually have some sympathy for this view, and the only thing that worries me a bit at this juncture is that it\u2019s kind of a funny time to be changing the structure of the auction when we\u2019re in the process of winding it down.  But I think that arguably we could have had a higher minimum bid rate earlier on", " MR. ALVAREZ. Yes, that\u2019s right.  In fact, we committed to putting the proposal out for comment before making the TAF a permanent facility", " MR. LOCKHART. Much like the Greenbook, my views have moved in the direction of greater optimism since the last Committee meeting in August.  The incoming data have been a little stronger than were anticipated then.  At this late September juncture, I think the picture can be characterized as improving, but still with very mixed vital signs, and the outlook is somewhat more optimistic but tempered by awareness that this is an economy powered by a large number of government supports.  I agree with all who are declaring that a technical recovery is under way, but it is a tentative recovery, not well established.  Even with the improving data, I think there is substantial uncertainty around the question of whether the recovery has its own legs or is  propelled by transitory government programs.  Governor Tarullo in the last meeting talked about a relapse scenario. I see the economy as still vulnerable to relapse. Over the last two weeks, our Sixth District contacts provided a lot of support for this view of the current reality. Sixth District realtors and homebuilders reported that the first-time homebuyer subsidy noticeably boosted new home sales and construction of moderately priced properties. The \u201ccash-for-clunkers\u201d program provided a big lift to Southeast auto dealers and cut deeply into new car inventories. In response to the Board\u2019s request, our regional executives contacted six state budget officials.  They told us that the stimulus money, as intended, has helped support construction activity, but it represents spending that would have been cut or funded by running down rainy day funds. This input supports the view that stimulus spending is mainly eliminating a negative in the outlook. In this contact cycle involving directors and other business leaders, we tried to probe their sense of factors critical to transitioning from government support to sustained growth based on private demand. Our business contacts said that the inventory drawdown is slowing but may not be followed by an increase even as sales increase.  As the Chairman pointed out at the last meeting, in the near term, inventories don\u2019t have to rise to improve economic growth, they just have to fall more slowly. Nonetheless, we\u2019re hearing claims on the part of some businesspeople of permanent adjustments to inventory requirements and businesses.  Apart from a modest rise in back-to-school spending, general merchandise retailers reported continuing restrained consumer demand.  Transport firms reported very little in the way of increased activity, and the Sixth District survey of purchasing managers reveals a drop in new orders and production after more promising numbers in July.  As regards employment, we heard that layoffs have subsided, but there is no indication yet that firms anticipate hiring.  In summary, the nascent optimism expressed by my contacts just before the last FOMC meeting has been supplanted with unease over the economy as the influence of public support programs diminishes. We are revising up our third-quarter GDP estimate and are inclined to do the same for the fourth quarter, but in comparison with the Greenbook, I remain much less bullish about 2010 and 2011. There are reasons at this juncture to question whether the economy will have healed enough for a significant expansion of private demand.  I would cite several factors likely to weigh on the economy through the medium term:  high unemployment, cautious business investment, diminished consumer finance, the potential drag on the banking system from commercial real estate, the slow repair of the banking system, and slow-moving adjustments, such as intersectoral labor movements. Regarding prices, the incoming data show disinflation to be more persistent and more broad-based than the Atlanta bank put in its last forecast submission.  I think these disinflation trends bear watching, but at the moment, I still judge inflation risks to be roughly balanced. As regards growth, the incoming data have clearly been more positive, and I would judge the balance of risks to be more balanced than was my view in August.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER. Mr. Chairman, in the Eleventh District, retail sales remain anemic.  Weakness in energy due to lower natural gas prices continues to be a drag on the Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana economies, and commercial real estate remains mired in significant distress.  But there are some positive numbers that have been reported.  Private-sector jobs grew in July, and then pulled back a little bit in August.  Initial unemployment claims continued to decline. There are signs of improvement in the temporary staffing market.  Reflecting the activity that Nathan reported, exports\u2014and Texas is the largest exporting state\u2014rose in July for the second consecutive month; they\u2019re up slightly in Q2.  Existing home sales are up through July. There\u2019s actually a slight pickup in home construction as new home inventory levels stabilize. And we have a leading index that was up on all components, making positive contributions at the last measurement.   Now, realizing that it may not be the case that \u201cas goes Texas, so goes the galaxy\u201d or \u201cso goes the globe,\u201d still, there are some glimpses of sunlight that come through from our anecdotal soundings and from the CEOs that I have talked to\u2014the list of which I provide you before every meeting, Mr. Chairman.  Distillate consumption, which is strongly correlated with industrial activity, has picked up at least slightly.  And I note that electricity generation is also up slightly, which is a positive.  On the consumer side, Mastercard\u2019s internal data were positive in terms of sales activity for the week of September 7, for the first time since October 30, 2008.  The broadcasters report that advertising is creeping back up.  In part, this is Ed Whitacre\u2019s ego. There\u2019s also political advertising on health care, but, more generally, it\u2019s getting away from the trial lawyers and the lesser advertisers that we have seen and moving toward more general, normal, economic activity.  The semiconductors report a pickup in demand, which I find quite interesting. According to Texas Instruments, for example, in the first quarter customers actually reduced their original orders by 7 percent.  In the second quarter, they shipped 31 percent over their original order base, which indicates a rush to cover either inventory shortfalls or perhaps demand\u2014they\u2019re not sure which.  And, as of last night, their shipments in the third quarter are exceeding the original orders by 29 percent.  And, lastly, an odd positive to the recession, is that Wal-Mart reports that pilferage or internal theft is down 20 percent for fear of people losing their jobs. Despite those positive indicators and the aggregate data which we have heard presented by others and at this table, I would summarize the mood of my interlocutors as being wary of the purported recovery. They see some improvement in the statistics that they read about elsewhere, but, based on their own experience, they doubt them.  Some cotton to our outlook at the Dallas Fed, which is for a checkmark-shaped recovery, with less growth, as President Lockhart pointed  out, in 2010 and 2011 than the staff are forecasting here at the Board.  But I heard from more than I hoped that they\u2019re managing for what I would call a W-shaped recovery.  And if they\u2019re wrong, they\u2019ll be relieved. More than once I heard what I consider a new management bias described as being based on \u201cprocess improvement\u201d or \u201ccost take-out\u201d or \u201cmargin repair.\u201d  This is the kind of nomenclature that now is ubiquitous amongst McKinsey and Bain consultants, who up until last summer were flogging techniques to enhance top-line improvement through pricing power. Our own measure at the Dallas Fed of global capacity utilization shows record lows.  It indicates that for some time incremental demand will be met by utilizing a greater share of existing capital rather than investing in new equipment or buildings.  And I can\u2019t find a single sector where a leading CEO is budgeting to do anything other than to contain costs and only commit to vital and minimal cap ex in 2010. So, Mr. Chairman, that\u2019s how it looks from a microeconomic perch.  It\u2019s undoubtedly imperfect, but I think it\u2019s illustrative.  There\u2019s a disconnect between the way that the women and men who are managing the businesses of the United States view the economy and the aggregate data. And I don\u2019t know how we will join that disconnect, but it\u2019s clearly there.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My business contacts in the Fourth District continue to be wary about developments in the economy.  While most businesses reported incremental gains in their output levels earlier this summer, many have already seen a tapering off of those gains. Other contacts reported that orders are fluctuating with no discernible trend. Overall, I would characterize the predominant mood of the business executives I speak with as uncertain and cautious. One of the reasons there is so much uncertainty is that the improvements that we have seen in the critical industries appear to be tied to short-term stimulus programs.  District auto sales got a clear boost from the \u201ccash-for-clunkers\u201d program, and auto production plans have now been increased for both the third and fourth quarters.  There is also no question that there have been ripple effects through the supply chain all the way back to orders for steel.  This increased production in autos and industries related to autos was critical to the stabilization in the Fourth District output that we reported in the latest Beige Book. But the limited gains in the industrial sector to date do lead me to think that this recovery is very fragile. Underscoring the fragility is the uncertainty about just how sustainable the demand for car sales will be into and beyond the fourth quarter.  For similar reasons, my contacts  in the real estate industry are concerned that sales may decline once the first-time homebuyer tax credit expires on December 1. They certainly aren\u2019t complaining about the support, which is drawing in new homebuyers, yet they also report that an unusual number of sellers are renting rather than purchasing move-up houses.  One real estate executive said that, traditionally, four out of five sales are to move-up buyers, whereas he is only seeing two out of five sales to move-up buyers in the current market.  The lack of move-up purchasing has limited the impact of the first-time homebuyer programs, and move-up purchasing is going to be critical once the first-time homebuyer incentives are exhausted.  Again, the economy\u2019s fragility is partly hidden by incentives, which, in this case, are scheduled to roll off later this year. Concerns such as these weighed on my outlook for economic growth, particularly in the fourth quarter. I anticipate a gradual and bumpy recovery.  My outlook does not have sustained above-trend growth until the second half of 2010, with the unemployment rate topping off at just over 10 percent early next year. Turning to inflation, two pieces of research done by my staff helped to guide my outlook.  The first is a model of inflation expectations that does not rely on TIPS to estimate inflation expectations. Instead, the model combines inflation data, nominal bond rates, survey measures of inflation expectations, and inflation swaps to construct estimates of expected inflation.  This model shows that inflation expectations remain stable from two to ten years out.  Second, my staff, along with the staff at the Atlanta Fed, has been examining the detailed price data by splitting the consumer price index market basket according to whether prices of goods and services are sticky or flexible.  The stickier prices appear to be a particularly informative measure of core inflation, in that they more reliably predict future inflation.  Our staff analysis   shows that the inflation rate of the goods and services with stickier prices has shifted sharply lower this year. This trend points to suppressed inflation rates for the next few quarters. These results point to some crosscurrents I see in putting together an inflation projection.  In the near term, resource slack is likely to depress core inflation numbers, while over the medium term, monetary and fiscal policies and stable inflation expectations should support an inflation trajectory toward 2 percent.  Specifically, I expect core PCE inflation to dip below 1\u00bd percent in 2010, but to increase gradually toward 2 percent in 2011. Overall, the risks to my inflation outlook remain balanced.  Regarding the risks to my outlook for economic growth, though, I think I appear to be in the small minority, because I still see the risks to growth to the downside. I am concerned that the gains that we have seen recently in the real economy are limited and are potentially just temporary reflections of the policy actions undertaken earlier this year.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy is clearly doing better.  All indications are that we will have a pretty strong bounce in activity during the second half of the year\u20143+ percent annualized real GDP growth seems likely, and the risks over the near term are probably to the upside, I think, of the Greenbook forecast, because inventory cycles can be very powerful. That said, I still think it is very premature to declare victory for several reasons.  First, a good portion of the growth will come from the swing in the pace of inventory accumulation rather than strength in final demand.  Second, the banking system is still impaired.  Bank credit outstanding has been declining. Small businesses and commercial real estate sectors are particularly starved for credit, and that is likely to continue for some time.  Third, payrolls are still falling, and the unemployment rate is still rising.  Fourth, we don\u2019t know how households will respond to the sharp drop in net worth at a time that household debt burdens remain high.  I can imagine a combination of higher household saving and increased labor market participation as baby boomers postpone retirement.  The first would damp demand; the second would raise the amount of slack in the labor market.  Fifth, we are already in the process of removing accommodation\u2014the purchase programs are going to move to the slower pace, the liquidity programs are being gradually unwound, and other government support to the financial sector, such as the money market fund guarantees and the TLGP, are being withdrawn. At a time when the unemployment rate is very high and is still rising, and when there is ample slack in the economy, I think we want to be cautious in moving too quickly to take back additional accommodation. What we want is a robust recovery that pushes the unemployment rate down quickly\u2014that\u2019s what we are going for. That doesn\u2019t seem to be in the cards.  Nothingthat I\u2019ve heard around the table suggests that that\u2019s the expectation of the members of the Committee. Until we actually see that robust recovery, I think we\u2019re getting well ahead of ourselves in talking about removing additional accommodation.  Although some are worried about the longer-term inflation outlook, over the next year or two, to me, the risks seem very much on the downside: Core services inflation has come down a lot; core goods inflation seems likely to follow, given the large amount of excess capacity available in the U.S. and abroad; we\u2019re already below a rate of core inflation consistent with our longer-term forecast for the core PCE deflator; and core inflation typically falls during the early stages of recovery.  In fact, if the recovery were to turn out to be more robust than expected, I would expect that would lead to a further surprise on the productivity front and potentially even more downward pressure on inflation over the next year or two. Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER. Well, if we\u2019re going to do \u201csecond quarter,\u201d it should be \u201cby the second quarter\u201d or \u201cby the end of the second quarter,\u201d rather than \u201cin the second quarter,\u201d which implies we get all the way there", " MS. YELLEN. \u2014a relapse scenario. In that event, the balance of costs and benefits of further MBS purchases could reverse. So I do not want further expansion of MBS purchases or other initiatives to be entirely off the table.   Although I can agree to leave the size of our MBS program at $1\u00bc trillion today, I see a strong case on policy grounds for further monetary stimulus.  Core inflation is currently below my price stability goal of about 2 percent, and the unemployment rate is well above my full employment goal of about 5 percent.  I anticipate a tepid recovery, but even if the recovery is somewhat more robust, this situation will persist for many years. I am pretty sure that, if it were possible, we would at this point have taken the federal funds rate into negative territory. That would be consistent with our historical behavior, with  optimal policy calculations, such as those reported in the Bluebook, and with the guidance of most policy rules. Unfortunately, so far this year, the nominal funds rate has been fixed near zero while core inflation has fallen. So the real funds rate has risen.  In this sense, monetary policy has actually tightened this year, although circumstances\u2014namely, the increase in unemployment and decline in core inflation\u2014seem to call for more monetary stimulus.  Even taking account of our large-scale asset purchases, I think the effective degree of easing, given the dislocation in financial markets, likely has been modest relative to past recessions. I agree with President Plosser that communications are a logical device to use, and I think the most obvious way to provide additional stimulus without further balance sheet expansion is to use language designed to bring market expectations of the funds rate path into closer alignment with the Greenbook path, thereby lowering medium-term rates.  Market expectations concerning the likely path of the funds rate have come down over the intermeeting period, but there is still a gap between market expectations and the Greenbook path, which coincides with my own preferred path. To help narrow that gap, I propose replacing the language in paragraph 3 of alternative B with the language in paragraph 3 of alternative A.  Specifically, I would replace the vague phase \u201cEconomic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period\u201d with the alternative phrasing stating that \u201cThe Committee anticipates that low resource utilization and subdued inflation are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels\u2026.\u201d  This language would indicate to markets that the FOMC will not raise rates merely on the basis of strong economic growth if, in fact, we are nowhere near maximum sustainable levels of employment and activity and if inflation is subdued.  It would provide a conditional statement that would usefully inform the expectations of financial market participants.  I know that this phrasing will not appeal to those members of the Committee whoreject the notion that slack influences inflation.  But it is consistent with the language of B that already embraces the logic of such a linkage", " MR. BULLARD. Starting with the red part", " MR. ROSENGREN. I was talking about putting a period after \u201cmarkets\u201d and taking out the last clause", " MR. HOENIG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I look at the circumstances that we\u2019re in, I would prefer alternative C.  And I don\u2019t say that lightly, and I don\u2019t say it because I don\u2019t happen to be voting. I don\u2019t have to put it out there\u2014that\u2019s an issue sometimes. I think it\u2019s important that we look at the stance of policy, and we\u2019re in a very accommodative stance today.  And looking ahead to 2010, 2011, 2012, we\u2019re still going to have a reasonably accommodative policy.  I recognize that the short-run costs are always right before us. And I don\u2019t want to stanch this recovery any more than anyone else does, and that is a major concern. I remember, perhaps unfortunately, sitting around worrying about 1 percent inflation in 2002 and 2003, worrying whether we would have deflation, and worrying about short-run issues as we kept rates low for an extended period of time\u2014I think that was our language.  I just want to make sure that we\u2019re thinking about the long-run costs of this much stimulus and of the difficulties we will face ahead in withdrawing it, because we\u2019ve never before used these tools to neutralize this much stimulus.  We have enormous reserves in, and already some of the \u201cchasing yield\u201d has begun with this amount of funds out there and available.  We are taking on not only risk in the short term and on the downside, but, by delaying, we also are taking on longer-term risks, which may seem easier to take on precisely because they are longer term.  So I\u2019m very sensitive to that. I also am very sensitive to the fact that this might surprise the market, and that is a very serious worry. But at some point I think we need to surprise the market, to some degree, and that is why I was so interested in what the basis-point effect on mortgage rates would be as well as  the psychological effect. But I think it\u2019s a risk that we need to take on at this point, because if we don\u2019t announce this now, we will be very close to year-end at our next meeting, and I don\u2019t think we can then say that we\u2019re really pulling this stuff back.  At that point, I think we\u2019d be even more reluctant to do it. So now we can shoot for year-end.  We could tell them we\u2019re not getting out now, and we\u2019re going to move this very carefully towards year-end.  In the long run, I suspect that we\u2019d have\u2014I can\u2019t say better outcomes\u2014reasonable outcomes. There are a couple of other things.  I would push for first quarter\u2014if at all possible.  Also, I\u2019m uneasy with the phrase \u201cextended period,\u201d because it has been such an issue with me in the past. So I\u2019ll end with that. Thank you", "  Everybody around this table has more experience with these issues than I do\u2014  MR. TARULLO. No, that\u2019s not true", "  [Laughter] MS. DUKE.  \u2014but I\u2019m struck as I look at the statements and as I listen to the discussion that it sounds like we\u2019re doing one smooth maneuver that has been the same over a period of time when the underlying dynamics are really very different.  I would agree with President Lacker that the purchases of the MBS and the support of the housing markets has been smooth, has acted as a substitute for the financial markets that haven\u2019t yet restarted.  But, on the other hand, the waxing and waning of programs on the asset side of the balance sheet are going to result in bursts of quantitative easing in the form of reserves, and we\u2019re just beginning to see that. Given my impression that reserves are currently at desired levels, I think that it will result in some lowering of interest rates.  I would disagree with Governor Kohn on that, and then disagree with President Lacker and agree with President Yellen that this is not necessarily a bad thing, that it\u2019s probably warranted by the conditions that we are facing.  Also, I would point out that while the TALF is supporting lending, on the one hand, our regulatory policies are generally acting to restrict credit, on the other, so those two things are working at cross-purposes, perhaps. With all of these different things going on, I have difficulty weighing the relative impact of each one on the final outcomes, but I do remain concerned that on balance we\u2019re going to see too little credit availability leading to too much saving and a slower recovery than we would like.  So I do support alternative B. I think through tapering we actually are likely to learn a little bit more about the effects of stock versus flow, as well as about the bank response to this second big tranch of reserves coming in, so it certainly would be possible in the future to argue for an extension into the second quarter, but I\u2019m not sure whether that would be through more gradual tapering or through an increase in the purchases. I think it just depends on how those develop. In keeping with my banker roots, I do find paragraph 1 awfully rosy compared with the reservations that were expressed in the policy round, but I don\u2019t have any changes to offer. I would delete the \u201cup to\u201d language, but, again, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m terribly strongly in favor of that; I would probably also use the first quarter, again, saying that in the future I may prefer the second quarter. Thank you", " MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B, although, like President Yellen, not without some reluctance.  I have two difficulties with the language of alternative B as drafted.  In paragraph 1, although I think it does reflect accurately our sense of the current trajectory of the economy, I don\u2019t think it captures the level of uncertainty about what may happen next year, and thus I would be substantially more comfortable with an explicit indication of that uncertainty. With respect to paragraph 3, I think President Bullard captured the most important point from my point of view, which is that the world should understand that we\u2019re prepared to respond as required by economic circumstances.  I worry that there is a sense of finality that is projected in the language as currently drafted, and I don\u2019t think it turns on the \u201cup to\u201d language for the reasons that Governor Warsh suggested.  I think it turns more upon the way it\u2019s stated and, to be perfectly honest, upon a lot of external commentary which has begun to impute a certain finality to us. So whether through the mechanism that President Bullard suggested, or President Rosengren suggested, or some other means, I would be substantially more comfortable with alternative B if it states in more or less\u2014and I say \u201cmore or less\u201d given that we are a central bank\u2014explicit fashion that we are prepared to respond to changing economic conditions, so that people do understand this is not final in the sense that, even if things begin to deteriorate next year, we\u2019re not going to think there\u2019s a high hurdle rate because, after all, we ended that program.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO. Yes. I think it depends for me, ultimately, Mr. Chairman, on what other language might change.  Were you to tell me that no other language was going to change and I get to do \u201cup to\u201d or not, I would want it out", " MR. PLOSSER. That\u2019s okay, but there are two elements to this", " MR. LACKER. Taking out \u201cup to\u201d is a firm commitment to the program.  If we were to see some problems in banking markets caused by the expansion of reserves, would we consider running off Treasuries, or selling Treasuries, in order to drain reserves.  Is that an element of flexibility that remains on the table", " MR. PLOSSER. I guess I\u2019m being difficult, but I\u2019m worried about the perception of the marketplace, namely, that we are passively accepting an increase of $185 billion of reserves without an active decision by this Committee to do so.  If we do anticipate that SFP comes back, in some ways that eases our exit strategies, and I understand why that may, in fact, be desirable.But given the political interaction between debt ceilings and other things, do we want it to go away or do we want it to come back.  Those are knotty, little questions about how then we manage these extra reserves in terms of this Committee\u2019s view of policy going forward", " Or we could say \u201cbroad range,\u201d which is in between\u2014 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. All right.  [Laughter]  I\u2019m putting an end to this.  Let me ask how many are in favor of putting in \u201cwide.\u201d One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Just for the record, how many are against it.  One, two, three. Okay. So let\u2019s include \u201cwide.\u201d I think those are the major decisions. I will comment on the first paragraph.  We had some views on both sides, that is, whether it was too cheery or not cheery enough, whether it was certain enough or uncertain enough.  I\u2019m at a little bit of a loss as to where to go with it.  I felt the comments were pretty balanced around where we were, but if anyone else would like to address that.  Would you like to address that, Governor Tarullo", " MR. EVANS. Can I ask just one question", " MR. SACK. No, I don\u2019t have a problem.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a massive source of confusion if it says \u201ccompleted,\u201d but I have no problem with \u201cexecuted\u201d either"], "2009FOMC20091104meeting.txt": [" MR. SACK. There is a lot of talk about the carry trade, and I think when we talk about the carry trade we need to be careful to distinguish whether we are talking about a fundamental story that we would expect to take place or whether we are talking about something beyond that. The fundamental story would be that low financing rates in the United States should make it attractive to borrow and to go long other assets. And you should evaluate the return on those other assets relative to the return that investors could get on a risk-free asset, which is quite low.  To the degree that the carry trade reflects that activity, I think it is perfectly reasonable and desirable. The question is, \u201cDo we see so much activity that it goes beyond that, where the low financing rates are causing asset prices to go up too far because there is too much leverage and too much risk-taking.\u201dThat is what I tried to focus on, in the context of U.S. assets, in exhibit 1.  I think the only way to answer that question is to turn to the models and try to make an assessment of fair value.  And for U.S. assets, we do not see a problem at this point because, as I said, we think they are fairly priced.  I do think there are greater concerns regarding assets outside the United States, in particular emerging market assets.  We don\u2019t look at those in detail, so I don\u2019t have as detailed an answer, but we have certainly heard quite a bit of concern being expressed about the prices on those assets being pushed up too far.  So I think it is a concern, or it is a risk to be aware of, but I would think at this point it is directed toward emerging-market asset prices", " MR. SACK. The short answer is that there is a lot of uncertainty about calibrating the effects.  Absolutely.  And the uncertainty in these two panels comes from different sources in some way.  In the one on the left, like any model of fair value, the results have only a certain degree of statistical significance and can depend on the type of model that you write down.  This model actually includes a supply variable directly, which it does find is statistically significant, and then we can use that to back out, in the context of the model, what it thinks the effects of the  LSAPs would be.  The point estimate is something around 50 basis points, but it has a confidence interval that certainly spans easily from 20 to 80 or so. The uncertainty on the right is a bit different, but equally important.  The advantage of the event-study exercise is to zoom in on the LSAP events, so that we can be sure we are isolating the effect of the LSAPs. Of course, the downside of event-studies is that they give you no perspective on whether those effects persist and what the dynamics are thereafter.  If you have an efficient-markets hypothesis, you might expect them to persist.  I mean, it would be odd, in the context of efficient markets, if they predictably reversed in a timely way.  We have some confidence that some of this effect persists, but I guess I wouldn\u2019t want to hang my hat on saying absolutely that this entire effect persists.  So that is the source of uncertainty there.  I take this evidence together to suggest that the LSAPs have worked.  There has been some effect, but it is very difficult to quantify, no doubt", " MR. SHEETS. I\u2019m not quite sure", " MR. LACKER. We heard earlier that a huge amount of the primary credit facility borrowers are foreign banks. Does the borrowing through these swap lines occur by banks that don\u2019t have access to our primary credit facility", " MR. SHEETS. My understanding is that it\u2019s some of both", " So there are some institutions that could borrow from us directly, and they borrow either instead or also through\u2014 MR. SHEETS. Through the swap lines. Given the pricing structure of the swap lines, getting funds through the swap lines has been relatively expensive.  So if they have had a choice, they haven\u2019t gone to the swap lines", " MR. LOCKHART. Help me with connecting the dots at a high level here.  I took your overall discussion of the reverse repo market to be sort of discouraging on net\u2014near term at least\u2014that we have obstacles, various technical challenges that are building up, and that it is far from certain that this is going to be a large-capacity drainer of excess reserves.  Then I look at the market\u2019s view of this question in exhibit 26, and it appears that they are ranking the reverse repos as the largest possible drainer of reserves.  Are we building here to a disconnect between the reality of this tool and what the market thinks this tool can do and, therefore, a schism between public views of our ability to drain and what we can really accomplish", " MR. PLOSSER. I just had a follow-up to the answer that Nathan gave on the intraday volatility that you referred to in terms of reserves.  To what degree was that also the creation of our own operating procedures\u2014that we were going into the market only once a day and we were reluctant to be players on a continuous basis.  Could we have solved some of that problem by our own operating procedures and being in the market more continuously", " So you could respond multiple times during the day but end up adding way too many reserves or adding\u2014 MR. PLOSSER. Is that because we were targeting quantities rather than prices.  Once again, could we have been closer had we been more frequent", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This is a question about swap lines.  I like the memo, and I like the approach.  The policy of discontinuing the swap lines with certain central banks\u2014I\u2019m not quite sure where that leaves us because it seems as though now that, when we get into another crisis, the presumption would be that we would reestablish those lines with those banks since we did so this time around.  So I\u2019m not quite sure how to place your description of what we are doing here in that context because I think that there would certainly be overwhelming pressure in another crisis of this magnitude to reestablish those swap lines.  Then you would have the difficulty of having to, as you say, renegotiate and set up the details, as you did this time.  So I\u2019m wondering what you think about that as opposed to the idea that we are pulling back and we\u2019re maybe implicitly saying that we may not reestablish with, say, South Korea or other countries like that in the future.  What\u2019s your thinking on that", " MR. SHEETS.  A couple of thoughts.  Your general point is well taken.  On the first point in terms of the pulling back, the scaling, and so on and so forth, our view is that we need to have a certain small number of swap lines in order to have the operational capacity to understand how they work, to have thought through all of the legal issues, and also to have a good sense from the Committee and from other central banks as to what the appropriate policy objectives of these things are. But from that relatively small set, if conditions require, it\u2019s usually fairly easy to scale it out.  So I\u2019m not worried about\u2014 if we only have four and then the world blows up and we want to have fourteen again\u2014 whether it is going to be harder to go from four to fourteen.  No. I would be worried about going from zero to four, however.  Ten years from now, the folks in New York who did all the work may be onto other things or other positions, and just as was the case in this lastepisode, we had to run around and pretty much figure these things out from scratch. I actually think that Trish has a few purple hearts that she earned in that process.  Now, the flip side of this is that we gave them a swap line once, and if things get bad, we\u2019re going to give them a swap line again.  I think that is a very reasonable presumption if a crisis erupts in a year or two years.  But if the next crisis is eight or ten years out, there is a lot of water under the bridge. The world looks a lot different, and it\u2019s not clear to me that there is the same presumption.  Now, the Committee at that point may want to look at it and come to the conclusion that, yes, we want to give Korea another swap line, but I do not think there would be as strong a presumption as if they actually had a swap line with us. So I do think there is some meaning in where we draw this set of counterparties.  As I mentioned in my remarks\u2014but it is an important point\u2014it is also very helpful to us in managing our relationships with foreign central banks from here until the time of the next crisis.  on Yes", " MR. KOHN. Right. So it\u2019s not clear that the risk of the counterparty is the right criterion, but it could be the size that you can execute in and the speed with which you can execute.  I think you just need to be very clear on the criteria so that it\u2019s easily defensible when people say, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you doing it with every small person who wants to lend us money.\u201dI think putting the RCAs on hold is a good idea.  They always seemed very complicated to me and potentially bifurcating the fed funds market, and I think that, if we can get it done without that change, we should.  Maybe we need them, but I think putting them on hold is a good idea and concentrating on the reverse RPs and the term deposits is the right way to go.  I would be fine with a small real-value test with the rate thing. On the swaps, this is more difficult.  I think the swaps were a very, very useful instrument in the recent crisis, and it wasn\u2019t just about particular institutions.  It has come down to that, I think, as the crisis unwinds. It has come down to that both in our domestic facilities and in our international facilities.  But at the height of the crisis, there was a generalized demand for dollar funding that the markets were unable to meet because there was segmentation.  There was a lack of arbitrage.  There was a hoarding of liquidity.  And the swaps\u2014particularly once they got to be open ended\u2014were very, very important in both relieving pressure on the markets and building confidence. I like the idea that the home country central bank is in charge of the lending for the most part.  That\u2019s where the problems are going to be.  That\u2019s where the fiscal issues are going to arise.  So to the extent that the home country central bank can do the lending, that\u2019s a benefit.  And I think the point implied by President Lacker about reserves is a good one, but the problem with relying on reserves is that there is a limited amount of reserves that any particular central bank has, and I know in talking to people from the ECB, a problem they had was mobilizing the reserves in the various national central banks. So I think the idea of this swap facility was very, very useful.  It\u2019s important that we have something that is ready to activate on short notice and that we keep the machinery oiled at least for a small number of central banks, the Big Four that Nathan talked about.  And I guess in theory that standby lines will do that.  There could be some sort of contingency facility that you also tested on a periodic basis.  In some sense I\u2019m indifferent about how it is done, but I think it is important to have it there. I am much more torn about the Mexican swap line, to tell the truth.  I worry about emerging market swap lines.  I worry that we\u2019ll have to get into the business of judging whether the underlying policies in that country are good.  In this case, we had a generalized demand for dollars all over the world.  So smearing the dollars all over the world was a good way of dealing with that.  The next crisis could be more particular to an individual economy.  President Hoenig and I were in Mexico about two weeks ago, and it was quite striking, I think, Tom, that the Mexicans as well as the visitors thought that it was a pretty troubled economy with lots of problems.  I guess I\u2019m worried that we\u2019ll get involved in something that is particular to Mexico rather than a general dollar liquidity shortage.  I recognize that the Mexican economy, as well as the Canadian economy, is deeply integrated with ours\u2014it is in our interest that it not be destabilized in some sense. It would be important, as I think Nathan mentioned in his briefing, to come back to the FOMC before any of these swap lines are activated for the first time.  I would not delegate it to the three of us on the subcommittee.  I would want the FOMC to do it, and I think we need to be careful about how we specify the criteria under which the swap lines would be activated in the material that backs it up, that somehow we make it clear that, if there is a very specific problem keyed to the specific economy, other ways of dealing with it\u2014through the IMF, the Administration, the Congress, if the United States is going to provide support in that case\u2014are more appropriate than using the Federal Reserve, bypassing those other channels.  I am still a little concerned about the Mexican part of this thing", "MR. LACKER. Yes. On the swap lines, I have never been a real big fan of these.  My affection rose slightly earlier in the year, but it was a transitory rise. [Laughter] I find my enthusiasm waning.  Basically, I don\u2019t think they solve an economic problem worth solving.  We have dollars out there, and maybe I am just really sanguine about the ability of the system to move dollars around. I guess at the end of the day that might be where we differ.  It has the disadvantage of our having to police other central banks\u2019 use of the funds and not let them do foreign exchange with them and all.  So, broadly speaking, I wouldn\u2019t favor it because I think we can maintain the operational capability without the authorization for these things.  I think we can practice these things some way or another.  I think we can manage to maintain our human capital. On the foreign currency swaps, where we borrow a foreign currency in order to lend to one of our institutions, I think at this time horizon, nine months down the road, the vulnerability of any of these institutions, because of maturity transformation in a foreign currency, is entirely endogenous. It is entirely the choice of how they run their business, and I don\u2019t think there is any excuse at this horizon not to have pushed them out of the nest.  I don\u2019t know the details of these institutions, but I think we ought to be working toward pushing them to run their business in a way that they are not so vulnerable to that. As for the NAFA things, I think those are classic foreign exchange.  It\u2019s a vestige of our classic foreign exchange currency swap things that we have always opposed.  They are really fiscal policies\u2014the same reasons that Vice Chairman Dudley articulated. I am glad to hear that RCAs are on hold.  I didn\u2019t think they were worth pursuing, and they seemed to benefit mainly the GSEs.  As for the other things, I think a question we want to ask ourselves before this is, What sense of urgency do we really feel about reverse RPs and term   deposits.  I was struck by that chart that Brian showed us and the new section at the end of the Bluebook that discusses a sequence of potential statements that we could use for the exit.  I was struck that they placed primary reliance on these two mechanisms for draining reserves and held asset sales in abeyance. I would like to have the Committee really grapple with that.  I don\u2019t know why we wouldn\u2019t go to asset sales first.  If our balance sheet were as small as it would be, let\u2019s say, nine months from now without these deposits, would we issue a bunch of deposits to buy MBS.  I don\u2019t think we would do that. I don\u2019t know why we would avoid selling MBS over the near term as we want to scale back reserve balances.  I think we ought to grapple with just how much urgency these things require before we go public and get everybody all excited about them", " MR. PLOSSER. I guess I will start with swaps because that seems to be popular.  I share a lot of the concerns, actually, that Governor Kohn had.  Don, I thought I understood you to say that your inclination, which I would agree with, is that it is fine to keep these things on the shelf, but you don\u2019t necessarily want to delegate it to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee to make the decisions each time that it really ought to come back", " MR. PLOSSER. For the first draw. I found the argument in the memo a little strange about the transparency issue\u2014that we wouldn\u2019t want to have it appear in the minutes that this was voted on. And I find that sort of anti-transparency, which I wasn\u2019t sure I found very compelling. The other thing I think about the swaps is that, as President Lacker was asking, many of these banks do have lots of dollars at their disposal.  Okay.  Given that, I would think one proper way to think about this may be that we would like them to use their own dollars as their first line of defense, rather than coming to us.  I don\u2019t know whether that really makes sense, whether we could price this in a way that would make that a sensible strategy, or whether it is even a desirable strategy in some sense, because if these things were operational on a continuous basis, would this be a kind of \u201cno questions asked\u201d way for them to request dollars.  Or is it only reserved for crises.  So I\u2019d like to put their dollars on the line first, and I\u2019m not exactly sure how we would do that. I don\u2019t mind having these things on the shelf and ready to go and operationalized. I am a little concerned about the usage and whose dollars come first.  And I think putting the RCAs on hold is fine.  The other aspect is something that President Lacker returned to, which is the term deposits and the RPs. I kind of share his view in that I am not sure we have the tools in the right order, at least as suggested by some of the staff discussion.  But one question I had about the term deposits was, if the term deposits are eligible for collateral at the discount window, a bank could have a term deposit and turn around and post it as collateral at the discount window and borrow, taking out short-term reserves again.  It seems as though they would undo the term deposit by doing that. So what is the point of having the term deposit if they can turn around and undo it this way", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. Yes.  What was interesting as we went through the crisis was that, for the foreign central banks, there was clearly a very high threshold against using their own dollar reserves, liquidating their Treasury securities or whatever, to fund their domestic banks. We know that because they didn\u2019t do it, and they told us that they didn\u2019t want to do it because they thought it would be very confusing to the market in terms of what they were up to.  Was this some sort of foreign exchange intervention.  Or was it a sign of distress particular to their country.  We also know that there was a pretty high threshold because we actually charged them quite a bit for the foreign exchange swap lines relative to the fact that they are basically virtually a risk-free rate, yet they chose that rather than to liquidate their dollar reserves.  So I think you have to recognize that there is something special about the dollar reserves holdings that they have that they don\u2019t want to mess with.  There was a cost for them to engage in dollar reserves sales that seemed to be fairly significant as we went through the crisis", " MR. MADIGAN. President Lockhart, I think our view is that the primary tool will be the interest on reserves rate. But the experience to date leads us to have some doubts as to whether that will put a hard floor on the federal funds rate.  So we\u2019re presuming that we will, in order to harden that floor, need to take at least some reserves out of the system.  Whether or not we will have to take a whole lot out at this point isn\u2019t clear, but it is possible we might have to.  That is why we have been working on a number of tools", " MR. ROSENGREN. Just a quick comment on the unintended consequences of lists.  When we came up with the primary dealer list, I don\u2019t think anybody could have guessed that we would have a primary dealer credit facility.  So when I think of coming up with lists of counterparties, I just worry about the unintended consequences.  If we select firms based on size of institution, it might quickly be inferred that there is a broader reason to have the list constituted the way we have it. So when I think about that, it does seem that Governor Warsh\u2019s suggestion that, to the extent that we can broaden it but make it manageable for the Desk to do, we avoid the unintended consequence of making it look like a list that was based on size that may be misinterpreted for other purposes.  I know it is much easier to deal operationally with fewer counterparties; but just given the perceptions that can be created by that, we might want to give some thought as to whether there are ways to broaden it so that we don\u2019t give that misperception. Then the second list is the list of countries.  We spend a lot of time thinking about stigma, and President Yellen and I were talking about this on the elevator coming up.  But to the extent that we could come up with a size criterion that made it very clear that, if a market got to this size then we would entertain\u2014it\u2019s kind of the opposite.  It seems like having a much clearer criterion. One reason all of these other central banks want to be our counterparty is that we are signaling something.  If we have a swap line with Mexico, people are inferring a signal that we are comfortable having them as a counterparty.  I worry about stigmatizing the countries like Mexico and Korea and other countries that want potentially to be a counterparty in part for the signaling benefit. The way we get around that is if we have a very clear criterion that says, \u201cIf you get to this size, then maybe we will think about having a swap line.\u201d  Maybe size isn\u2019t the   right metric, but coming up with some metric other than country-specific choices would make me more comfortable with that list as well", " MS. YELLEN. Yes. I just wanted to support that point.  We were discussing this, and I agree with President Rosengren\u2019s comments. I do think we should think about, if we stigmatize this larger group of countries, what their response might be.  For example, they might not feel so happy about having unfettered capital flows or having subsidiaries or branches of U.S. or European-based multilateral banks in their countries.  They might change the way in which they supervise and regulate those operations, if they thought it was not automatic that they would get access to dollar liquidity in the same way they did in this crisis. If I could just\u2014this is the only thing I want to comment on\u2014respond to President Plosser\u2019s comment on this, that ideally they have large stocks of reserves and we should want to encourage them to use those reserves first before drawing on us.  I am not sure that is actually true. I think that the distinction here is similar to the old one between inside and outside money.  The reserves that they hold are equivalent to inside money.  When they sell dollar reserves they have in a crisis situation to provide liquidity to their banks, it is a propagation mechanism for causing exchange rate movements and international transmission of the disturbances that they are suffering. In contrast, when we provide liquidity, we are printing money.  We are adding to the stock of outside money, and we circumvent those repercussions.  So, in a crisis, the dynamics aren\u2019t the same.  There is a good reason to have this kind of facility", " MS. YELLEN. You know, I don\u2019t know what the right answer is, but I am worried about restricting it to these four.  President Bullard mentioned this concern as well, and I think President Rosengren is suggesting one way to use criteria to maybe broaden the group.  But I am quite concerned about singling out these four and not making it larger.  I understand there are political issues around that and boundary problems and so forth.  But I am concerned about limiting it to these four.  And there could be economic consequences.  If you take a country like Korea and you say, \u201cWell, we are not putting you in the same category as before,\u201d beyond what they might do with our banks, they may decide they need an even larger war chest.  They may be more reluctant to have current account adjustments", "  It could have implications for\u2014 MR. TARULLO. So you are kind of for swaps but are leaning toward more rather than fewer", "  MR. LOCKHART. Lead-off hitter [Laughter].  Singles and doubles, Mr. Chairman.  Despite better-than-expected economic growth in the third quarter, the sentiment of my Sixth District directors and business contacts has neither improved nor deteriorated substantially since our last meeting. The current tenor of business activity is flat to moderately more positive, but where it is more positive, there is uneasiness that improvement may not be sustainable. Several directors reported conversations citing uncertainty about the future policy environment, including health care policy, as retarding hiring and investment.  We also heard skepticism about the durability of private spending absent stimulus programs.  A number of my contacts said that orders and top-line revenue would have to grow a great deal and be sustained for many months before new full-time hiring or capital expenditures would be undertaken.  Firms reported that they have ample ability to expand their business with their existing labor force and temporary labor if needed.  However, few expect a significant upturn in orders in the near term.  Our inquiries about capital expansion got more than a few incredulous looks.  Capital spending for business expansion does not seem to be a realistic consideration for most of our contacts. I continue to hear that small businesses are struggling to find adequate financing to support any expansion and rehiring.  Work done recently by the Atlanta research staff on the makeup of job losses points to the unusually large concentration of job losses in the small business sector.  Through the end of 2008, businesses with 50 or fewer employees accounted for about 45 percent of net job losses in the recession.  Firms of this size accounted for only about 9 percent of job losses in the 2001 recession.  Our contacts also broadly confirm the view that a major commercial real estate problem is developing.  We have the view, along with others, that commercial real estate will have a sizable downside impact on regional and small banks.  I am concerned that the interplay of the commercial real estate correction and weak job growth due to constrained credit is shaping up to be a serious headwind. To sum up, anecdotal feedback from our recent contact cycle does not validate any reliable trend in the stronger GDP numbers and paints a picture of highly cautious and extremely reluctant business actors.  That said, I think it is reasonable to incorporate solid near-term growth in second-half estimates, but I remain skeptical about the medium term.  I remain to the pessimistic side of the Greenbook forecast, and I am not inclined to make too much of improved recent and near-term expected data in thinking about exit timing and communication. As regards the inflation outlook, incoming price data suggest a little more disinflationary pressure than I had assumed in June.  In the forecast submitted with this meeting, I marked down my core inflation projection a little, and I judge the inflation\u2013deflation risks to be roughly balanced. In preparation for this meeting, I and my staff had a number of conversations with financial market participants.  There was uniform satisfaction with the continuing normalization of financial markets.  Contacts expressed more confidence and reported that they believed the markets, in general, have confidence in the idea that the Fed has the tools to execute an exit strategy.  A universal concern, however, is the strategic approach to and timing of the exit.  My contacts see some risk of a premature exit, a concern I share. But what was most notable in my recent conversations was concern about premature communication of exit intentions and the market reaction to changes in the Committee\u2019s statement wording.  I won\u2019t venture any further into tomorrow\u2019s discussion.  So I will stop there.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Incoming data seem consistent with third-quarter and fourth-quarter GDP growth averaging roughly 3 percent\u2014a welcome change after several consecutive quarters of decline.  However, although I expect the economy to continue to recover, it will likely grow much more slowly than previous recoveries. I remain particularly concerned that, as the monetary and fiscal supports subside, there will be insufficient private spending to make much progress in labor markets.  Growth in consumption and housing tend to be drivers in recoveries, and although both grew in the third quarter, they were supported by a variety of government programs, which are now in the process of winding down.  As a result, I expect that, by the end of next year, unemployment will not be much lower than its current level, an outcome quite similar to the Greenbook forecast.  I expect that, even by the end of 2012, the unemployment rate will be well above our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.The Greenbook assumes that credit conditions will ease, making credit more available for businesses and households.  I am concerned that banking conditions over the next year may well deteriorate.  For many banks, nonperforming loans are rising and rising faster than they are reserving for problem loans.  Thus I expect that capital constraints will not ease over the next year.  In fact, they might tighten. Research at the Boston Fed has found that forecasters tend to underpredict unemployment when the percent of bank assets in banks with a poor CAMELS rating is elevated.  Currently, the percent of bank assets in banks with a CAMELS rating of 3 or worse is high and climbing.  Supporting this concern is the decline in lending in the Call Report data, which are continuing to   worsen. In fact, if one splits the lending between banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 with those of 3 or worse, the declines in lending are much larger at institutions experiencing problems, in part because they are likely shrinking to improve their capital ratios. In light of the substantial excess capacity in the economy and given that credit is likely to remain constrained, I expect a gradual disinflation over the forecast period.  The Greenbook forecast for core CPI and core PCE looks like an annual step function bounded below by 1 percent.  My concern is that the inflation rate may not be bounded by 1 percent, and we may experience more disinflation than in the Greenbook forecast.  In part, this is the result of forecast equations in Boston, but in part, it reflects the incoming data on wages, salaries, and benefits.  The continued decline in the rate of growth of wages and salaries, especially in the context of rapid productivity growth, makes it quite unlikely that core inflation will reach my 2 percent target over the forecast period.  As others noted at the last meeting, this outlook represents continued poor outcomes for both aspects of our dual mandate.  I hope, but do not expect, that growth will be faster than most of us forecast.  This would at least diminish the length of the other extended period, the period for which unemployment remains severely elevated. In turn, while we can hope that anchored inflation expectations will keep inflation from falling more than the Greenbook envisions, even in a protracted period of significant excess capacity, I am concerned about the risks that expectations will move down or that they will not sufficiently offset the downward pressure from resource slack.  While potential output may have fallen and the natural rate may have risen as a consequence of the crisis from which we are emerging, it is difficult to imagine a shift so dramatic as to materially change the size of these resource gaps.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have been encouraged by the positive tone of recent economic data and continued signs of healing in the financial system.  Improvements in the housing sector are particularly welcome because they contribute both to economic growth and to mitigating the strains on the financial system.  In the corporate bond market, risk spreads have come down, and that should support business investment for those corporations with access to market financing.   However, these encouraging signs are marred by the persistently weak labor market and stagnating wage income.  In addition, my business contacts, too, report that bank credit conditions remain tight, and most have reined in capital spending, limiting expenditures to essential projects and those that promise immediate efficiency improvements.  Finally, some of the recent strength in housing and auto purchases results from temporary government programs.  Overall, the recovery is shaping up as a long, difficult slog for several reasons, including the extraordinary depth of the recession, the pressure on financial firms and households to repair their balance sheets, and the zero bound\u2019s considerable constraint on monetary policy. I find myself in agreement with the Greenbook\u2019s assessment of the outlook for the economy, but this is not an outcome that I find at all satisfactory, not with unemployment rising to 10 percent this year and remaining above 8 percent through 2011 and inflation below desired levels as far as the eye can see.  That said, the most frightening downside risks to this forecast have receded, and I now view the risks to the outlook as roughly balanced.  Nevertheless, those risks are considerable.  On the upside, it is possible that consumers and businesses may be better able and more willing to spend than I have given them credit for.  Over the past several months, we have seen improvements in a number of factors that pulled down consumer spending over the past year.  These include uncertainty, consumer confidence, wealth, and credit availability.  My staff has estimated consumption-forecasting models that include these variables, and their preferred specification generates a forecast for PCE growth over the next four quarters of around 5 percent due to the improvement in those factors.  Because the model misses other forces that are restraining consumer spending, I haven\u2019t adjusted my own baseline forecast up to nearly this extent, but this analysis does highlight for me a potential upside risk to the outlook similar to the V-shaped recovery discussed in the Greenbook. Counterbalancing this upside risk are some significant downside risks.  Some of the most worrisome ones also relate to consumer spending.  In particular, the still-parlous state of household balance sheets could restrain consumption more than is incorporated in the Greenbook. In the past, I have highlighted the potential drag on consumer spending that we may see if households, to rebuild wealth and reduce leverage, boost their saving beyond the rather modest rebound incorporated in the Greenbook forecast.  The United States was one of many countries to experience a massive increase in debt-to-income ratios followed by a severe housing bust and a retrenchment in consumption.  Interestingly, cross-country evidence reveals a remarkably strong correlation between the increase of debt to income before the crisis and the decline in real consumption once the crisis began.  I recognize that correlation does not necessarily imply causation, but this evidence provides a cautionary note that we may see abnormally low consumer spending for some time. Another downside risk relates to the effect on the banking sector of further deterioration in the commercial real estate market.  As many of you have mentioned, the prospects for commercial real estate have continued to deteriorate.  We estimate that a significant share of banks in our District will fail over the next five years as a consequence.  In fact, we are concerned that we now have a large number of already economically insolvent zombie banks whose troubles may have seriously impaired their ability to extend credit to the businesses in   their communities.  In addition, lenders are commonly asking borrowers either to repay loans or to provide more equity to offset the erosion of real estate values.  And given the very weak conditions in commercial real estate, this situation sets the stage for further increases in delinquencies and foreclosures. This process could generate an adverse feedback loop akin to that associated with residential real estate. So in summary, the economic outlook remains very uncertain, but I think the tail risks and their associated costs have receded to the point that the risks for growth are now balanced. Turning to inflation, the basic story has not changed much since our last meeting.  I expect substantial slack in labor and goods markets to reduce core PCE price inflation from about 1\u00bd percent this year to 1 percent in 2010 and 2011.  The risks to this forecast are roughly balanced as well, but I am very concerned by the sharp deceleration we have seen in wages over the past year, and that is a development that is echoed by comments from my directors.  They report that wages are flat or even slightly down, with no increases in sight. Against this backdrop of substantial slack, a key factor putting a floor on the decline in the inflation rate is the public\u2019s confidence that we will do whatever it takes to bring the economy back from recession and keep inflation from falling too low.  If we waiver from that pledge and tighten too soon, confidence in our commitment to economic recovery and price stability could be undermined, and that could be a recipe for an extended episode of disinflation or even deflation like the one Japan suffered through.  A commitment to low and stable inflation involves defending the inflation objective on both the upside and the downside.   A concern in this regard is the fact that implied forward rates from fed funds futures contracts now suggest that market participants expect us to start raising rates as early as next spring. This assessment, however, depends critically on the assumption that term premiums andfed funds futures contracts are very low by historical standards\u2014about 1 basis point per month.  This assumption seems questionable, given evidence that historically these term premiums appear to have varied considerably, and estimated risks and term premiums on a wide range of assets are now quite elevated. My staff just recently completed the development of a new model of the term structure of Treasury yields and has used it to back out estimates of expected future short rates and the term premium on fed funds futures.  They find that the term premium on fed funds futures has risen substantially and is currently much higher than 1 basis point per month.  The implication, in contrast to the usual interpretation from futures, is that market participants currently expect a relatively shallow path for the funds rate similar to that in the Desk\u2019s primary dealer survey.  These expectations exceed but are closer to my own views concerning the appropriate course of policy given what we now know. Of course, our policy decisions must depend on how economic developments actually unfold.  But if we signal a tightening of policy before it is justified by the evolution of inflation and economic slack in the economy, perhaps partly out of concern that market participants see us as getting behind the curve, we could upset confidence in our policies, cause longer-term rates to rise, and end up in a more dangerous deflationary situation", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You said much more than 1 basis point.  Can you give me a rough order of magnitude", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Likely", " MR. LOCKHART. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like so many others, I support the policy choice in alternative B.  I interpret this as a stay-the-course option.  For the most part, I support the language in draft alternative B, but I do have some reservations about the changes in paragraph 3 from the September statement. I\u2019m not sure I see the benefit of replacing the assertion that the Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the fed funds rate for an extended period with the new statement of low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation, and inflation expectations.  I think it\u2019s generally understood that the conditionality of our decisions is based on resource utilization, inflation, and inflation expectations.  So I think this could be interpreted as trying to emphasize something new by changing the language in this way, and I suspect it could be interpreted as implying increased focus on the unemployment rate, which of course I\u2019m sympathetic with as a criterion, but we may very well begin to initiate tightening before  there\u2019s any substantial improvement in unemployment.  So I think this could serve to confuse more than illuminate. So I don\u2019t see a percentage in a lot of forward guidance at this point, and I would prefer simply to stick with the language that we used in September. I am concerned, based on some of my soundings in the financial markets, that we\u2019re sort of in a strange loop dilemma. We\u2019re not ready to initiate tightening, at least through the policy rate, but changes in the \u201cextended period\u201d language, including maybe even the words around that language, depending on how they\u2019re interpreted, could create an unwanted adjustment in rate levels that would amount to tightening.  So I prefer that we start to signal when we\u2019re much closer to action. As regards the $175 billion agency debt purchases language, I would have the concern that this could be misinterpreted, but I think the adjustments between the first draft and the draft we have in front of us adequately explain this as very much a technical matter; so it will avoid misinterpretation or overinterpretation.  So I\u2019m comfortable with that.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Thank you.  Just a couple of comments.  Saying that reserves facilitate deposits implies that the banks have to lend the money to the consumers", " MS. DUKE. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would like first to pile a little onto Governor Warsh\u2019s comments about the mortgage-backed securities market.  The financial improvement does not extend to mortgage instruments.  As recently as the last meeting I was concerned that the lack of a housing finance system would require our continued purchase of the MBS even beyond the first quarter of next year.  I\u2019ve thought about this a lot in the intermeeting period, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that, just as we found with the TALF, there are some markets that our tools can\u2019t fix.  I don\u2019t see how our economy fully recovers without the true resolution of Fannie and Freddie and clarity in the role of government in housing finance and the structure of private-label loan securitizations.  In my opinion, it is much more important than homebuyer tax credits, but I don\u2019t think either our continued purchase or holding of these securities can substitute for such a policy.  With that, I would like to agree with President Evans in his comments, particularly his agreement with President Yellen and Governor Kohn, and support alternative B", " MR. TARULLO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like everybody, I think, I support the policy actions set forth in alternative B.  I do have some concerns about the language, specifically the insertion of the \u201cincluding\u201d phrase at the beginning of paragraph 3.  I didn\u2019t have those concerns when Brian circulated the language.  I didn\u2019t have those concerns after Brian explained to me why the language is in there.  But after this meeting, I do have them, [laughter] and let me explain why. First\u2014this is a secondary point, but I will mention it\u2014I am somewhat bemused by the inflation expectations criterion.  For a social scientist to put such weight on such a slippery metric,   whose relationship to outcomes historically is, as I understand it, not particularly well established empirically has just surprised me\u2014something that I hadn\u2019t focused on before being on the Board.  That\u2019s something that I look forward to hearing more about in the December meeting, when we have a full presentation of the academic work behind inflation more generally. I understand that faith and intuition are important elements in economic policy making.  So in and of itself, that concern wouldn\u2019t have moved me to speak.  I guess where I do have a concern is on the issue of what this phrase will communicate.  This is going to be the news out of this statement.  Everything else is expected.  Some of the things that some people expected to be in here are not going to be in here, and therefore, this is going to be the only thing for people to focus on. To the extent that the \u201cincluding\u201d phrase is understood as a positive statement of the principal factors that the 17 people around the table will be looking at over the coming meetings, I think that would enhance communications, and I took it that that was the reason it was included in the statement originally.  But unlike Kevin, I didn\u2019t find the 30 speeches a wholly positive and productive development after the last FOMC meeting.  My own sense from talking to a number of market actors was that they thought that there was confusion within the Committee, which they thought undermined within a very short period of time the FOMC statement itself.  I don\u2019t think it was serious, and I think people kind of bounced back, and some of the sophisticated analysts did a very nice job on our behalf of teasing out the points of agreement and putting them out to markets more generally.  But just having listened to the conversation, I am concerned that the release of this statement with the \u201cincluding\u201d phrase will be quickly followed by a litigation of the meaning and relative importance of each of these three items in a series of public statements, and when some people start making the public statements, other people are going to be moved to make public statements that kind of go a bit on the other side.  Therefore, I am concerned that what began as a  nicely stated, positive assertion of the principal factors that we all, some of us more than others, will be looking at will fairly quickly devolve into a bit of cacophony. Now, it may be that markets will just look at who the speakers are and say, \u201cOkay.  Well, this is nothing new from this person,\u201d and so it won\u2019t be that serious.  But to the degree that what we\u2019re looking for in the next three, four, five, six meetings is the capacity to speak more or less with one voice on how we plan to move ahead and eventually how we plan to exit, I fear that we\u2019re setting a not-terrific precedent for our capacity to do so.  And so, Mr. Chairman, although I certainly wouldn\u2019t even dream of opposing alternative B if you choose to keep the language in, I guess my own preference would have been to hold this language until perhaps the December meeting, after we\u2019ve had a chance to talk about at least the inflation considerations in a bit more detail, in the hopes that the positive statement at that time would reflect a greater level of consensus among the seventeen of us.  Thank you", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. If there is starting to be a reaction to this, there may be some value to having a background conversation to make it clear that this is not a change.  I wouldn\u2019t do it beforehand because we don\u2019t know that we have a problem.  But if the market does take it the wrong way, which I think is a low probability, you might want to have a background conversation", " MR. LOCKHART. I spoke against it", " MR. LACKER. I would point out there is going to be a cottage industry no matter what"], "2009FOMC20091216meeting.txt": [" MR. PLOSSER. Mr. Chairman", " MR. PLOSSER. I think it is important to do that in January.  But I would just like to emphasize that, in the context of that and thinking about sequencing, I think it would also be very helpful to think about what we believe the steady-state policy tools are going to be; that is, how are we going to conduct policy in normal times going forward with interest on reserves.  And, I think it is important to have that discussion, but in the context of thinking about how we use the tools, and the way we use these tools, interacts with where we ultimately want to end up in how we conduct policy\u2014whether it is a floor system or a corridor system\u2014and what we think is going to happen to the funds market.  I think these things are tied together, and I\u2019d like to see that discussion carried on in tandem if we can", " MR. ROSENGREN. So no dealer raised the question of whether you would just move the interest rate on reserves but not do anything else, for example", " MR. EVANS. Thank you. Brian, actually you began to answer my question on the primary dealers.  I realize, after listening to and seeing presentations like this, I didn\u2019t really know who the survey respondents were.  Is it really bank economists.  I thought this was more financial market participants.  I guess the question is:  If it is bank economists, is it really that different from, say, the Blue Chip or NABE or something like that", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. As one of those people who used to receive those surveys, I know that they usually go to the economists who sit on the desk.  If they\u2019re uncertain about how to answer the question, they\u2019ll talk to the traders.  So I think there\u2019s probably a little gap between the economists\u2019 views and the traders\u2019 views, but generally the traders are consulted", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. So you\u2019re not worried about these programs basically being an influence on short-term interest rates beyond the IOER rate.  That\u2019s what I would be concerned about. You\u2019re just saying we are moving the fed funds rate closer to the IOER rate.  That\u2019s fine with me.  I\u2019m more worried that they\u2019re going to be a separate influence on short-term interest rates beyond the IOER rate", " MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I just wanted to make sure I understand exhibits 19 and 20 and the effects of tapering.  We\u2019re tapering now, and we\u2019ve gotten some distance along that path. I guess these charts right below are meant to say that the effects have been minor, or there haven\u2019t been any effects, even though people in the market said, \u201cOh, you\u2019re going to back up these rates.\u201d  Is that a fair assessment", " MR. SACK. Yes. In my view, a big chunk of the question about asset sales is:  Can we do them in a way that doesn\u2019t cause a sharp backup in rates, whether that\u2019s a pre-commitment to a gradual sales pace, or whether it\u2019s building in some kind of state responsiveness to interest rates, or whether it\u2019s other approaches.  The staff is trying to think about these issues\u2014that is, what mechanisms could we use to sell assets safely.  It may be that there is no way to do it convincingly, and the only way to shed assets is to do it through redemptions, and that would be fine. But I think we at least want to think through all of the options and assess whether there is some approach where we could basically get the effects\u2014the same kind of gradual winding down in the portfolio you would get under redemptions\u2014but that would give us more flexibility along the way", "  MR. LACKER. Yes. Absolutely", "  VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. I just want to add that the issue on redemptions, though, is also colored by what you want the portfolio to look like in the longer run.  Let\u2019s say we start with a portfolio that was bills, notes, and bonds, and was roughly in proportion to the market; but it\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s necessarily the portfolio that we want in the new world as we transition to a new monetary policy setting.  That decision on redemptions is partly about balance sheet size, and it\u2019s also partly about where we want to take the portfolio over the medium to longer run", " MR. BULLARD. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have a question on the term deposit facility. One of the provisions is \u201cno early withdrawal,\u201d but another provision is \u201cyou can be pledged as collateral at the window.\u201d Those seem to be in conflict", " MR. BULLARD. There\u2019s variable liquidity among various assets, and you should have metrics about the degree of liquidity, and then get your measure of how much liquidity is out there, instead of arbitrarily saying certain assets are liquid and others are not", " MR. PLOSSER. I\u2019d like to follow up a little bit on the TDF, because I\u2019m still uncomfortable with the potential for arbitrage between it and primary credit.  Jim, do you envision that the TAF will shut down before TDF becomes active", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. I don\u2019t want to interject, but I think there are two ways to look at it. One is just to say the IOER rate, which is an overnight rate, is the basic tool, and we just have all of these fine-tuning instruments to make sure we don\u2019t have too much slippage between the market rate\u2014the federal funds rate\u2014and the IOER rate.  That\u2019s one approach, and I think that\u2019s the simplest approach.  The other way, though, is to say, well, we really have tools that can affect things at different parts of the term structure or different types of instruments, and we can play with that if we want. That gets more complicated and it makes policymaking more complicated.  So I don\u2019t know how far we want to go in that direction, but I think there are at least two ways to look at that", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Just to follow up\u2014if I\u2019m a bank, why would I put my reserves into this account unless it paid a higher interest rate than the IOER rate.  Because it\u2019s less liquid", "   MR. ROSENGREN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We have had some heartening news since the last meeting.  In particular, the employment report was stronger than most analysts expected, with the economy losing only 11,000 jobs.  However, it is obvious, but still important, to emphasize that this is still moving in the wrong direction.  As the recovery progresses, a good employment report will be one that adds jobs substantially faster than growth in the labor force, so we can make significant progress in reducing the unemployment rate and reattaining full employment. The Greenbook has the unemployment rate at 9.6 percent at the end of 2010, with an assumption of no change in the federal funds rate.  Unfortunately, my own forecast is quite similar.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain quite elevated.  We need to see a significant reduction in job loss and a marked increase in hiring if we are going to achieve net increases in employment that significantly exceed growth in the labor force.  Other labor market trends highlight why the progress is likely to be slow in bringing the unemployment rate down.  First, the fraction of employed persons working part-time for economic reasons is nearly at an all-time high for the series.  Second, the workweek of production and non-supervisory workers remains low relative to non-recessionary periods.  With many workers on a reduced workweek, or involuntarily on part-time work, many businesses will defer hiring new employees until their existing workforce is more fully utilized.  Thus, even if GDP growth exceeds potential, as I expect it will over the coming quarters, this will likely reduce the unemployment rate only gradually. Headwinds from the banking sector are also likely to continue to blow strongly.  The percent of bank assets in institutions with low supervisory ratings continues to grow, and bank failures are artificially being held down by resource constraints at the FDIC.  Given the volumeof problem loans and problem banks, it is probably time to have a Resolution Trust Corporation to deal with failed bank assets. Recovery in commercial real estate will be delayed if the public and private sectors hold large inventories of problem commercial real estate loans in the hope that losses will be avoided through forbearance. On the inflation front, there is little evidence of inflationary pressures.  A variety of models used by the Boston Fed expect continued disinflation.  For models that depend on resource slack, the very high unemployment rate relative to any reasonable estimate of full employment suggests further disinflation.  However, recognizing the difficulties in measuring unemployment and output gaps, we have also examined models that emphasize the role of real marginal cost.  Here, too, one would expect significant disinflation, because real unit labor costs have been falling dramatically and are currently at a postwar low.  With double-digit unemployment, I don\u2019t expect a quick reversal in real unit labor costs.  Furthermore, our model suggests that, even in the presence of extremely well-anchored inflation expectations, the downward pull from resource underutilization may well outweigh the stabilizing effect of anchored expectations. Thus, while the high-frequency data have clearly improved from earlier this year, they have not changed enough to significantly alter the outlook of an economy with very weak labor markets and a significant risk of further disinflation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am pleased to see the signs of improvement in the economic data we received during the intermeeting period, especially in the November employment report.  Nonetheless, I see the economy in 2010 as having little momentum and as challenged by a lack of business confidence.  My business contacts report that sales are up from earlier this year, but they don\u2019t see the momentum that is needed for a  sustained recovery.  Several of my contacts noted that recent growth is unlikely to be sustained, because it was driven by one-time gains.  For example, business has been picking up in several manufacturing industries, because they are replacing inventories at the wholesale level.  They indicated that wholesalers had not been restocking earlier in the year.  Inventory restocking is obviously welcomed, but if it is without a sustained improvement in final demand, it implies only a temporary strengthening in economic activity. My business contacts also expressed a general lack of confidence in the outlook. They view the current environment as so alien that most of them were uncomfortable providing an outlook for 2010. They tell me that their conventional methods for assessing their own business prospects are irrelevant in this environment.  On top of the uncertainties about the economic outlook, as others have noted, proposals for health care reform, financial reform, and the new environmental regulations, have the potential to affect business conditions significantly in the near future. I am concerned that this lack of confidence in the economy\u2019s prospects for even the next few quarters is going to be a significant barrier to a more robust recovery.  Businesses continue to stress cash preservation and cost containment as their top priorities.  They report little incentive or motivation to invest in capital projects.  To quote one CEO, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to invest or prepare for growth without orders in hand.\u201d  This issue of confidence was also raised in a recent discussion at our joint board of directors meeting, among the businesspeople and the bankers, on credit availability and bank lending standards. For large firms, which have access to the public debt markets, credit is now available on more attractive terms than earlier this year.  But, as others have commented, smaller firms, which rely primarily on banks, are complaining about the availability of credit.  Bankers expressed a lack of confidence in the values of their borrowers\u2019 collateral as one of the main reasons that they have had to raise their lending standards. Many of the businesspeople criticized the higher pricing and tighter terms for lending as being based on unreasonable assessments of their businesses.  So they are losing confidence in banks as a reliable source for funds in the face of elevated terms and additional covenants.  These reports suggest that credit availability continues to be an impediment to growth, particularly if we are counting on small businesses to contribute to economic growth. My business contacts did have some good news, and that is that more firms are expecting to return to profitability.  With this improvement, several businesses reported that they would at least partially restore hours, wages, and benefits that had been cut when the outlook was more dire. These actions should aid GDP growth, even if they have little effect on the unemployment rate for a while. More broadly, the speed and scale of the cutbacks many businesses implemented earlier this year give firms substantial room to expand activities before they would have to hire any new employees. Weighing all of these reports and the recent data, I made only minor changes to my outlook. I continue to see weaker GDP growth in the current quarter and for 2010 than the Greenbook projection. I expect the unemployment rate to remain roughly unchanged in December, with only modest improvements through all of next year.  My projection for core PCE inflation remains low throughout 2010 before it gradually converges towards 2 percent beginning in 2011. My inflation outlook is based on the significant amount of excess capacity that we currently have and inflation expectations that remain close to 2 percent from one to ten years out, according to my staff\u2019s model for inflation expectations.  I continue to see the risks as balanced around my outlook for economic growth and inflation. The potential for the recent momentum in labor markets to continue is roughly offset by the potential for further restraints on credit availability.  For inflation, uncertainty remains elevated on either side of my projection.  This uncertainty is linked closely to whether or not inflation expectations remain anchored.  Overall, the economy is certainly in better shape than earlier this year, but it is still not clear to me that the economy has truly turned the corner.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B, but I would like to emphasize something that I\u2019ve said in the past.  I continue to see a persuasive case for further policy easing. We are far below maximum sustainable employment, inflation is undesirably low, and almost any version of the Taylor Rule, as well as the Bluebook\u2019s optimal policy simulation, recommends a negative setting for the federal funds rate at the present time.  We need to remind ourselves of this fact to counteract the very natural instinct to tighten policy as the economy recovers. It\u2019s true that, if we had been free to lower the federal funds rate into negative territory, it would probably be appropriate to start tightening in the not-too-distant future.  But we were constrained on the way down by the zero bound, and, in the face of that bound, systematic policy calls for us to hold the federal funds rate near zero for a long time to come. Alternative B includes a paragraph addressing our special liquidity facilities.  I do not consider the proposed language very controversial, with one exception.  I\u2019m concerned about phasing out TALF support for newly issued CMBS.  I think it\u2019s too soon to announce the termination of that support.  Outside of CRE lending, financial conditions have improved considerably, and it\u2019s appropriate to allow the other facilities to expire as scheduled.  The reaction should be minimal because few observers expect them to continue. In contrast, our decisions relating to the LSAP programs are important from a policy perspective. The question of whether or not to reinvest SOMA holdings as they mature is an aspect of a broader policy decision concerning these programs.  I do see some advantage to allowing our agency-related holdings to run off.  This is a mechanistic strategy, but it creates a self-liquidating feature for our MBS portfolio\u2014an exit strategy that shrinks our holdings over time in a manner that will be predictable to markets, minimizing the possibility of abrupt movements in yields that could result from further discretionary asset purchases or sales and ongoing market speculation about our plans. I\u2019m encouraged by the staff assessment that allowing our MBS holdings to run off is likely to raise mortgage rates by only a few basis points.  If so, I think the benefits of increased predictability and a well-defined exit strategy will likely outweigh the small, albeit undesirable, contractionary effects of permitting our MBS holdings to contract before we would ideally withdraw stimulus. My bigger concern is that we just don\u2019t know what will happen to MBS spreads and mortgage rates as we wind down our purchases over the next several months.  Many market participants expect rates to spike up considerably.  And if that happens when the economy is still very weak, and the housing markets remain fragile, I think we may need to resume purchases.  I agree with President Bullard that it\u2019s important to preserve the flexibility to tailor LSAP purchases and sales to emerging economic and financial conditions. The final line in paragraph 3 states that our purchases are conditional on evolving conditions, and I consider that line to be more than mere boilerplate.  We will need to take that proviso seriously during the next few meetings as we gain a better idea of how winding down our programs is affecting spreads and yields. In the meantime, it\u2019s worth strategizing about whether there is any way for us to gear the pace of purchases or sales to evolving conditions without targeting a specific mortgage rate and without creating undue uncertainty and excess volatility in the markets", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In our November statement, we committed to maintaining a target range of zero to 25 basis points for the fed funds rate as long as the economy continued to exhibit low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations. I believe that those conditions are still in place, and so I am happy to maintain the fed funds rate in that target range. Also, for the reasons ably described by President Plosser, I support committing ourselves to plans for ending the liquidity facilities as is done in both alternatives B and C.  I do not see the utility of our buying the extra $150 billion of agency MBS and $15 billion of agency debt in alternative B, but I am willing to support the thrust of the alternative, because our language in the November statement about the LSAP signaled a strong commitment to those extra asset purchases. With that said, I am concerned that alternative B is so silent about our plans for the balance sheet beyond March. I would recommend changing the last sentence of alternative B to read, \u201cThe Committee will continue to evaluate the size and composition of its holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets,\u201d so that\u2019s basically changing from \u201cpurchases\u201d to \u201choldings.\u201d  This change would communicate to the public that we may choose to reduce the balance sheet by failing to reinvest or by selling assets. My own view is that we should begin such a reduction in the second quarter of 2010, at least by failing to reinvest and, more desirably, through additional sales. Why do I favor reducing the balance sheet.  Well, first, the benefits of our interventions in these markets have fallen greatly.  I am convinced from evidence offered by the New York Fed that the LSAP had big benefits in late 2008 and early 2009, but during that period financial  markets were functioning poorly.  Risk premia in particular markets became largely disconnected from one another.  But as pages 12 and 13 of the Bluebook emphasize, these conditions have greatly ameliorated, and investors can more readily substitute across various financial assets.  In these circumstances, reducing our positions will have a muted effect on yields. The benefits, therefore, of our big balance sheet have been greatly reduced, and our big balance sheet is not without cost.  It confronts us with the low probability possibility of high inflation. Banks have $1 trillion of excess reserves.  These reserves represent an inflation risk generated from potential changes in household expectations. The logic here is simple.  If households believe that the price level is about to rise, they will demand more liquid deposits in order to make their transactions.  One of the five memos for the inflation dynamics session we\u2019re going to get is by Simon Potter and other coauthors, and it indicates how increases in government debt can lead to exactly those kinds of changes in household beliefs. Given those changes, banks can readily accommodate the extra demand for deposits because they\u2019re holding so many excess reserves.  The extra deposits in the hands of households become extra money chasing the same amount of goods, which has the possibility of generating inflation. In this way excess reserves are a vehicle for households\u2019 expectations about inflation to become reality. One way this chain of events could take place is for banks to make additional loans.  However, their doing so would mean that they would be significantly changing the risk composition of their portfolios.  My own belief is that deposit creation would be fueled instead by households and firms selling banks relatively illiquid but relatively riskless securities like corporate bonds, municipal bonds, and Treasuries.  Households and firms now own about $4 trillion in such securities, which is enough to expand demand deposits by 600 percent.  This   expansion, obviously an extreme case, would put enormous pressure on the price level.  I\u2019d be the first to say that this inflationary chain is only a possibility, and I agree with market assessments that it currently has a low probability of occurring.  But one lesson I have taken away from the past five years is that our conduct of policy should take account of exactly these kinds of low-probability adverse tail events. The staff is currently exploring the use of reverse repos and term deposits.  These facilities have potentially useful ways to accommodate transient reductions of excess reserves.  In contrast, asset sales are a more effective commitment to a permanent reduction in our balance sheet. This difference means that, at a minimum, asset sales are a useful complement to term deposits or reverse repos. As I say, I would like to see shrinkage in our balance sheet beginning in the second quarter of 2010, but now I think it\u2019s worthwhile for us to start to foreshadow that possibility by changing the language of alternative B as I have recommended to refer to holdings of securities as opposed to simply talking about purchases.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER. Yes, sir. With the sentence that reads, \u201cBusinesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.\u201d  I would add, \u201cbut remain reluctant to expand overhead, including payrolls.\u201d This is what we heard at the table.  You summarized it eloquently. It is not in the statement, and I think it should be.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. \u201cRemain reluctant to expand overhead, including payrolls", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, sure. The last sentence of paragraph 3, alternative B\u2014I want it to read, \u201cThe Committee will continue to evaluate the size and composition of its holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions of financial markets", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. What were your words, Don", " MR. KOHN. Yes", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. No, you\u2019re next", " MR. LACKER. We do", " MR. EVANS. Could I make a comment", " MR. KOHN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a question rather than a comment, and it\u2019s for Mike. I had trouble understanding the paragraph or two that you had in your paper about the current situation. I guess you say we shouldn\u2019t be sitting around this table talking about gaps.  So what should we have been talking about this morning.  And within this model, how do you explain what has happened over the last two years.  We\u2019ve had an enormous drop in output and a significant decline in inflation. So how would you have designed this morning\u2019s discussion if you had had an opportunity", " MR. DOTSEY. I would be no more informative on that than anybody here.  But one could say that one of the things that has happened in financial markets is that capital is not being allocated efficiently across the economy; that is, the firms that might be getting the capital in normal times, maybe smaller productive firms, are not getting it, and some larger, non\u00adproductive firms, perhaps because they have better balance sheets or have been around, are getting it, and that would look like a technology shock. But, then again, maybe we\u2019re in a world where we have ambiguity aversion in our model, and all of a sudden people have become very, very uncertain about things or demanding large risk premiums, and, as a result, investment isn\u2019t being done because it\u2019s being priced in a crazy way", " MR. PLOSSER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019ll try to keep my comments brief.  I want to talk a little about what I took away from some of this.  I found the papers very interesting and fun to read and think about. One of the lessons I take away from this\u2014and it\u2019s one that I\u2019ve taken away for some time, and Jeff referred to it\u2014is that a little humility may be in order, in terms of our ability to truly understand particularly short-run dynamics in the inflation process. One of the things that I think we learned from this discussion is that, depending on the model that you write down, and depending on the nature of the shocks that you allow to hit that model, you can get different outcomes, you can get different relationships between variables within that model. That means that we need to be a little cautious in our interpretation about how we rely in our policy discussions on one set of variables versus another set of variables in guiding our outlooks for inflation. One of the things that I have tried to convey in some of my comments over the last several months is that I have been worried that in the way we talk about inflation\u2014particularly the future of inflation and deflation\u2014we have become a little too fixated on measures of output gaps.  One of the things we learned from this is that, depending on which output gap you write down and what you think of the shocks, other things may matter, so we need to be a little more careful about \u201cdiversifying our portfolio\u201d about what\u2019s going to happen and protect ourselves from being put in a bad spot. So, I think humility is important.  I think the nature of the shocks is important.  I think the conversation between Governor Kohn and Mike Dotsey about what we think this shock is and what it did is a useful kind of conversation to have.  The problem comes when the output gap becomes a shorthand for a whole bunch of other stuff, and then it becomes a communication problem, because it may or may not be the right shorthand.  There may be circumstances where you need a different shorthand or a different measure.  And that\u2019s where talking about the nature of the shocks becomes useful in how we think about it. If you focus on traditional measures of the output gap, it seems to me there are circumstances where, with excessive emphasis on trying to close that gap\u2014I\u2019m not talking about the current circumstances, necessarily\u2014you may not be conducting policy in an optimal way or even increasing welfare. You may actually reduce welfare if you focus on the wrong metric or the wrong target with the gaps. So there may not be an easy, one-to-one correspondence at times between policy that\u2019s welfare improving and policy that closes gaps, and we need to be cautious about that. Charlie Evans commented earlier about taking other variables into account, and it is very important that we do that. The last comment I\u2019ll make is that I want to reinforce Janet Yellen\u2019s point, because she and I agree on this\u2014some people may find that unusual.  Given the uncertainty that we have about the class of models that we deal with, there\u2019s a lot of work on robust rules.  Some of the staff in San Francisco\u2014John Williams and others\u2014have worked hard on this.  I find this work very useful, because they take models where we actually can compute optimal policy, and then ask what happens: What kind of simple rules could we use that would get us close to something that looks like the optimal policy.  There\u2019s been a great deal of work on this.  The simple rules they write down typically are of a Taylor rule variety with an output gap and a deviation of inflation from some target.  One thing that comes out of those robust rules, though, is that the answer is not that the output gap doesn\u2019t matter.  But in most of those exercises that I\u2019m familiar with, the weight on the output gap in the Taylor rule tends to be pretty small.  I think that\u2019s one of the things that is interesting about some of those rules.  The important thing about those robust rules is that the weight on the deviation from inflation target gets very big, and the weight on the output gap is relatively small in many cases. One of the helpful things that we could do is think about the class of robust rules and about how robust these rules are against the class of models that are on the table.  That could help focus our discussion and give us, again, this robustness in our policy thinking that could be very helpful.  So I\u2019m very positive towards that line of research in the literature, because, as we can see here today, models are different, and they can give different outcomes.  We need to be cautious about what we know and how precise we are and not put too much weight on any one factor at any one point in time\u2014\u201cdiversify our portfolio,\u201d if you will.  Again, my argument for lo these many months is to try to get our language to look more robust and a little less focused on single metrics. I want to thank all of the Reserve Bank staff.  They did a great job, and I think this has been a very useful discussion.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman"]}
