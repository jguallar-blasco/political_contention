{"2011FOMC20110126meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  You have this EDO model that\u2019s in the class of post-1970s general equilibrium models, many of which have the property that any shock affecting economic activity affects the NAIRU, and thus, you would expect the NAIRU to fluctuate at a cyclical frequency.  I\u2019m wondering whether that property of that model has influenced the staff\u2019s thinking about this", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Well, there are various shocks in EDO, such as preference shocks, as there would be in any DSGE model.  You might say that those are shocks to demand, for example, and those would shift the concept of potential output such that they would tend to minimize the gap.  But the biggest thing going on in EDO, the shock that is causing the gap to open up and to be very wide, is, again, this economywide risk premium shock.  In other words, the way EDO tells the story is that a very big increase in slack has opened up, and that is putting downward pressure on inflation.  A different DSGE model might parse the data very differently:  It might say that, indeed, a lot of what we might think of as a falloff in demand in this cycle is having an effect on a flexible-price concept of output, or something like that.  I guess the point I want to make is that the identification assumptions used in DSGE models, and one\u2019s interpretation of what they would imply for inflation, can yield very different results when you do variations on those identification assumptions.  This is something that a number of people have commented on. If you ask whether a DSGE model would tell the story differently from, let\u2019s say, FRB/US, the answer is \u201cmaybe\u2014it depends on the DSGE model.\u201d  So EDO\u2019s telling of the tale in a lot of ways is not that different from FRB/US, but another DSGE model, like, say, the Smets\u2013Wouters model, would tell the story very differently.  This is a cautionary tale about our ability, as far as econometrics goes, to identify exactly what is driving things", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think this is not going to make the minutes", " MR. SACK.  First of all, if we believe that the balance sheet has had effects on financial conditions, then the primary consideration for you in how to manage the balance sheet and whether to sell assets would be the effects on financial conditions and the economy.  In terms of income effects, selling assets can concentrate returns.  It\u2019s possible that, say, long rates would move up, but they do so because of greater optimism about the economy and an expected higher path of short-term interest rates.  In that sense, the higher rates, or the capital losses that would be realized by selling assets, are essentially just the present value of the future costs that the portfolio would face.  So, to a large extent, the asset sales are just reallocating the timing of when losses are realized, which is probably another reason not to make that income stream the primary objective", " MR. PLOSSER.  I\u2019d like to restate my question about the SFP a little more precisely.  When SFP goes away, we transfer out of the Treasury, and they become excess reserves, in effect.  Right.  We\u2019ve just entered a program where we\u2019re going to blow excess reserves up by $600 billion, and the transfer I just mentioned is going to increase excess reserves by another $200 billion in the process.  I was trying to get at the notion that, in part, that\u2019s an effect on income, because now we\u2019re actually paying income out on the excess reserves that these are converted to, which reduces our net income. The policy question is:  How does that affect our ability to drain reserves when the time comes, given that reserves are going to be $200 billion higher because of this action.  This action may end up affecting what we face in terms of the pace of asset sales or our ability to drain using reverse repos and other things.  In other words, the end of SFP could make the draining problem bigger than it otherwise would have been", " MR. KAMIN.  We do believe that the Greek sovereign debt is unsustainable, but a couple of points are worth making.  First of all, there is some chance that the European Union will decide to bail out Greece completely so that they do not have to default or restructure their debts.  I don\u2019t know what the chance of that is, but that is certainly in the probability space.  Second, we don\u2019t place that high a likelihood on a full EU bailout for Greece, and instead we place a much higher likelihood on Greece\u2019s undergoing some kind of restructuring.  It is our working assumption for our forecast, and it is also our hope, that this process occurs a bit down the road, when investors will have had a good opportunity to \u201cring-fence\u201d Greece away from the other countries.  That is, investors understand that Greece\u2019s situation is unsustainable, and when the restructuring occurs, they won\u2019t be surprised, they\u2019ll be ready for it.  If that, indeed, occurs, then, not only is our exposure to Greece close to de minimis, but the exposure of the other large Western European banks to Greece is not so great either.  Basically, as long as you can keep the investor sentiment stabilized, the direct exposures to Greece are probably small and can be maintained.  The problem that we had back in May was that we were in an atmosphere of very great uncertainty, where nobody had ever seen an industrial economy close to default.  In that atmosphere, expectations ran rampant, and all types of global financial markets were highly destabilized.  It\u2019s our assumption that that will not occur if Greece has a restructuring, let\u2019s say, a year or two down the road.  But, obviously, that\u2019s a hope, not a certainty", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I was worried that it might be hard to read the numbers over the next couple of months, because if you get strong consumption, you\u2019re not going to be sure if that\u2019s just a temporary factor or not", " MS. RASKIN.  But leaving the private-label stuff aside, did you take into account the full range of GSE put-backs", " MR. FISHER.  I\u2019d like to ask a question about exhibit 7, the bottom right-hand corner, and, in particular, about commodity prices.  First, it\u2019s uncanny that both lines moved straight to the right.  Also, I\u2019m curious to know what your nonfuel index is based on.  You may have mentioned it", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The improved tenor of the incoming data has been clearly reflected in the comments coming from business contacts in the Sixth District in this intermeeting cycle.  The best characterization of those comments is more optimistic than before the December meeting but still a bit tentative, cautious, and reluctant to place significant bets on stronger demand.  As the data show, the pace of consumer spending has clearly picked up, but our conversations with retailers, some of which have national scope, convey little sense that they are preparing for a stronger year in 2011.  I draw this conclusion from our queries about inventory, store expansion, and hiring.  The inventory of unsold homes continues to weigh on residential real estate markets in the Southeast.  Reports from our survey of Realtors are consistent with the current Tealbook\u2019s forecast of a modest drop in house prices.  The data also indicate that business investment in equipment and software remains buoyant.  Our contacts in the region tell us the lion\u2019s share of this investment is oriented to further productivity enhancement and streamlining of supply chains and distribution systems, not a response to an improving economy.  Our directors and contacts pretty uniformly stated the view that gains in labor productivity have not been exhausted and will continue to take priority over hiring. Regarding labor market conditions and prospects for hiring, our most recent round of discussions with business leaders in our District evoked some widely held views that may be relevant to yesterday\u2019s discussion of the NAIRU.  We heard a lot of comments to the effect that job descriptions have been, and continue to be, transformed to require broader skills, modern technology savvy, and generally a higher degree of versatility and flexibility, even in positions that are relatively low on the totem pole.  We heard such comments about truck and car sales personnel, truck drivers, and agricultural workers, to mention a few.  The CEO of a large auto retailer described the extension of the salesperson\u2019s job into financing arrangements, warranty negotiation, and documentation.  This seems to be occurring across a spectrum of industries and occupational lines.  The message we heard is that the new employee is not so easy to find and that many of the unemployed lacked the skills and the attitude to fill these redefined jobs. Turning to my forecast, with some comparison to the Tealbook, my economic growth forecast has been revised up a little, but not materially.  In reality, my forecast for growth, unemployment, and inflation are really not much changed from my November submission.  I continue to hold the view that headwinds from a variety of sources will restrain growth to a pace a little under 3\u00bd percent this year, keep unemployment elevated, and allow for only a modest rise in core inflation. My forecast for inflation is slightly higher than the Tealbook\u2019s, and, as I mentioned, my forecast for GDP growth is slightly lower.  On balance, I don\u2019t think the differences in the near-term outlook between what I submitted for this meeting and what I read in the Tealbook are all that significant.  While I have not incorporated the recent rise in commodity prices into my inflation outlook, for largely the same reasons delineated in the Tealbook, my recent conversations with business contacts have introduced more caution into it.  These conversations reflect a growing sense that attempts to pass through higher commodity prices to the consumer are about to be implemented across a range of products.  I heard that price hikes in apparel, transportation and delivery services, household goods and hardware, and grocery products are in the works.  There is much uncertainty whether these price increases will stick, but this is the first indication I\u2019ve heard that businesses believe they have pricing power.  Influenced by this anecdotal feedback, I have changed my assessment of the inflation risk from weighted to the downside to balanced.  I also think the specter of deflation is less likely today than it seemed last fall, in part due to the effect of our policies.  Regarding economic growth and employment, I still see the risks as broadly balanced.  However, if pushed to express a bias one way or the other, I am now tilting in the direction of the upside.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy has entered 2011 with more momentum.  We\u2019re seeing promising upticks in business investment in equipment and software, and potentially sustainable increases in industrial production.  Appearing positive but not yet definitively propelling are improvements in auto sales and net exports, which are also moving demand.  Conditions in the labor market have improved modestly, but considerable slack remains.  Despite these upward positive trends, the housing market, in particular, continues to be troubled and is exerting downward pressure on economic growth.  The housing market shows no signs of emerging from the significant overhang of real estate that is in foreclosure or entering the foreclosure process. I continue to be troubled by the failure of financial institutions to address comprehensively the underlying causes of mortgage documentation and related servicing problems.  Giving short shrift to these problems unnecessarily elongates the pace of sales of foreclosed properties, which contributes to lower priced and lower quality housing stock, both of which will result in weaker consumer demand and stunted national growth until addressed. In addition to these persistent operational risk factors in servicing, home foreclosure rates will likely be higher this year as financial institutions publicly assert that they have fixed their internal servicing problems and restart the foreclosures that had previously been halted.  In other words, the properties subject to foreclosure that were held back by financial institutions during the robo-signing period will most likely come to market, and these surges will increase the uncertainty of supply, resulting in further uncertainty regarding home values.  If more documentation and processing problems resulting from operational inadequacies come to light, the delays in the recovery in the housing market will be extended.  In addition to the elevated volume of home foreclosures, elevated inventories of unsold homes and high vacancy rates for commercial properties contribute to the overhang exerting downward pressure on home values.  The quality of many homes also has deteriorated, resulting in more downward pressure on prices.  In short, the day of reckoning, when institutions that service loans address the failures in their processes and systems, apparently has yet to come, and, therefore, the process of clearing the housing market will remain fitful and unpredictable.  All of these possibilities could depress house prices, discourage potential homebuyers, and depress housing starts. I\u2019m also not certain that the allowance for loan and lease loss reserving that banks have done in response to foreclosure-related investigations and litigation is adequate for future losses.  If such investigations and litigation entail significant cost, concerns could be renewed about the adequacy of bank capital.  There also could be further damage to the confidence of firms and households, leading to delays in purchases of business capital and consumer durables.  If severe deficiencies in reserves were to materialize, credit availability could again contract. Inflation expectations have remained anchored despite the fact that core inflation remains low.  This stickiness benefits the recovery by preventing the natural contraction in economic activity that would occur were real interest rates to rise more dramatically.  My previous forecast noted that reductions in employment, income, and wealth had left many households with the need to repair their severely distressed balance sheets.  In short, I don\u2019t believe that consumer confidence has returned yet to the levels that would be necessary for a faster paced recovery. My previous forecast also noted continued uncertainty regarding the mortgage documentation problems, which, as I\u2019ve described, act as a continuing drag on the resurgence of the housing market.  I believe these problems have not yet been resolved.  In fact, I think they could be exacerbated by related problems, such as the facts underlying the adverse ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Court regarding mortgage assignments \u201cin blank.\u201d Neither my prior forecast nor my current one explicitly considers any additional, that is, beyond the baseline, effects of consolidation at the state level.  In particular, even after making deep spending cuts over the last two years, states continue to face large budget gaps.  At least 46 states struggled to close shortfalls when adopting budgets for the current fiscal year, which began July 1 for most states.  Fiscal year 2011 gaps total $130 billion or 20 percent of budgets in these 46 states.  To comment upon President Dudley\u2019s observation that this shortfall is a small portion of GDP, I would add that these gaps come on top of the large shortfall that 46 states faced in fiscal years 2009 and 2010.  States could continue to struggle to find the revenue needed to support critical public services for a number of years, threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs.  Even for those states whose gaps have been filled and whose budgets are balanced, this story may not be over.  Families hit hard by the recession will experience the loss of vital services throughout the year, and the negative impact on the economy could then be prolonged.  In terms of federal aid to states, about $60 billion remains to mitigate these 2011 fiscal problems.  By 2012, this number will be $6 billion. Continued high unemployment could keep state income tax receipts at low levels and increase the demand for Medicaid and other essential services that states provide.  High unemployment combined with households\u2019 diminished wealth due to fallen property values could continue to depress consumption.  Thus, sales tax receipts also would remain low.  These factors suggest that state budget gaps could continue to remain larger and last longer, themselves manifestations of a slow recovery.  Thank you", " MR. STOCKTON.  We circulated a table on the new single-family home sales that came out this morning.5  As you can see, they rose a whopping 17.5 percent to 325,000 units.  However, to place that increase in perspective, I would direct your attention to the lower left panel that shows the graph.  I think this constitutes something pretty darn close to \u201cmoribund\u201d in  5 The materials used by Mr. Stockton are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). our view.  We had been expecting some rebound at 315,000 units, so this is a little better than we expected, but not enough to change our basic story", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  From the comments during the economic go-round, I think everyone acknowledges the extent to which the prospects for economic growth have improved over the last couple of meetings, although there\u2019s also wide recognition of the need for a bit of caution about how exuberant one gets about them.  I\u2019m in the camp of doubting that our asset purchases made a huge contribution to the improvement, notwithstanding your observations, Mr. Chairman.  I say that because I personally doubt that changes in long-term yields have been very important to firms\u2019 investment and hiring decisions or to consumer spending decisions, which seem to have been at the core of the improvement in the outlook.  The way in which growth has strengthened has reduced my assessment of the likely benefits of our asset purchases.  I also doubt that we\u2019ve had that much effect on yields so far.  At the same time, I think the stronger outlook brings forward the time when we\u2019re likely to want to remove monetary stimulus.  To my mind, then, it has raised the risk that continued balance sheet expansion will prove excessive, in the sense that it sets back the starting point for us to remove stimulus. Let me note a couple of points.  One is that bank reserves have not changed much at all since we began this asset purchase program.  We\u2019re about to see a $450 billion increase over the next two months in bank reserves, so that undergirds my sense that we haven\u2019t seen much effect yet from what we\u2019ve done, and we could well see a lot in the next couple of months.  The second point has to do with inflation, and I think you were correct, Mr. Chairman, in your comments about the importance of being careful with this surge in commodity prices that\u2019s coming from overseas and affecting our headline inflation rate.  Our experience over the last couple of decades has been that there is a measurable effect on core inflation from these energy price surges, so that\u2019s another justification for some caution about inflation going forward. For me, the case for continuing the program is eroding a bit.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to scale it back right now\u2014in any event, we\u2019ve done nothing to prepare markets for such a change, as is our well-established custom.  It does seem to me, however, that there\u2019s a reasonable chance of data coming in over the next couple of months that are consistent with stronger economic growth.  And I think you\u2019re right to highlight the employment report\u2014if we were to get very strong employment reports in the next couple of months, I think that would change the whole tenor of the outlook markedly, both in markets and within our Committee, and I think we\u2019d seriously want to consider adjusting our asset purchase program in March. In light of these thoughts, I see value in preparing markets for that possibility\u2014not promising, but preparing them for that possibility through your testimony and through the minutes reflecting our concern about that possibility.  I actually liked the original version of the last sentence of paragraph 3 of alternative B, despite the fact that it seemed to imply that we didn\u2019t review our program in December.  We used the future tense there and the present tense here. I also have concerns about other parts of the statement.  Paragraph 1 of alternative B seems more downbeat than I think we are around the table.  I think paragraph 1 in alternative C does a much better job of capturing where we are on the outlook.  In particular, this litany of factors restraining household spending seems a bit discordant, because, as you said, the big news in the fourth quarter was that consumer spending was stronger than we thought.  Therefore, I\u2019d advocate substituting the first paragraph of alternative C for the first paragraph of alternative B. I have one more thing.  I applaud your initiating conversations and further discussions about an explicit numerical objective for inflation.  I would just add this observation about these four words, \u201cor a bit less.\u201d  In the past, I\u2019ve brought up my brother-in-law sitting in front of retirement planning software and calling up his brother-in-law who is on the FOMC and asking him what number he should put in for inflation for the next 20 years.  And I\u2019m wondering what I\u2019d tell him if our objective was \u201c2 percent or a bit less", " MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman, it\u2019s the one thing, though, that hasn\u2019t really changed.  That\u2019s where I think there\u2019s a bit of dissonance.  If you think it\u2019s a good idea to up the optimism level a bit, I think a lot of people around the table would be open to suggestions, but I\u2019m not sure that one does it", " MR. LACKER.  Though it is still insufficient", "\u201d MR. FISHER.  It has either strengthened or it hasn\u2019t strengthened.  But the Chairman had an interesting suggestion.  Could you repeat your suggestion, please, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Can I just ask Eric to clarify something.  Did I draw the correct inference that you regard this as governing discussions with members of the general media, as well as people whose purpose is to generate direct or indirect trading profits from predicting monetary policy actions", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the subcommittee for doing all of the fine work on this.  I have to agree with President Hoenig.  My experience being around the Fed was that I thought we were already doing most of this, and I thought there was a code.  So maybe it\u2019s a matter of reviewing that code. I\u2019m going to make some general comments that may go in a different direction.  My view is that our discussions of communication tend to be very negative and very risk averse\u2014in fact, I would say they exhibit extreme forms of risk aversion.  There is too much worry that something might be said to someone that might be inappropriate\u2014and certainly we need to worry about that\u2014but that should not be the primary concern of our communication policy.  Our communication policy should be a positive statement of what we are trying to accomplish with communications, and we should think in terms of broad strategic communication policy from this Committee.  Ideally, I would go so far as to adopt metrics about whether or not we are accomplishing our goals through our communication policy.  I think the general judgment over the last three years is probably that we are not accomplishing what we want to accomplish as a Committee. My feeling is that our existing strategy has too often allowed others to define the Fed and to define this Committee, and we need to have strategies and ideas about how to get our ideas out there.  To put everything in a narrow framework about whether somebody will make a misstep at some point is not helping that.  I think that, because we have this view, and it is a longstanding view around the Fed, it has allowed public relations problems and misinformation to fester, and I am very worried that this might do lasting damage to the institution. I do not think that rules can be written that encompass every situation in which we might find ourselves, and I also think that anyone we talk to, in principle, could profit from anything that we say.  So I don\u2019t think you can have a prescriptive thing that maps out every single situation.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good way to go. One general policy would be to convey the same messages in all forums and never reveal confidential information about what is going on in the Committee itself.  I think pretty much everybody adheres to that.  In general, I think that active engagement with all audiences should be encouraged.  That should be something that we are trying to do and trying to get done.  By \u201call audiences,\u201d I mean financial markets, business leaders, the general public, and, in fact, I would greatly expand our contacts.  I would try to think about whether we\u2019re doing enough and whether we\u2019re communicating with certain audiences.  Obviously, we\u2019re missing certain groups of people, and they\u2019re going off and developing their own ideas about what we\u2019re about and what we\u2019re doing.  To put limits on that is going to impair our ability to get messages across and may damage the institution. So I would prefer a positive statement that emphasizes engagement with all audiences.  We certainly do not want people to profit from what we\u2019re doing, but, in some sense, any time you utter a word, I suppose somebody can trade on it.  I would, however, dispute the claim that you can trade successfully on very much of what anybody says around here\u2014I certainly think not, but maybe people think that they can.  We\u2019re giving our own views about where we think policy should go, but each of us is just one voice on a big Committee.  Certainly, the Chairman is different.  The Chairman has a huge megaphone, but the Chairman\u2019s interactions are more prescribed, probably, than are those of the rest of us. Also, many of us talk to a variety of councils that come into the Banks.  Are we going to say that that guy on the council might turn around and profit.  I think this is just a very difficult thing.  So you have to follow this code where you say, \u201cI\u2019m giving you my own positions.\u201d  I say the same things all the time.  I have the same messages all the time.  And I\u2019m happy to try to communicate those messages.  But I don\u2019t think that you can prescribe that such-and-such situation is out of bounds", " MS. YELLEN.  Do you think it would be okay to talk to the clients of a financial firm behind closed doors about your personal views on monetary policy", " MR. FISHER.  You asked for an example.  It seems to me that the optics there would not be good", " MR. FISHER.  I don\u2019t", " MR. PLOSSER.  I\u2019m talking about the media or some people who are Fed watchers", " MR. PLOSSER.  My own personal approach is never to say anything to anybody that I wouldn\u2019t say publicly or haven\u2019t said publicly, for example, in a speech.  I think there are lots of gray areas here.  I agree that it would not look good for one of us to speak at a Goldman Sachs venue, but, at the same time, all of us, I suspect, have spoken at banking conventions sponsored by a not-for-profit organization, such as the American Bankers Association, but basically the attendees include clients and donors and funders.  Is that acceptable, whereas something else may not be.  Or what about a university event, where alumni are raising money to support the institution.  There are lots of cases where it begins to get a little fuzzy, so I\u2019m leery of trying to legislate that kind of controlling policy.   I want to encourage communication.  I want to have more communication, not less, and have more open communication and less behind-the-scenes communication.  I think enforcement is going to be really, really difficult, and, again, I think we just can\u2019t legislate good judgment.  I would prefer that we adopt broader guidelines that apply to everybody and then trust that we will use our best judgment, rather than adopt an attitude where we sow seeds of suspicion by trying to control behavior tightly.  That\u2019s just my general philosophy", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to thank the subcommittee for putting in time and effort and good thinking to help us on this.  I strongly support an effort to come to a mutual understanding about the standards of integrity we expect of each other, and I think that\u2019s really worth doing. I\u2019ve been wrestling with this since the subcommittee sent out materials for us to review.  I thought I had a grip on a number of principles, but I realized I hadn\u2019t thought deeply about what they\u2019re grounded on.  I think it\u2019s difficult to draw bright lines, and that\u2019s what I am struck with in reading what you have distributed.  Let me take this phrase as an example:  \u201cindividuals whose purpose may be to generate direct or indirect trading profits.\u201d  I\u2019m often at receptions around the District, where I talk to people who are members of the public.  As someone else remarked, virtually any of them could have a portfolio on which they could make a decision that might reflect what they thought they gleaned from what I said.  I think we all know what we\u2019re trying to capture\u2014the Macroeconomic Advisers of the world\u2014but the net is drawn too loosely. The other issue is predicting monetary policy, and that stuck in my head for a bit, because, if you look at this from a broader perspective, we\u2019ve been on a three-decade journey towards greater transparency, towards fuller communication.  I think we talk a lot more about our individual views than we used to.  I haven\u2019t gone back and compared speeches, but my general sense is that, over the last 20 years, members of the FOMC\u2014Governors and Presidents\u2014say more in public about their own views than they used to.  We used to be much more guarded.  Central banks around the world over the last 20 or 30 years have become much more forthcoming, and I think there\u2019s a really good reason for that.  I think that we all understand that we are more effective the more the public understands about how and why we do things.  We want people to understand our reaction function, so, in some sense, we want people to be able to predict monetary policy.  That creates an inevitable tension.  Obviously, if markets expect a move of 25 basis points, and somebody tips them off that it\u2019s going to be 50, that\u2019s a problem.  But, explaining macroeconomics to somebody presumably doesn\u2019t prejudice a decision and helps what we\u2019re doing going forward.  Between those two poles there\u2019s going to be some fuzziness; for example, the elements of macroeconomics that you choose to enlighten people about can convey information about your views\u2014in fact, this is a time-honored Fed communication practice that we use to hint about one thing or another. This is a hard issue to resolve, and it draws me strongly to the idea of dealing with it in terms of principles rather than prescriptive, detailed, legalistic rules.  Along the same lines, I think that centralized reporting is going to absorb a lot of time and effort on a small fraction of cases that are sort of blurry; for example, people will be spending time trying to figure whether they should report something or not, and it\u2019s not likely to be worth the effort.  I think what we\u2019re going for should be a mutual understanding of the general principles involved, which are selectivity of access and inappropriate disclosure, or the perception of those two things. I think what President Bullard said is really important.  Imagine that we adopt a formal policy on communications.  Imagine that it\u2019s also secret.  So we adopt a secret policy on communication\u2014well, that doesn\u2019t seem right.  I think we\u2019re going to be drawn towards releasing our policy.  And I think President Bullard is right that we want to frame it in the broad context of the value we see of communicating to American citizens.  I also think First Vice President Moore is right that we\u2019re perceived as cozy with Wall Street when the reality is that we spend a ton of time with the citizens around our Districts. In sum, I think it would be useful to have that come through in a statement of what we think our communication is about, and how we do it with integrity.  I would urge the subcommittee to think about it from both the positive side and the negative side and try to craft a philosophical statement that starts things off and says something like, \u201cYes, communicating to the public is important, because they need to understand what we do, why we do it, how we do it, what goes into our thinking,\u201d and so on.  Then, \u201cAt the same time, there are some things we need to keep confidential for the integrity of the process.  Here is how we constrain that.\u201d  But put that as part of a broader, more positive message about communication.  These are my initial thoughts on this, and, at this time, it is all I have to offer", " MR. BULLARD.  I had one comment on Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s remarks.  I thought that the most out of bounds thing that you could do is to talk to a board of directors, especially of a financial institution.  I was taught in the Fed that that was the most out of bounds.  And you, in contrast, have the idea that, if that same bank has its clients in with a big group, that\u2019s what\u2019s out of bounds.  I think that difference shows how murky this is.  When you talk to the bank directors, you\u2019re going right into the bank, and that could be perceived as giving inside information directly to the financial institution", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My first point picks up on something that Kevin said and a couple of people echoed, but it was notably absent from the beginning of the go-round, and that point is that there are discrete issues here.  The one that I think is front and center is that of exclusivity of access, particularly exclusivity associated with profit and trading for profit.  The issue of communication seems to me a different one\u2014related perhaps, but a much more difficult one\u2014and, as you said, Jim, one that has more affirmative elements to it and not simply negative elements.  As you could tell from my earlier question to Eric, I, like Kevin, think the issues of the press are perhaps deserving of some conversation, but they\u2019re separate, as well, in part precisely because if the press itself is acting ethically, exclusivity is not an issue.  They literally are speaking to the world whenever they repeat something that they have heard from one of us. My second point is a little hard to say, but I\u2019m going to say it.  I disagree with Kevin on this notion that somehow the Federal Reserve is special and that the rules that apply to the rest of the government don\u2019t apply to us.  I\u2019ll be honest and say that\u2019s one of the things that has concerned me about the Federal Reserve in the two years that I\u2019ve been here.  I\u2019ll begin with ethics.  There have been some things that I have seen\u2014and, again, it\u2019s hard to say this\u2014particularly associated with some of the behaviors of some directors at Reserve Banks that just shouldn\u2019t be allowed, and I think we need to formalize things considerably more than they have been formalized. The third point is that rules are hard.  Rulemaking is difficult because you always have under-inclusion and over-inclusion.  This is why rulemaking processes are not a straightforward exercise, and why rules are not always the best approach to take.  But, Charlie, precisely because one cannot legislate good judgment, there are times when one needs to legislate behavior.  I think there are circumstances in which the potential for over- and under-inclusion is sufficiently circumscribed that one may need something approaching a rule, even though, in a lot of other areas, principles and examples and guidelines are more appropriate mechanisms.  In a way, some of this discussion was like a first-year law class.  People state a position, and some people create a hypothetical that\u2019s at the edge of that position to show how you can\u2019t possibly have a rule.  Well, of course, you can have a rule, but you can\u2019t necessarily cover everything with that rule.  Several people have been explicit about this, and I agree with them. The most disturbing thing right now is the phenomenon of someone who comes in, talks to most or all members of the FOMC and then to a group of paying clients, essentially advertising that fact and suggesting that there\u2019s a special kind of information.  This is not limited to one person, and this is not just Macroeconomic Advisers, although they have been mentioned.  Way before I was at the Fed, I heard people going around town saying, \u201cOh, yeah, I have lunch with X and Y at the Fed, so I kind of know where they are, and this is where the Fed is heading on this.\u201d  I think this problem is more serious than most of the people around the table think it is, and I have believed since I\u2019ve been here that there was a real problem waiting to explode.  Now, we\u2019ve had a lot of bad press, which has been about other things, but I really think there\u2019s the potential for problems here.  And I have to say that it\u2019s not just limited to, as I said, the Larry Meyer type of issue at all.  I think Larry is going to bear the brunt of a lot of this in some respects, but it really isn\u2019t limited to him.  We\u2019re not at the point of being able to write that rule, but that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t need to be in favor of doing so.  I would add that I really think we need rules for the conduct of directors of Federal Reserve Banks.  I really do.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  There have been meetings where people are formally here in their role as directors and they have attempted to lobby me on applications dealing with their institutions and/or pending regulatory issues.  In one case, even when I suggested to the individual that it was inappropriate, he persisted with my colleagues and attempted to come by my office the next morning.  I just think we need a code of conduct to prevent that sort of thing", " MS. YELLEN.  It\u2019s great that we\u2019re all in agreement.  [Laughter]  I appreciate the wide range of views we\u2019ve heard.  I think that, at a minimum, what I would try to accomplish is to articulate some overarching philosophy concerning communications that expresses both its positive value and the ethical principles that we need to adhere to in order to make sure that we don\u2019t create undue private advantage.  How we get past there isn\u2019t obvious; the gray areas here are immense.  I share the view many of you have expressed that these contacts are very valuable as we carry out our work, and I think our subcommittee really needs to think about whether we can devise any more-concrete guidelines about how the philosophy applies in specific situations.  Again, I appreciate the views you\u2019ve expressed, and, obviously, we have our work cut out for us"], "2011FOMC20110315meeting.txt": [" MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Brian, I would guess that the primary dealers canvassed by the Desk reveal the most about likely market reactions to tapering or nontapering.  But I have noticed that economists, not traders, seem more evenly split than the primary dealers on whether we are going to taper, so there is at least some difference of view out there in the market.  Are there any factors that would militate in favor of tapering, maybe differences in circumstances between now and last year when we observed the relative dominance of the stock over the flow effect", " MR. STOCKTON.  Yes.  I mean, reasonably stable.  As Brian noted, we don\u2019t really see much evidence yet in the TIPS markets that there\u2019s been a significant shift in inflation expectations.  What we have on the upside on inflation expectations comes from the first half of March in the Michigan survey.  Even those longer-term expectations tend to be sensitive to gasoline prices.  As I indicated, even if you look at the increase in the 5- to-10-year ahead, and make some reasonable adjustment for the fact that near-term expectations have increased significantly, that upward movement, even if you abstract from that, might be one tenth or two, which is within the range in which things have been moving.  But I think that certainly is going to bear watching going forward", " MR. SHEETS.  Absolutely.  That figure that I cited was for our estimate of the euro area as a whole.  Now, the ECB may have a more narrow assessment of how much slack there is, but German unemployment is down relative to before the crisis by 2\u00bd percentage points, while Spanish unemployment is up 10 or 12 percentage points.  So there is a dramatic difference between the peripherals and particularly Germany", " MR. BULLARD.  I just wanted to ask a follow-up question.  Is regional variability in unemployment in Europe different than it is in the United States.  There is regional variability in the United States, with significant differences", " MR. BULLARD.  I just have one more question, Mr. Chairman.  In your discussion, Nathan, you talked about weather disturbances and food prices.  Do we have independent evidence that global weather patterns have been particularly different from other years, other than looking at just prices of food products and so on", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The data we have received since our last meeting support the view that the recovery is gathering steam and has become self-sustaining.  Private demand, rather than temporary fiscal stimulus or inventory investment, is increasingly powering the expansion.  Even so, there are ongoing drags from housing, nonresidential construction, and state and local government spending, along with new downside risks relating to possible near-term federal spending cuts and the negative spillovers from higher gas and commodity prices, and broader uncertainties relating to the Middle East, North Africa, Japan, and the euro area.  These risks to the recovery have grown in recent weeks, and they diminish my confidence that we will enjoy smooth sailing ahead. With respect to private spending, I am encouraged that business surveys and anecdotal reports have taken on a more optimistic tone.  Businesses appear far more upbeat about sales and express greater willingness to invest and even hire.  These improved attitudes are consistent with the patterns we are seeing in capital spending.  Recent signals pertaining to consumer spending have been harder to read, but, on balance, they too point to at least moderate growth in line with disposable income.  And surging auto sales suggest a release of pent-up demand. Consumers are hardly ebullient, but they seem more optimistic and for good reasons.  The stock market has recovered, labor market conditions have improved somewhat, those with jobs have less reason to fear losing them, and the burden of debt payments has abated to more normal levels.  Further, a tax cut is beginning to show up in paychecks.  Of course, declining house prices are a continuing negative for household wealth and borrowing capacity, and the intermeeting evidence suggests that this trend continues unabated. Anecdotal reports suggest that access to financing, especially for car loans, has improved even for those with poor credit histories, and this may be an additional factor boosting purchases.  Looking forward, though, I am concerned about the vulnerability of consumer spending to further upward movements in oil prices.  And in this regard, the plunge we saw last Friday in the Michigan survey\u2019s consumer sentiment measure, serves as a wakeup call. History shows that gas prices are highly salient to households, and rising prices at the pump can quickly affect consumer confidence.  In recent weeks, the negative effect of rising gas prices on confidence has apparently overwhelmed all of the positive factors that were and should be boosting confidence.  We should expect some toll on spending, because higher oil prices affect not only consumer psyches but also their purchasing power.  Auto purchases could be especially vulnerable. Turning to the labor market, I see hopeful signs of improvement.  Employment is rising in both the establishment and household surveys, initial claims have declined, and an increasing fraction of firms indicate an intention to add to their payrolls.  That said, like President Evans, I am skeptical that conditions have improved and slack has diminished by quite as much as Tealbook assumes, based on the 0.9 percentage point plunge in the unemployment rate since November.  Such a large decline in the unemployment rate over a short period of time is historically unprecedented, and to my mind, the patterns in the data are hard to interpret.  In particular, I don\u2019t see much auxiliary evidence to corroborate such a large improvement.  For example, even though employment has expanded in both the household and payroll surveys, overall job gains since employment stopped falling have been modest, and the gains since November are far too small to account for such a large drop in unemployment.  Furthermore, there is no evidence of a rebound in labor force participation\u2014something I would expect to see during a recovery.  Hours have also been flat, and this leaves me wondering whether a portion of the recent decline in unemployment may reflect a shift of discouraged workers from the unemployment pool to those counted as out of the labor force.  For example, about 3.8 million workers lost their jobs between November 2008 and March 2009, and those who are still unemployed would have exhausted extended unemployment benefits in recent months.  I recognize that such an interpretation of the data may be completely wrong, but I do see a significant mystery here, and I hope we can unravel it in the coming months. Turning to inflation, it is clear that headline inflation will be elevated in the months ahead due to surging energy and commodity prices.  Friday\u2019s Michigan survey shows that rising gas prices have not only lowered consumer sentiment, but already boosted inflationary expectations.  The survey reveals a sizable increase in inflation expectations one year ahead and a smaller increase in inflation expectations at the 5-to-10-year horizon.  I view this development with concern, but I am not alarmed because, as David and others have noted, the pattern we are seeing is quite typical.  Consumers commonly react strongly to contemporaneous movements in inflation, particularly to gas price increases.  In other words, they overreact to recent inflation data.  This suggests that when headline inflation comes down, as I expect it will if commodity prices either stabilize or reverse course, consumer inflation expectations should fall in tandem.  We have seen this pattern repeatedly in the past.  With respect to pass-through from higher commodity prices, the evidence points strongly to only very limited pass-through to core inflation and inflation expectations since the mid-1980s. I want to thank President Evans for carefully laying out the evidence in his memo to the Committee, and I would like to say that I completely agree with the conclusions he draws.  Thanks to well-anchored inflation expectations and limited pass-through, our Committee has had a good deal of flexibility in responding to such shocks as oil prices escalated between 2004 and 2008, and my expectation is that monetary policy will probably not need to respond this time around either.  That said, it would be dangerous for us to take the stability of long-term inflation expectations for granted.  So we must be vigilant in monitoring data bearing on pass-through of commodity price increases to core inflation, second-round effects on wages, and movements in inflationary expectations in the days ahead", " MR. FISHER.  May I ask one question, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  This is picky, but why use \u201cand\u201d instead of \u201cbut\u201d.  If you say \u201cand,\u201d you\u2019re sort of dismissing it.  If you say \u201cbut,\u201d you\u2019re saying we have to pay attention", "  [Laughter] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So the idea is:  \u201c\u2026these effects to be transient, but it will pay\u201d\u2014.  Yes", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B.  The editing suggestions seem fine with me. The outlook is improved.  Underlying inflation continues to be low, so I expect to support completing our $600 billion of purchases until we\u2019re finished in June.  I have a preference for no tapering of the program. There is a clear risk for policy and our credibility if inflation expectations were to increase substantially.  I think we all understand and agree on that.  I did take a little additional comfort from Brian Sack\u2019s report that indicated that the one-year forward inflation breakevens have only increased a touch once you start looking two years and out, and so most of the shift has been in the near term.  But we need to keep the inflation expectations risk front and center, so I wholeheartedly agree that we should monitor that. Still, I think resource slack is important, and I welcome President Kocherlakota\u2019s insightful comments about slack estimates from the simplest New Keynesian models.  I am a little skeptical about the sturdiness of these conclusions, and I think he used the term \u201creliable measures.\u201d  I\u2019d like to see more on that, I agree with that assessment. Inflation dynamics from the simplest New Keynesian models don\u2019t seem to match the data.  It actually takes quite a lot of work in order to introduce mechanisms like that, and, in fact, some New Keynesian models that don\u2019t have enough of the inflation dynamics embedded in them likely have mean reversion baked into their inflation forecast.  If they don\u2019t have enough inflation persistence, and then they see data that show a drop in inflation, they\u2019re going to see that inflation goes back up, and 2 percent is probably what\u2019s baked into that model.  So I\u2019m really not sure what confidence we should have coming out of those types of models unless the match of the model with the data is reasonable.  I think that\u2019s something that we have to understand.  In the DSGE versions that we use in Chicago, we put a lot of emphasis on the channels that help induce more inertial inflation dynamics, and I would say, like Jeff Fuhrer\u2019s research has emphasized on this, it\u2019s a very important feature.  I\u2019d like to see similar slack assessments coming from models that match the data better, and in the memo that I circulated on commodity prices, I had a line in there that alluded to this.  I think there\u2019s risk in putting too much weight on theoretical constructs that don\u2019t really describe the data nearly well enough.  I\u2019m not quite sure how much emphasis we should put on that. In terms of policy going forward, the Tealbook has the assumption that the interest rate takeoff will occur in mid-2012.  Yes, that could happen; I could see that that could be acceptable even with my outlook and concerns.  I still expect that core PCE inflation at that time is going to be 1\u00bd percent or less, so I\u2019m a little nervous about that, but if the facts change, I will change my opinion on that. Thinking about exit strategy, I can even imagine a reverse tapering of our $600 billion asset purchase, along the lines that Presidents Kocherlakota and Bullard have previously mentioned, that might take place before the rate liftoff.  I\u2019d just like to understand the possibilities there a little bit more, so in the discussion that we have about exit strategy, perhaps a little more emphasis on that than what the consensus was over a year ago. Putting it all together, given the outlook and the inflation risks that we face and the slack estimates that I think are appropriate, I am comfortable with alternative B, Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  Jim, isn\u2019t there a little bit of tension between wanting to include the $80 billion and favoring tapering", " MR. FISHER.  May I just ask for a clarification, Mr. Chairman.  The last time we discussed the $80 billion, as I remember, Michelle spoke passionately about not including it.  Could someone just review the reason we did not include it last time very quickly before we proceed", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  So just one word on that, which is that in an inflation-targeting regime, we would be talking about medium-term objectives.  And that\u2019s really what we have in mind here.  I think that \u201cunderlying\u201d abstracts from the temporary fluctuations associated with commodities", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As I think we have all noted around this table, the recovery continues to gain strength and increasingly appears to be sustainable, and there have been significant recent improvements in the labor conditions.  While we would all like to see stronger growth and lower unemployment, the fact remains that the economy is undergoing a major and necessary rebalancing that includes the deleveraging of consumers, businesses, and financial institutions.  Thus, having this kind of economic growth in that environment is, I think, an impressive thing.  Now, this process will take time, and maintaining a zero rate is as likely, in my opinion, to impede the process as it is to help it.  You heard around the table that we are seeing new leverage being introduced almost as we speak. I also want to comment on President Rosengren\u2019s point, which I think is an important one and a good one, but I think he has it backwards.  Low rates are, in fact, in place and designed to increase asset values, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing.  I gave the example of agriculture, because it is immediate, I know it, but it is an example; there are other asset values that are increasing fairly significantly now using leverage.  And I think this increase, whether it\u2019s an acquisition of a company to expand under very low interest rates that causes an appreciation in value, has to be taken into account.  So if you are going to now have supervision calibrate the movement in the asset value that your monetary policy was designed to increase, you are going to have to have your army stand pretty tall to do that. If you take, for example, this agriculture situation, we can go into a bank, and the loan-to-value ratio for the land has been priced up to 70 percent, which isn\u2019t a bad number, and if you look at it with the prices and the cash flow you say, \u201cAh, that\u2019s a great deal.  It should pay off.  Let\u2019s stress test it.\u201d  And you say, \u201cWell, if you have 300 or 400 basis points, it\u2019s too low, because those prices will come down.\u201d  What do you tell the banker.  Raise capital.  Do you classify the loan.  No, because the cash flows are good, the asset value is there, and the appraisal is terrific.  The problem is, in that situation\u2014and there may be others\u2014you also have a GSE down the road who is making loans for agricultural land that are sweetheart deals.  So you tell the banker to get out of the way.  The problem is, the policy that we have taken on is designed to move asset values, and it\u2019s working.  The problem is:  How long do you let it stay in place.  My point is that we need to move to a more balanced policy.  Specifically, we need to be, again, preparing the market for a rate increase soon, so that you don\u2019t get the imbalances that a collapse, whether in agriculture or the high-yield market that we talked about earlier, where yields are at historical lows.  That is what we need to be thinking about. I see little need to continue purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  Instead, I recommend the purchases end sooner rather than later, and at something less than the number that\u2019s been tossed out there.  I also recommend that we begin to form an exit strategy as soon as next time, if not sooner, to stop reinvesting principal payments from our securities holdings and to allow the size of our balance sheet to begin to stabilize and shrink.  Also, I continue to recommend that we change the forward guidance on the targeted level of the federal funds rate, because this banker I\u2019m talking to says, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to let rates low for an exceptionally long period.\u201d The point is that we are still in the process of crisis policy that\u2019s keeping rates artificially low, moving asset values up, causing these banks and others in the market to take on increasing risk by design.  Supervision, as good as it may be, can\u2019t offset or fine tune any better than monetary policy can fine tune.  And that\u2019s what I\u2019m really worried about.  I am just pointing out that our current highly accommodative monetary policy needs to be turned down\u2014not made tight policy, but needs to be turned down\u2014and the sooner the better, so that we don\u2019t create a new set of financial imbalances and develop longer-term inflationary expectations, because if we wait until we know we have it, it\u2019s too late.  If history has taught us anything, it has taught us that. So that\u2019s where I am on this.  I know I am outside this Committee\u2019s boundaries, but I really strongly feel we are on a path that has a whole new set of issues that is coming at us, not next year, but in the long run.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m also concerned about an intermediate type of discussion, when the long run is where we really are setting things up for future challenges. So that is my issue around asset values.  It is not just agriculture.  I think that\u2019s important.  Thank you", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No.  How about \u201chave remained low\u201d.  How is that.  Would that work for you, President Lockhart.  I think the part about getting stronger and firming\u2014I think that goes against what we are trying to say", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.  Is that okay.  What do you think.  Anyone", " MR. LOCKHART.  Well, my concern is that the attention of many of our audiences is going to be on the last three months, not the trend, as Bill is suggesting, and that we are inviting a view that we are not in touch", " MR. FISHER.  I\u2019m very concerned about inflation.  I think to say \u201clow\u201d is even worse than saying \u201csubdued,\u201d and I prefer to keep the language as it is.  I\u2019ll argue some other things when I have my intervention, but if we say \u201care low, the trends are staying low,\u201d I think it undermines our credibility.  I think it\u2019s a mistake", " MR. EVANS.  This is a very serious change, and I\u2019m not sure I understand it.  The language on the unemployment rate is very familiar; we all understand it.  We have spent a lot of time talking about what a natural rate of unemployment is, and we have talked about structural unemployment.  So we sort of understand 5, 5\u00bd percent, whatever your favorite number is.  Now, with the new language, we are talking about the level of unemployment.  How many millions of people are unemployed today, and do we have an idea of how many million unemployed it will have to be so that it will no longer be \u201celevated,\u201d but it will be \u201cimproving\u201d.  What is the right number when we get to an acceptable level.  Is it zero million unemployed.  I just don\u2019t know the answers to these questions, but with all of the time we spent trying to educate people on the natural rate, we might have to do that on the levels", " MR. LOCKHART.  I am not sure you have enough people supporting the view that the word \u201csubdued\u201d is a problem around the table.  So you should really go with the majority of the Committee", "  I prefer \u201csubdued\u201d to \u201clow,\u201d but\u2014 MR. FISHER.  Yes, I do, too", " MR. HOENIG.  Okay.  The second question that I have is around the idea that we are comparing ourselves with other central banks.  I may not have this right, but if I read it right, the United Kingdom doesn\u2019t actually have a press conference after its meeting; it\u2019s when it releases its projections.  So that\u2019s different than what you\u2019re suggesting", " MR. HOENIG.  And that is not unlike our Humphrey-Hawkins\u2014I mean, in the sense that we put out our projections and respond to questions before Congress.  My other point is\u2014and I\u2019m a little uneasy about doing this, but\u2014at the ECB, they don\u2019t produce minutes, and they don\u2019t have a vote.  So it\u2019s a different model altogether than what we\u2019re talking about here.  And my concern around that is, as we compare ourselves with them, we are not comparing the same things.  There\u2019s a question of handling the difference in views.  We have a broad range of views, sometimes broader than others, and I know that the Chairman represents those, because he does the summaries very nicely.  But we do have minutes that are released, we do have a statement, and if we want to really have that incorporated, my question is:  Why don\u2019t we concentrate on moving the minutes up more quickly, so that you have them out sooner.  And we also have transcripts that others don\u2019t. This Chairman, I understand, would do it very well, but as you get the Chairman up there trying to represent very different views in this press conference, sometimes more different than others, the concern is that you get that out there clearly.  And then, a day later we\u2019re out giving speeches, and if it doesn\u2019t line up, we\u2019re going to have some real problems.  What we\u2019re going to do over time is be forced to the mean.  That is, you don\u2019t want to get too far out of line, if you didn\u2019t quite hear it that way.  And what people hear and do are sometimes quite a bit different. So those are some of the concerns I have about going forward with this.  And I apologize, I didn\u2019t send notes in, because I got to this later than I wanted to.  But those are the things that occurred to me as I was reading this on the plane here", " MR. LOCKHART.  Janet, obviously, a press conference after four of our meetings a year really adds a great deal of clarification to what the Committee is thinking.  Did you discuss at all whether any change in the statement format would be required at those meetings or at all", " MR. TARULLO.  This is probably a good moment to indicate that I think the subcommittee proposal is fine, a good idea, although some of these issues do bear a little bit of thinking.  I have to say, I am concerned about ending the blackout period sooner, and I\u2019m concerned about it, I think, precisely because of the scenario Tom laid out, which is:  Ben gives the press conference, and then there are a bunch of people waiting for 12:01 p.m. the next day to go out and give their own gloss on what\u2019s happened.  And I fear that the dominant play here may end up being defecting, in which case you get a lot of people doing it. I understand the notion of trying to give vent to different or dissenting voices, but I guess, because my observation has been that we have had plenty of dissent, and much of it public, and I\u2019m not sure it has been particularly useful for the Committee as a whole, that maybe we want to rethink a little bit the acceleration of the end of the blackout period", " MR. HOENIG.  Betsy, and to Governor Tarullo\u2019s point, one of the things that makes me a little bit uneasy is that you\u2019re talking about the blackout period.  Well, the blackout period originally was because we didn\u2019t announce anything, and you had to wait until markets figured it out, and so you didn\u2019t want to get ahead of them.  Now we have the statement, which mitigates that need.  But now Governor Tarullo wants to extend the blackout period because the Chairman speaks, and we don\u2019t want people contradicting it. I\u2019m not sure that you\u2019re allowing for the diversity of views you get out there.  And, you begin to say, well, we\u2019re going to confuse people more because the Chairman spoke here, and now we\u2019re going to have a speech that\u2019s a day and a half later.  Those are things I think we ought to think through carefully because this is a regime change.  This is a big deal in terms of what we\u2019re doing and how we are going to affect the dynamics of the Committee going forward.  Now, it\u2019s more of that long-term concern that I have", "\u201d MR. HOENIG.  No, no.  I\u2019m opposed to Governor Tarullo\u2019s point to extend it.  I think it is inconsistent with why we originally had the blackout", "  [Laughter] MR. ROSENGREN.  What were going to be the formal choices that you have", " MR. PLOSSER.  Just a quick reaction.  I think it\u2019s kind of silly to have them different.  It\u2019s going to be hard for people to understand and hard for markets to understand", " MS. YELLEN.  Right.  For all meetings, whether there\u2019s a press conference or not.  So Friday, now, we\u2019re proposing, is okay.  Anybody have a\u2014Bill, you have a look of discomfort", " MR. ENGLISH.  It\u2019s a one-day meeting on Wednesday.  Push the blackout back to Friday. PARTICIPANTS.  No, no, no.  Just leave it at Thursday"], "2011FOMC20110427meeting.txt": [" MR. SACK.  Yes, I do.  As I said, I have many of the same concerns with market functioning in terms of selling.  But I agree with you, it is not the same, and there are some things that are asymmetric.  In terms of the available float, tradable float to the market, that\u2019s very different.  When we were buying very actively, we were removing a lot of the tradable float, and that was likely impairing market liquidity.  And, of course, when we\u2019re selling, we are providing supply to the market that it can trade.  However, as I mentioned, we are not selling the most actively traded TBA securities in the market.  We will be selling these more seasoned, more specific pools, which may limit that benefit to some degree. The concern I was raising was that, if the market thought that there was a single seller who would be in very aggressively, and maybe unpredictably, it would be harder for marketmakers to make markets and provide liquidity to the market.  So it is the uncertainty, I would say, about what the effect of a very aggressive sales program would be that would limit market functioning.  But I want to emphasize that this would be at paces well above what the Treasury decided upon.  We think that there is some room to sell at a decent pace without causing significant market disruption", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am looking at figure 24, \u201cExpected Spread between IOER Rate and Federal Funds Rate.\u201d  If I\u2019m reading this correctly, IOER goes up and the spread gets larger.  Why is that.  I would think the arbitrage would be the arbitrage, given the fees that are in the market.  So why does the spread go up", " MR. SACK.  The current level of the spread is constrained by the arbitrage, but it\u2019s also constrained by the zero bound on nominal interest rates, which is presumably limiting the spread that we see.  Let\u2019s say the arbitrage hypothetically required 30 basis points.  We know the fed funds rate wouldn\u2019t go to minus 5, so the zero bound is providing a limit on how big that spread can get.  I think what you are seeing is that, as IOER goes up, that limit goes away, and the spread increases.  Having said all that, at any level of the IOER rate, we think that arbitrage is relevant and does put a cap on how big that spread can be, because if that spread gets too large, firms will come in and do the arbitrage.  So that\u2019s why the spread only rises to 25 basis points, even with such a large amount of reserves", " MR. SACK.  Under the story I just told, you would expect the same gap at 1 and 2, and that\u2019s not consistently represented in the table.  For some of the columns, you see that pattern\u2014that the gap widens a lot from 25 basis points to 100 basis points on IOER, and then widens only marginally more as you go to 200 basis points on IOER.  That\u2019s true for all of the columns except for the first one.  So, my guess is that the gap that we will see between market interest rates and the IOER rate could widen as we move up from current levels, but, for the reason you noted, will reach a constant level, a steady-state level, well before the IOER rate gets to 2 percent", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes\u2014a clarification, Brian.  I\u2019m looking at figures 17 and 18 on page 3 about the GC repos and the securities lending.  You made a comment that part of the problem was the lack of Treasury collateral in some of these markets, which helps to explain a little bit of the rise in the securities lending and some of the differences in the repo rates.  Is that related at all to the fact that we are buying most of the Treasuries that are coming out through our purchase plan, and that we are actually making Treasury collateral scarce in doing this exercise", " MR. SACK.  The underlying market conditions coming into the FDIC fee were relevant.  We\u2019ve been conducting asset purchases, and that has left less collateral in the market than it otherwise would have had; at the same time, the Treasury has run down the SFP, which also has taken Treasury collateral out of the market.  So there was a backdrop of less collateral available, but it wasn\u2019t causing significant disruption or problems for the market.  What happened with the FDIC fee was much more of an abrupt shift.  Just to be clear, we had expected the repo rate to move down roughly in line with the federal funds rate for the same reasons that apply to the federal funds rate.  But what happened was that the adjustment was more abrupt.  It seemed that the decision by some market participants not to do the arbitrage\u2014not to fund themselves in the repo market, pulling that collateral out of the market\u2014really made it difficult for the market to adjust in the short term.  I would say that the things you point to provide a backdrop of some shortage but not problems, but then the FDIC fee resulted in a much more abrupt adjustment", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Any further questions or comments.  [No response]  Without objection.  Foreign exchange transactions\u2014second", " MS. YELLEN.  Second", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, in the memo that you circulated earlier, and to some degree in your presentation this morning, there is a hint, but not an explicit statement, of the proposition that the choice between option 1 and option 2, and variants thereon, would be tied, at least, to the relative pace of tightening that we would eventually want to undertake.  Is that a correct inference to draw", " MR. ENGLISH.  I guess it is not obvious to me that there would be a big difference between the two.  Either way, if the Committee was clear that it was concerned about inflation, that it was taking steps to tighten policy to address those concerns, I would have thought the communication would be clear, I\u2019m assuming, and the market would react appropriately", " MR. LACKER.  But the market wouldn\u2019t work the same, right", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I\u2019m going to be terse on these.  In terms of 4a, I agree with the statement.  Consistent with the view expressed in 4a, I prefer a corridor system to a floor system, ultimately.  There are definitely some economic benefits to the floor system, which research around the System has pointed to, but all in all, I think the benefits are outweighed by its relative unfamiliarity.  I agree with the statement in 4b as well, and I agree with the statement in 4c, except that I always want to be thinking about asset sales and redemptions as being a bundle, a way of reducing the balance sheet as one, so I would talk about asset sales and redemptions being implemented within a framework. Let me close by saying a word about the suggested FOMC statement about raising the fed funds rate target.  This is on page 16 of the exit strategy memo.  These are certainly early days to be talking about this kind of stuff, but there are some subtle governance issues we are going to be facing as we move into our exit strategy here.  The suggested statement includes a reference to the Board of Governors\u2019 action on interest on reserves.  I think including the Board of Governors\u2019 action in the FOMC statement is confusing and potentially problematic from a governance point of view.  I would, instead, make the FOMC statement about the FOMC\u2019s actions.  The Board of Governors can release a separate statement, presumably at the same time, that could read, \u201cConsistent with the FOMC\u2019s change in its target for the fed funds rate, the Board of Governors voted to change the interest rate on reserves to be\u201d whatever it is.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to follow up on this point that I learned from Vice Chairman Dudley last August, and now I\u2019m apparently going to have to unlearn it.  [Laughter] My concern is that if we adopt a policy of redeeming MBS\u2014suppose we do that in December 2011\u2014and conditions soften in 2012 and longer-term rates fall, we will then be put in the position of stopping the policy at that point, because it could well be at that stage that we will begin to see people starting to pay down their mortgages more rapidly, just as we did in August 2010.  My vision, as I think I have heard from others around the table, is that the balance sheet track should be going on slowly downward in the background.  If we redeem MBS, we are going to be in the position of balance sheet management immediately.  That is what I took away from that", " MR. FISHER.  Could you clarify, Mr. Chairman, that last point.  I have a feeling that will come up", " MR. PLOSSER.  I have just two observations.  I think you\u2019re being asked to synthesize a lot of diverse views, and I understand that.  I think your first point was that the asset sales or the reduction in the balance sheet would depend on economic conditions.  I would encourage you to say that they can either be slowed down or speeded up, because I think the tone of how you say it will suggest that it\u2019s only likely to go one way.  It would be helpful to say that it could go either faster or slower depending on economic conditions", " MR. SACK.  Well, my point was going to be that many of us are surprised that there is not a bit more concern.  I think it\u2019s uncertain how the Treasury would deal with the situation.  We know they have a set of tools that they would employ.  But if pushed to the brink, there is the question of what other steps they may take to be able to service the debt. If it went to the worst-case scenario where there was actually a default-type event on U.S. Treasury debt, I think it would be a significant market event.  And the effects would be in the directions you would expect\u2014a bigger risk premium priced into the Treasury curve, a weaker dollar, and downward pressure on U.S. asset prices if foreign investors and others reevaluate the situation here.  So I think it could be consequential if we got there, but certainly our hope and expectation is that we won\u2019t end up there", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The incoming data point to a more mixed picture than I was expecting when we last met.  We are again in the position of trying to judge whether a slowdown early in the year will extend further into the year.  Overall, I agree with the Tealbook that most of the slowdown is transitory.  In my remarks, I will focus on how I revised my projections since our last submission in January. First, I do see the incoming data as pointing to a surprisingly weak first quarter.  Given the range of weak indicators, I agree with the staff estimate of 1.7 percent GDP growth in the first quarter.  There is no shortage of potential explanations for a softer quarter, ranging from severe winter weather to the run-up in oil prices related to the developments in the Middle East and North Africa. While much of the softness looks temporary, there is reason to take some signal from the recent data and expect some additional softness in growth beyond the first quarter.  In projections from our econometric model in Cleveland, rising materials prices play a lead role in slowing the anticipated pace of GDP growth relative to a few months ago.  While I have previously reported small effects of commodity price changes on GDP growth, in our model, overall materials prices affect the economy more than commodity prices do.  While I don\u2019t anticipate that materials prices will continue to soar, the increases that we\u2019ve already seen were enough to modestly slow the projected pace of growth.  I should also note that my manufacturing contacts have mentioned that materials price increases are importantly affecting activity and profit levels, although not enough to derail growth in their businesses.  Putting all of this together, since January I have pulled down my forecasts for GDP growth for 2011 and 2012 by about \u00bd percentage point to around 3 percent in both years. The one bright spot among an array of disappointing data releases was the April report on labor market conditions, which confirmed the downward trend in the unemployment rate and confirmed a pickup in private employment gains.  Taking a closer look at the implications of unemployment for slack in the economy, my staff presented evidence that labor market slack is not going to go away very quickly.  One reason is that despite recent declines, unemployment remains stubbornly high.  A second reason is that, based on historical norms, firms have plenty of room to increase both hours per week and the number of workers.  Finally, the labor force participation rate is likely to rise as many individuals who would normally be participants in a stronger economy finally return to the workforce.  So while labor markets are improving, there is still a lot of slack in labor markets, and therefore, I don\u2019t see wage pressures picking up any time soon. Labor market slack aside, the upward drift in core inflation in recent months and the rise in materials prices have led me to bump up my core inflation projections from my January submission.  I now expect core PCE inflation of about 1\u00bc percent in 2011 and 1\u00bd percent in 2012. At our last meeting, there was some discussion about how quickly core inflation can rise in light of the significant increase in core inflation that surprised the FOMC in 2004.  My staff examined the chances of a similar rise in core inflation in the current environment.  To formally assess this risk for 2011, they relied on a small forecasting model that incorporates current conditions, which include variability of economic growth and inflation that is somewhat higher today than it was in 2004.  According to that model, even with today\u2019s elevated volatility, the chance of a significant jump in core inflation, combined with modest GDP growth, is only about 20 percent.  Now, clearly, this is enough of a risk to merit paying attention to, but we should not react too hastily when higher probability outcomes show a more gradual increase in core inflation.  In my view, the chance of a surprise rise in core inflation is much lower today than in 2004, because our economy is much weaker today than it was then.  For example, the unemployment rate is more than 3 percentage points higher than it was in the first quarter of 2004. On inflation expectations, in the Cleveland Fed model, which accounts for a time-varying inflation risk premium, inflation expectations are at or below 2 percent out to 14 years.  That said, inflation expectations at horizons of three to five years ahead have risen and are now similar to the levels they were last spring.  After the spring of last year, inflation expectations started to drop with the growing signs of weakness in the economy.  This was a critical factor in my decision to support additional asset purchases.  So we should not be worried about inflation expectations at these levels, but I would not want to see them continue to rise. In my judgment, the risk to the outlook for GDP growth remains balanced.  While the recent weakness in most of the incoming data point to a risk of a sustained soft spot in the recovery, the surprising strength of employment suggests the potential for a stronger recovery. On inflation, I think the risks are more to the upside than the downside because of the rise in input costs and the threat that inflation expectations could move higher in response.  Still, the most likely outcome is a gradual rise in core inflation with moderate GDP growth.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, our region of the country is doing well-to-booming.  If you look at the downside, our housing market is comparable to other areas where there was a buildup of supply that exceeded the buildup in household formation; that we\u2019re working through.  Once you get by that, our manufacturing sector came down slightly in our most recent survey, but that was from a record high and we are seeing that continue to expand.  Our retail sales did slow down in the first part of the quarter, but did pick up pretty significantly in March, which, from our point of view, is very positive.  Agriculture is continuing to do very well\u2014a boom\u2014and energy is also in a boom environment. To add an anecdote on my concern for leverage, I think it is worth sharing this.  We have a pretty sizable energy company, recently formed in the past five years.  It shifted its strategy toward oil, away from natural gas.  And they were able, because of the low cost to leverage, to buy 1 million acres of development rights on land in our region for about $200 million\u2014$200 an acre of development rights.  They then formed a royalty trust and took approximately 65,000 of those acres from which they had borrowed the $200 million, went on an international tour and raised money from sovereign wealth funds for rights to this royalty unit, and then closed their deal here in the past few weeks for rights on 65,000 of the 1 million acres for $238 million.  So leverage is doing well in our part of the country:  low cost of borrowing, easy money, lots of liquidity sloshing around, here we go.  So I bring that up as a caution to this Committee. On the national level, I agree\u2014information we have received since the last meeting indicates that the economy recovery continues and that our labor markets are improving modestly but steadily.  Household spending and business investment in equipment and software both continue to expand, while at the same time improving their balance sheets, which is good, from my point of view.  Since the last meeting, we have also seen that inflation expectations have remained, as we say, contained, except that what we are seeing for energy, food, and now a broader basket of goods  indicates confidence may be waning in that particular sector.  One thing on unemployment\u2014if you break it out, we are seeing pretty significant improvements in employment for college graduates.  We are seeing less in terms of high school and non\u2013high school; I\u2019m not sure monetary policy can solve that, and I think we should be mindful of that. One other thing that I worry about is that while we talk about our very accommodative policy as necessary, we also see these energy and commodity costs rising and moving forward.  And, yes, they may transitory, but I\u2019m afraid that when you have wages that are not rising, real income is falling, and high prices in that environment actually kill demand because incomes can\u2019t keep up.  And the effect on that middle income group that we are so concerned about supporting is going to be negative, not positive.  So we may not see the inflationary pressures three and four years from now, but that may be because we have a new economic crisis built around the fact that we put all of this liquidity into the system, built these commodities up, and when the prices adjust and come down, it will be because we have starved the middle class in terms of real-wage increases. I think we need to be careful about how long we leave this very accommodative monetary policy in place, because we are creating imbalances.  They are going to correct.  And that, of course, will fall most heavily on those with middle and lower incomes.  Thank you", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The moderate pace of the recovery is continuing.  The economy continues to face a number of headwinds limiting its ability to grow faster.  These headwinds include higher gasoline prices, reduced government spending at both the state and national levels, and a housing market characterized by low equity values, supply overhang, and deteriorating quality. Historically, my projections have been more pessimistic than the staff\u2019s because of my continued concern regarding the housing market, low state and local spending, and the slow resumption of consumer demand.  Wanting to offset this pessimism with the seemingly good news that the unemployment rate was looking lower\u2014and not daring to wade into the debate over modern finance models between President Evans and President Lacker, nor having really the extensive list of interlocutors known to President Fisher, and, finally, seeing no short-term end to the fact that I will always be last in the economic go-round [laughter]\u2014I had no choice but to hit the road last week in search of some observable data and traveled to an unemployment center. The one I visited is known for its cutting-edge approach in providing training, job prospects, credit counseling, foreclosure counseling, and other enhancements to people moving in between jobs.  I claim no academic precision to the sampling here, nor do I claim anything about the temporal dimension to these observations.  I went to the unemployment center with no preconceived notion except data from the latest household survey showing that the number of people involuntarily working part time had increased by 90,000 in March to 8.4 million.  The household survey also indicated that the nation\u2019s 13\u00bd million unemployed people have been out of work, on average, for at least 39 weeks.  With all of this labor available, one question I had is whether the recent increased inflation could lead to a wage\u2013price spiral of the kind that typically ignites the runaway levels experienced in 1979 when inflation was 13.32 percent.  Another question I had is whether improvement in the unemployment rate alone should cause us to claim \u201cmission accomplished.\u201d What I observed at the unemployment center\u2014actually, it was more positively called an employment center\u2014is a pipeline that carries the newly unemployed between jobs.  The existence of jobs at the end of the pipeline is what motivates people to even enter the pipeline and participate in services provided throughout the process, such as resume writing, computer literacy, one-on-one counseling, and foreclosure prevention.  The quality of the jobs at the end of the pipeline was not particularly exciting.  The day before I was there, the city\u2019s stadium had been rented by Monster.com to accommodate job seekers and employers.  The job seekers showed up in droves, but the bulk of vacant jobs represented by the few employers that participated looked mostly like multilevel marketing jobs that paid commission only and were based on the number of friends you signed up. Not all job seekers were uneducated.  Most recent additions of job seekers to this particular employment center were college and graduate-school educated.  On the day of my visit, they were pharmaceutical company employees, and they were clogging the pipeline, in the view of the less educated, because the more educated were settling for jobs that were lower paying and of a kind that the less educated were vying for.  Once the less educated saw that they were losing out, they left the pipeline, thereby abandoning the retraining programs that could have been of some benefit and increasing the time these people remain jobless and with insufficient income. Another group of employees clogging exit from the pipeline were the so-called surviving employees.  These employees have jobs but are so demoralized and exhausted by being the sole survivors holding onto their jobs and picking up the slack of the laid-off employees that they, too, are looking for jobs.  Once they add to the competition for a vacant job, they bump away the unemployed in the pipeline who believe themselves to be increasingly stigmatized by the length of time they\u2019ve been without work.  So the existence and attractiveness of jobs at the end of the pipeline determined whether people even entered the pipeline to begin with. For the recently unemployed, the challenge of this employment center was to tighten the link between the employer doing the layoff and the about-to-be-laid-off employee so as to get the employee into the employment center before being laid off.  This way the employee would stay engaged in a job search.  Of course, despite enhancements like resume writing, one-on-one counseling, and computer literacy training, the only real enhancement seems to be a high probability of their being a job. I\u2019ll stop there but sum it up by saying that this picture, were it to be duplicated somewhat consistently across the country, is not a picture of robust job creation, nor one that seems susceptible to setting off a dangerous wage\u2013price spiral, nor one that shows bargaining and negotiation over wages to be anything but concessionary.  It\u2019s a long way of saying that labor markets will be strong when the economy can absorb the people who want to reenter the job market.  Thank you", " MR. EVANS.  Paragraph 2.  We say, \u201cmeasures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low\u201d and then we say that increases in energy prices have pushed up inflation in recent months.  Then we\u2019re going to say \u201cand a decline in inflation to rates consistent with\u201d our mandate.  So we\u2019re now talking about inflation being too high relative to our mandate, whereas we\u2019ve had an extended discussion about inflation being low relative to our mandate.  It seems it needs some modifier like \u201cheadline inflation\u201d or \u201cnear-term inflation\u201d or something", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I believe there are reasonably strong arguments for choosing alternative C from a certain point of view and not providing further stimulus at this time.  The recovery seems well established, and price stability often requires preemption, especially at this time of the business cycle.  Despite those arguments, though, I can support alternative B.  We\u2019ve encountered enough speed bumps in this recovery to make cutting back on stimulus perhaps less urgent right now.  In addition, in our discussion of exit strategies, I didn\u2019t hear any convincing reasons to doubt that we could withdraw stimulus at a fairly rapid clip if need be, and I take it as a corollary of doing whatever it takes to provide sufficient stimulus that we stand ready to withdraw stimulus at whatever pace is required to keep inflation well contained as the expansion unfolds. Regarding language, I did, indeed, make three suggestions regarding paragraph 2(b), two of which were adopted in this draft.  The motivation was to provide, similar to President Kocherlakota\u2019s suggestion last time, more connection to real life in our description of inflation.  It just seemed to me \u201ccurrently putting upward pressure on inflation\u201d was more consistent with an overall inflation rate that hadn\u2019t risen yet and was threatening to, and yet we\u2019d had so many months of inflation well above what we want that it was worth acknowledging to the public that we understand that inflation is, indeed, too high right now, and why. And about relative price changes, President Evans, I understand that when oil prices go up much more rapidly than other prices, it\u2019s a relative price change, but if it brings the average up, then it\u2019s inflation as well, and you can\u2019t deny that.  I mean, if there aren\u2019t offsetting declines in other prices that keep the average constant, one is equally entitled to call it an increase in overall inflation as well. I also was concerned about this language about underlying inflation.  I think it\u2019s widely interpreted as a code word for core inflation, and I had two concerns about sentence 2.  One of the main ones is that rather than relying on the notion of overall inflation converging to what we think of as underlying inflation over time, why not communicate that we think the rise in inflation is transitory; why not come out and say, \u201cWe expect inflation to decline soon\u201d.  It struck me as more clear to say it that way.  The other thing is that sentence 2 is one of the five places we refer to the mandate in this statement, and we say underlying inflation is low relative to what the Committee judges\u2014I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve ever spelled out underlying inflation and made clear that it\u2019s our forecast and not core.  My concern with sentence 2 is that it\u2019s open to misinterpretation that our interpretation of the mandate has to do with core rather than overall inflation.  Evidently there were countervailing concerns about sentence 2.  I\u2019m anxious to hear what they were", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  I\u2019m not totally happy with paragraph 2 as written.  I think it\u2019s an attempt to be what the younger folks might call a mash-up between President Lacker\u2019s version and the original.  At the risk of confusing things still more, let me make a suggestion, which would be to drop the last part that\u2019s highlighted in red\u2014the \u201cand a decline in inflation to rates consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate\u201d\u2014and replace it with \u201cin a context of price stability.\u201d I think what\u2019s confusing about the paragraph right now is, we talk about underlying inflation being low, then inflation goes up to being high, and then we\u2019re talking about what we want it to come down to be.  I find the paragraph confusing when I read it.  I think my suggestion may be more helpful, but maybe others will have ideas about how to address this", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our second round of LSAPs is nearing its scheduled conclusion in June.  I was not in favor of this policy when it was implemented in November, but I see little to be gained at this point of ending it early.  We are almost done. As we discussed last time, I thought it important that our April statement signal that LSAPs will end in June, and alternative B, paragraph 3, does that.  In general, I do prefer the language in alternative C, but like President Lacker, I can live with something closer to B.  However, I would like the statement to go somewhat further in preparing the public for exit and giving the Committee more flexibility, so that it can act sooner rather than later, if necessary.  I think this is a good time to begin changing the language.  Because the Chairman is having a press briefing after this meeting and the next meeting, it gives us opportunities to make more-extensive language changes in the statement than we might feel comfortable doing otherwise.  The Chairman will be able to explain what we mean by our changes rather than letting the public divine what we meant. First, I think we should take the opportunity when the LSAPs end in June to also stop reinvestments of MBS.  We should signal this in the statement by saying the Committee will complete $600 billion of longer-term Treasury purchases by the end of the quarter, and at that time intends to end the policy of reinvesting principal payments from securities.  The market has reacted quite benignly to the Treasury sales of MBS.  I don\u2019t anticipate such an adverse reaction to our announcement that investments will end, and it will help prepare the public for our eventual exit.  I think paragraph 4 is becoming more problematic, given the inflation and inflation expectation numbers.  Are inflation trends really subdued.  Are inflation expectations really stable.  I think we should consider adjusting the language, if not today, then in June.  Is \u201cextended period\u201d consistent with potentially raising the funds rate, as President Kocherlakota suggested, by year-end. Even the Tealbook puts a nonnegligible chance of raising rates this year, although the point forecast suggests a longer period before liftoff.  We don\u2019t want to mislead the public, but paragraph 4, I\u2019m afraid, might do that.  Instead, I think we could say, \u201cThe Committee will maintain the target rate of the federal funds rate from 0 to \u00bc percent today, and based on its outlook for the economy and inflation, anticipates that it will remain low for some time to come.\u201d  This works, because paragraph 2 discusses our outlook for inflation\u2014the fact that we expect the effects of higher energy and commodity prices to have transitory effects on general inflation.  And paragraph 1 explains that labor market conditions are improving.  Because we are releasing new forecasts at the press briefing, changing the language to refer to projections seems sensible. I would also note that among the various policy rules in the Tealbook, the so-called growth rate or first-difference rules suggest that the funds rate should be about 50 basis points this quarter and 90 basis points by the third quarter.  Of course, different rules give different guidance, and I have argued before why I like something more like the first-difference rule, in part because of measurement problems, but I won\u2019t repeat those arguments today. A couple of wording choices we talked about last time could be implemented today and explained during the press conference.  I would like us to consider changing paragraph 2 so that it refers to\u2014and I raised this point last time\u2014\u201cemployment\u201d or \u201cunemployment\u201d rather than the \u201cunemployment rate.\u201d  Our mandate is in terms of maximum employment, not the unemployment rate.  Labor force participation rates are a variable we have even less control over than we do employment.  By emphasizing the unemployment rate, we risk giving the idea that we won\u2019t begin exiting until the unemployment rate is back down to the natural rate.  But this is misleading.  I believe we will need to act before the unemployment rate gets back down to a normal level. I think alternative C\u2019s characterization of where the economy is relative to our dual mandate\u2014namely, that employment and inflation have moved somewhat closer to the levels that the Committee judges is mandate consistent\u2014rings truer than paragraph 2 in alternative B, which seems to brush aside the recent increases in inflation and inflation forecasts.  That is why I generally prefer alternative C. We also should consider clarifying what we mean by underlying inflation.  As President Lacker was suggesting, we had this conversation last time as well.  I think we have some concept of inflation over the medium run, not just core inflation in mind.  So why don\u2019t we say that, rather than referring to underlying inflation. I\u2019m also worried that claiming expectations remain stable may not be entirely credible.  Indeed, some have argued that, in fact, expectations of inflation have risen, reflecting the abating concerns about deflation.  Five-year, five-year TIPS have risen considerably since last fall, and so to say that inflation expectations are stable may be a little bit awkward.  In fact, if we recall, we wanted to get them up somewhat since last fall. So I would suggest that the last sentence of paragraph 1 reads something like as follows:  \u201cInflation has picked up in recent months, but longer-term inflation expectations remain within historical norms, and indicators of inflation over the medium term are subdued.\u201d  I think that language would fit well with the Chairman\u2019s emphasis on our forecast in his press conference, and he could get away from using underlying inflation", " MR. LACKER.  Which medium run, past or the future\u2014going which way", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  In general terms, my outlook is not that dramatically different than it was in March.  My forecast is for moderate output growth, unemployment rates that remain elevated, and core inflation rates that are still below our mandate-consistent levels. Like the Tealbook, I revised up my projection for core PCE inflation.  This revision moved up my expected date for the first increase in the fed funds rate by one or two meetings.  However, my outlook is still consistent with the \u201cextended period\u201d language in alternative B. While my outlook does not support the quicker policy response offered by alternative C, I am concerned about the upside risk to inflation.  Temporarily high headline inflation presents a price stability risk if we\u2019re not able to keep longer term inflation expectations anchored.  Fortunately, as I mentioned yesterday, a range of financial market indicators suggests that longer-term inflation expectations remain mandate consistent, and, in my view, I think we need to maintain those expectations right where they are. I would not use \u201cgenerally\u201d in front of \u201cinflation expectations\u201d in the last sentence in paragraph 1.  I would leave it as it is.  I also think that providing greater clarity on our exit strategy would help us with our policy credibility and help us to maintain inflation expectations at their current levels.  Being more specific with the public about our policy intentions and the methods that we\u2019re going to use would help to offset some of the public concern about our ability to control inflation with such a large balance sheet. I think another step in helping us with policy credibility and maintaining inflation expectations anchored would be to publicly announce an explicit numerical inflation objective.  As we have been discussing, I think this is going to be a difficult time to describe our outlook for inflation to the public.  Setting an explicit numerical objective would help with that communication.  It would also force us to be clear on which measure we are targeting.  So I hope that we can return to that issue at a future meeting. I also share the concern that has been raised by several of my colleagues about the new language in paragraph 2.  That is, stating in paragraph 2 that underlying inflation is low, but then stating later on that we are going to see a decline.  But, Mr. Chairman, given your comments that you will address this at the press conference this afternoon, I am comfortable with the language as it is in this new alternative.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Well, I appreciate that, and I think one characterization is this permanent placement.  But, overall, I think inflation is really low, and so the fact that we move to a different operating procedure where maybe we contemplate a floor where more of it would be permanent\u2014I mean, this is not a partnership with the Treasury; this is not Zimbabwe or anything like that or hyperinflation, period.  And to even talk about monetizing the debt\u2014I mean, President Fisher has used words like \u201cdangerous\u201d out in the public, and I think this is not helpful.  So, yes, I would disagree with that characterization", " MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman\u2014I don\u2019t think we have 100 percent agreement, President Fisher, because you have been saying publicly that we have monetized the debt.  And I don\u2019t think that that was either the intention or the action of this Committee.  So I wonder if you agree with the other part of President Evans\u2019s statement", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  I heard you (President Evans) say something about inflation that made me wonder if we understand inflation in the same way.  You said it\u2019s not inflation if it\u2019s not a broad and uniform increase in prices", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We are near the end of a third go-round, and I have no case to make for a change in policy.  So I had planned to fly in the face of FOMC tradition and stop speaking, but in listening to all of the discussion, I am struck by \u201ccore inflation,\u201d \u201cunderlying inflation,\u201d \u201cheadline inflation,\u201d \u201cinflation in the medium term,\u201d \u201cinflation expectations,\u201d \u201cinflation projections,\u201d and even now, \u201cunmodified inflation.\u201d  And I think it\u2019s really important, if we are going to build credibility, if we are going to emphasize our commitment, that we start to talk about inflation in the same way and what we mean about it.  This debate between President Evans and President Lacker about what is inflation and rebranding inflation says a lot about where our disagreements are.  I think having disagreements about the level of inflation is one thing, but having disagreements on what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about inflation actually creates a lot of confusion.  And I just don\u2019t think we can build that credibility until we\u2019re all speaking about the same thing.  I was very pleased to hear the Chairman say yesterday that core inflation is now yesterday\u2019s news and that we\u2019re actually going to pay attention and talk about the things that real people are actually seeing and help people understand what that means in terms of inflation.  And I think that\u2019s important in all of our discussions. Moving to the statement, having listened to all of that, I was originally agnostic on having \u201cgenerally\u201d before \u201cstable\u201d in paragraph 1, but I think we probably ought to leave it out.  It seems like an extra modifier that I wasn\u2019t sure there was a lot of support for. And then, in paragraph 2, I would agree with President Kocherlakota\u2019s suggestion that we go back to \u201cin a context of price stability\u201d at the end of that sentence and leave out \u201ca decline,\u201d because I got to thinking\u2014all right, pushed up inflation to where, and a decline from where, to a level that\u2019s consistent\u2014where\u2019s that level.  It created three questions in my mind, and I think if we go back to the original language on that last sentence, it would be helpful.  I know you disagree with me, Jeff, but anyway, Mr. Chairman, those are my thoughts.  I support alternative B", " MR. EVANS.  I agree with your characterization, Mr. Chairman.  It\u2019s really the last part, where it mentions a decline in inflation to rates consistent with the Federal Reserve\u2019s mandate, that made me think differently about it.  If you drop that one along the lines of President Kocherlakota, I do not have a problem with the \u201cpushed up inflation in recent months.\u201d  That\u2019s just fine", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  In the interest of coffee, I\u2019m now going to ask how many people would like to just leave the characterization of inflation expectations as \u201cremained stable,\u201d and how many would like to consider an alternative.  How many would like to say \u201cremained stable\u201d"], "2011FOMC20110622meeting.txt": [" VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My preference, unconstrained, would be to omit the entire sentence that begins, \u201cIn particular, the size of the securities portfolio,\u201d because I think it unnecessarily commits us to the direction of a corridor system.  But failing that, I am willing to live with the sentence as it stands without the bracketed language.  Let me explain why that\u2019s my strong preference.  My view is that there\u2019s no reason to commit to a corridor system now.  In the next few years we will learn a lot about operating a floor system.  It doesn\u2019t make sense to commit to a corridor when we don\u2019t have all the available information to make an informed choice about whether we prefer a corridor system or a floor system.  And the costs of waiting to get this information are very low, because market participants are not at all focused or care about whether we make this choice today.  So if we wait, nothing bad happens; there is really very little cost to waiting. Now, I agree with President Plosser that, if there was no possible chance that a floor system could be superior to a corridor system, there would be no point in waiting to get new information.  But I do think that there are a number of reasons to think that the floor system might potentially be superior.  So I want to talk about some of the potential benefits of a floor system. The first thing is that if we had a floor system, there would be more reserves in the banking system, and that might actually help the payment system operate more efficiently.  With a corridor system, in contrast, you are going to have more intraday credit extension, and you are going to have more interbank transactions as people try to get to flat, vis-\u00e0-vis one another.  As a result, there is going to be more interconnectedness through the banking system.  With a floor system, we anticipate that some of the major payment systems like CHIPS and DTC would have fewer payment fails, because there would be more lubricant in the system.  There would be earlier settlement times, and you would have fewer delays in terms of executing payments.  And there would be less congestion in terms of settling the systems at the end of the day.  A second potential benefit of a floor system is that excess reserves could help banks satisfy their liquidity requirements more easily because there would be more liquidity in the system as a starting point.  Third, it\u2019s very possible that a floor system might be operationally more efficient.  If you think about how the SOMA Manager would execute operations on a day-to-day basis in a corridor system, every day the Desk would have to do a careful calculation of money demand, money supply, and how much reserves need to be added or drained from the system.  A lot of those fine-tuning operations would probably go away in a floor system because the little shocks to money demand and money supply would not have consequences for the actual level of short-term rates.  As a result, the operations conducted by the SOMA Manager would be much simpler.  And fourth, a floor system might reduce the volatility in short-term interest rates that is caused by those shocks in money demand and money supply.  In other words, the SOMA Manager makes a forecast of how many reserves the system needs to keep the funds rate at its target.  But to the extent that the SOMA Manager makes a bad forecast and does not hit the desired demand for reserves in the system, then that introduces volatility into short-term rates. Now, in all of this, I\u2019m not saying I favor a floor system.  I\u2019m not arguing for a floor system over a corridor system.  All I am arguing is that it is bad policy to rule out a floor system at the current time given the chance to learn a lot about how a floor system operates in practice.  Now, Charlie said just now, and in his note, that in the April FOMC minutes, the Committee members generally favored a corridor system.  I went back and looked at the minutes, and I don\u2019t read it quite the same way.  Here is what the minutes said, at least the sentences I picked out of the minutes:  \u201cSome participants also noted their preferences about the longer-run framework for monetary policy implementation.  Most of these participants\u201d\u2014those who had noted their preferences\u2014\u201cindicated that they preferred that monetary policy eventually operate through a corridor-type system.\u201d  So that\u2019s most of some participants, and \u201cmost\u201d of \u201csome participants,\u201d as far as I can tell, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a majority.  I think the staff actually counted seven people who expressed a preference for a corridor system.  Another important thing is that this was really not put on the table as something that we are actually considering, corridor versus floor.  Do we want to rule out a floor system at the current time.  This is not something that we really discussed or debated at the last meeting.  So what I\u2019m asking is to keep the current language in place, without the bracketed language.  I think that is a reasonable compromise.  Let\u2019s learn before we commit to either a corridor or a floor system. Charlie raised the issue that a floor system would presumably allow a balance sheet of any particular size.  I would offer President Plosser the notion that we could commit to keeping that off the table by language that might say something like, \u201cthe smallest balance sheet consistent with what is needed for the efficient execution of monetary policy.\u201d  So if you\u2019re really worried that a floor system might lead to an unlimited balance sheet size, we could take that off the table by basically committing to the smallest balance sheet necessary for the efficient implementation of policy.  I think that would address your concerns that the balance sheet would be this discretionary tool of policy", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I knew this was going to happen.  [Laughter]  The efficient implementation of monetary policy suggests that if there are substantial benefits from a floor system in payments and in reducing volatility and so on, then the smallest balance sheet would be consistent with a floor system. All right.  Debbie, will you help me count.  Those in favor of the original language:  \u201cnear its target,\u201d without referring to a corridor system.  [Show of hands]  Okay.  So the majority are in favor of that. Then, we want to compare that with the following language:  \u201cThe associated quantity of bank reserves are expected to be reduced to the smallest levels that would be consistent with the efficient implementation of monetary policy", "\u201d MR. PLOSSER.  Can I question the word \u201cefficient\u201d here.  What do we mean by that.  What are the criteria to decide what \u201cefficient\u201d is", " MR. PLOSSER.  I\u2019m a little bit concerned about symmetry here.  The Chairman at one point last year talked about \u201cextended period,\u201d and we gave the example where, in the Greenspan era, they dropped some language that they changed the very next meeting.  Could we be in an environment where we didn\u2019t want to wait that long\u2014that things would change, and we may have to move sooner than three months.  I\u2019m a little bit worried about the asymmetry that you are building into it that might put us at risk of not moving as fast as we might have to", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you.  Mr. Chairman, I just want to remind the Committee that what we are discussing here are exit strategy principles and not concrete intentions.  And whether or not there are any conceptual concerns with the addition of Narayana\u2019s sentence, I would say that it does somewhat stick out from a tonal perspective in the sense that it reflects a current anticipation and a precise number of months.  If you look through the tone of the principles, there really is nowhere else where we indicate with precision what exactly the timing would be.  One possible way of moving through this is to pick up the \u201cprobable\u201d language that we use in paragraph 5, where we indicate \u201cprobably within a few months\u201d and tack that onto the end of the first sentence in paragraph 4, where we could then indicate that it would probably be within a half-year, or whatever it is, after the modification of the forward guidance.  I think that would be more consistent with the tone of the set of principles that we\u2019re talking about", " MR. FISHER.  I have problems with the ritualistic sequencing of all this.  We\u2019ll talk about that later.  But in this case, just to take your concern, Governor Yellen, and Mr. Plosser\u2019s excellent point, I would just say, \u201cWhen economic conditions warrant, the Committee will begin raising its target for the federal funds rate.\u201d  We don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to do it within one month, three months, or six months.  Why are we pinning ourselves down here.  And then we create expectations.  Even saying \u201ca couple of meetings,\u201d Mr. Chairman, again\u2014with all due respect\u2014we\u2019ll do it when it\u2019s appropriate.  So why not simplify the language.  I respect President Kocherlakota immensely, but I think we are making this much more complicated than we should.  I would simply have it say, \u201cWhen economic conditions warrant, the Committee will begin raising its target for the fed funds rate", " MR. ROSENGREN.  My preference would be to have no timing in this set of principles.  This is a sequence discussion, and I\u2019m very comfortable with the sequence, but I\u2019m less comfortable the more we tie it to timing.  And the more we tie it to timing, the harder it\u2019s going to be to get a consensus on when the timing should start.  So I think we should think carefully about hardwiring the timing.  The more language we put in here that gets into timing, the more likely it is that we are going to have a discontinuity.  I really think this should be a sequencing, not a timing, discussion", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m in favor, as is President Rosengren and I sense Governor Tarullo, of taking all time references out; I think it unnecessarily binds us.  So I wouldn\u2019t include \u201cprobably within a few months\u201d in the fifth paragraph and \u201cover a period of four to five years\u201d in the sixth paragraph.  Any reference to time, I think, puts us in a straitjacket, and conditions may well change.  I know no one at this table who five years ago expected us to be where we are today.  So it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me to have a specific time reference, and that would be my first point.  I\u2019m a little uncomfortable, possibly out of ignorance, as to whether it makes sense to declare that we would raise rates first and then sell.  It might incur losses.  It might move the yield curve.  I would like to say, in paragraph 5, \u201cSales of agency securities from the SOMA will likely commence sometime after the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate,\u201d but then go on to say, \u201cthough the timing of sales,\u201d and then use the very last part of that sentence, \u201ccould be adjusted in response to material changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions.\u201d  To me that\u2019s operationally a commonsense way to phrase it, rather than saying \u201cprobably within a few months.\u201d In summary, I would like all time references to be taken out.  I think that\u2019s a sensible thing to do.  I would also suggest an editorial change in the fifth paragraph in that it allows us at least the opportunity to adjust the timing.  In the language in paragraph 5, I would say, \u201cSales of agency securities from the SOMA will likely commence sometime after the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate, though the timing of the sales could be adjusted in response to material changes in the economic outlook or financial conditions.\u201d  I think we need to be as opportunistic going out as we were going in.  I understand the need for us to have a sense of what our priorities are, but I don\u2019t want to be locked in, in case economic or financial opportunities present themselves.  And to me, that would be a sensible way to write that sentence or that paragraph", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I prefer last in, first out, and never using reserve draining tools.  Otherwise, I can support this [laughter], and I\u2019m not troubled by the timing references.  I think we\u2019re trying to say what we agree on, and I think the timing references that are in there are things you can agree on.  The ones we couldn\u2019t vote to put in were ones we didn\u2019t agree on.  So I can support the adoption of these principles even though I\u2019d prefer something much different", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman.  Could I just make it clear that I support taking out all the time references in every paragraph.  \u201cFive years\u201d and the \u201cthree years", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I\u2019m comfortable with the memo as amended.  I agree with taking out the time references.  I think the only time reference that one might want to continue to include is the \u201cover a period of four to five years,\u201d but I think that\u2019s too narrow, four to five years, because as this plays out, if you ended reinvestment and the agencies are writing off for several years, you might want to have a broader range.  So I\u2019m completely happy with how the Committee decides.  I don\u2019t feel strongly about it, but I think that one is a little different than the other time references", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the sequencing with the elimination of all the time references.  My only concern with the document was that, as written, taking step 2 engages the gears for step 3, and taking step 4 engages the gears for steps 5 and 6\u2014it seems like that would make it difficult to calibrate and maybe even to begin the exit strategy.  So without those, I\u2019m fully in support of it", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just wanted to follow up on President Rosengren\u2019s suggestion about replacing \u201cat the same time or relatively soon thereafter\u201d with the word \u201cnext.\u201d  I\u2019m sympathetic to the idea that we don\u2019t want to have references to exact times, so I\u2019m happy with that.  But on the other hand, the word \u201cnext\u201d does remove the possibility of doing something \u201cat the same time.\u201d  So I would prefer to see something like \u201cat the same time or thereafter", "  MR. LACKER.  For what it\u2019s worth, without the timing references, specifically \u201cfour to five years\u201c regarding normalization of our balance sheet, I find myself in President Bullard\u2019s camp of being unable to really support this.   We\u2019ve talked for a while about wanting to normalize our balance sheet, and we\u2019ve talked for a long time about wanting to do that relatively expeditiously, and to me, if all that\u2019s left is the sequence, and I don\u2019t support the sequence, I couldn\u2019t support this", " MR. LACKER.  Help me understand this strategy.  Do you place greater value on the upside option, given the occularity about the AIG offer, than the market, or do you think that these are underpriced.  The market prices are going to take into account the carry, right.  So this change in strategy should be present-discounted-value neutral.  So I\u2019m wondering whether you have a different idea than the market about the value or you see a higher value than the market on the upside option, given the appearance and the optics relative to the AIG offer", " MR. SACK.  I didn\u2019t learn that the minutes were going to be accelerated until yesterday.  It\u2019s certainly an option to have the statement come out earlier from everyone except the Bank of Japan, with an indication that the Bank of Japan would be expected to take a similar action.  If so, we can bring it forward at least several days.  I think the Bank of Japan didn\u2019t want it too far in advance of their action, but there\u2019s some flexibility there.  The other thing is, given the timing of their meeting, we would like to release the statement in the morning.  So perhaps we could consider whether a release in the morning ahead of the minutes would still be acceptable.  We\u2019re thinking of a 9:00 a.m. release", " MR. SACK.  That\u2019s very hard to say.  We\u2019re in a very awkward equilibrium where the markets assume there will be an outcome because not having an outcome would be so catastrophic.  However, that assumption means you don\u2019t see any pressure in markets, and it relieves the pressure on the political process.  And the problem is that the markets may be expecting this to go up to the last minute, so they may be expecting an eleventh hour solution.  I think that means that there\u2019s a chance we won\u2019t see any significant source of pressure in the markets until we\u2019re right against the deadline or so, perhaps late July or very early August", " MR. SACK.  There are some issues that I think are covered under the current directive.  If upward pressure on repo rates were to drag the federal funds rate up as well, the current Desk directive would mandate that the Desk do RPs and inject reserves, so those I\u2019m taking as given.  More broadly, in terms of how the operations may be affected or how the operations could be changed in response to the consequences\u2014that\u2019s an area where I would seek consultation from the Committee.  I\u2019m assuming the Committee does not want to structure operations for the sole purpose of helping the markets through the debt ceiling problems.  If you wanted to go to the extreme, you could imagine operations like CUSIP swaps, where we would buy defaulted securities and sell nondefaulted securities out of our portfolio.  I\u2019m sure there are a number of very creative things we could do to help the markets through a debt ceiling problem.  I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s not an appetite to go to those extremes.  However, there\u2019s a lot of area in between the extremes in terms of how the operations we conduct regularly will be affected, and those are the things we\u2019ll be sorting through.  If we\u2019re doing anything outside of our regular operations or outside of what we see necessary to meet the directive, we would consult with policymakers", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  At the risk of being repetitive as to what President Lacker already said so eloquently, Mr. Chairman, I think it will be important, in advance of any big event in the markets, for us to be clear to the markets about what our stance is.  I think we might be clear within this Committee, but it\u2019s going to be important as well for that clarity to go through to the markets.  Maybe that can be done by late July or early August or something like that", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It\u2019s a propos that President Bullard just commented that this recession followed the popping of a housing bubble.  Larry Slifman made a similar comment.  I think there is an important and interesting distinction between whether it was the housing bubble or the housing bubble plus the financial crisis.  We have some evidence on financial crises, but we have also seen housing bubbles around the world that weren\u2019t accompanied by a financial crisis.  I think Australia is one example.  You may not know off the top of your head, but do we have any sense of whether recessions are very deep and recovery is very slow when there are housing bubbles popping but not a serious financial crisis", " MR. SLIFMAN.  When you give a briefing, you have to give things linearly, sequentially.  But obviously these things are all endogenous, and there are interactions among all of them.  I think I tried to stress in my remarks that low expected income interacts with fears about future job loss, concerns about further house price declines, and concerns about geopolitical situations\u2014that all of these things interact with each other to affect short-term spending decisions.  Yes, there is some longer-term spending path that we would expect households to converge to over time, but in the current situation, over the period that\u2019s relevant for us, I think that, for a variety of reasons, households can get thrown off those paths or choose to go off those paths for a while", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, either Bill or Brian can add on, but the earlier discussion that Brian led was about contingency planning from the Federal Reserve\u2019s operational point of view, and much of that is mandated by the directive of our normal procedures.  I asked Brian\u2014and I think he is already thinking that way anyway\u2014to consider possible actions that we might take to stabilize markets to the extent we can, with the thinking that if we came close to that time, the Committee would be able to talk about them and see what we were comfortable doing.  So from the Desk\u2019s point of view, I think we have a plan going forward. The other consideration is, we have been strongly discouraged by the Treasury from doing the kind of planning that would involve talking to the private sector.  For example, we have no idea whether the computer systems of BNY, JPMorgan, and the FICC and so on can even manage.  It might be a Y2K type of event in the sense that they don\u2019t contemplate the possibility that they wouldn\u2019t receive principal and interest.  The Treasury\u2019s reasoning is that it doesn\u2019t want to create too much anxiety in markets, and its view is that it intends not to default until it was unavoidable.  You know, we are continuing to talk to the Treasury, and I think at some point we may just have to say, as supervisors and regulators, that we need to do this on our own, and the Treasury doesn\u2019t have to take responsibility for it.  We are, I think, very close to the point where we have to fish or cut bait on those kinds of issues.  So those are the two areas where we are planning.  President Lacker", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since our last meeting, my business contacts in New England have turned surprisingly negative.  This negative sentiment particularly pertains to smaller businesses that are not seeing significant increases in demand and are deciding to put off additional hiring or investments until it is clear that we have a more self-sustaining recovery.  When I press these business leaders on the causes for their change in sentiment, they focus on domestic, not international, concerns, and particularly cite that incoming data continue to surprise on the downside, and they do not see what will turn that around.  Unfortunately, I share the disappointment with the incoming data.  For most of this recovery, the Boston forecast, like many other forecasts, has expected that in a couple of quarters, economic growth would pick up.  However, with each additional quarter we keep pushing back when the self-sustaining recovery begins.  Since the beginning of the recovery, we have only grown slightly above potential, and our forecasts have been too optimistic, resulting in serially correlated errors. What accounts for the inability of this recovery to make significant headway in reducing the significant slack in the economy.  First, I think we have underestimated the financial headwinds generated by the financial crisis.  The impaired balance sheet of many consumers and businesses reduces their access to capital and makes them sufficiently risk averse that they are not anxious to take risks even if loans are available.  Second, our housing policies have been unsuccessful.  Housing prices are unlikely to rise as long as there\u2019s a large overhang of vacant and foreclosed homes.  We need policies that return people to sustainable housing situations but quickly remove the inventory of unsold homes.  Housing is one of the sources of serially correlated errors in the forecast, and our research suggests those errors explain a significant fraction of recent forecast errors, a greater fraction than can be explained by housing\u2019s share in GDP or its obvious connection to household durable goods purchases.  Third, more recently we have underestimated the move to more austerity at local, state, and federal levels. What\u2019s my current forecast.  Well, the Boston forecast, once again, foresees an acceleration in economic growth in a couple of quarters.  And while it\u2019s technically a self-sustaining recovery, the growth rates we envision in the out quarters continue to slip lower and lower.  While such acceleration is our best guess, I am becoming less and less confident that we will actually get that outcome, and even with that forecast of accelerating growth, I\u2019m expecting the unemployment rate to remain above 8 percent at the end of 2012. So what about inflation.  The DSGE models presented earlier had inflation in 2013 ranging from 0.3 percent to 1.5 percent.  The Tealbook has inflation measured as core or total PCE at 1.5 percent in 2012.  The Boston inflation forecast is a little below the Tealbook forecast.  Thus, despite some increase in core inflation from extremely low levels, these forecasts all expect us to be well below 2 percent at the end of the forecast period.  I would also note that some of the increase in current measured inflation is related to higher measures of owners\u2019 equivalent rent.  This is striking given that mortgage rates have fallen, housing prices have fallen, and foreclosures remain elevated.  So at a time of increasing affordability for new home buyers, their reticence or inability to purchase new homes has caused a shift to rentals.  I would view this as reflecting more the dysfunction of the current housing market than any significant risk that inflation in the medium term was at risk of breaching my target of 2 percent. If these forecasts are right, we will continue to miss on both elements of our mandate for several more years.  What about the risks to this forecast.  I see significant risks to the downside, but I will focus only on one, the international risk.  While the Europeans may manage a temporary infusion of money for Greece, I am seeing little evidence of significant mitigation of the underlying problem.  The primary deficit remains problematic.  The debt-to-GDP ratio continues to rise, there seems to be limited political tolerance for more austerity in Greece, and the political desire in the rest of Europe to subsidize Greece seems to be ebbing with the passing of time.  Given my modal forecast and assessment of risks, it\u2019s critically important that the economy begin to grow above potential.  Tomorrow I will discuss the implications of this assessment for an appropriate monetary policy that balances all of the risks in the economic recovery.  Thank you", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Overall sentiment of our business contacts and directors in the Sixth District remains positive, but they are not as optimistic as they were before the last FOMC.  Several directors mentioned greater uncertainty around their cautious optimism for the second half.  Few of our contacts cited major changes to their plans for the remainder of the year.  Among the larger contacts we spoke to, the indications of a slowdown were mixed.  Those that expressed disappointment in activity levels cited causes we had heard before:  higher gasoline prices that reduced shopping trips or ate into consumer discretionary spending and supply chain disruptions that affected auto manufacturing.  A large package shipping company headquartered in Atlanta\u2014you can guess who it is\u2014has seen a general slowing of domestic volume year to date.  In contrast, the country\u2019s largest home improvement retailer is seeing very strong traffic in sales volume, to some extent defying broad perceptions of the economy.  Tourism remains quite strong across the region, both international tourists and domestic.  Our New Orleans directors were notably bullish about the energy industry in the Gulf.  They foresee strong activity and job growth in the coming year. We asked a number of contacts about the pass-through of higher input costs.  The atmosphere seems to have shifted from resistance on the part of major buyers to being resigned to some pass-through from suppliers, and a number of contacts across several sectors spoke of having raised prices or having plans to do so soon.  One grocery chain attributed rising fresh-produce costs to higher fuel costs, and I\u2019m hearing similar accounts from business contacts in places I wouldn\u2019t expect.  The distinction between energy and non-energy consumer goods and services that was suggested in the first draft of the policy statement may not be so neat a distinction. Turning to the national outlook in comparison with the Tealbook, the Atlanta Bank\u2019s forecast and the Tealbook are now essentially the same, whereas earlier there was some separation in terms of the overall trajectory, with Atlanta being more pessimistic.  We decided to hold to our basic forecast path of rising economic growth and interpret the recent incoming numbers, particularly the household spending data, as a temporary setback.  Our forecast incorporates a modest second-quarter number, but jumps to a GDP growth number above 3 percent in the third and fourth quarter.  I actually find this an awkward moment to make a call regarding the implications of the recent disappointing data.  I am \u201ctentative\u201d about both the growth and inflation pictures and won\u2019t be holding to my forecast much longer if incoming data continue to disappoint.  I took note in our recent board meetings of concerns expressed by more than one director about the economy simply being on a longer-term weak growth path, say, a 2 percent economy.  Also, as was mentioned earlier in the financial stability discussion, I think the shock risk has risen dramatically with the debt ceiling, Greece, and Europe, and as my question inferred earlier, the potential of a slowdown in China. As regards the balance of risks, I assess the risks to economic growth as heavily, if not exclusively, weighted to the downside.  The alternative scenarios in the Tealbook ably covered the most obvious downside risks.  Regarding inflation, I think there is a reasonable chance that core inflationary pressures play out for longer than I assume as final prices come to reflect the influence of elevated commodity prices.  I don\u2019t expect this to be on a protracted basis, but I\u2019m concerned that such a story might adversely affect inflationary sentiment with uncertain follow-on effects thereafter.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As widely noted, we\u2019ve hit another soft patch.  The key question is, what are the causes.  Only by understanding the reasons for the soft patch can we gain confidence about its duration and the medium-term trajectory of the economy.  It\u2019s clear that some special temporary factors played a role.  First, the run-up in gasoline prices crimped real disposable income, and this weighed on consumer spending and confidence.  Supply disruptions stemming from the Japanese catastrophe limited motor vehicle output, and may have also depressed demand, as incentives were cut and some popular models were in short supply.  In addition, there is considerable sentiment for the view that the ongoing housing market mess has played a role, with renewed weakness in home prices crimping household wealth and dampening confidence.  And the price declines may have caused prospective home buyers to hold off, even though housing affordability has improved dramatically over the past few years.  Bankers and other business people we talked to also cite regulatory uncertainty, although it\u2019s hard to see why, if this were indeed important, it would bite so abruptly. Regardless of the cause, the weakness of the economy has to be viewed as quite striking at a time when monetary policy is viewed as very stimulative and the healing process following the crisis is evident in a number of areas, including household debt service burdens and credit availability.  I would argue that there is a bit of a puzzle here.  I\u2019d like to suggest that there may be another factor\u2014namely, monetary policy may not be as stimulative as we think it is.  In this regard, I\u2019m not arguing that monetary stimulus is less powerful than normal because of the housing mess or the fact that there are still necessary balance sheet adjustments in train.  I\u2019m making a different argument\u2014that the degree by which monetary policy at a given accommodative setting stimulates real economic activity may diminish over time.  This is not something that we\u2019ve had much experience with, because normally the economy responds quite rapidly to easier monetary conditions.  As a result, this will not show up empirically very clearly in our models or via econometric estimation.  Put simply, we typically don\u2019t stay at very accommodative settings very long, so we don\u2019t have much empirical evidence by which to judge this. Let me explain what I mean in a bit more detail.  Monetary policy at a given setting might provide less lift to the economy over time because either the linkage between the federal funds rate and financial conditions or the linkage between financial conditions and the real economy may weaken over time.  For example, as short-term interest rates stay low, the yield curve will flatten and stock prices will rise, but eventually the yield curve will have a more normal shape and the stimulative effects of monetary policy will peter out.  Japan would be a good example of this.  Similarly, the effects of easier financial conditions on aggregate demand may also diminish over time.  Consider, for example, the prospective homebuyer or car purchaser who responds to a drop in interest rates by moving up the timing of the purchase.  The homebuyer or car purchaser who purchases today will then not purchase tomorrow.  To the extent that monetary policy influences the timing of purchases, its effects will peter out over time. If I am correct that the degree of stimulus at a given rate setting to the economy lessens over time, this has a number of important implications.  First, we might need to increase our degree of accommodation to have the same desired effect as earlier.  Of course, this may not be easy to do at the zero lower bound and with an already enlarged balance sheet.  If we cannot or will not do more, we should expect the recovery to be less robust because monetary policy has lost some of its power.  Second, it implies that exit might need to wait until later because monetary policy will become less stimulative over time just as a natural matter of course.  There may be less reason to exit early because the degree of monetary policy stimulus naturally wears off over time.  Third, early tightening might actually exert considerably more restraint than we anticipate if policy is not providing that much of an impetus to economic growth at present.  We don\u2019t have much experience sitting at the zero lower bound for years, and I hope we won\u2019t repeat this in the future.  That\u2019s why I think we must be open-minded and challenge our assumptions that the current stance of monetary policy is as stimulative as we think it is.  I have encouraged my staff to work on this issue, and I would encourage others to do so as well.  Thank you", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The moderate pace of the economic recovery continues to be shaken by various forces.  As a result, in the short and medium terms, we seem to be moving further away from our mandates.  And, as we learned from this meeting\u2019s financial stability presentation and memo, financial stability, too, is presenting a key risk.  To my mind, the forces that are shaking us off the moderate growth path are related to declining home values, rising prices, and growing and longer-term unemployment, all of which are weighing on consumer confidence.  Wrangling over the debt ceiling isn\u2019t helping as our lawmakers remain at odds over raising the cap by $2.4 trillion.  The Conference Board shows a dip in the confidence index, even from April.  Americans are more pessimistic about the economy and their income prospects.  Something I had never heard of before I came here, the so-called misery index, which means what it sounds like it means, is on an upward trajectory. As I have noted before, one fulcrum of concern is housing.  Residential construction has subtracted from growth in GDP in four of the seven quarters since June 2009.  That is a contrast with the past three recoveries, when housing added to economic growth for at least a year and a half following the downturns in the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s.  Two years ago home prices stopped falling, as low prices, along with homebuyer tax credits, spurred a surge in sales.  Demand then collapsed last summer when those credits expired.  Markets currently don\u2019t have enough buyers to absorb a steady flow of foreclosed properties.  This phenomenon is broad based.  Twelve of the 20 metropolitan areas tracked by Case-Schiller have posted new lows.  Only the Washington, D.C., and Seattle metropolitan areas saw month-to-month growth.  Indeed, the share of mortgage borrowers who have negative housing equity has moved up further in recent quarters to above 25 percent.  This figure translates into about 12 percent of all households.  These falling equity values dent consumer confidence.  They remind homeowners that each month they are making monthly payments on mortgages that exceed the value of their homes; it underscores that the investments in their homes are shaky and not capable of being drawn upon for home improvements, college tuition, or unforeseen medical expenses.  Some of these homeowners will throw back the keys, but even more will attempt a modification in order to try to get some relief from a burdensome monthly payment.  Those who become delinquent will get on the slow train toward foreclosure. This is a train to nowhere, not just for the homeowner, who will soon no longer be a homeowner, but for the bank that holds the mortgage.  The large bank holding companies most actively involved in mortgage-related activities continue to add provisions for repurchase losses.  Repurchase reserves for the four largest bank holding companies now stand at about $11.8 billion, which, even at that staggering amount, is believed by many supervisors to be insufficient.  Foreclosure is also a train to nowhere for the economy, because increased foreclosures are a continued rightward drift in supply, further depressing home prices. One of the big pressures on the demand for housing is the creation of households by younger people.  In a sign of the interconnectedness of the problem of unemployment, many young people\u2014who are suffering more than average from unemployment right now\u2014are doubling up, moving in with friends, with family, and with landlords by necessity, who themselves are struggling to pull together the monthly mortgage payment and are posting extra rooms in their houses on Craigslist to bring in extra cash.  During normal times, about 1.25 million households would be created each year, but that figure now stands at roughly 750,000.  If falling prices cause buyers of all ages to delay purchases, prices will be pushed even lower.  One possible method of halting this rightward shift in supply is to intervene with homeowners before delinquency and move them away from the entry point to the foreclosure pipeline.  Properly structured short sales are one way this could be explored.  In addition, interventions that consist of government purchases of vacant properties in the foreclosure pipeline could also slow a rightward supply shift and a downward demand shift. To sum up, both declining home values and more, and more longer-term, unemployment are weighing on confidence and consumption.  The effects of this dampening seem to be more evident because growth in GDP is not robust enough to mask them.  It\u2019s like the turbulence you feel on an airplane, which is always worrisome, but is all the more worrisome when the plane is flying closer to the ground.  Alternatively understood, the behaviors that are emerging from the intersection of the housing market, unemployment, and confidence impose social costs that are showing up in slow consumption and slow growth in ways that are now unmasked and ways that we are only beginning to understand.  We don\u2019t completely understand these interactions of depressed indicators, but they seem entirely relevant to our assessment of economic conditions and the future path of our economy", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019ve always assumed that this was the time to ask a question about the optimal policy chart that\u2019s in the second part of the Tealbook because we don\u2019t do it at other times.  One thing raised in our discussion of DSGE models yesterday is the possibility of using that type of analysis to do an optimal policy exercise, which we might be more comfortable with.  But until then, we have FRB/US, with which I am also pretty comfortable.  This time I notice that the inflation projection with the funds rate constant is not really different than the counterfactual in which the funds rate is allowed to be negative.  While there doesn\u2019t seem to be much discrepancy in these paths, I will note that the core inflation path is a lot higher than the Tealbook extended forecast.  First, I was curious as to why that\u2019s the case", "  MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  As I said in yesterday\u2019s round, I continue to see the most probable path of the economy as expansion at a moderate pace, and I also continue to forecast subdued inflation once the effects of the earlier oil and commodity price increases dissipate.  But I do think we are at a difficult juncture.  The economic data have underperformed.  My outlook, like many, has been marked down moderately, and there are abundant downside risks as well as increased shock vulnerability.  At the same time, the uncertainty around the inflation outlook has increased, and upside inflation risks remain.  I think maintaining the current extent of accommodation will help mitigate some of the downside risks to the outlook. Turning to the statement, the characterization of the economy in alternative B is broadly consistent with my own reading of the current circumstances and outlook.  I do think, however, that the context in which the Committee would be issuing the alternative B language involves heightened and shifting risks, and I note that the draft statement is silent on risks to the outlook.  If the Chairman were not doing a press conference after this meeting, the public would learn three weeks later that the central tendency of the Committee\u2019s forecast has been written down somewhat, and the balance of risks adjusted to a meaningful extent.  Absent the press conference, a disconnect might be perceived between the statement and the later accompanying information.  I think today\u2019s press conference affords the Chairman the opportunity, if you wish or if you get the question, to convey the Committee\u2019s sense of the risk context.  But overall I\u2019m satisfied with the current draft of alternative B, and I suggest no changes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The issue, I think, for the U.S. economy is the fact that households and businesses and financial institutions are in the process of deleveraging.  But with adjustments like these under way, the economy grows at a moderate pace, and I doubt that we can stimulate strong growth anytime soon through monetary policy, given the deleveraging that has to take place.  And as much as we would like monetary policy to solve the growth problems in the economy, I think it is beyond its reach.  In my view, accommodative policy generally is appropriate.  I remain convinced that what I think of as excessive accommodation will set conditions for the next set of problems and potentially the next crisis.  Going forward, I think the Committee should consider ways to limit the amount of accommodation that we put in place.  Experience suggests to me that we often react to negative outcomes by easing policy extensively and often.  This easing bias artificially stimulates the economy for a time, as has been noted, and eventually the positive effects of the artificial stimulus fade off.  When the negative effects, such as financial imbalances, emerge, we are forced to engage in even more accommodative policy to combat the ensuing downturn.  In this way, we become enmeshed in what I think of as an unfavorable cycle of easy policies to offset effects of previous easy policies.  And I think it\u2019s a very tenuous way to approach this.  What I\u2019d like to see instead is that we do keep policy accommodative but within boundaries, so that it would not be excessively so.  And I think we\u2019re at a point where using the exit strategy that we\u2019ve worked on can set the context for going forward.  It can address some of what we might call an unstable situation that we have from an extended easy policy that we can\u2019t get out of.  And it would enable us to more gradually bring policy away from this excessive accommodation toward more modest accommodation, and preclude future problems that are years ahead, perhaps, but nevertheless ahead.  Thank you", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic recovery has hit another soft patch.  The near-term economic growth is weaker than I anticipated it would be earlier this year.  But so far the recent weak data have not materially changed my view on the path of the recovery in the intermediate term.  I expect both growth to accelerate in the second half of this year and into next year, a bit above trend, and the unemployment rate to go down gradually. I have for some time argued in this Committee that the shocks that have hit our economy in this crisis have had important permanent elements to them.  As a consequence, I have tried to argue that the traditional measures of resource slack may be overstated, and that, in fact, there were limits to the effectiveness of monetary policy to mitigate some of this fall in potential output.  To that end, I support the Chairman\u2019s proposal to begin characterizing our exit strategy in public communications, including the postmeeting press conference and his monetary policy report to the Congress.  I would also encourage us to continue our discussion of explicit inflation objectives as well.  The press briefing and testimony format allow for a fuller discussion of such an objective to help anchor expectations as we exit and to explain how a numerical objective would help fit into the context of our dual mandate.  Explaining the difference between the inflation objective and the unemployment rate, which is something beyond the control of monetary policy in the longer term, is both subtle and not easy.  Trying to do this in the statement would be too difficult, but the postmeeting press conferences and briefings are a way around that. Given the inflation developments and the economic outlook, I am increasingly uncomfortable with the funds rate sitting at zero.  The Taylor rule framework suggests that it is appropriate that we begin to remove accommodation as inflation accelerates and the unemployment rate falls, as forecasted last year.  Moreover, I am concerned that we are allowing imbalances to build up in the financial sector because the interest rates are so low.  I could easily see us simultaneously raising the funds rate by 50 basis points when we stop reinvestment.  In discussing the sequence of steps, we shouldn\u2019t give the impression that large time frames can elapse between our sequencing of events.  We should make sure the public understands that even after we initialize normalization, monetary policy will remain fairly accommodative for some time to come.  To give the Committee more flexibility, and to prepare the public, we need to seriously consider changing the forward guidance and the reinvestment sometime in the next couple of meetings, if the current forecast plays out as anticipated. At this meeting, I can go along with alternative B.  I do have two observations about language.  The sentence in the first paragraph referring to \u201ca loss of momentum in the labor market\u201d strikes me as going somewhat beyond the facts.  I fear that phrases like \u201closs of momentum\u201d connote to many some indication of a forecast and future path\u2014that is, serial correlation that may or may not turn out to be the case.  The previous sentence in the first paragraph says that the pace of recovery is slow in the first half of the year, and to me that would seem to cover any additional observations we need to make about the labor market.  I\u2019m not sure we need that sentence at all; I would just strike it.  But if that\u2019s unacceptable, I would prefer to simply say in the second sentence, \u201cRecent labor market indicators have been somewhat weaker than anticipated\u201d and drop the word \u201cmomentum.\u201d My second observation concerns the language in the last sentence of that paragraph about \u201clonger-term inflation expectations have remained stable.\u201d  I raised this issue last time because at least some measures of longer-term expectations, if you look at TIPS over the past 10 months, have actually moved quite a bit, as much as 100 basis points on some measures.  Other measures of longer-term expectations, like the SPF and others, have been more stable, but they have historically been stable.  So I am worried about the connotation of longer-term expectations remaining stable.  I would suggest we replace \u201chave remained stable\u201d with \u201cremain near historical norms.\u201d  That\u2019s all I have, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me raise a question about the application of the Taylor principle in the current context.  We can legitimately debate whether the funds rate should be effectively negative in some sense.  But if we take for the moment the premise that, given the weak state of the economy, et cetera, the appropriate funds rate is minus 1 to minus 2, I think it\u2019s pretty clear in the Woodford style of theoretical literature that, as the appropriate funds rate moves up but still remains negative, you wouldn\u2019t respond because of the zero bound.  You may disagree that we are in fact still constrained by the zero lower bound.  But if we are, I\u2019m not quite sure how I see that the Taylor principle would apply", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lacker, I missed part of what you said.  How would a stochastic trend with white-noise innovations be consistent with a constant\u2014basically, 3 percent growth over 140 years.  Wouldn\u2019t you expect to see extended periods of higher economic growth", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support the outlook described in alternative B out of an abundance of hope that the serious downside risks to economic growth do not materialize.  I also support the policy prescription in alternative B. However the economic books and posterity judge the effects of this Committee\u2019s historic purchases of $600 billion of Treasury securities, one legacy of the large-scale asset program that both the advocates and the critics agree on is that this program took place against a backdrop of weak macroeconomic data in the United States; suboptimal fiscal policy; modest, at best, growth in gross domestic product; high joblessness; and a flat housing market.  Part of the rationale for the LSAP was that it would stimulate, or at least counteract, slow economic growth through the transmission effects of low interest rates.  However, when the LSAP began last November, there followed a rigorous bout of Treasury selling, sending yields sharply higher.  Predictably, rates then moved down, after peaking at 3.77 percent in February.  Rates on benchmark 10-year notes are now back below 3 percent, compared with 2.48 percent before the start of purchases.  Where rates would have been in the absence of the LSAP is questionable.  But regardless of whether, in the absence of LSAP, rates would have been higher and deflationary pressures would have taken hold, we do know that lower interest rates have not translated into vastly accelerated business investment or momentous consumption.  From this perspective, the argument for more QE of a similar size and composition is questionable.  Some argue that the LSAP was too modest, but even if it was right-sized for the economy as we saw it then, it seems to me that identical monetary policy accommodation that would be aimed directly at interest rates on Treasuries and mortgage rates may not be the prescription for today\u2019s problems.  Instead, I think a different response should now be considered that addresses with precision the portions of the economy that are clogged. What does such a response look like.  I\u2019m not sure I know, but am heartened by some of the ideas put forward by many here today and yesterday.  I can think of a couple of guideposts, though, that could help steer us.  First, I think we need a hypothesis that identifies where the congestion is occurring.  My present view is that we have low interest rates, which should be capable of spurring economic growth, but that something else is gumming up the transmission.  That something may be an econometric view of consumer confidence that is weighted too much toward the wealth effects of shareholder equity and too little toward the wealth effects of home values.  That something may be the absence of value-maximizing behavior in the behavior of servicers and investors.  That something may be decisionmaking by the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that is not leading to sustainable loan modifications.  We may determine, ultimately, that the only congestion is one of a rational lag in recovery, or we may determine that there is congestion and decide there is nothing that is within the realm of the Federal Reserve to be done about it.  But we certainly can\u2019t come to any conclusion until we try to reach a consensus about what is gumming up the system. Second, we need to understand that while it may not be our responsibility or congressionally-given right to act out of the box, it is our responsibility to think out of the box.  We need to be actively involved in fertilizing the ideas that our staffs bring forward. Third, we need to think about temporal interconnections between trends.  We\u2019ve talked a lot about them in the last day.  For example, if unemployment stays high for an extended period of time, or, in other words, if the number of long-term unemployed increases or the average amount of time a person is out of a job increases, does this affect consumer confidence.  Does this increase the number of homes put into foreclosure.  Or if interest rates are low for an extended period of time, what yield-chasing activities are resulting in a more destabilized financial system.  And when do we move beyond monitoring and become regulatorily concerned and poised to act.  These are but some questions and guideposts that could keep us on the forefront of making sure that we continue to generate cutting-edge ideas about what our economy is experiencing, with potential applications to what we are choosing to do about it.  It seems to me that the considerable expertise around this table is needed more than ever to press us forward in a joint exploration of what ails this economy and whether we\u2019re going to think about doing something within our power about it.  Thank you", "  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Actually, one possibility is to use language similar to what I had in my speech in Atlanta where I said, \u201cpick up somewhat.\u201d  Maybe that would be\u2014can we do that.  I\u2019m trying to avoid giving the sense that we think this is entirely temporary.  Yet another approach is President Rosengren\u2019s suggestion about adding a sentence in paragraph 2 saying that the Committee perceives that downside risks to economic growth have increased.  I would note that adding that would be a very significant change, because would we then also have an inflation risk component.  We haven\u2019t been using the \u201crisk\u201d language.  I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t do it, but I\u2019m a little afraid of doing it on the fly.  President Plosser", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  I\u2019m less concerned about alternative B creating the wrong impression because you are going to give a press conference, and you are going to have the projections.  And the projections, I think, in some ways will speak for themselves", " MR. PLOSSER.  And they do behave differently sometimes", " MR. BULLARD.  I also appreciate the work of the subcommittee on what I think is a very difficult topic.  I have some concerns that I\u2019ve discussed previously with Governor Yellen and President Fisher.  I think there are a lot of gray areas here, and I think this cannot really be helped when you write down a document like this, but it does set up some problems of interpretation, in my view, especially for our staff.  I\u2019m concerned that this document could be over-interpreted far beyond what is intended by this communications subcommittee, and that this could inhibit what we now consider normal staff activities.  This type of over-interpretation, just based on a reading of a vague document, can often happen in a large bureaucracy like the Fed. I\u2019ll give you one example.  The New York Fed has recently put out an innovative approach to communication, the Liberty Street Blog.  A very good researcher in the System, Gauti Eggertsson, put something on the blog based on his research in which he argues that the current FOMC will not repeat the mistake of 1937 for reasons that he exposits on the blog.  I would consider something like this a very normal staff activity.  In fact, I would consider robust and active debate of this type as an important contribution to high-quality monetary policy.  But when I read the document here, it says, \u201cStaff should refrain from publicly expressing their own personal views regarding prospective monetary policy decisions,\u201d which could put an end to that kind of a blog.  So a literal reading of the staff portion of the memo might circumscribe Gauti\u2019s behavior", " MR. BULLARD.  He thinks we won\u2019t because he thinks we\u2019ll look through commodity prices and we won\u2019t make that mistake.   If this interpretation takes hold, I would view that as a very negative development in the Federal Reserve System.  It would be the opposite of the open debate that I think is most appropriate and helpful for monetary policy.  Unless you think that it can\u2019t happen here, I will remind you that there was a time in the Federal Reserve System when staff behavior was tightly circumscribed and people were, in fact, fired inside the System for their views, and it was a serious situation.  That has a chilling effect on the staff.  The staff does not want to work on pressing issues that face this Committee for fear of running afoul of vague rules.  They can decide to do other activities, work on something else, and not address the key concerns of the Committee.  So my suggestion would be to reconsider the staff portion of this memo.  I appreciate that Governor Yellen has suggested that we ask the research directors to look at it and see what they think, but I want it to be on the record here that if that\u2019s the direction the interpretation goes, I would be very much opposed to that. My second concern is that the off-the-record interview is not addressed in this document.  To the extent that we have noncollegial behavior on this Committee\u2014and I don\u2019t think that we really do to a large extent, but to the extent that we do\u2014it comes through the off-the-record interview.  And what are the rules about those interviews.  Do all of these rules apply to those situations. My third concern, which is far more minor, is that the idea of a blackout only applies to speeches or appearances that concern monetary policy or macroeconomic developments.  But the current blackout, the one that we\u2019re in right now, if I count it correctly, had four appearances, one op-ed, and three appearances by FOMC members.  All of them were excellent.  They were not policy related, but I think it\u2019s a very slippery slope to start having lots of presentations, especially when you have any kind of Q&A or anything during a blackout period.  Even if you say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk about policy issues,\u201d it can be, \u201cOkay, I\u2019m not talking directly about monetary policy, but I\u2019m going to go to a conference on commodity prices, and I\u2019m going to characterize my views about commodity prices.\u201d  And then you say, \u201cWell, that was not a monetary policy discussion.  It was a commodity prices discussion,\u201d but yes, it impinges on what our views on policy would be.  So I think it\u2019s a very slippery slope to get into the business of doing a lot of presentations and appearances during a blackout in which you\u2019re going to define what macroeconomics is and what macroeconomics is not.  The system could break down if we allowed too much of that to go on.  But that\u2019s more of a minor concern.  I think most of the things that we do are very reasonable on the blackout.  For all of us, it gives us something of a respite\u2014that is, a reason that you can turn down invitations because you\u2019re going to go on a blackout.  I think it generally works pretty well, but I think that part is a slippery slope. My main concern, then, is the impact of the vague document on the staff and the possible chilling effect of open discussion within the Federal Reserve System.  Second, I do have concerns about the off-the-record interview because it is not addressed in this document.  And third, the application of the blackout.  Thank you", "  I think that it\u2019s different if you say, \u201cThe implications of the analysis in this paper are that the Committee should\u2014\u201d MR. EVANS.  It\u2019s a framework, not an action", " MR. HOENIG.  Just a point of clarification based on this conversation.  These are identified as \u201cpolicies,\u201d and, Eric, you said \u201cguidelines,\u201d and, Richard, you said \u201cguidelines.\u201d  It\u2019s subtle, but are these guidelines, or is this a policy", " MR. SACK.  Over the next several years, probably about $100 billion a year.  My concern about saying \u201cthree to five\u201d is that while you may be interpreting \u201cthree\u201d as the outcome if the sales begin late, the market wouldn\u2019t know that from this.  So the market could make the inference that the Committee would consider selling at a pace of $300 billion a year.  We currently have $950 billion or so of agency MBS.  By saying \u201cthree to five,\u201d it at least opens the door for interpretation that the sales would actually be at a faster pace than suggested by previous communications", " MR. FISHER.  I don\u2019t want to jump ahead here, but this is why I\u2019m chary about putting specific time references in here.  The point is, I can see both sides of the argument.  We\u2019re going to do it in a way that is designed to minimize the extent to which we might affect the allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.  The reason we put a time frame in there\u2014and, I would argue, one of the arguments for that\u2014would be just to make sure it\u2019s clear this isn\u2019t going to go on forever.  Forgive me, Mr. Hoenig, but I have a feeling that\u2019s your driving impetus here.  But, you know, this is a debate\u2014\u201cfour to five,\u201d \u201cthree to five.\u201d  First, we don\u2019t know when the sales are going to start.  And, second, we are going to do it in a way that minimizes its impact.  That\u2019s what our expectations are.  So I could argue both sides.  I agree with Tom\u2019s concern, I don\u2019t want this to be pushed off indefinitely.  But I think we are boxing ourselves in again by having a specific time frame here.  I don\u2019t think we need to do that right now", "  So it\u2019s done quickly, but it\u2019s conditional on\u2014 MR. FISHER.  The one thing we agree on is, we don\u2019t want to disrupt the marketplace.  What we don\u2019t agree on is the time frame", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Is the idea to include it in the minutes, if we can get to closure"], "2011FOMC20110801confcall.txt": [" CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If they vote in the Senate today, would they vote in the House", " MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman, did you say you were interested in feedback on these processes", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019ll try to be brief.  My comments generally fall along the lines of President Kocherlakota\u2019s.  I\u2019m fairly comfortable with items 1 through 5.  I think they are standard practice as long as we\u2019re using market prices for those operations.  That seems mostly straightforward, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I think where it gets a little more difficult is in items 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.  In each of those cases, there\u2019s this presumption that the market is not functioning and needs fixing in some sense, and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re getting into a little more difficult territory.  I agree with President Williams that parts of this are about liquidity, being a lender of last resort, but I think that because it\u2019s the Treasury, it is particularly muddled and dangerous territory to be treading.  We have faced negative repo rates before.  I\u2019m thinking of item 6 here, and questioning what we mean by market functioning.  In some of these areas that involve more policy choices or changes in our policy, I\u2019d like the Desk to be a little more explicit about what they mean by market functioning and to what extent it needs repairing in some sense.  That is, do we know what the right prices might need to be for some of these items.  I think that items 6 and 7 I can live with, but we need to be very careful. I\u2019m particularly troubled by item 8.  I think you have two types of money market mutual funds, including ones that may be a mixture of various types of assets.  If those money market mutual funds have trouble with Treasuries and liquidity, they can always sell other types of assets.  They don\u2019t need to sell their Treasuries, so I think that that\u2019s not a problem.  But for those money market mutual funds that are all Treasuries, it may run the risk of net asset value challenges.  That\u2019s a different sort of problem, and we may have to address that in different ways.  But I\u2019m very cautious and skeptical of item 8 because I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to tell.  We don\u2019t have the authority without 13(3), and we would have the difficulty of creating moral hazard problems.  So I\u2019m deeply worried about that. I am very uncomfortable with item 9.  That is basically accommodating\u2014and I think it would be seen as accommodating\u2014financing the public debt.  That\u2019s an FOMC decision and not a Desk decision.  So I think we should be very careful, and I would oppose that, unless the FOMC decided to go forward with such an operation. Item 10 is a sterilized version of item 9.  While I\u2019m more comfortable with that than item 9, it does strike me that the reason for going to engage in some kind of swap would be if the prices weren\u2019t set on defaulted securities or we thought the prices were wrong.  That strikes me as us engaging in actively managing the prices of defaulted securities relative to nondefaulted securities, and I think that could be problematic. So with those caveats, those are my views.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to everyone who contributed memos to this discussion.  I found each of them to be quite useful. Regarding the potential policy responses discussed by Bill and Brian in their memo, I do not have any concerns about actions 1 through 5.  I continue to support the current authorization.  As long as our actions with regard to defaulted securities incorporate current market pricing and appropriate haircuts, these policies can be consistent with sound monetary policy. I am a little nervous about actions 6 and 7.  I think we have to be very careful in describing why we would be undertaking these actions.  For example, action 6 would essentially have us, as I refer to it, \u201clease\u201d our SOMA Treasuries in order to alleviate negative T-bill or repo rates.  I think it\u2019s vitally important that this not be confused with a shift in monetary policy that looks like the beginning of an exit strategy.  After all, that is one of the options.  Similarly, action 7 would have us increase liquidity in a way that some might confuse with QE3, if we were to do something like that.  I think the key point I\u2019m making is a simple one:  Although these actions might be appropriate, we would need to be exceptionally clear in our communications.  It sounds obvious, but it\u2019s natural to have trouble with that.  Also, because these actions would be to support market functioning beyond our normal federal funds policy instrument, I\u2019m nervous that these actions might be perceived erroneously as another market bailout for privileged institutions.  To undertake these actions, I would hope that substantial communications would convey the FOMC\u2019s belief that these actions are vitally important to continue meeting our dual-mandate responsibilities. Regarding action 8, support for money market funds, I think the hurdle for this action should be quite high also.  I agree with President Rosengren\u2019s comments that we should study this industry very carefully and think about the right way to respond.  Invoking 13(3) authority shines the spotlight ever brighter on our nonstandard policy actions.  I am nervous about the invocation of \u201cinappropriate prices,\u201d which the memo indicated.  I do think this is a cleaner issue for Treasuries than at any other time we\u2019ve responded recently with regard to other programs.  So maybe it\u2019s workable, but it is a little nerve racking.  Again, I think the hurdle for this should be a judgment that our standard monetary policy responsibilities for employment and price stability justify this. I think actions 9 and 10 also seem like a bit of a stretch.  Without more discussion, expanding our balance sheet would, again, perhaps look like QE3.  I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m opposed to that, and I\u2019m not saying I favor it; I just think it requires discussion.  CUSIP swaps may be ingenious, and we are uniquely positioned to bear those risks as the central bank, but it could look like we\u2019re too intimately involved in funding the Treasury in that situation.  So that makes me a little nervous.  It might be okay, but we ought to discuss that. Finally, I think in general, we need to have many more discussions to understand the myriad implications from actions like these.  We know our monetary responsibilities with regard to the dual mandate, but we don\u2019t have the same type of agreement with regard to financial stability, especially when there are conflicts with that.  So I hope that we don\u2019t have to take these actions as quickly as was contemplated by this memo and that we have the time to think about them more carefully.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My remarks are fairly general.  I agree with President Kocherlakota\u2019s memo that a time of government default is a time when price stability is at acute risk.  Any indication that the central bank may be willing to mitigate the situation through debt monetization could ignite inflation expectations and lead to a catastrophic outcome.  Inflation expectations could be explosive in such a situation, and the crisis could be made quite a bit worse than it would otherwise be.  In effect, the explicit default by the Treasury and the U.S. government could be exacerbated by the threat of further implicit default through higher-than-expected inflation.  This could send yields to very high levels and create a very difficult situation, with some similarities to some of the countries in the European periphery. Given this scenario, I think we would have to be extraordinarily cautious in taking any actions that could be interpreted as debt monetization.  The crisis environment would likely be one where any move by this Committee or the Desk would be scrutinized very closely.  The past several years have shown how powerful the expectations effect can be in a crisis situation.  I think options 9 and 10 would probably feed such expectations and, therefore, that the Committee should probably stay away from these policy actions in the event of a crisis of this type. More generally, I think the tone of the English\u2013Sack memo assumes more orderly market functioning than might actually occur in a crisis with defaulted U.S. Treasury securities.  I could imagine little or no market for defaulted securities.  Even if that might seem like an extreme market response, the securities might become toxic.  We certainly saw examples of this in the last go-round in 2008 and 2009.  The lack of a clear price might make many of the procedures outlined in the memo somewhat problematic, as most of the discussion assumes that a clear market price exists. Be that as it may, it now appears that the U.S. Treasury has ultimately decided to prioritize principal and interest payments even in the event of a binding debt ceiling.  This would presumably eliminate the need to plan for a state of affairs in which defaulted securities are trading\u2014or not\u2014in the market.  However, one caveat to that is that that could change in an actual crisis situation.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m fully in support of items 1 through 5.  With respect to 6 and 7, I\u2019ve said before and I\u2019ll say again here, I think we should consider expanding the short-term money markets, including the repo markets, that are subject to our rate targets.  With the size of our balance sheet and the fact that we\u2019re paying interest on reserves, we\u2019ve actually taken over the traditional fed funds market.  Both of these scenarios contemplate rates in other short-term funding markets moving outside of the fed funds target, so I think that actions that are necessary to move those rates back inside the target would be appropriate and could include the purchases of Treasury bills. As to item number 8, I\u2019m very uncomfortable with liquidity provisions that are a substitute for appropriate regulation on the money market funds, especially those that would continue to support the fixed-net-asset-value regime.  Also, I\u2019m not sure how much the federal guarantee contributed to stabilizing the money market funds and how much our liquidity facilities did that, but in a situation where the federal government was already in default, I can\u2019t imagine that a federal guarantee would be very useful.  Again, I would agree with the Vice Chairman that it probably would make more sense to purchase T-bills than to try to come up with some sort of facility that targeted money market funds. On numbers 9 and 10, I\u2019m very uncomfortable.  I think there\u2019s really a fine line between market-functioning concerns and reacting to the effects of fiscal policy\u2014or lack of fiscal policy\u2014overwhelming monetary policy.  However, I could envision a situation where it was, frankly, a reaction to operational problems, where you had some participants who just plain had no capability to hold defaulted securities.  I learned about three weeks after I got here never to say never, so I will not say that I oppose these, but I would go back to the high-bar caveat.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. SACK.  Could I return to item 7 for a moment.  Many of the items that were considered today were considered in the context of contingency planning, if markets were to become disrupted or go down certain paths.  But the perspective on item 7 that you raised, and that Governor Duke raised, was perhaps that RPs should be done in response to firmness in the repo rate simply for managing financial conditions.  The issue of whether the Committee is comfortable allowing some short-term interest rates to increase sharply even if its federal funds rate target is still being met\u2014that, I think, is a more immediate issue, in the sense that we are seeing firmness in the repo market today.  If there were a concern that allowing the repo rate to be elevated was detrimental to the economic mandates of the Committee, then that seems to me to be a more immediate issue.  Now, of course, there\u2019s a decision about whether the Committee wants to look at a constellation of broader rates in gauging the stance of its policy.  And even if the answer were yes, I guess there is an issue about whether you think this firmness in the repo rate is going to persist.  You could argue for not pulling the trigger immediately in order to see if markets calm down and the repo rates return back into the range of 0 to 25.  I guess I was curious if the Committee has decided that it isn\u2019t concerned about repo rates, if it has decided that it is concerned about elevated repo rates but wants to allow more time to see if they come back down, or if it wants to go ahead and lean toward some kind of an action in that direction"], "2011FOMC20110809meeting.txt": [" MR. FISHER.  And do you sense that that has increased or decreased over the past few weeks.  Just in terms of your gut", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  In terms of the stock market, I agree with Brian\u2019s view, but there\u2019s a different view as well, which is looking at the stock market irrespective of what bond yields are.  Just looking at 10-year trailing earnings, the P/E ratio is actually quite a bit above the long-term, historical average.  Someone like Shiller would say the stock market is actually very overvalued today.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way of looking at the stock market, but there is an alternative view of stock valuation that leads to a quite different conclusion", " MR. HOENIG.  But that\u2019s not in their self-interest.  Or are they able to look beyond that in terms of longer-term outcome.  They are dealers and they are working on their own book, and I worry because some of the conversations I\u2019ve had suggest that their focus is very short term and that they are trying to influence where we come out by how they skew the information toward us.  That gives me some pause.  But you think they\u2019re more objective than that", " MR. FISHER.  I\u2019m hearing more noise about concern about the French fiscal situation, in addition to their bank exposure.  Could you take a minute to comment on France.  Is this something serious, or is it something that people are just piling onto as they look for other problems", " MR. LEAHY.  Well, I think there may be a little of both there.  The spreads of French longer-term bond yields over German bund yields have gone up some.  There have also been rumors about downgrades for France circulating in the market.  I don\u2019t really know how much truth there is to those rumors, but there are rumors.  We have seen some funding pressures for some French financial institutions\u2014 cutbacks on credit lines and such, and paying higher spreads in overnight funding markets.  The pressures are nowhere near the same degree that we\u2019re seeing, say, for Italian or Spanish banks, but they\u2019re creeping up and it\u2019s something to watch", " MR. WILCOX.  It\u2019s hard to know.  We\u2019ve been surprised how weak it\u2019s been.  We think it\u2019s importantly driven by demographic or structural factors associated with the aging of the population, but it\u2019s also pretty clear that there\u2019s an important cyclical component.  And there\u2019s a lot of disagreement, some disagreement among members of the staff here at the Board, lots of controversy in the economics profession.  Getting that decomposition right is very difficult.  But I\u2019d like to ask Bill Wascher to comment", " MR. HOENIG.  You don\u2019t think that much of it is going into foreign direct investment elsewhere", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me say up front that I asked to go first today, not to parse economic data so much as to talk about cognitive dissonance and, specifically, to make a plea to all of us and to remind myself audibly how important it is to resist the temptation that we all naturally feel to cling to our own past beliefs and predispositions, even in the face of a slew of dissonant data. For a year or more, I think that the implicit debate in these go-rounds during FOMC meetings has been between those who argued that we are in an economic recovery that would be steady, though unspectacular, with occasional soft patches, and those who argued that we are in a weaker, halting recovery that would take a much longer time to return us to trend points in growth and employment.  Well, I think that debate is over.  The side arguing steady but unspectacular growth has lost, but it\u2019s by no means clear that the side arguing that the recovery was weak and halting has won.  I think the meaningful debate today is whether even a weak and halting recovery can continue or whether we\u2019re already at or below stall speed and quite possibly slipping into another recession.  Equity markets\u2014which, as Brian mentioned, seemed to reflect for quite some time some of the more optimistic sentiment\u2014have, in the past couple of weeks, been marking down economic prospects.  Yesterday they appeared to be siding with those who think the most likely scenario is a recession, a probability assignment that strikes me as somewhat high, or at least it would have last week. Despite the past year\u2019s debate in which we\u2019ve had different views, every member of this Committee is united in having been too optimistic.  I think that the most pessimistic among us, of whom I was one, certainly did not expect that growth over the past four quarters would be only about 1.6 percent, and would not have thought so even if we had been told about the impact of Fukushima.  Who among us today would stand behind the projections we made last year for GDP growth during this year\u2014and particularly in the second half of this year.  Almost none, if any, I suspect. Most of us, I\u2019m sure, still expect some increase in Q3 growth because of the resumption of auto production that David mentioned a moment ago, but it seems plausible that this impact itself will be transitory.  And to the degree that expectations for a pickup in economic growth in the remainder of this year and into 2012 were dependent on some assumed momentum from a decent first half of the year, they are clearly unfounded.  It\u2019s not immediately clear what other factors will contribute to an acceleration of the underlying pace of growth.  Even the most sanguine view of current conditions must acknowledge that the economy is now sufficiently vulnerable that a modest shock could send us back into recession.  Needless to say, the euro zone situation described by Mike Leahy a few moments ago could be considerably more than a modest shock.  Many of us have been saying for some time that the Europeans had the financial and technical resources to solve their problems if only they would exert the political will.  I fear we are fast approaching the point when this will no longer be the case.  Plummeting equity markets and tightening financial conditions, along with the blow to confidence they bring, could surely also be more than a modest external shock to what is at best now a fragile recovery. Like investors rethinking their market positions, each of us needs to rethink our analytic and policy positions to question the assumptions that lay behind our past expectations, and not just to try to fit the most recent data into our prior views.  We will, I am sure, spend a good bit of time in future meetings analyzing, in the Tealbook\u2019s rather understated formulation, the \u201cforces imposing greater-than-expected restraint on the expansion,\u201d into which an honest inquiry is likely to yield challenges to premises and beliefs held variously by most, if not all, of us in the past year or more.  This inquiry and the debates around it will surely be important in shaping our policies and response to these forces and eventually in deciding when and how to exit.  But I would suggest that there is a more immediate task for us today\u2014that is, to consider just how perilous the current situation is and then, in light of the dangers identified by that assessment, to consider what measures could be taken to reduce the probability of those dangers being realized.  Given that the \u201csteady growth\u201d position has been thoroughly controverted and the \u201cslow but halting growth\u201d position seriously undermined, it seems to me that the cost\u2013benefit analysis of additional monetary policy measures must have changed significantly.  After all, both the string of bad intermeeting data and the substantially reduced expectations, not to mention the recent declines in markets, suggest that the factual predicates for our policy dispositions during the past year were, to a greater or lesser extent, misplaced. Now, the economic go-round in a typical FOMC meeting is a pretty formal, almost\u2014and sometimes literally\u2014scripted affair, and even the policy portion of most of our meetings tends to play out in a fairly structured fashion, and properly so, since proposed language and alternative policy options will quite sensibly have been proposed, modified, and much discussed before we convene.  Today, I think, should be different.  The cumulative effect of the gathering evidence of stagnation, the psychological impact of the ratings downgrade, the growing concerns that euro zone problems may not be contained, and the global market drama of the past couple of days has made this a potential inflection point.  I hope that we can this morning operate in less scripted, less structured fashion so that we can formulate the most appropriate response to the delicate circumstances that confront us for actions that may be taken today or in the coming weeks.  I think we need to be a bit more nimble than we\u2019re accustomed to being, and I hope that in the spirit of all of us questioning ourselves, we can do that for the rest of the day.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yesterday\u2019s equity market selloff certainly gives pause, but I don\u2019t think it obsoletes the views that I prepared as long ago as Sunday afternoon, the diagnosis that pertains to the context of policy.  I wanted to start by saying that President Bullard in an earlier meeting posed a good question when he asked if there was ever a time in the past 25 years when uncertainty did not seem higher than at other times, and he got quite a laugh when he asked about that.  I do think the context of this meeting really does present a lot more uncertainty than whatever the Committee could consider normal.  It seems to me that there\u2019s simply a lot that we don\u2019t know at the moment.  We don\u2019t know if the growth-restraining effects of the first half will fall away as expected.  I think the Tealbook nicely captures the central forecasting challenge of the moment, which is determining the forces responsible for what it calls the \u201cgreater-than-expected restraint on the expansion.\u201d  We don\u2019t know whether the consensus base-case forecast of a stronger second half and stronger 2012 will materialize.  We\u2019re one month into the third quarter, a quarter that the Tealbook projects GDP growth at 3 percent, with little indication in the data of that level of growth.  We really don\u2019t know how the European debt situation is going to play out in coming weeks.  We don\u2019t know beyond yesterday\u2019s developments and this morning\u2019s, if we\u2019re tracking them without BlackBerrys, how the market will sort out the implications of the downgrade.  We don\u2019t know whether the projection of inflation settling out will come true, and we don\u2019t really know whether there are underlying forces at work, forces captured in the Tealbook\u2019s phrases \u201cpersistent spending weakness\u201d and \u201csupply-side corrosion and damage,\u201d that portend a longer and deeper problem of sluggish growth. The outlook, of course, always involves a lot of uncertainty, but it certainly feels to me that the combination of uncertainties at this juncture is unusual.  And, at least going into this past weekend, it inclined me, obviously excluding extreme financial instability, to emphasize an agnostic view regarding the outlook.  So I am holding to the base-case outlook that I submitted in my last forecast in June of stronger economic growth and subsiding inflation in the second half, but with less conviction.  The BEA\u2019s NIPA revisions somewhat changed the narrative in my thinking.  The revisions, along with the negative tone of the incoming data, make it harder to sustain my previous forecast.  When I submitted my projections in June, I was thinking of restraints on economic growth primarily in terms of commodity shocks and the economic fallout from the earthquake and tsunami disaster in Japan.  I think now the list has to be expanded to the uncertainties associated with the ongoing government debt messes here and in Europe.  Friday\u2019s employment report somewhat took the edge off of accumulating doubts, but at this point, I\u2019m reluctant to entirely dismiss the possibility of an outright contraction, which is also a change in my thinking since June.  The Tealbook also references the possibility that \u201cthe self-equilibrating tendency of the economy has been greatly weakened by the damage resulting from the financial crisis\u201d and/or that \u201cthe economic weakness reflects structural factors\u201d that have lowered the potential path of GDP.  I think these are plausible scenarios as well, and they imply much longer periods of relatively slow growth than have been reflected in any of the projections I or the Committee has published at this point.  In many ways, that\u2019s Governor Tarullo\u2019s point.  So going into the past weekend and before yesterday\u2019s market instability, I felt that a wait-and-see approach to the incoming data over the next weeks or perhaps months is especially warranted. Now let me turn to input from my District, and once again, there is some contrast between anecdotal reports we\u2019ve heard and the picture presented by the incoming data.  Listening to reports from my directors and business contacts, I find it hard to identify major shifts in overall business conditions in my District.  Overall, activity appears to be growing at a modest pace.  Business sentiment has slipped a little since June, but I wouldn\u2019t say there has been a significant deterioration in assessment of the near-term outlook of our various boards of directors and affiliated business contacts.  In fact, for the most part, the feedback across contacts was not qualitatively different from June.  Large firms are still reporting a favorable business environment, while small firms continue to struggle.  Improvements in residential real estate have been spotty by property type and region, though overall the housing market remains depressed.  Industrial activity is still expanding, but at a softer pace than earlier in the year.  Auto producers and sellers, however, are seeing a pickup in activity following tsunami-related supply disruptions, and the expectations for auto production and sales are reported to be favorable for the balance of the year.  Consumer spending has slowed, consistent with the national indicators.  Retailers continue to note significant differences between upmarket spending, which has been reasonably good, and middle- to lower-income spending, which has been exceptionally weak.  Many households appear to be reprioritizing their spending baskets in response to constraints on disposable income and heightened uncertainty.  The Atlanta Bank\u2019s chairwoman, who represents the country\u2019s largest home-improvement chain, reports strong sales across stores, with some emphasis on what might be called \u201chome-value investment spending.\u201d Wage and other compensation pressures in general remain very modest, and commodity price pressure evident earlier in the year has lessened.  The capacity to pass through price increases seems to be mixed.  The same home-improvement retailer expressed surprise at the willingness of customers to absorb price increases and noted that they expect to test the limits of that willingness over the second half of the year.  A firm that represents several thousand grocery products opposite supermarkets said their suppliers will be pushing through price increases in the coming months.  A major auto retailer, however, indicated that pricing power has largely played out in that business.  Although a few pieces of anecdotal feedback could cast doubt on the \u201csubsiding headline inflation\u201d scenario, on balance I detected no clear movement of price pressure in one direction or another. As regards the balance of risks, none of my discussions in the past several weeks have revealed sentiment that the economy is sliding back into a recession, but the tone of these discussions was decidedly cautious, and many acknowledged that the downside risks outweighed those to the upside.  I share the view that downside risks to the outlook for economic growth over the near term have risen, and regarding inflation, I still judge the risks as broadly balanced.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  I\u2019ll take a chapter from Governor Tarullo\u2019s opening monologue and dispense with the average presentation.  I do want to note from my corporate contacts that, regardless of the sector, whether it\u2019s rail activity, electricity usage, cargo hauled through the air or on the seas, airline traffic advance bookings, restaurant pricing, or even one of my favorite leading indicators, elective surgery\u2014which, by the way, has declined significantly nationwide, but showing the difference between my District\u2019s performance and elsewhere, cosmetic and elective surgery is up in Texas [laughter]\u2014there is no question that we are seeing, in the reports given by business leaders, a mystically stated \u201cslowdown in the pace of play.\u201d  Also, in terms of not embracing shibboleths that are dear to some of us, I think I have been reporting that inflationary pressure, particularly as we look at it from a trimmed-mean standpoint, certainly seems well contained and within reasonable bounds.  It\u2019s not an issue that I find myself preoccupied with any longer. I must say, Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m a little concerned when I hear people talk about the way the markets\u2014and they\u2019re talking about the equity markets, but I think we\u2019re also talking about broader market phenomena\u2014have behaved in the past few days.  And having been a market operator, working under the strong sense that markets are manic-depressive mechanisms, I think we have to be very careful not to overreact.  We do know\u2014as we mentioned earlier in the previous discussion we had, particularly with Brian\u2014that we\u2019ve had worse periods:  \u201982, \u201974, March of 2009.  So there is substantial downside here.  I would simply say that I think things have gotten worse.  I think we have to call a spade a spade. One of the things that I believe firmly has compounded the pessimism or, put it this way, the lesser enthusiasm I am hearing from my corporate interlocutors\u2014which is one difference I bring to this table; whether it\u2019s valid or not is to be decided by others\u2014is that we cannot ignore the fact that the debt ceiling negotiations were an absolute debacle.  And we have, if not an incompetent government\u2014and I\u2019m not referring to the Administration, I\u2019m talking about the structure\u2014then certainly one that does not give rise to confidence.  Now, I spent 10 days in Italy, away from the lead-up to the congressional vote.  By the way, full disclosure:  President Pianalto was in Italy also.  We were not together; we were in separate parts of Italy.  And I was reading the correspondence we had through encryption in terms of possible alternative actions that might be taken in the event of a default.  One thing I did not see was any television for 10 days.  When I got back, I got off the plane, went to exercise to get over my jet lag the night before the House vote, turned on the television, and scanned through CNN, the networks\u2014even Fox, which I don\u2019t ordinarily watch.  I was taken aback by the frenetic nature of the discussion, but most importantly by what I felt would be a signal that would be received by average consumers, which is having been told by their President, their congressperson of either party, and their senator that the sky is falling.  My immediate reaction would have been to turn to my spouse, if I were an ordinary consumer, and say, \u201cMy God, we cannot take this trip.  We cannot buy X or Y, and we cannot do this or that.\u201d  If I were a business leader\u2014and this is what I did hear in my subsequent discussions with CEOs\u2014I\u2019d be standing, arms crossed, legs spread, saying, \u201cShow me.  Where is the tax regime going to change.  What about the subsidies that I hold so dear for my industry\u2014that I\u2019ve lobbied so hard over generations to get.  How are spending patterns going to change.  And very, very importantly, what are you going to do to me on the regulatory front.\u201d Here\u2019s my point:  The problem we have now is, there\u2019s no question we\u2019ve had very weak demand.  If you look at mall traffic, which is aspirational goods largely\u2014nothing necessary is sold in a mall\u2014and talk to the interlocutors I talk to, it has dropped to zero from a pace in the first quarter of 3 percent.  Off-mall traffic has dropped to 2.6 percent over the past three weeks, largely owing to sales of food, which is a necessity.  But there\u2019s been weak confidence.  There has been a very tenuous\u2014and Governor Tarullo used the term\u2014a sort of \u201chalting\u201d one step forward, one step back; it\u2019s not continuous.  But we all know it\u2019s been somewhat tentative in terms of confidence, and confidence has been undermined.  It has not been undermined by monetary policy.  It\u2019s been undermined by nonmonetary factors.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic news since our last meeting has been very discouraging, and it\u2019s getting harder to argue that the weakness that we saw in the first half of the year was an aberration.  After the GDP revisions, the recovery now looks like a tough slog with occasional bright spots that have been increasingly rare.  So, like many of you, I revised down my forecast for GDP growth over the next year and a half.  While a variety of inflation measures have been surprising to the upside, I think the sources of those pressures will prove to be temporary. I\u2019ll briefly elaborate on my assessment of the outlook.  For some time now, I\u2019ve projected a pace of recovery that\u2019s been on the lower end of the Committee\u2019s range of forecasts, but the incoming data have been even weaker than I have anticipated.  While some estimates of recession probabilities have moved into the danger zone, I don\u2019t think a decline in GDP is the most likely scenario.  Instead, I expect output growth to pick up, albeit to a still-disappointing rate, in the second half of the year.  In my judgment, the key source of restraint on the pace of GDP growth is consumption.  Household spending is likely to remain soft while income growth is limited and households continue to repair their balance sheets.  The recent revisions to the NIPAs have highlighted these forces by significantly marking down income and consumer spending over the past three years.  My business contacts have long stated that retail sales have been unusually bifurcated, with lower-income consumers still struggling and behaving as if the recession hasn\u2019t ended.  Still, my business contacts are reporting some growth, although most are reporting only small gains.  That said, on a more positive note, households are making grudging progress on debt reduction, and in my view, this progress will support modest growth in the economy and not lead to further deterioration. Key auto plants in my District are swiftly returning to normal production levels, which are about 50 percent higher than production levels were as recently as June.  This pickup in production is occurring despite some risks of a slowdown in overall retail sales, because dealer inventories have been left exceptionally low by the disruption in production stemming from the earthquake in Japan.  As the Tealbook suggests, the planned acceleration of auto production should provide a pretty sizable increment to output growth.  The last dramatic recovery of auto production was in 2010, and it was an important factor in one of those rare bright spots in the recovery.  Nevertheless, like the Tealbook, I\u2019m concerned by the risk that this bump-up in manufacturing activity is going to prove to be transitory. Turning to the inflation outlook, I had been expecting to see measures of both total and underlying inflation moderate in the second half of this year.  And overall inflation has moderated, but inflation excluding food and energy has not.  I still consider underlying measures of inflation to be useful predictors of future headline rates, and the Cleveland Fed\u2019s median and sticky price measures both indicate a lower underlying rate of inflation than does the measure excluding food and energy.  In addition, my downward revisions to the pace of economic growth induce me to expect reduced price pressures as the months roll by.  It also appears that financial markets are less concerned about inflation amid the signs of a global slowdown.  Inflation expectations, as measured in the Cleveland model, fell significantly across most durations following the debt agreement and the S&P rating announcement.  For example, the three-year expectation two years forward, which I think is perhaps the most relevant policy horizon, has declined 23 basis points to just under 1\u00bd percent since the July CPI release.  It looks like inflation expectations could again be shifting, and if inflation expectations dip much further, inflation itself may move away from our price stability mandate. Turning to the risks surrounding my outlook, with the momentum to economic growth already so weak, I would put the risk to output as largely to the downside.  In recent meetings, I have viewed the inflation risks as skewed to the upside, in light of both inflation rates and expectations coming in higher than anticipated.  But today, the shift to lower inflation expectations that I\u2019ve observed in the data has caused me to return the risk to inflation to being balanced.  These recent changes in risks have added to the challenges for monetary policy, and I think they suggest carefully exploring a range of policy options.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  To me, the economy appears to be faltering, and the probability that this faltering exposes us to increased sensitivity and vulnerability has risen materially.  Labor market conditions are certainly weaker than in June.  Although the unemployment rate ticked down last month, I don\u2019t see any good news in the labor market situation.  For one thing, I think discouraged workers are holding down the unemployment rate.  Indeed, the household survey indicates that the share of the working-age population that is now employed stands at 58.1 percent, the lowest level since 1983.  In addition, more-forward-looking indicators of labor demand, like the number of temporary employees or the claims figures, are not at all encouraging.  According to the Labor Department, there are 4.6 unemployed workers for every job opening, and these job figures were added in the middle of July before the debt ceiling debate and before stocks began their steep descent.  The economy may not be falling back into recession, but neither does it appear to be growing at the 3 percent rate many had hoped to see in the second half of the year. One of the theories suggested in the Tealbook to explain the notable weakness is that the self-equilibrating tendency of the economy has been greatly weakened by the damage resulting from the financial crisis.  This theory is only partially plausible to me, and here is my evaluation of it.  Consumer and business confidence are not recovering the way they usually do following a downturn, and this lack of confidence could be, as it seems to be already, snowballing into a self-reinforcing cycle of anxiety.  Businesses are hunkering down, weakening the job market further, and consumers, in turn, are launching their own programs of austerity, curbing the spending the economy needs to grow.  If you think through the usual determinants of consumption\u2014disposable income, employment, stockholder wealth effects, housing wealth effects, and confidence\u2014they all are currently a drag on consumer spending growth, and it\u2019s not obvious to me how they are going to get turned around. Most disturbingly, the interactions among these factors seem to be dragging down economic growth even more.  For example, I have a neighbor with an elite MBA but a job that doesn\u2019t need one, and she is so embarrassed about the real possibility of losing her home that she used to call me repeatedly when I was the banking commissioner, pleading for secrecy but needing a sustainable modification.  On this past Saturday morning, when I went to retrieve my newspaper in the yard, she drove by in her car and stopped to chat.  I asked her how she was doing, and she said something like, \u201cThank goodness I squandered my savings fighting foreclosure so I don\u2019t have investments to tank after the debt deal that won\u2019t get us anything.\u201d  [Laughter]  That formulation kind of took my breath away, so we talked about the weather.  But her remark makes me wonder about the self-correcting part of the staff\u2019s possible hypothesis.  If the components of consumption are weak and households don\u2019t expect much improvement, what moves the economy back to its trend level of growth.  It may well be that the overhang of private debt needs to be reduced before we get a sustainable recovery.  After all, taking a long look back, personal debt had become a cornerstone of economic and capital market activity.  While initially consumer debt existed at the fringes of the economy, the prevalence of installment loans, national mortgage markets, and credit cards permitted consumers to borrow against money they did not have.  As the future of middle-class incomes becomes much less stable, the logic of borrowing against such hypothetical future incomes begins to unravel.  In the run-up to the crisis, credit was closing the gap between the haves and the have-nots, but without rising real wages and with a burst credit bubble, vast amounts of debt remain.  If debt deleveraging takes about seven years, we\u2019re smack in the middle of slower growth, with more to come, and the question becomes less about what the outlook for the economy is and more about how monetary policy can help with the pace of this debt deleveraging. There are two dynamics that I think will hold back growth for a while.  First, households and businesses don\u2019t have confidence in the future and so they\u2019re not willing to spend money and take risks right now.  Second, households need to deleverage and aren\u2019t willing to borrow in order to spend ahead of their incomes.  If I\u2019m right about these, the economy isn\u2019t going to recover quickly on its own and is going to need considerable policy support.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  The sentence that appeared yesterday, \u201cFinancial conditions have become more restrictive\u201d\u2014I can understand the equity markets\u2019 behavior contributing to that characterization, but how do you think it\u2019ll be interpreted against things like mortgage rates and other rates that have not risen and, if anything, have fallen.  Treasury rates, of course, more broadly have fallen precipitously", " MR. FISHER.  Yes.  Why not say \u201cfinancial conditions have become more volatile\u201d.  I don\u2019t believe, particularly after Governor Duke\u2019s intervention and the point that Dennis just made with regard to Treasuries, that you could argue, other than the downturn in the equity markets and a slight widening in spreads, that financial conditions have become \u201cmore restrictive.\u201d  Volatile.  Yes.  Restrictive.  I\u2019d question that", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I consider the case for policy action compelling.  Even though transitory factors played a role in depressing growth during the first half of the year, the data we have received since June revealed broad-based weakness that is very likely to persist.  How can a forecast in which resource utilization and inflation both linger at levels below the Committee\u2019s targets possibly be consistent with an optimal monetary policy.  At the very minimum, we should ease policy until our medium-term inflation forecast is centered on 2 percent.  The argument for policy easing becomes yet stronger when we consider the balance of risks to economic activity and inflation.  The downside risk to growth is particularly serious now because the potential for fiscal policy to respond in the event of a downturn is limited, if not nonexistent.  Should those downside growth risks materialize, we would likely be facing significant disinflationary risks, too.  Our arsenal is not empty, and we should avoid any inclination to save our ammunition until a later date. I strongly support your proposal to substitute the language related to \u201cextended period\u201d proposed in paragraph 3 of alternative A for that in alternative B.  As you mentioned, such forward guidance would be broadly in line with the implications of the staff\u2019s estimated outcome-based policy rule and with FRB/US model simulations of the Taylor 1999 rule.  Both of those rules prescribe a funds rate trajectory that remains at the zero lower bound until the second half of 2013, at which point the unemployment rate would be in the vicinity of 7\u00bd percent and inflation would be around 1\u00bd percent.  I would also note that the optimal control rule calls for significantly later action to raise the funds rate off its lower bound at a significantly lower unemployment rate. To further enhance the clarity of our forward guidance, I believe it would be helpful to provide more-specific quantitative information about the economic conditions that are likely to warrant the continuation of exceptionally low levels of the funds rate.  For example, I would propose language along the following lines:  \u201cThe Committee anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 7\u00bd percent and the medium-term outlook for inflation remains subdued.  The Committee currently expects those economic conditions to prevail at least through mid-2013.\u201d  Such a formulation seems roughly consistent with the implications of our June economic projections, which had a central tendency of 7 to 7\u00bd percent for the unemployment rate in 2013:Q4 and a central tendency of 1\u00bd to 2 percent for overall PCE inflation in 2013.  Providing a quantitative threshold for the unemployment rate would also underscore the conditionality of our forward guidance and hence might help ensure that the public interprets the reference to a calendar date\u2014namely, mid-2013\u2014as a forecast, not an unconditional promise.  Indeed, this approach would help the markets and the public understand how a shift in the economic outlook would be likely to affect the anticipated timing of policy firming.  For example, if there were a further downward revision of the economic outlook, investors would recognize that the 7\u00bd percent unemployment threshold would not be reached until a later date, and hence they would push back the anticipated time of policy liftoff. I\u2019d also like to suggest one further change\u2014to paragraph 4 in alternative B to make it a bit more forward leaning.  I would propose changing the word \u201cwill\u201d to \u201cis prepared to.\u201d  In other words, I propose, \u201cThe Committee will carefully assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its policy tools as appropriate to promote a stronger pace of recovery in a context of price stability.\u201d Looking toward September, without a clear improvement in the outlook, there are a number of reasonable options for policy action that we should consider.  For example, I think that extending the duration of our Treasury holdings along the lines suggested in alternative A has some merit.  Such a program is attractive because it might push down longer-term yields, including mortgage rates, and might offer greater support to the housing market.  Another promising approach would be to establish some sort of peg or cap on shorter-term interest rates.  Because capping rates at the short end involves buying at the short end, whereas lengthening the duration of our portfolio involves selling at the short end, we would need to analyze which alternative approach is preferable.  I\u2019m somewhat less inclined to make further cuts in IOER, but I would certainly be willing to entertain such an approach.  At any rate, given the plethora of policy tools and the potential urgency of taking some further action in September, I hope we can plan on having a two-day FOMC meeting to ensure that we have enough time to consider the various options and to make specific decisions as appropriate", " MR. EVANS.  As I mentioned earlier, a 9 percent unemployment rate against a very conservative natural rate of 6 percent generates a policy loss that is as large as if inflation were running at 5 percent against a 2 percent objective.  But my stronger point is this:  We talk and act as if 2 percent is an almost unacceptable inflation rate and a ceiling that limits further policy accommodation.  A couple of examples:  First, the common view seems to be that we will consider further LSAPs and more only if the risk of deflation is significant.  I\u2019m glad there\u2019s a floor, but the ceiling is too low.  Second, in an interview the other day, Don Kohn\u2014for whom I have the highest regard\u2014spoke in the following way.  He said that additional quantitative easing might be appropriate if inflation keeps coming down.  His option for QE3 was handcuffed by an inflation ceiling that\u2019s too low in my opinion.  Today\u2019s medium-term inflation pressures are overstated.  I do not see how this ceiling-like framework is consistent with our dual mandate responsibilities, at least not if the ceiling is 2 percent.  Our objective can be 2 percent.  We should average that, but it shouldn\u2019t be our ceiling. In favoring alternative A, I\u2019m attracted to the additional commitment\u2014defining \u201cextended period\u201d to be at least mid-2013.  I certainly support that.  I suspect that we would have ended up there anyway.  So we should reap the benefit of reducing the uncertainty.  I\u2019m also quite attracted to the additional language that Governor Yellen used in terms of stating that this could be appropriate as long as the unemployment rate is above 7\u00bd percent.  But again\u2014and I don\u2019t have the exact language\u2014regarding \u201cas long as medium-term inflation is subdued,\u201d I would agree with that if we understood better that \u201csubdued\u201d could include 2\u00bd percent in the current environment or even 3 percent.  But I do like that type of language. I think we need to avoid signaling that we\u2019re AWOL, and so I agree with your suggestion, Mr. Chairman.  One thing that does seem missing in the current formulation of alternative B, as I understand it, is that it doesn\u2019t include the characterization that the downside risks have increased, and I wonder how that would be interpreted.  I really think that should be included.  Alternative A has language like that as well as, frankly, I think, a better description of the temporary factors.  I would have been happy to take paragraphs 1 and 2 from alternative A, but I\u2019m quite happy to support your suggestion, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The staff studies on additional monetary policy options were quite helpful.  I would find it both timely and helpful to explore these options in detail, as, to date we have spent far more time managing risks associated with the exit strategy than managing the risks associated with the need for additional stimulus.  Unfortunately, we do not have time in a one-day meeting to fully discuss the memos.  I strongly support the September meeting being two days to more fully map out action should the economy continue along this path.  In particular, it would be useful to try to roughly calibrate the effects of the various policy options.  If we are looking to have an impact equivalent to at least a 25 basis point cut in the federal funds rate, which combination of staff suggestions meets this hurdle.  That way, the Committee could more clearly evaluate the options based on the impacts on the economy and the difficulties in unwinding the policy when that became appropriate.  This would allow a better assessment of the costs and benefits of further accommodation options.  I\u2019m increasingly worried that what we viewed as a tail occurrence is becoming the most likely outcome, and we have not yet fully prepared for the policy options should that result. If we were not at the zero bound, I have little doubt that we would today be considering at least a 25 basis point easing.  Most of the reaction functions discussed in the Tealbook B, imply that we should be easier than we were in June.  I am not certain that alternative A provides the best way to achieve further easing.  I fear that the change in language we have discussed does little to signal further easing.  It says that exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate are likely to be maintained at least through mid-2013, but this matches the path of the federal funds rate that the market already expects, as described on page 53 of Tealbook A.  A statement that matches current market expectations is not likely to have much of an effect on market rates. My own sequencing of accommodation would be as follows:  Step 1, I would announce a fixed ceiling on Treasury securities through 2012 and a fixed floor on the balance sheet through 2012, with an escape clause if the unemployment rate falls unexpectedly below 7\u00bd percent or the core inflation rate unexpectedly rises above 2\u00bd percent.  I would couple this with lowering the interest on reserves 25 basis points.  Foreign branches hold many of the reserves, and reserves pay 25 basis points while three-month Treasury bills have paid close to zero.  This amounts to a subsidy for foreign branches.  I see no reason to subsidize foreign branches with our interest on reserves, and coupled with the new language, I would expect this would amount to the equivalent of a 25 basis point easing.  Should further easing be necessary, I would extend the period of the ceiling on Treasury securities and the floor on our balance sheet with communication that the floor and ceiling would continue unless the unemployment or inflation triggers were reached.  We could continue to extend out the period of ceilings and floors until we had greater confidence of achieving desirable monetary policy goals.  If the floor and ceiling were extended to three years and more accommodation was still needed, I would begin by first extending the maturity of the SOMA holdings by exchanging short-term securities for long-term securities.  If that proved insufficient, I would then expand our balance sheet with purchases of longer-maturity securities. In an unconstrained world, I would take step 1 today.  Given the limited time to fully discuss alternative options, I would prefer to take all of the language in alternative A but exclude paragraph 4.  I would include Governor Yellen\u2019s language, and I would actually use core inflation of 2\u00bd percent as the second trigger.  I view Governor Yellen\u2019s proposal as changing something that is highly conditional to something that\u2019s unconditional unless the triggers are hit, and so I think it is a much stronger statement to use Governor Yellen\u2019s language.  Now, we\u2019ve somewhat boxed ourselves in by using inflation at the medium term because we\u2019re talking about a short period of time, and we\u2019re talking about inflation.  We\u2019re in effect trying to forecast oil prices.  So I would use core inflation at 2\u00bd percent to take care of President Evans\u2019s concern.  And I would use core inflation, but since I doubt I will get consensus on that, I would be comfortable with Governor Yellen\u2019s language.  Thank you", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B for today.  As I said earlier, our goal is to acknowledge the reality of slower-than-expected economic growth and the difficult situation in financial markets and to remain prepared for a policy move in the event that the expected rebound in the second half does not materialize.  More aggressive action than that today, in my view, could be counterproductive.  Number one, it will be viewed as trying to compensate for a failure of the Congress to effectively address medium- and longer-term fiscal uncertainties.  Number two, stronger action today will definitely emphasize the idea, already popular in financial markets, that there is a Greenspan\u2013Bernanke put on the equity markets.  Both of these will be damaging to our credibility, in my view, and credibility is our most valuable asset.  Markets are not expecting much action at this meeting.  So I think we\u2019ll be consistent with those market expectations if that\u2019s the way we play this.  This does not prohibit us from having meetings during the intermeeting period if we think that the situation is deteriorating further or that we\u2019re simply going to have to take action. Now, on the extended period through 2013, as I said earlier, I do not think we would be wise to tie policy action to the calendar.  We\u2019ve already been burned by this twice, and if we do it today, we\u2019ll be headed down for a third time.  The data have a way of contradicting what you expect.  If you track the macroeconomy for a long time, you know that there are wide bands of uncertainty, and the economy could be in a completely different place from what you expect two years out.  The 90 percent confidence intervals are so wide as to be laughable.  So I do not think you should tie it to a calendar date.  It will look very political to delay any rate hikes until after the election.  I think that will also damage our credibility.  I also doubt that we can credibly promise what this Committee may or may not do two years from now.  So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all that meaningful.  I think that going with the 2013 language will put us in a box that we may not want to be in going forward.  Further, as I emphasized earlier, this move could backfire badly.  This would keep policy rates at zero for at least four and a half years, unless we decide to renege, which will cost us some credibility chips if we want to do that.  Japan has been at zero for a decade and a half, and that policy has definitely not produced price stability.  Instead, they got mild deflation.  There are good theoretical reasons for why they would get that and why that has occurred.  I think we have to be more cognizant of this than we are around this table.  Worse, if we do get on that kind of a track and inflation expectations start to drift down because of this policy, monetary policy will actually be getting tighter, not easier, exactly at the point where we\u2019re trying to provide stimulus.  I also agree with President Rosengren that to be effective, a move of this type has to go beyond what markets already expect, and I think that we\u2019ve established at this meeting that the markets are expecting the policy rate, given the recent data, to be at zero through 2013.  So this would only ratify market expectations.  It wouldn\u2019t have any stimulative impact of the types emphasized by authors like Gauti Eggertsson and Mike Woodford. I also disagree with the Chairman on the QE3.  I do not think we will be able to avoid a discussion of QE3 going forward, as much as many of us may like to.  This is our most potent weapon, and it\u2019s more promising as having effects on the economy\u2014and we can debate what those effects are\u2014than any of the other tools in our toolbox.  This is because the QE program influences inflation expectations and therefore has potential to drive real interest rates lower if that is what the Committee desires.  The most important aspect of a further QE program would be to purchase or sell securities in response to economic conditions instead of according to calendar dates.  If we had this program in place as of today, we could simply announce a certain amount of purchases today, and that would be a much simpler way to react to events than what we\u2019re forced to contemplate, which are alternative policy actions.  We could behave much more as we would in an interest rate environment where we would lower the policy rate in reaction to worse-than-expected economic data. The new language suggested by Governor Yellen to tie the fed funds rate move to a 7.5 percent unemployment rate sounds super risky to me.  I might remind the Committee that Europe has not seen 7\u00bd percent unemployment, except on rare occasions, over the past two decades.  We really have no idea where the unemployment rate may or may not be going as we go forward in time because we have that little of an understanding of what causes and perpetuates high unemployment.  The European example is one that should give us pause about tying anything to a specific number.  To me, that would be a very large move with very little thought behind it at this juncture.  I would certainly like to see a lot more study on that before we would tie it to a specific number.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  On your point about communications, I do face a speech in a few weeks.  And I\u2019d be more than interested, either now or in some other context, in taking instruction from this Committee about how you want me to phrase it.  And in particular, one thing I could do\u2014I know there\u2019s not unanimous agreement on this\u2014is downplay that particular option in favor of continuing to look at options, et cetera.  But that\u2019s something we could discuss", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans", " MR. EVANS.  If I could just ask a question, because I know that President Bullard mentioned that an unemployment trigger of 7\u00bd percent could be super risky, and I thought you mentioned it this way earlier, President Plosser.  Governor Yellen\u2019s proposal has jointly with the unemployment rate trigger the admonition that inflationary pressures ought to be\u2014and we can disagree over what it is\u2014subdued or some number.  In pointing to unemployment, do you have in mind some risk beyond the inflationary risk", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m sympathetic to your concern.  We\u2019re expressing, as you said, a general darkening of mood and expectations.  The issue is, what action do we take.  And there is a proposal on the table by Governor Yellen, which I\u2019m not willing to support.  I\u2019m not willing to support it because it\u2019s asymmetric\u2014that is, it talks about maintaining rates low as long as unemployment exceeds 7\u00bd percent and a medium-term outlook for inflation remains subdued, undefined.  We have a lot of work to do to define our comfort level here.  I\u2019m sympathetic to President Evans, but I think the asymmetry of it will create problems further down the path. I worry about paragraph 1 because there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s unspoken in here.  I would like to actually add a sentence\u2014which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get, but I\u2019m going to state it anyway.  That is, after we talk about how housing has flattened out, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed, which is true, I would like to add the following language:  \u201cUncertainty regarding non-monetary-policy initiatives appears to have added to the hesitancy of businesses\u2019 willingness to expand payrolls, utilize existing capital, and add physical capacity, although business investment in productivity-enhancing equipment and software continues to expand.\u201d  I would further insert that \u201cuncertainty has been compounded by financial developments in Europe.\u201d  For some reason, we\u2019re not mentioning this.  I think these are significant factors. I think there are risks to us going further than we\u2019ve already gone.  I understand the desire to act, but I think we have to think through those actions, and presently I don\u2019t think we have a consensus at the table that we should do more.  I am not willing to vote in favor of doing more.  I think the proposal that Governor Yellen has put forward, which I\u2019m somewhat sympathetic to, is too asymmetric.  I take President Bullard\u2019s point seriously\u2014that is, that pushing things out to 2013 looks too politically convenient\u2014and I just think we don\u2019t have enough information at this juncture.  I would endorse alternative B with the enhancement or complication that I\u2019ve added, and I\u2019m not willing to support much more than that.  I think we have to be extremely careful here.  We need to conduct monetary policy in the most deliberate way, not a reactionary way.  We have had a significant market selloff, which we talked about earlier with Brian.  In terms of valuation levels, we could have a great deal further to go.  I think the tool kit that we have in place has limited potential because we\u2019ve exhausted much of what we have still in our pocket.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I\u2019m going to stick with what I have.  Let me just make a comment, and I understand your concerns, but I just need to say a couple of things.  Number one, I\u2019m perfectly willing to accept the argument that monetary policy is not the main tool, that this is not the main thing wrong with the economy, but it\u2019s our duty to do what we can, to be palliative, to help where we can, even if we can\u2019t solve fiscal, structural, and other problems.  Number two, we have a mandate that says we should look at employment and inflation.  We\u2019ve had a very marked reduction in the outlook since the last meeting.  Not responding in any way not only raises a question of whether we\u2019re following our mandate, but it also makes the markets uncertain because they don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing.  They can\u2019t follow our logic.  Again, to put out a much darker statement and not to do anything strike me as being inconsistent.  I believe this step is the most modest possible step we could take.  It\u2019s completely conditional; it could be offset by any change in conditions.  It could be offset by asset sales, if necessary.  We will elaborate going forward exactly what the conditionality is, and I will look forward to our discussions around the table.  We will have a two-day meeting.  I think I can accede to that point, at least, for September.  [Laughter]  And we will discuss all of this, and we\u2019ll continue with the subcommittee\u2019s discussions about the appropriate use of an inflation objective, which I do not believe is in any way inconsistent with this perspective, because what we\u2019re saying is, we believe that conditions will warrant, and \u201cconditions warranting\u201d means that we meet our objectives.  I don\u2019t see any inconsistency of this with the inflation objective or that framework.  Again, I feel that not signaling to the market and to the public that we are at least engaged in understanding that there is an issue here and that we\u2019re trying, at least in a palliative way, to respond to it, risks a real disconnect in terms of our communication, which I\u2019m unfortunately not willing to accept.  It would be very unpleasant to have three dissents, but I guess if that\u2019s where we end up, that\u2019s where we end up", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Our position is incredibly uncomfortable.  Many around the table have pointed out that the factors contributing to the disappointing results are not monetary in nature, and that it\u2019s not clear that monetary policy can cure the ills.  Well, it might not be our fault, and it might not be our job, and we might not be in the best position to act, but I still see our responsibility as taking whatever action we can that we believe will result in the best outcome, regardless of how it fits with our own preferences or comfort level.  But we have to weigh carefully the costs and benefits of our options.  I don\u2019t see the change in our guidance as high risk.  It communicates our best estimate of the future outcomes.  And even though the statement might not be different from market expectations today, it could keep markets from prematurely anticipating our exit if this uneven recovery results in a spurt of good data as a result of those same temporary factors.  And I do see the rewards of this action as not raising expectations for QE3.  As to the clarification proposed by Governor Yellen, I could support it but would prefer to take more time to think about it.  I do support a two-day meeting and perhaps an intermeeting conference to give us time to assess the relative costs and benefits of all of our options.  As I said in the economic go-round, I believe our remaining ammunition is limited and therefore must be carefully aimed.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  I\u2019m sorry, because we do have two more to go, and then we should probably have a discussion, but I\u2019d be extremely cautious on \u201c2013,\u201d Mr. Chairman.  It just looks so politically convenient.  I really think that through your good efforts of communication, through the actions taken by this Committee, we\u2019ve in essence, removed ourselves from the heat of the political debate.  I think we\u2019re less suspect in the eyes of our critics than we have been.  And I think the attention is rightly focused on getting this fiscal situation under control.  I might have different prescriptions than what has been suggested, but the focus is back on the Congress, with the assistance of the executive.  The \u201c2013\u201d just looks too politically convenient, and I don\u2019t want to fall back into people being suspicious about the way we conduct our business.  So I just want to plead on that front.  I think it\u2019s a mistake.  I think it would then allow those who are trying to squirm out of their duties of actually getting their act together on fiscal policy\u2014whatever that act is\u2014to put the finger back on us.  And it\u2019s unfortunately after an election, and it\u2019s a declaration before we know what the outcome is of what\u2019s likely to happen on the fiscal side, which is critical here.  So I wanted to plead that we do not adopt that specific date, given that it is ultra-inconvenient and given that we have worked very hard\u2014and you have taken special personal risk in terms of your communications\u2014to lower the temper and suspicion about monetary policy.  I think this would raise the suspicion and make us look like we\u2019re way too politically acquiescent, whatever our personal politics may be", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I would not be able to support the alternative, even as rewritten with Governor Duke\u2019s proposed change of language", " MR. PLOSSER.  That\u2019s what I\u2019m struggling with.  I\u2019m not sure it would be, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It would be, \u201cBased on its current projections, the Committee anticipates that economic conditions\u2014including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run\u2014are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.\u201d  \u201cAt least two years.\u201d  How about \u201cfor at least two years\u201d", " MR. ROSENGREN.  If you\u2019re going to take three dissents, then I think we should go to the language of alternative A and take out paragraph 4, because I think there was enough support for that.  So if they\u2019re going to dissent anyway, I think we should have much stronger language, because I think that was the consensus of everybody else other than the people who are dissenting.  If they really feel so strongly about that, I think we should go to alternative A, take out paragraph 4, and that would characterize how everybody else is viewing the economy", "\u201d  [Simultaneous speakers] VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I\u2019m a little concerned about whether the market will jump to the view that we\u2019re going to do QE3 because you have this language:  \u201cThe Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings.\u201d  I just think you might want to be aware of that potential", " MR. TARULLO.  This is Bill\u2019s concern again"], "2011FOMC20110921meeting.txt": [" MS. REMACHE.2  I am.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In a memo provided to the Committee ahead of this meeting, the staff presented three options for managing the SOMA portfolio in order to provide additional monetary policy accommodation:  a reinvestment maturity extension program, a SOMA portfolio maturity extension program included in alternative B in Book B of the Tealbook, and a long-maturity large-scale asset purchase program included in alternative A. The intention of each of these options is to remove duration risk from the holdings of private investors, thereby putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and making broader financial conditions more supportive of economic growth.  However, the amount of duration risk removed and the manner through which that occurs differ across the three options.  The two maturity extension options maintain the current size of the portfolio while shifting its composition toward longer-term Treasury holdings, while the long-maturity LSAP option expands the size of the portfolio while shifting its composition.  2 The materials used by Ms. Remache, Mr. Carpenter, and Mr. Reifschneider are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). Under the reinvestment maturity extension program, the reinvestment of principal payments from agency securities is shifted into Treasury securities with greater than six years to maturity.  This policy is assumed to remain in effect until redemptions begin.  As can be seen in your first exhibit, in the top-left chart by the dark blue line, this policy maintains the portfolio at its current level and leads to only a modest shift in the path of the SOMA once exit commences.  The average duration of the portfolio, shown by the dark blue line in the chart to the right, moves up to five years by late 2012, about a half-year longer than in the baseline scenario. The maturity extension program (MEP) of alternative B would involve $400 billion of long-term Treasury security purchases and a similar amount of short-term Treasury security sales, in addition to lengthening the maturity of reinvestments of agency securities.  Under this alternative, the size of the SOMA would again stay steady.  However, as can be seen in the top-left chart by the light blue line, it implies a more distinct departure from the baseline over time.  The average duration of the portfolio would increase markedly, reaching nearly 6\u00bd years, as shown in the top-right panel.  Because of the longer average maturity, the portfolio would not run off as quickly during the exit period.  Indeed, it would be as much as $450 billion higher than in the baseline and would take 15 months longer to return to steady state. The long-maturity LSAP of alternative A would add $1 trillion in Treasury securities to the balance sheet, in addition to lengthening the maturity of reinvestments of agency securities.  The red line in the top-left chart shows the increase in the SOMA.  The average duration of the portfolio moves up, but by much less than under the MEP.  Once exit commences, the SOMA runs off more quickly; however, given the higher starting level of the portfolio, it reaches its steady-state size at about the same time. The middle-left chart shows the path of the SOMA in 10-year equivalents\u2014a measure of the dollar value of duration risk.  The chart shows that both the MEP and the LSAP add a considerable amount of additional duration risk to the SOMA portfolio, with the MEP operating more by shifting the average duration of the SOMA and the LSAP operating more by increasing the size of the SOMA.  By contrast, the reinvestment option by itself adds only modestly to SOMA duration risk. As shown to the right, the MEP and LSAP have similar effects, reducing the 10-year term premium by roughly 20 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively.  These figures are somewhat larger than the estimated 15 basis point effect of the LSAP that ended in June.  FRB/US simulations suggest that either of these programs would lower the unemployment rate about \u00bc to \u00bd percentage point and boost core PCE inflation about \u00bc percentage point.  Of course, as Brian noted, market participants place relatively high odds on a maturity extension program, and hence a sizable portion of the interest rate effect may already have been realized.  The reinvestment option has considerably more modest effects on rates and therefore on the economy. The broad contour of Federal Reserve income over the projection period is similar under the MEP and LSAP alternatives, although there are some important differences in its trajectory and sensitivity to interest rate movements.  The bottom-left panel shows our projections for remittances to the Treasury under each scenario.  Relative to the baseline, both the MEP and LSAP would result in an increase in remittances to the Treasury through 2014, driven by higher interest income on Treasury holdings.  Thereafter, income would be lower as a result of higher interest expense.  In the longer run, income under these alternatives remains depressed because of the higher proportion of securities acquired during the current low yield environment.  Under all scenarios, remittances remain positive and trough at levels close to those prevailing before the crisis. The bottom-right panel examines the results under an adverse rate scenario in which the FOMC tightens earlier and long-term interest rates run as much as 175 basis points higher than the baseline.  In the LSAP scenario, which is the most adverse, remittances to the Treasury would cease for a period of four years, resulting in a deferred credit asset on the balance sheet peaking at about $50 billion in 2016. Before closing, I should highlight two additional points about the balance sheet options presented.  First, under the MEP or LSAP, the SOMA would own approximately 40 percent of all Treasury securities with greater than six years to maturity, with many securities at our 70 percent limit.  The Federal Reserve has never held such a high proportion of long-term securities, and we think that holdings of this proportion have some risk to cause a deterioration in market functioning. Finally, it is worth repeating that all of the estimates presented here are subject to a high degree of uncertainty, particularly those around the market and economic effects.  In particular, we presented results based on a portfolio balance model, which implies that it is only the overall quantity of interest rate risk that matters in determining the market effect.  If instead there is more market segmentation across maturity points, then there would be more difference between the LSAP and MEP programs, as we also purchase short-term securities in the LSAP program.  I\u2019ll now turn it over to Seth to discuss IOER", "  Half of the excess reserves of the foreign branches\u2014 MR. CARPENTER.  Most of the roughly $600 billion increase from the second LSAPs, in dollar terms, went to the foreign branches and agencies, in an adding-up sense.  So it\u2019s a good portion of it", " MR. FISHER.  Eric\u2019s point is very good, and I think the point about domestic banks is very good.  But I thought that under Regulation D, we couldn\u2019t pay interest rates on bank balances that exceeded market rates.  Is that true or false.  What is the law, and what do the regulations require", " MR. CARPENTER.  Not defined", " MR. CARPENTER.  The statutory requirement is pretty vague.  In terms of putting things into practice, it ends up being a little bit more judgment.  You could look at several other market rates, and so you\u2019d have to define the universe of short-term interest rates.  You\u2019d have to define what \u201cgeneral level\u201d means.  So if you were to look at just federal funds, the effective federal funds rate is 6, 7 basis points, but every day there\u2019s a distribution of trades, and some of those trades are outside of the 0 to 25 basis points target range.  As a result, there are, every day, trades in short-term money markets that are above 25 basis points.  In that sense, it\u2019s not obvious, at least to me, that paying 25 basis points is at odds with the vague definition of the law", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I had a question and a comment.  The question was about the observation that if we executed either the MEP or the LSAP, we\u2019d be holding 40 percent of the Treasuries with maturity over six years.  To me, that suggests that these operations might not be all that scalable.  So in the sense that if we faced further deterioration in the economy and we wanted to provide more accommodation at that stage, it would be difficult for us to think about working through augmenting these programs.  Is that a fair conclusion", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have two comments on exhibit 3, \u201cForward Guidance.\u201d  I think one aspect of these simulations is that the announcement inside the model to keep rates low for longer is assumed to be a credible announcement, as you note here, and I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s really the right way to think about this.  You\u2019re talking about a central bank that has never done this in the past and an unprecedented situation.  You make an announcement far out into the future\u2014say, for 2015\u2014and my baseline would be that the market\u2019s not initially going to believe that you\u2019re going to be able to carry through on that commitment far out into the future.  That is, when you actually get to 2015, you\u2019ll be tempted to revert to normal Committee behavior as it has evolved over many years.  And so my sense is that because of this assumption, these effects are probably overstated in the simulations, and that you should allow the guys in the model to gradually learn that the Committee is actually going to come around and actually carry through on this, even if the data may come in somewhat differently than anticipated at the time of the announcement. The other area\u2014obviously I\u2019ve been an advocate of this\u2014was that I was disappointed to see that simulations like this don\u2019t take into account the possibility that you would just get stuck at a zero nominal interest rate equilibrium and you\u2019d end up at zero nominal interest rates for a very long period of time.  Japan has been at zero for about 15 years.  I think you have to have that also in the simulation so that you can say with some confidence, \u201cYou take on this action, and you\u2019ll be able to move off zero at some point in the future,\u201d instead of eliciting expectations that are going to actually keep you at zero for a very long period of time.  Those are two aspects of the simulations I was disappointed with", " MR. SACK.  We did not do an extensive reach-out recently on this issue, but we always have conversations with money funds.  This has been in play for some time.  I\u2019d just say that you do hear some anecdotes on the other side as well:  They\u2019ve been subsidizing; if we take another 5 or 10 basis points out of returns, there\u2019s a limit to their ability to subsidize; and at least one or two have suggested that they would close funds.  Now, it\u2019s hard to know whether that\u2019s a forecast or a way of trying to lean against this possibility.  I think some anecdotes say it would not be disruptive or important, but they don\u2019t all go in that direction", " MR. PLOSSER.  I would suggest\u2014and I have suggested this before\u2014that I think this is about communications as much as anything else.  And I don\u2019t think the statement is the place to do that.  You\u2019ve given several speeches about why the unemployment SEP number is different.  I think that concept needs to be socialized more widely.  I think you and the Vice Chair and others need to talk about it in speeches, help explain it to the public, so they understand this means something different before we try to get our policy statement, in which we are confined to very few words, to convey that notion.  I think that over a period of time, I would certainly become more comfortable that we could do this and not have it be misinterpreted.  In the context of a policy statement, I think it\u2019s very difficult to do", " MR. EVANS.  Well, I remember hearing John Taylor, or maybe he wrote it down in his blog somewhere, say that he disagrees with that characterization.  Now, I don\u2019t agree with how he described it, but at some point he said that output is only in there to capture inflationary pressures and things like that.  So there is tremendous disagreement", " MR. BULLARD.  Right.  I\u2019m recalling long papers by Lars Svensson that are defining all these things, and I don\u2019t think it was very clear", " WILLIAMS.  If there is a silver lining to our current predicament, it\u2019s been that these events provide a laboratory for research that has increased our understanding of the effectiveness of monetary policy at the zero bound.  Based on this research\u2014and we\u2019ve actually reviewed probably about a dozen papers\u2014I think it\u2019s pretty clear that these types of programs, both LSAPs and maturity extension, are effective policy tools that could help lower longer-term interest rates at the margin.  And I\u2019ll just comment that the staff memo that we saw today shows that either of these policy options would lower 10-year Treasuries between 10 and 25 basis points initially, and that\u2019s roughly equivalent to a 75 to 100 basis point cut in the fed funds rate.  I actually view that as a very sizable policy action to the extent that these are equivalent, and I\u2019m going to come back to that in a second.  I\u2019d also just say that obviously these policies aren\u2019t cure-alls, but I still think we should use them as appropriate given the constraints we face at the short end of the yield curve.  I\u2019d add that in the future, we\u2019ll likely need to broaden the set of securities that we purchase for the very reasons that President Kocherlakota and President Fisher mentioned.  I think we\u2019ll need to consider going back to mortgage-backed securities\u2014I know that\u2019s not a popular idea\u2014so that we can make larger ongoing purchases without cornering the market for longer-term Treasuries.  Moreover, research has shown that our past MBS purchases have had broad effects on private borrowing rates, making MBS purchases a potentially more potent tool than Treasury purchases.  And, as Brian mentioned earlier today, the MBS\u2013OAS spread relative to Treasuries has spiked upward again.  That\u2019s, again, I think, an argument for at least contemplating broadening to that class of securities. In terms of reducing the interest rate paid on excess reserves, I think that would be another way for us to provide a bit more monetary policy accommodation.  It would also lessen somewhat\u2014I\u2019m just repeating the comments that I think have already been made\u2014the confusing appearance that we are paying banks not to lend money while we\u2019re trying to ease policy in every other possible way.  Cutting the excess reserves rate would push down short-term rates a bit.  I realize that\u2019s a small change.  I do think it would send markets a signal to lower their expected path of policy going forward, which would help reduce interest rates all along the yield curve\u2014again, though, only modestly.  And regarding President Rosengren\u2019s comment about how markets would respond or how much disruption you\u2019d get, I also heard the same kind of thing\u2014that money funds are really a part of a suite of services that are provided.  So I would be surprised if lowering the interest on reserves to 10 basis points would cause a highly disruptive reduction in the money fund market. Turning to monetary policy communication, I think that more transparency is desirable.  Paragraph 2 of alternative A is a noble effort to communicate our long-run policy goals succinctly, and it\u2019s one that I support.  I\u2019m also sympathetic to the goal of providing conditional forward guidance, as in paragraph 4.  I think this is very difficult to do, though, based on the wide variety of views in this room.  And my main concern is that this approach will prove to be very challenging in terms of reaching consensus on these thresholds.  It\u2019s very difficult to satisfactorily distill our policy strategy down to just two numbers, especially during a time of extraordinary volatility and uncertainty.  Moreover, this approach focuses exclusively on the date of liftoff from low rates and provides no further information on the intended slope of rate increases after liftoff, which is equally or even more important for thinking about longer-term borrowing costs.  I do want to add that I think it\u2019s essential that, if paragraph 2 makes reference to an inflation rate of 2\u00bd, there is a reference, such as in paragraph 2, to our longer-run goal of 2 percent.  I think having just the 2\u00bd percent number obviously would be potentially confusing. So I am sympathetic to this approach.  It\u2019s very difficult to do in practice.  Luckily, I think there is a better way forward.  I\u2019m now not going to be the first person to mention this, but I will tilt at this windmill myself.  I think that it would be a better approach if we were to include our individual projections about the appropriate path of monetary policy in the SEP.  Like Governor Tarullo, I see many advantages to this approach, but unlike Governor Tarullo, I will strongly advocate for it.  Releasing our funds rate projections would accomplish everything that paragraph 4 in alternative A tries to do and, I think, much more.  So let me emphasize a few advantages of this policy.  First and foremost, releasing our funds rate projections in the SEP would clearly communicate to the public the most likely point at which we see the policy rate lifting off from the zero bound.  That could be mid-2013 or later or earlier, as the evolving data warrant.  Second, the range of our funds rate forecast would appropriately convey the disagreement and uncertainty we face about the exact liftoff point.  Third, as our output, unemployment, and inflation forecasts evolve, so too would our forecast for monetary policy.  This would give the public a genuine picture of the state-contingent nature of policy without any of the oversimplifications inherent in the simple thresholds of paragraph 4.  Fourth, the steepness of our funds rate path after liftoff would provide very useful information to the markets that is not currently conveyed by paragraph 2 or 4, and again, as emphasized in the memo, the pace of tightening after liftoff can be just as important for influencing longer-term interest rates as the timing.  Fifth and perhaps most important\u2014and I really think this is the most important idea\u2014is that having funds rate projections in the SEP, or at least having them internally, would help our policy discussions at this table.  It would give us a better understanding of the range of views on the Committee and could help us better frame the debate about policy and the outlook.  It might even help us find greater points of agreement regarding the future course of policy.  To summarize, I support the use of forward guidance in principle, but I think we can do much better by publicly releasing our policy projections in the SEP or at least having them internally as part of our discussion.  This would importantly communicate the most likely path of policy and the uncertainty and state contingency of that path, and again, it would shape the public\u2019s expectations about policy after the liftoff point, which could be just as important.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  Mr. Chairman", " MR. TARULLO.  That\u2019s true, Jeff, and I understand what you\u2019re saying, but you made a point in part based on how the world would receive a statement endorsed by all or most members of the Committee that associated a number with unemployment.  I would say you can make the converse argument.  If the Committee were to come out now with an inflation target that made no reference to unemployment, that would be construed in a very meaningful fashion as well; personally, I think it would be construed as the embodiment of what some people in the world advocate anyway, which is an inflation-only mandate.  So you\u2019re quite right to say the first statement is going to attract an enormous amount of attention, but it goes both ways.  Omitting unemployment will have just as powerful a message as including something on unemployment", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Give us some sense of what further progress you think can be made. We had the deepest and most interesting discussion on the communications issues.  Clearly, there\u2019s a lot of interest around the table in increasing our transparency, establishing more information about our objectives, and giving more information about our reaction function.  And in particular, we have the problem, or opportunity if you wish, to clarify the guidance that we gave at the last meeting.  I think this is something that should remain very firmly on the table in the sense of something we should continue to work at closely.  A lot of people suggested making more use of the SEP, the Summary of Economic Projections, and that\u2019s something we should certainly talk about.  For example, the view was expressed that the subtle distinctions between an inflation target and the long-run unemployment rate could not be adequately expressed in a statement and needed other kinds of communication like the SEP, press conferences, speeches, et cetera.  And I think that\u2019s worth discussing.  The possibility was also raised of asking additional questions or getting forecasts of interest rates in the SEP.  I do note that\u2014and I think this was raised by at least a couple of people\u2014the SEP is, in the end, the aggregation of our 17 or 19 opinions.  It doesn\u2019t have the imprimatur of a Committee decision, and that\u2019s a bit of a problem that we\u2019ll have to take into account.  But in terms of providing information to the public, I think it is a useful direction. Governor Tarullo noted that our discussions today didn\u2019t really address the worst-case contingencies, which a number of people have brought up.  And I would say that\u2019s by design because today we were talking about tools in the context of flexible inflation targeting.  I think that in a flexible inflation-targeting framework, we would try to respond to prices primarily through lender-of-last-resort activities and liquidity provision.  In terms of monetary policy stimulation, there may ultimately be some limits to how much stimulus we can provide if we\u2019re going to maintain inflation at the mandate-consistent level.  So that\u2019s an issue to be talked about further.  In those \u201cbreak glass\u201d situations, I think we would want to at least discuss seriously some of the alternative frameworks that have been discussed and proposed.  Again, as I mentioned, we\u2019ll put that on the table for discussion at the next meeting.  We certainly will talk about the kinds of situations in which we might want to take more dramatic action. Thank you for this very useful conversation.  Coffee is ready.  Why don\u2019t we take 20 minutes for coffee, and we\u2019ll come back for the economic go-round", " MR. KAMIN.  Well, we have certainly spent a lot of time thinking about that issue, particularly for China and Brazil, which are larger trading partners with us and figure more prominently in my thinking, though we do follow Turkey as well. In China, for some time, there have been a number of property-market-related risks, both in terms of prices having risen very high and in terms of there being very substantial lending, which puts at risk not only some borrowers, but also lenders.  In particular, a lot of state and local governments in China have been using off-balance sheet vehicles to try to channel funds to developers and others.  It\u2019s sometimes like a substitute for fiscal policy for them.  So that represents a concern.  However, it is true that over the past half-year or so, property prices in China, based on our perhaps imperfect measurements, seem to have tailed off a bit and maybe even declined.  And of course, the Chinese government and the PBOC are taking a lot of steps to try to rein in the lending.  It\u2019s certainly something that\u2019s very much on our radar screens, and we\u2019re very aware it.  But we don\u2019t see the overheating problem getting worse, at least as far as the property market in China is concerned. We\u2019ve also been following Brazil carefully for very much the same reason.  There have been very many anecdotal reports of a bubbling property market in the country.  Unfortunately, we don\u2019t have as good data on housing prices there, but there\u2019s no reason to disbelieve the anecdotes.  And part of the problem is that Brazil ramped up credit growth a great deal during the financial crisis and hasn\u2019t really reversed that now.  So we\u2019re watching that carefully.  Thus far, we haven\u2019t seen evidence of a bust of that sort, and we have seen the GDP growth and the economy slowing.  We\u2019re looking forward to that tailing off again without a meltdown.  But it\u2019s something we\u2019re following", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  Just to follow up on this, I think the situation in Europe is quite concerning, given the pace at which they seem to be resolving their problems.  And we can talk about a meltdown or implosion of Europe, but it seems to me that one of the things that might happen is an acceleration in the massive flight to quality that we have been seeing, with the consequences being, rather than a flight out of quality of the U.S. banks, a huge inflow of cash.  How would we react to that, or what would the consequences of that be, short of rapid depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar and a huge inflow of cash from European institutions into the United States.  How would that play out, and what would the consequences be for us, if any", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  After reviewing the messages from my directors and business contacts, I think the best way to characterize their commentary is that the U.S. economy is treading water at the moment.  No one I speak with disagrees with the view that the economy is largely moving sideways relative to trend growth.  As of now, none see their own businesses dropping off as if the economy were in recession.  Manpower Employment Services noted that its July and August business was volatile\u2014down and then up a bit.  Most of Manpower\u2019s clients are experiencing flat or, at most, small increases in revenue, and some are making contingency plans to cut back on their workforces in case the economy deteriorates.  Other contacts noted similar contingency planning.  One of my region\u2019s best-performing large manufacturers with a globally diversified business line described the current situation by saying, \u201cThe ice keeps getting thinner.  We expect things will be fine unless the ice breaks.\u201d  It sounds like nice theater, but here\u2019s the scary part:  The company has instructed all of its units to mock up plans for a 30 percent reduction in capital expenditure spending if it finds it needs to pull the trigger.  To recount the recent fundamentals succinctly, developments in Europe and Washington, weak U.S. economic data, and the associated volatility and net declines in U.S. equity markets all have had negative effects on household and business confidence.  Cyclically sensitive industries, like autos, are expressing substantial concern over the drop in consumer sentiment and the potential for a falloff in demand in the fourth quarter. In financial markets, several contacts noted how things today feel eerily as they did in 2008 before Lehman went down, and one can hardly blame them, considering the risk to financial institutions in Europe, highlighted most recently by the funding stresses faced by the French banks over the past couple of weeks.  One contact noted the widely held expectation that the U.S. economy is in for a long slog but no double dip.  However, they are concerned that this forecast couldn\u2019t hold up to the financial contagion that would result from further significant stresses on some big European banks.  Of course, substantial progress has been made.  Since 2009, U.S. banks are better capitalized and have greater liquidity cushions, and the risks from excessive leverage have fallen in some sectors.  For example, our financial contacts tell us that hedge funds have been reducing leverage for some time.  Consequently, the recent equity market declines did not experience any amplification effect from forced sales to meet their debt obligations.  Instead, recent equity sales likely reflected greater pessimism in general about the economic situation\u2014greater economic risk, for sure, but less leverage risk.  That\u2019s what our contacts suggest. Finally, a different parallel to 2008 is the concern over inflation pressures.  Like today\u2019s situation, back in 2008, there were substantial concerns over the risks of continued higher inflation.  Indeed, my directors and I, in August 2008, voted for an increase in the discount rate in order to reduce those inflationary pressures.  In my opinion, that turned out not to be the right move.  Inflation concerns evaporated quickly with the economic downturn and commensurate with the decline in actual inflation.  Today, with the currently weak business outlook, the pass-through of earlier high materials costs into prices is waning.  At this point, let me take the opportunity\u2014President Lacker made the comment about how output gaps and resource slack in our models depend importantly not just on how you would detrend these objects but also on a comparison with the efficient flex-price equilibrium.  No", " MR. LACKER.  Not \u201cjust", " MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The good news is that the economy has not fallen off a cliff despite the confidence shock that was precipitated by the debt ceiling impasse, the downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating, the worsening of the debt crisis in Europe, and financial market volatility that has occurred since the time of the August meeting.  We have staggered through August without a financial collapse.  That said, to me we look stuck.  The recent unemployment report shows an economy with little momentum.  Payrolls were flat in August, the workweek fell, and aggregate hours worked in the private sector have declined over the past few months. Businesses are likely holding back on hiring because they are unsure when their customers will fully return.  Meanwhile, consumers are still coping with the sharp loss of wage growth and wealth, driven now by a triple whammy:  low rates of disposable income growth, drops in home equity, and, now, hits in terms of volatility in the stock market.  Consumers are also coping with an uncertain future.  Indeed, discretionary consumer spending, a category that excludes housing, food, and health care and includes things like restaurant meals, entertainment, education, and most durable goods, is still down 1.2 percent more than three years after the business cycle peak.  Going back decades, such spending has never remained weak for that long.  Moreover, consumer spending is showing no signs of returning to the growth rates we saw during the recoveries of the 1980s and 1990s.  In this environment, it seems quite likely that both firms and households will be easily frightened by any new adverse economic news, be it gas prices that are remaining stubbornly high or unease about policymakers\u2019 abilities to reach consensus on important issues. At the same time, measures of inflation seem to me to indicate stability.  The 12-month change in core PCE prices is around 1\u00bd percent.  Moreover, longer-run inflation expectations from the Michigan survey continue to hover in the same range they\u2019ve occupied for some time, and inflation compensation from TIPS markets has fallen recently. It appears that the ongoing weakness in the labor market is keeping inflation in check, and that there\u2019s not much risk of an unhinging of inflationary expectations that would feed into a dangerous wage\u2013price spiral.  That said, there remains the worry that persistently high unemployment could push up the structural unemployment rate in the long run, leading to a situation where the labor market outcomes that are consistent with price stability are much less satisfactory.  At present, it\u2019s my view that we\u2019re probably a long way from that occurring.  To be sure, some estimates suggest an increase in the structural unemployment rate of up to 1 percentage point, and that has already happened.  But most estimates still put the structural level far below the actual level of unemployment.  However, if labor market conditions don\u2019t begin to improve sometime soon, structural unemployment could rise further.  In particular, the unusually high share of long-term unemployed\u2014with the share of those unemployed for 27 weeks and longer now at 43 percent, well above the 15 percent historical average\u2014raises concerns that workers will at some point begin to find it difficult to reenter employment as their skills decay. The possibility that the long-term unemployed will reduce our country\u2019s future growth potential is exacerbated the longer high long-term unemployment exists.  From this perspective, the long path to recovery is relevant.  In most recoveries, the ratio of residential investment to GDP jumps and provides a significant impetus to the recovery, but this has certainly not happened in this recovery, and I\u2019m hard-pressed to see how it will happen anytime soon.  As a result, I expect it will be quite some time before the unemployment rate comes down in any significant way.  Thank you", " MR. FISHER.  Yes", " MR. LACKER.  Right, exactly.  Same thing on the other side", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to make a comment about the use of the date as opposed to my suggestion yesterday of using an announcement of expected duration of our stay at the zero lower bound.  Right now, if the Committee were to stay with the mid-2013 date, in some sense the default is reducing accommodation from that, because you are moving closer to the time when that date is going to take place.  So the default stance is that you are reducing accommodation.  That is very different from when you choose to leave the fed funds rate the same.  In that case, you are not reducing accommodation, you are keeping accommodation the same.  If, instead, the Committee had said in August that they expected that conditions would warrant keeping the fed funds rate exceptionally low for two years, you could leave that statement in place, roll forward six weeks, and you would have the same level of accommodation in place. Now, I have talked offline to some of you about this, and I agree with the general sentiment that we don\u2019t want to be making too many changes at one time.  I\u2019ll take that as read.  But I do think that, going forward, we are going to spend a long time at the zero lower bound.  It is worthwhile to make this change\u2014away from a date to a duration\u2014to get away from the automatic tightening that is built into this", " MR. FISHER.  I would just be careful about that.  That\u2019s our expectation, but I don\u2019t think that statement is correct because it depends on what time interval you measure, 12 months, 6 months.  I would moderate it somehow were I to support alternative B", " MR. LACKER.  If we\u2019re able to reduce the MBS spread, there\u2019d be some other borrowers in the economy that would face higher cost than otherwise, right. Does the staff have a sense of the differential effect on spending.  Is lowering mortgage rates going to result in enough spending to counteract the reduced spending on the part of the people for whom borrowing costs are going to go up because of this", " MR. ENGLISH.  I agree there isn\u2019t dysfunction in the MBS market, but the MBS\u2013Treasury spread is pretty wide.  It\u2019s gone up about 50 basis points in recent months.  We think that\u2019s because with rates very low, the expected duration is probably longer than usual, so investors are a little chary of buying the MBS, and there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty about the duration.  That spread has widened out, and this would be a way of taking a step to try to unwind some of that widening", " MR. LACKER.  Bill, on the sources of uncertainty, do you think you know better than the market about those things", " MR. PLOSSER.  So it\u2019s likely that the players who are going to be able to take advantage of this maybe won\u2019t be the homeowners and the homebuyers.  It\u2019s going to be the traders who are going to be trying to arbitrage whatever they think we\u2019re going to do between Treasuries and MBS and other things, and whether or not that\u2019s going to have the effect that we want on the real economy is questionable", " MR. LACKER.  If you look at budget constraints and resource constraints, there\u2019s a certain amount of savings going on, and it\u2019s getting channeled to a certain amount of resources that are going to a certain amount of borrowers.  From that point of view, if we increase the resources going to some borrowers, it has got to come from somebody", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That\u2019s only with a total output being given.  This is the basic error of the crowding out arguments that you\u2019ve been hearing, which is that holding output constant, if you increase deficits, you\u2019re going to reduce investment.  That\u2019s not true if output is, in turn, endogenous and responds to fiscal conditions.  If output responds to monetary policy stimulus, that\u2019s going to affect income and saving. I feel like we pretty much covered the issue here.  [Laughter]  Any further questions.  [No response]  If not, why don\u2019t we just go now into the go-round.  And we\u2019ll start at the far west of the country with President Williams", " MR", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my comments, I will generally support alternative B and talk about alternative B.  Let me start with paragraph 1, the last sentence.  I, too, thought that the phrase, \u201cInflation has moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks,\u201d was a little bit strong.  I think it has been an improvement to eliminate the confusing references to underlying inflation, and I would take it that our basic measure of inflation, when we say \u201cinflation,\u201d is PCE inflation measured from a year ago.  I\u2019m looking at page 23 of the data sheets here, which has all our data on consumer prices.  This is what is presented to the Committee.  There are six charts here, with a lot of upward sloping charts in 2011, so I think it might be a little bit strong to say this.  I have a suggestion that I think more accurately will reflect your view, Mr. Chairman, which is that instead of using \u201cInflation has moderated since earlier in the year,\u201d we could say \u201cInflation is expected to moderate as prices of energy and some commodities have declined.\u201d The new first part of the very last sentence in paragraph 1 would be \u201cInflation is expected to moderate.\u201d  It would mean that, indeed, we think headline inflation is going to come down.  Yes, it is kind of high right now if you look at these charts, but we think it is going to come down.  That very much reflects the staff view and the view that you expressed earlier in your comments", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  My critique of that is, I think it is very important that the first paragraph be a statement of what we see, not a view about our forecast or our expectations.  It should be a description of our view of reality.  When you say \u201cis expected to,\u201d then you are getting into something more forward-looking, and I am not in favor of that", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  One suggestion I would have is that the Committee actually specify exactly what inflation rates they had in mind when they say that inflation rates are moderating.  I think it is certainly true of the three-month frequency.  Maybe it is also true of the six-month frequency.  If the Committee has a particular frequency in mind, then you can make reference to that", "  My head has stopped spinning right now, but\u2014 [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  It\u2019s on fire", "  [Laughter] MR. LACKER.  This takes us into the realm of fine-tuning sectoral spreads, and it begs questions.  What about small business lending.  What about municipals.  There are plenty of sectors where there is distress, urgency, and a need.  People are going to ask, \u201cWell, you\u2019re helping out the housing market, why aren\u2019t you helping out our sector.\u201d  That\u2019s the reason we have stayed away from this stuff until the crisis, and we should keep on that track by getting out of the business of subsidizing housing.  This perpetuates this really corrosive political economy in our country of tapping government resources to subsidize the housing market.  I should think we would be a little averse to that, given the damage that caused in the last crisis. About President Bullard\u2019s point on announcing $400 billion versus $45 billion, I think that is a cogent point.  I will make the observation here about quantitative easing.  We apparently are viewing, according to our Vice Chairman, quantitative easing as off the table because of the political backlash we got last year.  That\u2019s my sense", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is a privilege to follow my esteemed colleague from Richmond.  Here we provide the full range of options with just two commenters.  [Laughter] The economic outlook in the Tealbook clearly calls for action, and I would argue that the Tealbook outlook is on the optimistic side.  As I look at the pricing of Greek debt and credit default swaps, I wonder whether the baseline forecast should include a Greek default.  However, even with a more benign assessment of Europe, my forecast for both inflation and unemployment are consistent with significant action.  My preference for this meeting would be to do three things.  First, I would explicitly condition the forward guidance on economic outcomes, as President Evans has discussed recently, using language similar to what is in alternative A.  Second, I would reinvest principal payments of MBS back into MBS.  I strongly support that.  Third, I would do the Twist, but signal that should financial instability increase, or the economy deteriorate further, more-aggressive policy would be considered.  In particular, if conditions were to worsen, we should be considering targeting intermediate Treasury rates consistent with our conditional language and expanding our balance sheet.  While my preference is a combination of A and B, I can support alternative B with paragraph 3.  I do hope that the forward guidance based on the SEP is considered for our next meeting.  I actually agree with President Kocherlakota that it might be worthwhile considering whether using two years, rather than a calendar date, would be a more appropriate way of describing time. I normally don\u2019t comment on language, but this time I feel I should.  In paragraph 1, I think the criteria should be that it\u2019s factual and consistent.  If we use three-month inflation rates, we are, in effect, going to be describing commodity prices and oil prices.  That doesn\u2019t seem to be what we are trying to convey.  For retrospective, I actually agree with President Evans that we should be using core or underlying inflation, so we don\u2019t overweight temporary supply shocks.  Prospectively, we should be using total, because in the medium-term total and core are likely to be quite similar.  Going forward, we could come up with an agreement that if we are going to characterize it, then we characterize it consistently in that fashion.  In terms of paragraph 3 and 3\u2032, this is a one-time program, as we discussed yesterday.  Talking about it in total makes much more sense than talking about it parsed in nine ways.  In particular, when I look at the language at the bottom of paragraph 3, \u201cThe Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities transactions and the overall size of the maturity extension program,\u201d I would not use that language.  I would go back to the August language that says, \u201cThe Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.\u201d  I don\u2019t think that parsing an extension program into very small bits will be particularly effective.  That language implies that we might consider doing that, and I don\u2019t think we should.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I usually begin my policy round statement declaring support for one of the alternatives, and that is usually alternative B, which is appropriate for a member of the quiet middle.  Today, I am going to take a different approach.  Because I am a nonvoter at this meeting, I am going to give myself permission to put some arguments on the table for the sake of devil\u2019s advocacy.  As I stressed in the economy round, I would argue that the ambiguity of the moment should give pause, pointing to a preference for alternative C at this meeting.  One might prefer alternative C not out of strong conviction that no action is called for, but out of preference for not acting quite yet.  The case for holding off is included in the broader Tealbook case for alternative C, which Bill English just recited.  I would add to that case, as devil\u2019s advocate, that an approach that might have the most positive impact in jolting the economy out of its apparent torpor is a binary one.  By that I mean either do nothing or go all in, but avoid incremental half-measures. Let me present three reasons for holding our fire at this meeting.  First, the hard data and anecdotal reports suggest that the second half of the year will be better than the first half, even if not by a lot.  The staff Tealbook forecast assumes that an alternative B is required to generate this outcome.  I would argue that skepticism on this point is warranted.  Even conceding that the very modest rate effects assumed by the staff will be realized from an alternative B policy, marginally lower longer-term rates won\u2019t stimulate much additional borrowing and business activity producing job growth.  Lower longer-term rates might stimulate some refinance activity by homeowners and commercial real estate owners, but short of some top-down program of comprehensive mortgage refinancing, the effect is likely to be marginal on real-side activity.  Second, while acknowledging the sentiment that the Tealbook benchmark implies an uncomfortably slow decline of the unemployment rate, one could be just as uncomfortable with the persistent upward drift in core inflation measures.  As the Tealbook shows in charts labeled \u201cEvolution of the Staff Forecast\u201d on page 31, misses giving rise to upward revisions in unemployment forecasts have been matched by misses in upward revisions of core inflation forecasts.  A benchmark forecast that has a fairly large drop in inflation premised on an unemployment rate projected to remain high, in my opinion, should be questioned.  A third argument for holding fire is to let a little time pass to gain perspective on the circumstances the Committee is facing.  Per this argument, sentiment is being weighed down by an unfortunate confluence of bad or troubling news that arrived in a very short span of time.  By that I mean benchmark revisions, the debt ceiling spectacle, the S&P ratings downgrade, Europe, the jobs report, Hurricane Irene, and inflation numbers. I would argue that, considering both the data and the reports from contacts, the economy is not presently on a slippery slope to recession.  This view argues for giving ourselves a little more distance from the events of late July and early August before concluding that the economic landscape has changed so fundamentally that the economy cannot achieve escape velocity without further action on our part. Turning to the action side of what they called a binary approach, I would argue this:  If there is no progress toward firmer economic growth, and there is actual deterioration and/or it becomes clear that the European issues or the fiscal mess in this country are likely to suppress economic activity going forward, stronger action than alternative B is needed, conditioned, of course, on no deterioration of the inflation outlook.  It may be the case that a sequence of incremental policy steps ultimately accumulates to a big step.  But if a jolt to the patient is what is needed, one big step may be preferable.  So going all in\u2014the expression I used earlier\u2014could resemble President Bullard\u2019s proposal: an open-ended, quantitative easing commitment to be held in place until the Committee is satisfied that a sustainable recovery is firmly established or until we have to change course to meet our price stability mandate.  Again, I am presenting these arguments in a devil\u2019s advocate vein, not in outright opposition to alternative B. Switching to angel\u2019s advocacy, if that is a term, regarding alternative B, just a couple of comments.  First, I favor 3\u2032 as being somewhat more flexible.  Second, I am sympathetic to the mortgage-backed securities reinvestment proposal.  I think it might make a difference.  If I could wave a magic wand once to help demand, it would be to lower all mortgage payments in the country.  Third, in response to President Bullard\u2019s suggestion, I agree that there is something slightly wrong with the description of inflation in paragraph 1.  A simple fix would be to add the word \u201csomewhat,\u201d \u201cinflation has moderated somewhat,\u201d to try to capture a little bit of the ambiguity and slight disappointment we feel in the way inflation has evolved during the year.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman, I think that this underscores the challenges of communicating with the public on this point.  I think that the public perception of our framework is closer to the idea that we will not tolerate 2 percent.  It would be very helpful to clarify\u2014exactly as you have now with me\u2014what our inflation target means and what it does not mean.  In my view, the reactions to President Evans\u2019 recent remarks show that there is a sense in the general public and in the media that our medium-term targets really translate into something we have to meet on a year-by-year basis. Those of us that are involved in the idea of monitoring cost recovery for the product office might be familiar with this example:  In the product office, they are supposed to recover costs over a 10-year horizon.  The way we implement that is by watching them closely on an annual basis to make sure they are doing cost recovery.  With that, I think it will be very helpful\u2014certainly for my own thinking about policy\u2014for the general public to hear exactly this clear explanation you just gave to me about what the framework is.  Thank you", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B.  The economic outlook has deteriorated significantly since our August meeting and downside risks are looming ever larger.  I\u2019ve become increasingly concerned that the economy is near stall speed and could easily slip into recession.  As I explained in the economic go-round, I see the modal outlook as decidedly worse than a year ago when we decided to adopt QE2.  In particular, my outlook under current policy settings, like the Tealbook\u2019s, is for unemployment to stay horrifically high for years while inflation over the next two years declines below mandate-consistent levels.  I can\u2019t see how such a forecast can be consistent with optimal policy under an inflation-targeting strategy if we interpret that as a forward-looking approach in which we choose policy to minimize a loss function, including deviations of inflation from target and deviations of unemployment from its long-run equilibrium level.  In addition, we face downside risks that are exceptionally large at a time when policy is constrained by the zero bound.  Therefore, I strongly support taking actions at this meeting to foster a stronger recovery, assuming they pass a cost-benefit test. In my judgment, the maturity extension program, even though it is obviously not a panacea, is a cost-effective tool for providing some additional monetary accommodation.  I support Vice Chairman Dudley\u2019s suggestion that we roll over maturing MBS principal back into MBS rather than into Treasuries.  I agree with the arguments he and others made for this strategy.  Reducing the spread of MBS yields over Treasuries will have greater bang for the buck and would avoid a reduction in market liquidity that could result from our increasing dominance in the long end of the Treasury market. Regarding specific language, I would prefer the first variant of paragraph B(3) because conveying our intent to complete the full program seems likely to provide the greatest extent of stimulus and would be consistent with our communications about the previous round of longer-term Treasury purchases.  That said, I see good reasons for engaging in regular reviews of this program over coming months.  In particular, if the strains in European financial markets intensify much further, it\u2019s quite plausible and perhaps likely that safe-haven flows would flatten the Treasury yield curve to the point where there might be little or no benefits to proceeding with our maturity transformation program.  In light of such considerations, I\u2019d be willing to support the second variant of paragraph B(3) if that language seems preferable to other members.  Finally, I strongly support the bracketed language in paragraph B to underscore that the Committee is prepared to employ additional policy tools as appropriate.  Indeed, as I noted yesterday, I believe that communications may be the most powerful tool that\u2019s still in our toolbox.  I continue to see advantages to the approach in alternative A, but this is something we need to give further consideration to in the context of the larger discussion of our monetary policy framework in November.  I also strongly agree that we need to consider out-of-the-box or blue-sky approaches should things deteriorate further, and that it\u2019s important to develop those tools now", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, a couple of observations on the Taylor rule.  I\u2019ve never liked it, and I particularly don\u2019t like it in the current set of circumstances.  The reason I don\u2019t like it in the current set of circumstances is that I think that it doesn\u2019t really work well because we know that the equilibrium real rate of interest is not anything close to 2 percent, which is assumed in the rule.  We could actually solve backwards.  We\u2019ve seen the economy perform very, very poorly despite what\u2019s supposedly a very stimulative monetary policy.  Well, why is that.  Because the monetary policy hasn\u2019t been as stimulative as we thought, and that underscores one fundamental flaw of relying on the Taylor rule as your guide to policy. A second problem with the Taylor rule is that we have an economic situation where the losses are very asymmetric.  If we turn out weaker than we want or expect, there\u2019s a really good chance we\u2019re going to end up in a debt deflation, Japanese-style trap and we\u2019re not going to be able to get out.  The losses on that side are very high relative to the losses if things turn out to be a little bit better than we expect, and if we get a little bit more inflation than we expect.  In that environment, even if we thought that the Taylor rule was the right formulation, we should be following a policy easier than the Taylor rule because of this asymmetric loss function.  That\u2019s about the big picture stuff.  Let\u2019s get down to the statement. First of all, I\u2019m a little bit worried that the markets are going to take what we do today as us being done.  In other words, we\u2019re doing the maturity extension program because the bar is too high to do an LSAP, and so that\u2019s it.  We want to lean against that expectation.  In alternative B, paragraph 6, rather than have the phrase \u201cemploy its tools as appropriate,\u201d I would prefer to strengthen that a little bit to say \u201cto employ the full range of its tools as appropriate.\u201d  Keep it open ended, indicating that we could do more should things continue to go badly, which they very well might over the next six weeks.  The second point is on paragraph 4.  I do favor investing MBS into MBS.  But I would flip the sentence order in paragraph 4.  I would put the new policy action, \u201cTo help support conditions in the mortgage market, the Committee will now reinvest\u2026\u201d and then I would follow with the second sentence, \u201cThe Committee will maintain its existing policy...\u201d  This would give a little bit more prominence to the new policy action rather than the thing that you\u2019re maintaining.  In terms of 3\u2032 versus 3, I have quite a bit of sympathy with what President Bullard has been saying on this, but I don\u2019t think it works in this particular case of the maturity extension program because you can do less, but you can\u2019t do more.  You\u2019re limited at $400 billion by the nature of the constraints on our balance sheet.  If we were ever to do an LSAP, I would be inclined to do 3\u2032 because there is some value to having something that you can stop earlier or you can keep going.  But in the case of the maturity extension program, there is no option to keep going beyond nine months.  So I think that 3\u2032 is actually weaker than 3, and I do not support it in this particular set of circumstances. In terms of alt A, I would prefer to have more information that we could share with people about our reaction function.  I don\u2019t think the date is really sufficient, but yesterday\u2019s conversation made it very clear there was no consensus on how exactly to do that.  We should look at the SEP and try to discover what our ranges of views are on this subject, both in terms of what triggers would be interesting to us and whether any broad consensus would come out of those numbers.  We may find that there\u2019s no consensus and that this is a blind alley, but if there\u2019s a reasonable consensus, then maybe the SEP is something that can support this going forward. And finally, I absolutely favor contingency planning in this environment.  This is about as dark as the Committee has been regarding the downside risks that I can remember since maybe the dark days of the fall of 2008.  The European situation, in particular, looms very large.  We absolutely have to have contingency planning not just about our monetary policy stance, but also about what liquidity facilities we would deploy and in what manner.  In other words, what\u2019s our program escalation should things go in the wrong direction for market functioning.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  If we did that, it would be, \u201cto help support conditions in mortgage markets, the Committee will now reinvest . . . in agency mortgage-backed securities.  In addition, the Committee will maintain its existing policy rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.\u201d  Have you got that. I have a compromise suggestion on paragraph 6.  On the one hand, as Governor Raskin very appropriately pointed out, we did discuss the range of policy tools.  The statement should correlate to some extent with the events of the meeting.  On the other hand, I think that \u201cthe full range of its tools\u201d is a little aggressive.  I would propose that, as a number of people have suggested, we go back to the language of August, which is identical to this without the brackets.  \u201cDiscussed the range of policy tools\u201d is a reasonable step.  I don\u2019t think it promises any additional action in the near term.  Is that okay", " MR. TARULLO.  Some of these people are voting against alternative B", " MR. LACKER.  This is a question more generally about what conversations we\u2019ve had with the U.S. Treasury and what we\u2019ve gleaned from those about their debt management.  Are they going to react.  Do they pledge not to offset us.  What do we know", " MR. SACK.  That\u2019s right, but let me make a few more comments on that.  The additional maturity extension that\u2019s going to be realized is already under way based on debt management decisions they\u2019ve made to date, and my sense is that they\u2019ve maybe reached the point at which they are ready to start to pull back from that objective.  Yes, we will continue to see a lengthening of the weighted-average maturity given past decisions, but I think we\u2019ll see that lengthening begin to slow and at some point stabilize", " MR. SACK.  Their strategy is that they realize the weighted-average maturity will continue to lengthen, but that they\u2019re going to start, over time, to make adjustments that should cause that lengthening to slow and eventually to stop.  They have not given a precise number of what their weighted-average maturity target is.  I\u2019m not sure if they have one at this point, and they\u2019re engaged in a very active discussion of these issues with their own borrowing advisory committee.  I\u2019m not sure.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s precisely settled in their mind exactly where they want to end up, but it is my understanding that they do not want to continue to lengthen indefinitely", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, without giving offense, which I\u2019m sure I will, I do think it\u2019s important that we all be on board with this, but we also have to be extremely mindful that none of this leaks out to the public, and that\u2019s what worries me", " MR. LACKER.  I want to thank Governor Tarullo for sharing with us that the Board and New York staff are working on liquidity"], "2011FOMC20111102meeting.txt": [" MR. KILEY.  Any simple instrument rule will not be the optimal discretionary policy.  There would be an incentive to deviate from it", " MR. KILEY.  As I noted, we would view the historical approach of the Committee as one consistent with constrained discretion.  Clearly the Committee doesn\u2019t adjust policy willy-nilly and doesn\u2019t reconsider on a meeting-by-meeting basis every aspect of its strategy.  Definitely, there are commitments. Indeed, under the discretion case, as you noted, we take a number of commitments off the table and assume that, for example, an inflation objective of 2 percent is hardwired in the policymaker\u2019s DNA.  In addition, policy communications have given guidance regarding the outlook for the federal funds rate, for example, and I am sure the Committee and the public view those as conditional commitments.  It would be false to suggest that the policy approach involves zero commitments.  The optimal discretionary case here involves a number of commitments as well, and the extent to which there could be gains from further commitment is consistent with the story that we have told in illustrating commitment versus discretion", " MR. LACKER.  There is this dichotomy here, right.  The change in the unemployment insurance, the richness of those\u2014it is a kind of a shock, right.  You guys take that on board for NAIRU, but you don\u2019t take on board any of the other shocks that have hit the economy in the past few years.  Have you guys thought about that dichotomy, that contrast", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  Before this recession we thought the NAIRU was 4\u00be percent.  Now we think, leaving aside the effects of extended unemployment benefits, things like that, it is 6 percent.  When you ratchet that up, that is a very persistent hit to labor market functioning, relative to what we thought. We have also gone back and taken a look at what it was prior to the recession.  I don\u2019t think it was quite as low as 4\u00be percent.  But we have assumed that\u2014through very persistent reduced attachment to the labor force, through duration of employment, through long duration of employment hurting people\u2019s skills, things like that\u2014there are persistent fallout effects, supply-side effects.  As Mike said, those effects are taken into account in these analyses", " MR. KILEY.  Certainly, under the baseline outlook you get some of the benefit from the trigger and some of the benefit from the overall framework.  And then, in the shocks, when things turn out different than you expect, the triggers don\u2019t necessarily tell you what is going to happen in all cases, because they may involve differences in policy in periods after the trigger has happened.  The framework provides some of the benefit.   In the simulations, or in the forward-guidance memo, triggers that signal additional policy accommodation are helpful at the current time, if one wants to improve outcomes for resource utilization.  But there appear to be some gains from moving beyond that", " MR. KILEY.  Yes", " MR. KILEY.  There is one important aspect of commitment that isn\u2019t captured by the Taylor rule.  In all of our baselines, the Committee is committed to following some reasonable strategy.  The baseline is always a simple rule\u2014the outcome-based rule or something like that. The types of commitment strategies that Dave and Chris and I were talking about move beyond that simple rule, because they involve some commitment to undo undesirable movements in the price level.  So one is willing to have inflation run at 2\u00bd percent for a while, for example, if unemployment is very high, to a degree that is greater than embedded in something like a Taylor rule.  That is an insight in the policy literature that can be a good idea, and that is behavior inconsistent with simple policy rules that involve inflation.  That price-level-type aspect of nominal income targeting or the optimal commitment strategy or price-level targeting does move beyond the types of commitments that the Committee has, for the most part, been willing to make in the past", " MR. LACKER.  Yes", " MR. EVANS.  President Bullard, you often had mentioned the Benhabib\u2013Schmitt-Groh\u00e9 paper\u2014and I have to admit that the half-life of my understanding of those analyses is usually less than a full meeting length when I ask my staff about that\u2014but I thought that that relied on a Taylor-rule monetary policy, doesn\u2019t it ", " MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate the Board staff\u2019s analysis of these alternative policy frameworks, as others have noted.  Looking at ways to strengthen our framework and strategies for the longer term certainly is worthwhile, given the importance of our credibility to effective monetary policy. I do support efforts that strive to make monetary policy transparent, credible, and clearly communicated.  But in reading the alternatives and how they are interpreted in the Tealbook, transparency appears to be equated to additional stimulus when, in fact, the two strike me as separate concepts.  In my view, adopting new strategies to achieve additional stimulus in the near term is unlikely to accelerate the broad and necessary process of deleveraging and rebalancing now under way in the economy without risking the low and stable inflation we have worked to achieve, sometimes at great cost, over the past 30 years. Looking ahead to the long-term application of these alternative frameworks, I also see potential practical problems with their implementation, even though they appear to work well in simulations.  In particular, the communication challenges associated with changing our policy framework now would be tremendous, raising the possibility of increasing rather than decreasing uncertainty in what are already uncertain times. Let me turn briefly to my comments on the specific questions raised.  While the general concept of flexible inflation targeting seems innocuous, there are a number of definitional issues I find that are unresolved.  How would the explicit inflation objective be defined.  What inflation rate, what horizon, what numerical value.  And specifying an inflation target also raises the question of how the Committee would define \u201cmaximum employment\u201d\u2014the other component of the dual mandate. Second, the concept of optimal policy under commitment depends on a model, which immediately leads to questions about how different models reflect reality, and thus, produce different optimal policies.  Some have noted how different preferences can contribute as well. For instance, I differ from the authors and would argue that inflation of 2\u00bd percent over several years is more costly than inflation of 1\u00bd percent, because of the risk of longer-term inflation expectations becoming unhinged.  Commitment is elusive, because we cannot bind ourselves, or our successors, to carry through on any forward guidance we provide today.  As economic circumstances change, the temptation to deviate in the future from today\u2019s promises will be significant. Regarding strategies for price-level or nominal income targeting, I am concerned with basing policy decisions on only one or two variables.  The financial crisis reminded us that policy decisions should be based on a range of data that can inform us about the state of the economy and the outlook.  While our primary objectives are inflation and employment, financial stability is both important and consistent with our long-run mandate.  A narrower focus on inflation and employment in the medium term could lead to a costly miss of our financial stability objective in the longer term. Finally, I would be interested in exploring the idea of augmenting the SEP to include more information about our expected policy paths.  Adding such information to the SEP has the potential to enhance transparency and provide more flexibility, in my view, than incorporating specific funds rate projections associated with unemployment and inflation triggers.  Since the public is beginning to be more familiar with the SEP, the communications challenges may be easier to overcome.  Thank you", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to start and conclude where President Williams concluded.  That is, I don\u2019t think now is the time, but I do think it is a subject we are studying. First, I want to thank the staff for their good work.  I also want to thank them for their honesty.  I thought section 4 about the risks of our models at least, and the faulty potential of our models, was frank and honest.  I do want to have submitted for the record a particularly pungent sentence, which says, \u201cGiven that the strategies we consider lack historical precedent, and even the tools used to implement the strategies are relatively unconventional, there is considerable risk that our model results may prove faulty in some respect.\u201d  Indeed, any policy outside the range of historical experience, ranging from the strategies considered here to balance sheet adjustments and macroprudential regulation, could have unintended consequences for economic welfare, for better or for worse.  Your section 4 expands upon that somewhat.  I thank you for the good work that you have put together. I am in favor of at least more discipline, if not a rule.  I think we have been a little bit spastic in the way we have developed policy, a little bit reactionary, and we have sent signals to the marketplace, which then seem to be built into expectations.  I would like to see a little bit more discipline as we go through time. I am in favor of the exercise.  I boil it down to two simple principles:  We have to be realistic, and we have to be credible.  What I mean by realistic is that we know that we have more influence on inflation as a monetary phenomenon than we do on employment.  What I mean by credible is that shifting horses, whether we do it midstream or whenever we do it, cannot be viewed as a weakening of our commitment to price stability, and cannot be viewed as, in particular, a weakening of our commitment to long-term price stability. I thought President George\u2019s comments were interesting.  To me, the key variable is to identify a longer-term inflation target.  I am in favor of doing that.  President George pointed out some issues around that\u2014which target do we pick, under what conditions, and so on\u2014but talking about having one is a worthwhile exercise. Then, I would want to understand better within this Committee what the bands of tolerance are around that target if we are going to talk about flexible inflation targeting.  Once we have achieved that understanding, then I think we need to explain to the public that as long as we have a dual mandate we have to deal with both inflation and unemployment variables.  And as long as we have that mandate, then it may be desirable, if we decide that is the case at this table\u2014once we have agreed on a long-term inflation target, and our tolerance bands around it\u2014that we may have to deviate occasionally from our target on maybe the high or the low side in order to deal with our employment mandate. This is something that we should take some time to consider.  I started this meeting by giving President Bullard a six-pack of Shiner Bock beer", " MR. SACK.  My assessment would be that Operation Twist put downward pressure on Treasury yields, as I said in the briefing.  All else being equal, the majority of that would have passed through to private borrowing rates\u2014maybe not the entirety of it, but the large majority of it. What actually happened on the FOMC announcement was that private borrowing rates did not go down for lower-quality issuers, that spreads widened immediately.  But I would interpret that spread widening as more of a reaction to the concerns about the economy and the pessimism that was in the FOMC statement that apparently surprised market participants, rather than a lack of pass-through from the Twist action itself.   It wasn\u2019t that Twist only affects Treasuries and nothing else.  We do think that arbitrage, all else being equal, would have pulled down the private borrowing rates.  You see that in the reaction of the 30-year swap rate.  The 30-year swap rate, in terms of credit risk, is somewhat complicated.  It does have a credit risk premium in it related to the LIBOR that it is referenced to.  It is not the credit risk of lending to a firm for 30 years, but it is essentially the credit risk of promising to lend to a bank that will be in the LIBOR panel for those 30 years.  That means it has a much smaller credit risk component than corporate yields.  You can look at this and basically, from the relative movement of swaps and Treasuries, assess whether Treasury yield movements pass through to private rates, all else being equal, and then add on top of that the effects on credit quality. In terms of assessed credit quality, for sure it has been a seesaw.  The market repriced to much wider credit spreads through early October associated with pessimism about the economy and concerns about risks emanating from Europe.  It is the same pattern we saw with the financials and their CDS spreads, and so on.  Then, as sentiment improved\u2014which was the old theme of the briefing, as Europe seemed a little better and the data came in\u2014that is really what led to a substantial narrowing of the corporate bond spreads.  But my guess is, as we seesaw here, if this pessimism we have seen in the past two days persists, we will again start to see some upward pressure on corporate yield spreads", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  SIPC is on the case now as a trustee, so they are trying to manage these accounts.  But I think there is definitely some freezing of assets and people not being able to execute this stuff", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I don\u2019t know", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.  Morgan Stanley, we believe, has a very large liquidity cushion.  The MF Global experience showed you that whatever liquidity cushion you have can run off a lot faster than you expect.  Morgan Stanley is starting with a much better balance sheet than MF Global was, and they have been actually earning money.  One of the precipitating events for MF Global was that they took a very large loss in the most recent quarter.  That was really what started this thing spinning last Tuesday", " MS. MESTER.5  I will be referring to the exhibits in \u201cMaterial for Briefing on Trial-Run Policy Projections.\u201d  As part of its exploration into various approaches for enhancing the Committee\u2019s communications, the subcommittee on communications asked FOMC participants to provide information on their individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy.  More specifically, participants were asked to provide projections for the average level of the federal funds rate target in the fourth quarter of each calendar year through the forecast horizon of 2014 and over the longer run.  These projections correspond to the appropriate policy that participants incorporated into their November SEP submissions.  Participants who see the first policy firming occurring after 2014 were asked to provide their assessments of the likely year of liftoff, as well as their economic projections for that year. I have divided the handout\u2019s exhibits into those similar to the ones seen in the standard SEP release (these are exhibits 1 and 2) and those that might be useful for internal discussions (these are exhibits 3 and 4). As shown in exhibit 1, participants\u2019 funds rate projections have a central tendency of 13 to 67 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2012.  Beyond 2012, differences in views about the timing and pace of tightening can be seen in the widening of both the central tendency and the range of projections.  By the end of 2014, the central tendency for the funds rate is 13 to 250 basis points.  Thus, participants agree that by the end of the forecast period, the policy rate will remain considerably below its projected longer-run value, whose central tendency is 400 to 450 basis points. The longer-run projections represent the value of the funds rate to which the economy will converge over time in the absence of further shocks.  This longer-run value depends on both the longer-run inflation rate, which the central bank can determine, and the equilibrium real interest rate, which it cannot.  5 The materials used by Ms. Mester are appended to this transcript (appendix 5). Exhibit 2 provides histograms of the trial-run responses.  As shown, there is somewhat less disagreement about the appropriate path of policy\u2014at least over the next couple of years\u2014than the central tendencies and ranges might suggest.  A large majority of participants\u201411 of 17\u2014see the funds rate remaining at current levels through 2013, consistent with the Committee\u2019s current forward guidance that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.  In contrast, by 2014, only 5 participants see the funds rate still at current levels, and the range of projected values is quite wide.  This result suggests that, while participants are in fairly close agreement about their long-run objectives, they differ more significantly in their assessments of the economy and about how monetary policy can influence economic outcomes. As shown in exhibit 3, there is considerable disparity in views about when appropriate policy would require the funds rate to move off the zero bound.  The modal year is 2014, but three participants project no change until 2015 and one projects no change until 2016.  In contrast, one participant judges that the appropriate year of policy liftoff is this year, and three others, in 2012. Participants cited several factors that informed their policy judgments.  Those favoring liftoff in 2014 or later cited slow growth and high unemployment coupled with moderate inflation, high and persistent resource slack, and the effects of the zero lower bound in limiting monetary policy accommodation.  Those favoring an earlier liftoff cited the need to forestall inflation pressures and financial and structural imbalances, and the need to keep inflation expectations anchored.  More generally, some participants indicated that their views of appropriate policy included further clarification of the Committee\u2019s forward guidance, and some noted a relationship between the Fed\u2019s balance sheet and their funds rate paths. The trial run provided information on economic projections beyond the standard forecast horizon for those participants anticipating that the first funds rate increase would occur after 2014.  This allows us to look at participants\u2019 projections of economic activity aligned on the year of the first increase rather than on a calendar year.  This is a step toward gaining a better understanding of participants\u2019 views of the economic conditions that underlie their assumed policy paths.  Participants could find such information useful in their internal discussions of policymaking and communications issues, such as clarifying the conditionality of the Committee\u2019s forward guidance. It is important to remember that we do not know the exact timing of a participant\u2019s first rate increase\u2014the collected information reveals only the level of the funds rate in the fourth quarter of each year, and a participant could be anticipating the first change in the funds rate early in that year or late in the year.  So, to get a sense of expected economic conditions and the expected change in economic conditions at the time of the first projected rate increase, the top panel of exhibit 4 shows the central tendency and range of projections of real GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and PCE inflation for the current year (2011), for the year prior to liftoff, and for the year of liftoff. As indicated, in the year prior to their first rate increase (the middle bar in each forecast panel), the central tendency of participants\u2019 projections is for economic growth to pick up from the current level of around 1\u00be percent to between 2\u00bd and 3\u00be percent; for the unemployment rate to decline from around 9 percent this year to between 7\u00be and 9 percent; and for total PCE inflation to decline from around 2\u00be percent this year to a range of 1\u00bd to 2\u00be percent. Then in the year of liftoff (the third bar in each forecast panel), participants generally anticipate a slight acceleration in GDP and that the unemployment rate will continue to move down\u2014but the central tendency is fairly wide at 6\u00bd to 8 percent.  The central tendency of the inflation projection in the year of liftoff is about 1\u00bd to 2\u00bc percent. Of course, while the central tendencies and ranges give summary information, they don\u2019t reveal the connections between an individual participant\u2019s policy assessment and his or her economic projections.  The bottom panel of exhibit 4 displays some of that information in a set of scatter plots of pairs of variables from each individual forecaster in his or her year of liftoff.  It is important to note that forecasters can have similar views of the economic conditions needed to spur liftoff, but their views on the timing of when those conditions will be reached can differ substantially.  I\u2019ve highlighted two points in the first scatter plot as an example.  Each of these two forecasters sees growth around 3 percent and the unemployment rate around 8 percent when the fed funds rate moves away from the zero bound, but one thinks this will happen in 2012 and the other thinks it won\u2019t occur until 2014.   As seen in the first plot, several participants are projecting that the first rise in the funds rate will need to occur before the unemployment rate falls to 7\u00bd percent and with growth at 3\u00bd percent or less.  As shown in the bottom-right plot, all participants anticipate that liftoff will need to occur even though inflation is under 3 percent and the unemployment rate is at or above 6\u00bd percent. These exhibits and those distributed on Monday are meant to illustrate how information about participants\u2019 policy expectations might facilitate the Committee\u2019s internal deliberations.  If it would be helpful, the staff could collect and present this information on an ongoing basis and assist in exploring approaches for disseminating such information to the public through the SEP.  Thank you", " MR. FISHER.  Just a point for David and the international side\u2014to tie them together.  In talking to the oil companies\u2014which include Exxon; it has pretty good information\u2014what they note is that gasoline\u2013diesel demand is off 2 percent year to date.  But what has occurred is that with the slowdown in European growth, there is less refinery output, meaning less exports to the East Coast of the United States.  As a result, they haven\u2019t seen the decrease in motor gas prices that they had expected.  So there is this odd phenomenon.  It is an international market.  It\u2019s marked off of Brent, by the way, not off of WTI.  But it\u2019s a refinery concept.  The slowdown in Europe is actually affecting supply in the United States, even though demand has come up somewhat.  The same is true for av gas\u2014that, in the parlance of business, the crack spread has just not narrowed.  The question is, when will it happen.  But the pressures are moving in that direction from a demand standpoint.  I wanted to make that point. On food prices, the entire structure seems to be supported by Chinese demand.  Soybean oil, for example, which is the most important\u201410 years ago, they imported 5 million tons; this year, they\u2019ll import 60 million tons.  I mention that because, if you look at the headline PCE number, Mr. Chairman, of that 2 percent, 1.7 percent was either gasoline or food\u20141.4 was gas and 0.3 was food\u2014and the rest, the core, of course, was flat, in keeping with what the trimmed mean was forecasting, as I\u2019ve said, at a six-month run rate. For what it\u2019s worth, I think you need to take note of that phenomenon.  The international side is definitely impacting, in both gas and food, what is happening here in the United States.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But that\u2019s a loose EBA instruction", " MR. LACKER.  It would be hard to pick a consensus trigger out of that or a threshold.  Is that what you take from this", "   MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yes, I wanted to build on something I had said earlier after Governor Tarullo\u2019s earlier remarks.  Frankly, when I speak about the economy, I\u2019m not sure people are all that interested in what I would do with the fed funds rate if I were in charge\u2014they want to know what I expect this Committee to do.  And when we use the SEP, I\u2019m not sure we want to be thinking about it as conveying the full richness of all of our views about the economy, as opposed to trying to use it to convey what we think is going to be happening to policy tools. I think it\u2019s right to condition our long-run forecasts on optimal monetary policy.  That gives the people the right idea of what the long-run target is.  Conditioning our forecast for the fed funds rate and for inflation and unemployment on that\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to convey the right kind of information to markets.  Markets want to know where we think those variables are going to go and how we think policy is going to respond to that and what we think policy will be, as opposed to under what we think optimal policy should be", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The markets seem to have initially taken some solace in the Europeans having an outline of actions with no details and in U.S. economic data consistent with growth that does not improve the employment situation.  That such diminished expectations can generate a market rally is hardly encouraging.  As Brian highlighted, it is even less encouraging that a referendum in a small country can offset much of those gains.  This highlights the fragile financial condition as we try to make our own forecast. My forecast, like that in the Tealbook, provides little to celebrate\u2014positive but weak growth given the sizable output gap, positive but weak employment growth that leaves us far from full employment, and inflation that remains below 2 percent.  By mid-2013, I expect we will still have an unemployment rate above 8 percent and an inflation rate well below 2 percent.  The Tealbook has a similar forecast.  If these forecasts are right, we will be missing on both elements of the mandate two years from now. Financial market participants remain concerned.  Liquidity in many markets is sporadic at best.  Financial institutions, worried about their own liquidity risk, are not supporting markets to the same degree, making financial market participants less willing to take positions that may be difficult to exit.  My own interpretation is that in many markets, European and American institutions that have been dependent on wholesale financing are pulling back from activities, resulting in marketmakers less willing to make markets.  While there has been some increased refinancing activity, and the newly announced HARP changes are positive, both the movement in mortgage rates and the fiscal willingness to encourage refinancing remain too timid to have much macroeconomic effect.  Our econometric equations imply that we are well below the level of construction implied by fundamentals at this time.  And buyer concern about future prices and the tightness of credit conditions make a very gradual return to normal in housing the most likely outcome. My business contacts indicate widespread caution.  Given the possibility that deficit discussions remain dysfunctional and European brinkmanship remains the negotiating tool of choice, businesses would prefer to defer hiring and investment decisions until there is more clarity in the outlook. Given the weak performance we have experienced and the weakness in our forecast, our incremental policy is not the best approach.  Critics of Japanese policymakers focus on a slow, deliberate approach that led to very suboptimal outcomes, with 20 years of slow growth and inflation below targets.  If we do not start seeing more-robust improvement, then the likely fiscal austerity and continued downside risk from Europe put such improvement at significant risk.  We will need to decide whether incremental policies are likely to return us to either element of our mandate in the medium term.  Thank you", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My assessment of the economic outlook has not changed meaningfully over the past few meetings.  I do not see any evidence that the U.S. economy is poised to achieve escape velocity anytime soon.  We\u2019ve experienced periods when the balance of the incoming data had been negative.  More recently, the news has been somewhat better.  I made it a point not to overreact to the weaker monthly data we saw this summer, and so I\u2019m not overreacting to the more positive numbers we\u2019ve seen of late.  The best-case outlook seems to be simply muddling along.  The recent, more positive data are still only indicative of an economy that\u2019s just treading water.  The 2\u00bd percent growth rates we\u2019re looking at over the near term are just not enough to make meaningful headway into the substantial resource gaps we see in the economy today. Commentary from my business contacts continues to support this assessment.  Indeed, there really wasn\u2019t that much new in their reports this round.  Overall, most say things are moving sideways at this time.  They just don\u2019t see the demand in place to justify expanding workforces or capacity.  Many of my contacts said they were demanding contingency plans from their staffs to slash expenditures 5 to 30 percent if needed, and I continue to hear many say they are making plans to promptly cut spending at the first sign of a downturn in demand.  These are hardly the plans of business leaders who are contemplating an acceleration in their activities.  I expect more of the same.  The ups and downs in the national data did show through in our contacts\u2019 commentaries about the automotive industry.  The OEMs and their suppliers are expecting continuing modest improvement in auto sales and production, but they don\u2019t see things taking off, either. Everyone continues to be concerned about Europe.  This report seems stale.  The reports from my staff, who talk to people in the Chicago markets\u2014the report seemed stale on Friday, but it seems a little fresh today.  Prior to last week\u2019s announcement, the financial-sector contacts said that uncertainty and caution were freezing up some markets.  That said, there was little evidence of panic.  Our contacts also said that they would view any European debt package with some skepticism.  They seem to be on target with that one.  They question the Europeans\u2019 ability to execute whatever immediate plans they come up with, as well as the prospects for a longer-term resolution given the impediments to growth in the region. Turning to the macro outlook for the U.S., our growth forecast is similar to the Tealbook\u2019s.  We also think that the reductions the Board staff has made to potential output are plausible, and these reductions are not small.  They cut nearly 3 percent from the level you would get by simply extrapolating forward a modest 2\u00bd percent growth trend from the beginning of the recession\u2014not as much as the 5\u00bd percent growth that President Williams was talking about.  But even with this substantial reduction in potential, we\u2019re still looking at large output gaps and growth forecasts that leave resource utilization at very low levels throughout the projection period.  To sum up, all of the incoming data and anecdotal reports point to an economy that\u2019s just sputtering along.  We\u2019re generating growth, but it falls far short of the pace we need given the size of the resource gaps that must be closed.  With regard to the two scenarios I discussed this morning, in my opinion, the U.S. economy is entangled in a liquidity trap with amplification from a large Reinhart\u2013Rogoff financial crisis.  We could be staring at a lost decade, the way President Williams was suggesting from his comments on Japan.  Even if this is only an exaggerated risk\u2014I don\u2019t think it is\u2014if we fail to take further actions, owing to credibility risks, we end up with about as much credibility as the Bank of Japan has, I worry.  Like President Rosengren, I worry about too slow, incremental policies.  I think we need to continue to add more accommodation.  There are alternatives in the Tealbook, A1 and A2, and I\u2019m uncomfortable with stasis.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me ask you, President Evans and President Williams\u2014I\u2019m a little confused:  If potential output is 5 percent lower, how can the output gap still be comparably large", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, it sounds as though your drug use anecdote could argue either way.  It could argue for more stimulus to get more people off the streets, right", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Sorry\u2014900 days.  You can live in the house for a long time rent free before they actually catch up with you.  Also, you have the problem of getting the Real Estate Owned once it\u2019s foreclosed back into the market.  We have a very peculiar situation right now where rents are rising despite the fact that we have a glut of unsold homes.  And that\u2019s a really peculiar situation.  Now, the good news, of course, is that the Administration is taking another stab at helping high-loan-to-value households refinance.  But as I read it, the program seems pretty limited in scope, and the terms are not as generous as they could be.  Also, the Administration program is focused just on that one aspect of housing. I view housing as really essential because if you stabilized housing and housing prices did stop falling, not only would that be good for the housing sector itself in terms of provoking more demand for housing, but I think it would also be very important for household wealth and household confidence.  So it could actually have pretty significant effects for consumer spending.  But I don\u2019t think we\u2019re there yet. The last issue is fiscal policy.  There are two real issues here.  First, fiscal policy, in the absence of policy action, is going to be turned sharply restrictive at the start of 2012.  I think we\u2019re understating the potential significance of that.  Second, we have policy dysfunction in Washington, and that\u2019s also important because it has an independent effect on household and business confidence.  In this respect, the outcome of the supercommittee deliberations is important, not just for what they do or don\u2019t do in terms of long-term fiscal consolidation\u2014but also, if they do something tangible, it will actually be good for household and business confidence, and if they don\u2019t, it won\u2019t, because then we\u2019ll just be on hold through the next election. My view is that we\u2019re going to see moderate growth over the near term.  But until these three issues\u2014Europe, housing, and fiscal\u2014are addressed in a way that takes them off the table, I view the risk as very much tilted to the downside.  Now, if all of them were addressed positively, I could actually see the economy surprising on the upside.  And the reason for that is, a lot of people are on the sidelines, holding back, because they\u2019re uncertain about the outlook.  When I talk to businesses, especially small businesses, I actually hear a lot of people say, \u201cI\u2019m okay, but I\u2019m not doing anything right now.\u201d  So if we could just take care of these three problems, we could actually have a pretty good outlook.  But unfortunately, there\u2019s not a lot of power in this room to do much about it.  My own view is, we should be highlighting these three issues, and, especially on housing and fiscal, we should be pressing the Washington policymakers, both publicly and privately, to do something about these things.  Thank you", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economy remains mired in the worst slump since that of the 1930s.  While recent readings on retail sales, capital goods orders and shipments, and nonresidential construction have turned up, important indicators of near-term economic activity remain downbeat.  Business surveys point to continued caution, conditions in the labor market have not brightened, and gains in industrial production, excluding the motor vehicle supply chain, remain sluggish.  These disappointing indicators likely reflect the fact that the factors that have been restraining the pace of the recovery are still in place.  The large overhang of vacant housing units remains, credit availability remains impaired, and risk premiums remain elevated.  In the interest of time, I won\u2019t comment on the European situation or the housing situation or the fiscal situation.  I also won\u2019t comment on drug use among non\u2013purple squirrels.  Instead, I just want to talk for a minute about consumer sentiment, which is another factor likely continuing to hold back the recovery. Confidence measures are at historic lows, and recent measures of confidence remain exceedingly low, probably due to households\u2019 concerns about low future income and wealth, which tend to depress consumption.  Despite last week\u2019s report showing a 0.5 percent increase in real consumer spending in September, a welcome surprise for sure, I\u2019m not optimistic that households are ready to be an engine of growth for this economy.  For one thing, the September increase was not accompanied by rising incomes.  Rather, real disposable income edged down in September and has increased only very modestly over the past 12 months.  The resulting downdrift in the saving rate to around 4 percent in the third quarter might be interpreted as a sign that households are feeling optimistic again, but the lousy consumer sentiment numbers and the lack of any improvement in home equity values suggest that this is very unlikely to be the case and that consumer spending will be subdued going forward. The lack of any meaningful increase in real incomes for the vast majority of households suggests that many are feeling pretty strapped, even those who have jobs and are not under water.  This is evident in the spreading discourse about income inequality in the country, which the Chairman has been asked about.  Many of us are receiving personally addressed letters to our homes from protesters, and I have the one that I received just yesterday.  Page 1 reads, \u201cEnd the Fed.\u201d  This is typical because I do get one a day, and this is Occupy Muskegon.  Many of the Reserve Bank presidents, too, I know, are dealing with Occupy Wall Street protesters in their cities and at their Banks.  Regardless of how any of us feel about the merits of the 99\u20131 critique, we have to acknowledge that this is not only a cost of a lack of aggregate demand, a cost of long-term unemployment, but also an additional factor that is affecting social cohesion, dignity, and American optimism. In sum, the pace of consumer spending is up, but the low level of sentiment, volatility in the stock market, and tepid gains in employment and income projected for the coming years continue to weigh on consumer spending and thus on overall economic activity.  It\u2019s hard to see what string of events will eventually break this cycle, and as a consequence, I continue to expect the pace of the recovery to be subpar.  Thank you", " MR. SACK.  Yes, I would imagine their expectation is that that clause would be repeated.  We didn\u2019t ask that explicitly, but certainly given the volatility in markets and the uncertainties that they see, I think they wouldn\u2019t be surprised to have that sentence repeated with the word \u201csignificant", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Yesterday I discussed the Boston forecast and talked about inflation being at 1\u00bd percent, roughly where the Tealbook was, by mid-2013.  Both the Boston forecast and the Board forecast come from a particular econometric tradition, so I thought it was noteworthy to at least look at the memos on DSGE models.  And interestingly, from all four of those banks, they came up with roughly the same estimate that both the Tealbook and the Boston Fed forecast, which was roughly 1\u00bd percent.  In fact, I think 1\u00bd is a high rather than a low for both those four banks and those coming from a different econometric tradition. What that would seem to say is that there is some flexibility, if we are going to have an inflation rate below 2 percent two to three years out, to do more accommodation in order to get a better result on the unemployment rate.  The reason you wouldn\u2019t do that is, one, you might think that we couldn\u2019t affect the interest rate, or, two, if we did affect interest rates, it would have no impact.  Brian yesterday showed the percent of Treasuries that we\u2019re buying, and showed that in a number of issues, we\u2019re buying a very significant amount.  I have no doubt that if we\u2019re willing to buy a very significant amount, we have the ability to move down both Treasury rates and mortgage-backed securities rates.  It\u2019s a question of will, not whether we can do it or not.  It isn\u2019t a question of whether we can move those interest rates. So then the question is, if we can move those interest rates, what is the likelihood it would have any impact.  Some analysts have argued that pushing long rates down through quantitative easing would have no effect.  No effect is a very restrictive assumption, but it has been cited by a wide number of analysts.  That assumption means that housing is unresponsive to lower rates; that consumption, including autos and durables, is unresponsive to interest rates; that exchange rates in the foreign sector are unresponsive despite the complaints by many of our foreign trading partners about the quantitative easing; and that investment is unresponsive to lower rates. I asked the people who do our model to test the assumption of whether the interest responsiveness of each of these components is really zero.  Not surprisingly, my prior was that they wouldn\u2019t find that zero was the right answer.  And when they did that, they did find that in housing, the coefficient was much lower, but they didn\u2019t find that the coefficient was 0\u2014which is, housing is responsive; it\u2019s not as responsive as it would be without all of the various headwinds.  But in those other sectors, they couldn\u2019t reject the assumption that in the past several years, interest rates have affected those sectors in the same way that they did prior to the past several years.  So it is interesting that it does seem, from at least the econometric analysis done at the Boston Fed, that in using the model that we use for the forecast, we actually do find that if we chose to push interest rates lower, it would have an impact on the economy, contrary to what at least some analysts have argued. When I look at alternative B, which maintains the exceptionally low rates \u201cat least through mid-2013,\u201d our forecast implies that the language in alternative A would actually be more appropriate.  Should we leave policy unchanged when both elements of the mandate are missed in the medium term.  We\u2019re not at full employment, and we\u2019re lower than 2 percent for the inflation rate.  My preference would be to use this meeting to clearly communicate that rates will remain exceptionally low until unemployment is 7 percent or the inflation rate exceeds 2\u00bd percent in the medium term.  At our next meeting, if the outlook once again envisions unacceptable progress toward our primary goals, we need to consider taking more forceful action. Were we to have a shock from a large bank failure here or abroad, a European crisis, or the inability to reach agreement on our debt problems, aggressive monetary actions, perhaps coupled with a move to nominal GDP targeting to signal a regime change, would clearly be appropriate.  But even our baseline forecast implies a lost decade for many people in the workforce.  We should consider soon whether more vigorous policies are necessary.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today I support further actions by the Committee to provide additional significant monetary accommodation.  I am not arguing that economic conditions have deteriorated further and thus require this additional action.  I am arguing that the progression of adding stimulus needs to continue.  In my assessment, there are significant benefits to credibly solidifying expectations that policy will continue to be extraordinarily accommodative as long as conditions warrant.  I spoke about the risk-management benefits at length yesterday, and I hope that the record properly reflects those comments here as well in the interest of time. As I\u2019ve stated here and in public, I interpret our dual-mandate responsibilities to be closely associated with minimizing a quadratic policy loss function, which puts equal weights on price stability and maximum employment as captured by unemployment deviations from a pretty conservative and time-varying natural rate.  Given such a loss function, the staff analysis shows clear value in strengthening our forward guidance.  I agree with President Rosengren very much. There are also considerations not captured by the staff analysis that I think add to the case for further accommodation.  Some of this came up yesterday.  The longer we go with very high unemployment and output far below its potential, the more we risk actually eroding that potential.  President Williams mentioned the supply effects the Japanese perceive.  Some of the reductions that we have already made to our estimates of potential are due to decreased capital deepening that is actually a fallout of weak demand suppressing capital investment. Mr. Chairman, your speeches have highlighted the corrosive effects of long-term unemployment, and Governor Tarullo did a great job of explaining how we may be on the cusp of finally significantly raising the natural rate of unemployment.  I think those considerations add some urgency to this situation. In favoring more policy accommodation in the form of certain variations of alternative A, I expect that I will be outside the consensus policy decision today.  Since July 2010, I\u2019ve advocated aggressive forms of additional policy accommodation.  I argued for state-contingent price-level targeting in the fall of 2010.  I was pleased to support QE2 as a further substantial step along the way, and I hoped that that would be enough.  In August of this year, I argued for a version of the trigger threshold strategy similar to the language in alt A1, paragraph 4\u2033.  Yesterday\u2019s discussion clearly indicates that, at least for now, I\u2019m outside of the Committee\u2019s consensus regarding such policy clarifications of our \u201cmid-2013\u201d forward guidance\u2014that is, if in fact there is a consensus regarding interpreting and clarifying \u201cmid-2013.\u201d  We\u2019re going to have to deal with that soon.  It\u2019s not really optional. In any event, it\u2019s my judgment that we need another substantial step toward additional accommodation in order to solidify expectations.  Accordingly, I favor alternative A1, with a variation of paragraph 4\u2033 included.  I think that our exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate, at least as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent or unless medium-term PCE inflation exceeds 3 percent and longer-term inflation expectations become unanchored.  Just to be clear, my preferred strategy for delivering additional accommodation in the most credible fashion would be to pursue additional asset purchases regularly at subsequent meetings until the outlook for hitting either of these thresholds increased commensurately with these additional actions. As I said, Mr. Chairman, on the basis of yesterday\u2019s commentaries, I expect that my policy position is simply too far outside the consensus, and I cannot support alternative B today.  Thank you", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m going to support alternative B.  I do not support alternative A2 because I don\u2019t favor additional asset purchases at this time.  But I do have to express some sympathy for alternative A1, with its policy thrust of pushing the funds rate guidance further out to 2014. My own forecast projects a funds rate near zero at least through mid-2014.  Considering the language options for paragraph 4 of alternative A1, I am sympathetic to the first option because, as I said, it reflects my forecast.  I\u2019m also sympathetic to the second option for paragraph 4 because, in my view, it makes sense to move in the direction of policy conditionality in terms of projected economic outcomes, versus guidance based only on a calendar date.  I am less sympathetic to the third option in paragraph 4 because I think its introduction of an explicit unemployment threshold could prove to be a step too far.  For reasons that I expressed yesterday, I am concerned that the unemployment problem is multifaceted, not well understood, and quite possibly not as responsive as we might hope to a sustained accommodative monetary policy stance.  I am reluctant to connect the path of policy so concretely to what might show itself as time passes to be a problematic number that is taken as a trigger.  Despite my sympathy for alternative A1, paragraphs 4 and 4\u2032, I lean to alternative B at this meeting.  I would prefer a \u201cstay the course\u201d approach for the time being.  The economy is improving, and I think we would be prudent to take a breather and see how the European and congressional fiscal stories play out and the economy evolves.   I think it would be best to avoid the impression of a policy change, and the easiest way to do that is to stick with our previous language.  I say this because I do not really think the presumption of a very low funds rate through mid-2014 is a change from the consensus view that has prevailed since August.  Because alternative A1, with the first paragraph 4 option, does reflect this reality, I do not strongly object to it in substance but advise against it at this meeting as a matter of tactics.  If the Committee goes in that direction, I would hope we might convey that pushing the horizon of the current funds rate policy to mid-2014 is more an extension and continuation of the August policy decision than a change in the implied degree of stimulus relative to September.  This could perhaps be done through the Chairman\u2019s comments on the SEP. As regards the language of alternative B, I prefer no change at this meeting.  As I already implied, I do not object strenuously to the change that comes off a date and allows a rolling approach.  It does suggest an extension, as I said, which is consistent with my forecast, but that may be too narrow a point.  It\u2019s early enough, it seems to me, to treat this tactically at this meeting.  So all things considered, I prefer the existing \u201cmid-2013\u201d language.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I support alternative B, with maintaining the language \u201cthrough mid-2013.\u201d  Mr. Evans may be surprised that I agree with him completely\u2014that the longer we go with high unemployment, the more we undermine potential.  I just don\u2019t believe that our monetary accommodation has been all that useful in assisting the reduction of joblessness, given the uncertainty that is posed by the fiscal and regulatory morass that we see on Capitol Hill.  And I believe we\u2019re pushing on a string on that front. I have been outspoken on this publicly and within this room.  I did not support the extension to mid-2013.  I voted against it.  I still\u2014despite, I think, Brian\u2019s very good briefings\u2014view Operation Twist as incomplete.  I suspect it was good for the rich.  As a former trader, having learned very well to operate on \u201cbuying on the rumor and selling on the news,\u201d I think we did end up enriching certain swift and capable money operators.  It\u2019s not clear to me that in the end it will benefit the cost of business borrowing.  I do believe very firmly that we have significant liquidity in the economy. I found all the interventions yesterday to be quite brilliant, but I was particularly struck by Governor Duke\u2019s, in terms of some of the improvements that have been made regarding balance sheets and the potential that exists out there.  I wouldn\u2019t say that I want to completely embrace the \u201cTigger\u201d scenario, nor am I willing to embrace the \u201cEeyore\u201d scenario, but I found that to be a sobering assessment in contrast to what everybody else was talking about at the table, and it\u2019s something we should bear in mind. I continue to believe that we should harbor our ammunition.  We have few bullets left.  I referred to them in the last meeting\u2014in reference to your initials, Mr. Chairman\u2014as BBs.  But whatever we have left we need to use under dire circumstances.  I am still of the belief that we could see an S&P 500 trading at 600 under very easy circumstances if we have the horrific scenario that some fear obtained in Europe and just because of the nature of the skittishness of markets. I continue to worry about the impact of what we have wrought on those who played by the rules, saved their money, and are being hurt by low interest rates.  I do believe this is not constructive from the standpoint of the 6,000-plus community banks we have in this country in terms of squeezing their profitability. I do believe that this has a negative impact related to the resetting of pension fund liabilities, which takes away from investment that might otherwise go into job-creating capital, and I worry about the consequence of our low-interest-rate policy.  These are costs that are involved.  There are certainly benefits that accrue.  But I don\u2019t think one of the benefits is that we impact the too-high unemployment levels in this country if we just act as a substitute for fiscal policy.   We\u2019ll have more information by December in terms of knowing what the supercommittee is likely to do, and in my book, as long as we provide accommodative monetary policy, we give them an excuse not to act.  It is time for them to act, and I would urge you, in your press briefing, to underscore what you have said publicly\u2014and Mr. Dudley, the Vice Chairman of this Committee, mentioned yesterday\u2014that we should stress regarding the need for fiscal policy to get its act together.  Mr. Chairman, I would support statement B.  With regard to the word \u201csignificant,\u201d I am somewhat indifferent.  I would prefer not to use it, but if the Desk tells us that it\u2019s been digested by the market, then I could swallow it.  I didn\u2019t think it was in blue, by the way\u2014I thought it was in purple, Mr. Lockhart, just to satisfy you.  And I would suggest that those who are seeing purple squirrels may be taking the drugs that Mr. Lockhart and Mr. Lacker have been talking about.  [Laughter]  So that\u2019s it, Mr. Chairman.  I support statement B as drafted, with \u201cthrough mid-2013.\u201d  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A week and a half ago, I gave a speech in which I suggested that additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities should be put back on the top of our agenda.  I carefully phrased that speech and that particular suggestion so as to say that if things did not improve over the next couple of months, I thought we should consider it.  I qualified the formulation, really out of respect for the decisionmaking process of the Committee.  In fact, I think that there is a good case to be made right now for additional MBS purchases. Before I get to that reasoning, though, I wanted to say a couple of things about the general environment in which we\u2019re making this decision today.  First, we\u2019re not just talking about unemployment here.  Had it been a circumstance in which the economy was growing 3\u00bd percent a year but unemployment was remaining stubbornly high, it would have been one thing.  But that is not the circumstance that we confront.  We have now had a several-year pattern of growth that has little spurts and then reverts back to a very tepid pace.  So the failure to create more jobs seems quite logically tied to the performance of the economy as a whole.  Of course, there are some uncertainties about exactly how some sectors of the labor market would or would not react to improved growth.  But if one looks at the data, the importance of aggregate demand and of cyclical unemployment as explanatory variables is as strong as virtually anything that we look at in this Committee.  So I do think it\u2019s a red herring to talk about structural unemployment or drug problems or something of the sort when we\u2019re talking about what impact may be had by further monetary stimulus.  I appreciate Jeff\u2019s formulation, which was basically saying, \u201cYes, of course there\u2019s room for more stimulus.\u201d  But Jeff assesses the risks of inflation versus the stimulus, and I think that\u2019s a legitimate conversation.  I would come out on the other side, but it does seem to me that\u2019s the conversation we should be having. I think the case is actually quite strong, and it\u2019s quite strong right now.  Why MBS.  Well, people have already mentioned several of the reasons.  The spreads are obviously one of those reasons and the fact that we\u2019re getting to the point where there may be some impact on market functioning of further Treasury purchases.  But I would also point to something that has been reflected in a number of your comments over the past couple of days\u2014that the suboptimal, subexpected performance of the economy over the past few years, with the very disappointing trajectory of the recovery, seems in retrospect pretty obviously tied to debt overhang, the Reinhart\u2013Rogoff kinds of factors that people have been citing for a while now.  And the housing sector is clearly at the center of all of that.  As Betsy was indicating, in other areas there\u2019s been a good bit of working down of debt.  Housing is what has continued to be dysfunctional.  That\u2019s where the debt is; that\u2019s where the failure of markets to clear is.  Again, as Betsy was just mentioning, that\u2019s where prices and quantities don\u2019t quite seem to be in the kind of equilibrium that we would expect.  So I think action we would take in the housing area with MBS purchases would not only be efficacious in the way that all large-scale, long-term asset purchases would be, but could also have a particular impact on the major impediment to the kind of recovery that would more resemble past recoveries out of recessions. I know that a lot of people, myself included, are frustrated with the failure of the political branches of government to take appropriate action to provide more clarity and stimulus for the economy.  But this is an instance in which there could be some synergy.  Some modest steps have already been taken to make refinancing more readily available.  If we were to act by announcing a large-scale asset purchase, I think both the public sector and the banks themselves would see more opportunities again to leverage what we were doing to have a greater economic impact. So the case is actually quite strong, and thus I\u2019m very much tempted to join President Evans in dissenting from alternative B, because I think alternative B does not accurately reflect the state of the economy.  Having said that, I believe there are a couple of reasons not to move right now.  One is the point that Narayana and John made earlier, and which Bill Dudley has made, I think, on a number of occasions in the past several meetings\u2014that we do need to get the communications and the framework and the sense that we think in terms of multiple meetings (and not just one meeting) more clear than we have.  And there are some reasonable grounds for arguing that an action by us today, whether it was A1 or A2, would once again be difficult for markets and other observers fully to comprehend.  They wouldn\u2019t quite know how it was that we were making decisions and why. Second, and someone alluded to this earlier also, I do think that the risks of a significant adverse event in Europe are as high as they have been since May 2010.  The risks are not just significant\u2014whatever the adjective above \u201csignificant\u201d is, that\u2019s the one we should have", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  \u201cVery significant.\u201d PARTICIPANT.  \u201cHumongous", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you.  First, I want to talk a little bit about the \u201csignificant\u201d point.  I feel really strongly that it has to stay in, because if you take it out, you\u2019re basically saying that you now think the downside risks are insignificant.  Does anyone around the room think that the downside risks are now insignificant.  I agree that we were surprised by the reaction of the markets last time to putting \u201csignificant\u201d in.  But it\u2019s very different keeping it in as opposed to taking it out.  If you\u2019re taking it out, you\u2019re trying to make a statement that you think the risks have really declined significantly.   I just don\u2019t see any evidence that the downside risks have declined significantly\u2014in fact, at all.  The European situation is probably at the worst place that it\u2019s been.  It\u2019s also completely inconsistent with what we\u2019re saying in the SEPs.  If you look at the SEP results, uncertainty about GDP growth went up compared with June; downside risks to GDP growth are the same as June\u201411 versus 6.  If you look at the risks to unemployment, they have gone up since June.  So how do you reconcile taking \u201csignificant\u201d out here, and then you have all of this uncertainty that you\u2019re going to discuss in the SEP results.  I just don\u2019t see the benefit.  I think it could be really embarrassing for the Committee if you take it out, Europe falls apart, and people go back and say, \u201cWell, what were you thinking.  Didn\u2019t you see what was going on in Europe as you were going into the meeting.\u201d Now, in terms of other things, obviously I\u2019m going to support alternative B.  I prefer to stick with the date rather than move to the quarters.  I understand the argument for the quarters, but we\u2019re on a trajectory here where we\u2019re hoping\u2014at least some of us around the table are hoping\u2014that by January we can arrive at a framework where we actually specify triggers or thresholds.  And in that case, the thresholds will be the key thing, and then the date will follow from that.  I don\u2019t think it really makes sense to go to quarters and then go to this new thing\u2014you\u2019re going in a zigzag pattern.  So I don\u2019t really oppose the idea of the quarters conceptually, but I don\u2019t think it really fits in, in terms of the trajectory of how we might like to move through the meetings", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, all, for your comments.  We are still at a difficult juncture.  There is certainly a case, I think, for further action.  The best way to say it is that our medium-term forecasts have inflation below target or at target and unemployment well above what most people consider to be the long-run equilibrium level.  And I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward to show that that can\u2019t be a feature of optimal policy.  That said\u2014well, there are responses to that, of course.  One can argue that the actions that we could take at this stage are ineffective or have unintended side effects.  So it\u2019s a complex debate and one that\u2019s been going on in this room for some time. For this meeting, I would propose that we not take new action, and that\u2019s based more on trying to get our framework clarified than on a clear decision on the need for or efficacy of further action.  We took important actions at each of the past two meetings.  Both of these, I think, were well grounded in theory.  But President Kocherlakota and others have a point that there was some ad hoc feel to those actions, and probably their impact is somewhat less than it could have been if they had been better cast in the context of a framework and better prepared for the markets. For those who are advocating more expansionary policy, I would just point out that our toolkit is not infinite, that our capacity is not infinite, and that we\u2019ll be more effective if we can use the ammunition we have left in the most focused way.  And the best way to do that is to have a strong communication program that will help people understand what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re doing it, and help guide expectations in both the markets and the public. So I would propose not to take new action today.  I leave aside the question of whether new action is justified.  I see a case for new action.  But whatever we choose to do, it\u2019ll be more effective if we are able to provide a more coherent framework for communication.  Again, I think that we should not introduce yet additional policy actions today.  We have several things already in play.  Therefore, I do support alternative B, which most people around the table were comfortable with.  I think the majority of people in that statement were in favor of retaining the \u201cthrough mid-2013\u201d language.  Whatever the merits may be of the alternative, there\u2019s a case for waiting until we get to a new communication strategy before making changes, and then we can consider how to incorporate different considerations into that.  So I propose that.  \u201cSignificant\u201d is\u2014I got a very divided response on that.  Bill", " MR. BULLARD.  I would caution against \u201chumongous"], "2011FOMC20111128confcall.txt": [" MR. KAMIN.1  As Brian has discussed, the attempt by European leaders in late October to promote a comprehensive solution to the euro-area financial crisis has largely failed, and the crisis is deepening and threatening to spill over from the European periphery to the core.  In Greece, the government collapsed two weeks ago and was replaced by a temporary caretaker government headed by former ECB Vice President Lucas Papademos.  Greece\u2019s main opposition party has generally signed on to the fiscal reforms Greece has agreed to with the IMF and EU, but in order to repay its creditors and finance its deficit over the coming couple of years, Greece is negotiating a new \u20ac130 billion program with the IMF and EU, and this new loan is contingent on Greece\u2019s private-sector creditors voluntarily writing down the face value of their claims on Greece\u2019s government by 50 percent.  However, the discussions between the Greek government and its private-sector creditors on this debt restructuring have been fractious, putting the new loan package in jeopardy and adding to speculation that Greece may soon default and possibly withdraw from the euro area. If the European leaders had succeeded in putting the financial backstops in place to protect Italy, Spain, and other governments from contagion, the Greek situation would be just a sideshow with limited potential to destabilize broader markets.  However, efforts to strengthen the euro-area financial backstop have been stymied.  The October plan was to leverage the remaining \u20ac270 billion in uncommitted resources of the EFSF with private-sector funds to achieve over \u20ac1 trillion in  1 The materials used by Mr. Kamin are appended to this transcript (appendix 1). capacity.  But with outside investors showing little enthusiasm for this scheme and the EFSF itself having difficulty raising funds, it appears unlikely that the EFSF, by itself, would be able to protect Italy and Spain from a major run on their debt. In the absence of a credible backstop, investor concerns about sovereign default have begun to snowball, as Brian has described.  In Italy, soaring borrowing costs, along with weakening economic conditions and calls for more budget cutting, led to the fall of the Berlusconi government and his replacement by former EU commissioner Mario Monti.  Although this change may bode well for future economic reforms, the political transition has been chaotic and has further roiled financial markets.  Indeed, investors remain uncertain as to whether Italy\u2019s new government of unelected technocrats will be able to muster the political support needed to push through unpopular fiscal austerity measures. And now, alarmingly, market pressures are spreading to core euro-area economies, with France\u2019s and Belgium\u2019s borrowing costs rising, Belgium\u2019s credit rating being downgraded by S&P, and, as Brian mentioned, even Germany having a poor bond auction last week.  Calls are mounting for the ECB to stem the panic by taking a more active role in funding vulnerable governments, possibly by channeling funds either through the IMF or the EFSF.  An alternative approach, involving greater fiscal centralization and the issuance of Eurobonds guaranteed by the euro area as a whole, is also mustering support, including most recently by the European Commission.  However, Germany and the ECB so far have continued to resist these options, increasing investor concerns that the financial crisis could deepen while European officials watch either helplessly or passively from the sidelines.  Moreover, the recently announced plans for the recapitalization of Europe\u2019s banks are believed likely to promote deleveraging and contribute to a credit crunch that will further weigh on Europe\u2019s economy. Turning to the economic outlook, our October forecast for only slight declines in euro-area GDP this quarter and next now seems optimistic.  Retail sales, industrial production, and new orders fell sharply in September; October surveys show continued declines in business and consumer confidence; and the euro-area composite PMI in October and November has fallen well into contractionary territory.  Given the escalating financial stresses, the troubled banking sectors, and ever-increasing calls for fiscal consolidation, we are currently anticipating that the recession in Europe will be more severe and prolonged. These conditions present a significant risk to U.S. financial systems and to the U.S. economic recovery.  With this in mind, the FOMC might want to consider changes to its liquidity swap lines with foreign central banks aimed at easing funding stresses and bolstering investor confidence.  Accordingly, as detailed in the proposed resolution circulated earlier this morning, we are seeking your approval of a six-month extension of the existing dollar swap lines through February 1, 2013, along with the establishment of additional swap arrangements with our central bank counterparties to support the provision by the Federal Reserve of liquidity in Canadian dollars, British pounds, Japanese yen, euros, and Swiss francs.  These foreign currency swap lines are not needed today, but they would be established as part of a broad network of bilateral swap lines intended to address potential future funding needs and to support market confidence by demonstrating cooperation among the major central banks.  Before the initial drawing on these new swap lines, the Foreign Currency Subcommittee would consult with the Federal Open Market Committee if possible under the circumstances then prevailing.  These new arrangements would also expire in February 2013. Both for the dollar swap lines and for the new lines providing other currencies, we propose that the Chairman establish the interest rates by agreement with the foreign central banks and in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee.  He would keep the Federal Open Market Committee informed, and the rates agreed would be consistent with the principles discussed with the Committee.  In this regard, we have reached tentative agreement with our foreign counterparties on a reduction in the cost of borrowing through the existing dollar swap lines of 50 basis points\u2014from 100 basis points over OIS to 50 basis points over OIS.  The reduction in borrowing costs should help reduce banks\u2019 aversion to using the swap facilities, thus strengthening their liquidity positions and reducing the pace of their deleveraging and associated impacts on credit conditions.  These actions, if approved, will be described in a coordinated announcement by the Federal Reserve and our five central bank counterparties\u2014the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Canada.  That announcement is likely to be made Wednesday morning.  That concludes my remarks", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It\u2019s not disclosed.  We could inquire, of course, but our counterparty is the central bank.  And they\u2019re the ones who are responsible to us", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m torn on this issue.  There is a code among central bankers.  I think Vice Chairman Dudley is correct from the standpoint that we\u2019re most effective when we work together.  We\u2019ve learned this from our own history.  I think we have a communications problem here, which I would ask you to address.  You made the correct point that we\u2014and you used the term \u201cwe\u201d\u2014are trying and have been making efforts to normalize rates.  And you\u2019re right\u2014Dallas and one other Bank have been rather aggressive on that front.  I\u2019m very worried about what\u2019s going on in Europe.  It\u2019s a political mare\u2019s nest, and the sovereignty issues are horrifically vexing.  I\u2019m also quite concerned about where the European banking system is\u2014the false stress tests that they put together before and now the real effort\u2014I know we\u2019re having an influence on them\u2014to make sure that they get their capital ratios organized.  Obviously, we know how they\u2019re doing it.  They\u2019d like to issue tier 1 equity, but that\u2019s not easy in these markets.  They\u2019re cutting back, therefore, on their risk-weighted assets and on their lending.  The Commerzbank call to the analysts this past week had very clear instructions and a revelation that they\u2019ve instructed their bankers to lend only to Poland and to Germany, and they\u2019re just cutting out other activities.  So we know some deleveraging is taking place.  Shriveling up of other credits, including dollar-based credits, is happening, and I think Vice Chairman Dudley is absolutely correct.  We all understand this.  It comes back to bite us on the rear end. What I\u2019m most concerned about here is the reaction to our lending to others at less than we lend to the highest-quality community, regional, and large banks in this country.  I wouldn\u2019t understate or underestimate how that might reverberate negatively against us.  I\u2019m a little concerned that we\u2019ve agreed to OIS plus 50 basis points.  If it were OIS plus whatever equates to 75, assuming OIS is 12, I\u2019d be more comfortable.  And that just gives me pause.  I don\u2019t think that just issuing this statement, which does not refer to the OIS plus 50, is problematic.  I do think it becomes problematic in terms of the execution and, again, in the minds of those on both sides of the aisle in the Congress.  There is a tradeoff here.  We do want to normalize rates, but we\u2019ve been presented with a very difficult circumstance that poses risk to us.  And I think we need to noodle that through before we make a decision.  Again, I\u2019ve been probably the most aggressive advocate for normalizing rates.  We\u2019ve pulled back from that recently, but just because of the circumstance.  I don\u2019t think we could easily answer those questions unless we deal with our highest-quality domestic credits.  I think it would be very, very difficult, particularly with the community banks, the regional banks\u2014which are high quality, from which we demand substantial and measurable collateral to make a loan\u2014to say that we\u2019re trusting other institutions.  Again, they\u2019re our brethren.  These are central bankers.  We understand the code. But it presents a huge communications problem, and the question is whether we should take action or just try to deal with it through communications.  And I\u2019d leave that up to the rest of the group to decide, but I wouldn\u2019t understate it.  I think the optics are not very good, particularly when we\u2019re under the microscope\u2014or certainly the magnifying glass.  That\u2019s my biggest concern, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m torn on whether or not I can support this, unless we have a clear understanding of how we\u2019re going to deal with that.  It might be through a press conference on your part.  It might be through other efforts to communicate.  But it\u2019s a hard sell.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On expected usage, I understood Vice Chairman Dudley to argue that usage would probably be up substantially because of the deleveraging in Europe, but I understood you to say that you didn\u2019t think these swap lines would be used that much.  So I think we should try to get some clarity on where we really think usage is likely to go.  I\u2019d also say that under the 100 basis point policy, we didn\u2019t seem to have any trouble getting people to use the facility during 2008 and 2009.  So I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s changed this time.  And I\u2019m a little concerned that at 50 basis points, if the dollar funding remains in the money, then you could end up with the addicted banking system in Europe that wants the dollar funding over the long term, and then we don\u2019t really get out of the swap lines the way we did in 2008 and 2009.  The 100 basis point policy was very useful from that point of view, and you got those banks to seek other sources during that time. As far as the signaling goes, I disagree with the way the other central banks see this.  They want to send a united signal, which I would interpret mostly as they want to get the Fed on board, but I don\u2019t think that this is the way to go in this crisis.  What you\u2019ve got are governments that are counting on central banks to bail them out, and you need to keep pressure on those governments to get the fiscal austerity that they need.  They\u2019ve borrowed way too much, and they\u2019re certainly hoping that central banks will somehow bail them out, so we\u2019re sending exactly the wrong signal.  I can believe other central banks want to do it, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good way to manage a crisis.  Again, I would prefer to review swap lines at regular junctures, not at particular moments of intense turmoil in markets.  That\u2019s a better way to go, and then you get rid of the signaling problem of a panic mode and a signal that the central banks are all coming to the governments\u2019 rescue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I\u2019m going to respectfully recommend that we don\u2019t pursue this course for many of the same reasons that President Bullard expressed.  I can understand how funding can suddenly dry up for a financial institution, as in the case of MF Global.  I can understand how funding pressures can emerge for a broad set of market participants.  But I don\u2019t see us in a situation where there\u2019s a deficiency of liquidity supply.  Just look at our balance sheet.  There\u2019s plenty of liquidity in dollars available in the marketplace.  What I think we see is a deficiency in the willingness to lend to particular institutions, largely for the reason that they\u2019re viewed as riskier.  What we know both from public sources and from supervisory sources suggests that that reluctance in the marketplace lines up pretty well with differences in the riskiness of those counterparties.  I don\u2019t see any evidence that it doesn\u2019t reflect a difference in concerns about creditworthiness.  And so this doesn\u2019t seem like a matter of market efficiency or functioning.  It seems as though intervention here would be distributional.  More broadly, I think some financial strains are consistent with a well-functioning set of markets.  MF Global is a great example of that.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a case where we should have intervened, and I don\u2019t see MF Global\u2019s demise as a failure of market functioning, apart from the fraud they committed relative to the use of funds.  More central bank credit is always going to be seen as positive for markets.  So I don\u2019t think the fact that markets would view this as positive is an argument for doing this.  A farm bill is always positive for agricultural land prices, but it\u2019s not an argument that you want an infinitely large farm bill. My predecessors have a long history of dissenting on foreign exchange operations.  The reasoning is that, like other central bank credit actions, they essentially involve fiscal policy, they\u2019re distributional, and they\u2019re essentially end runs around constitutional appropriations policy, and that entangles us in political controversy.  I think that, as I said, applies to virtually all central bank credit extension.  That\u2019s why we\u2019ve declared, as a Committee, our intention to get back to a Treasury-only balance sheet as soon as we can.  And I\u2019d argue that this dynamic has contributed to the hostile political environment that we currently face.  More broadly, an expansion of central bank swap lines is going to send the message of an implied backstop commitment that I think is too large.  It\u2019s counterproductive.  It will contribute to financial instability rather than reduce it. So I remain respectfully opposed to additional swap arrangements to support our provision of liquidity in foreign currencies.  I agree with those who highlight the political risk that would be associated, I think, with offering these central bank swaps on terms that are more advantageous than those we offer at the discount window to domestic borrowers.  I would urge you, Mr. Chairman, if we go down this road, to consult with your colleagues and ask them if a straight 75 basis points would be acceptable, rather than 50 over OIS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, the way the statement is written, there\u2019s no mention of the rate we would charge.  It does say that \u201cthe Chairman shall establish the rates on the swap arrangements by mutual agreement with the foreign central banks and in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee,\u201d and that you\u2019ll keep us informed.  I assume that paragraph applies to both sets of swap arrangements\u2014the dollar swaps and the foreign currency swaps\u2014is that correct", " MR. ENGLISH.  Yes, that\u2019s right", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, technically, you\u2019re agreeing to delegate it to me, in consultation with the Foreign Currency Subcommittee.  But I\u2019m informing you that it would be my intention, along with the other five central banks, to agree to a rate of 50 basis points plus OIS", " MR. FISHER.  Well, again, I\u2019m worried about putting you in an uncomfortable position.  There is a principle here that I\u2019m worried about as well, and then there is the reactive aspect of this, which I\u2019m concerned about.  If I may just put my cards on the table, in answer to Governor Duke\u2019s question, I think it would be a mistake to cut the rate to domestic banks to 50 basis points and do it simultaneously.  I believe we would then panic the markets.  So, Governor Duke, I agree with you.  I think it would send a bad signal.  I wouldn\u2019t close that door, depending on what happens in terms of economic developments.  Where I come down personally is that we should not have agreed to 50 basis points.  We should have agreed to 75 or 12 basis points less than that, wherever OIS is.  But this is a dilemma because, again, we don\u2019t want to undermine our standing, and certainly we don\u2019t want to undermine your standing.  So I\u2019m just being utterly frank here.  I think that\u2019s the biggest problem with this proposal\u2014the 50 basis points.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. DANKER.  That\u2019s correct.  It\u2019s the resolution.

Or the ECB is going to hire Brian away because he has the answer and he\u2019s not sharing it", " MR. PLOSSER.  To follow up on Richard\u2019s question, one of the things that strikes me about the dealer survey questions\u2014particularly this one about how is GDP going to be affected by the European play-out\u2014is it\u2019s not clear to me that the dealers themselves are the right population to be surveying on the answer to that question.  There are other groups, other economists, and other types of groups in the financial markets and outside the financial markets that might have something useful to say in response to that.  The question I\u2019m asking is:  Have you given any thought to expanding the survey to different groups that might be a little outside the dealer network, if you will, to broaden the perspective on the types of answers you might get to at least some of these questions", " MR. PALUMBO.  The conceptual differences are fairly small.  Both of the measures are missing lots of important pieces of data.  The flow of funds accounts are missing a tremendous amount of data for the third quarter.  The quarterly variation in the flow of funds saving rate is even more residually derived than the national income accounts saving rate.  We don\u2019t take very much signal from the quarterly pattern at all.  Nonetheless, as you suggested, over longer periods of time, they move generally together.  They tell similar rather than dissimilar stories.  I haven\u2019t looked at a detailed parsing from the most recent data to see what was going on in the third quarter. One of the things that is conceptually different in the saving rates is the way that the accounting of liabilities on the household balance sheet works into flow of funds saving versus the expenditure-based measure in the NIPAs.  It\u2019s possible that is still driving a wedge that\u2019s making the flow of funds saving rate higher.  Essentially, households are still having a large amount of debt charged off their balance sheets; that could show up as a saving concept in the flow of funds accounts, but not necessarily so in the national income accounts.  But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a third-quarter source of difference.  In general, we don\u2019t put a lot of signal content on the quarterly frequency flow of funds data, especially on these early vintages where there\u2019s a lot of missing information. It\u2019s something that I generally pay only a little bit of attention to", " MR. BULLARD.  Part of the story that you told is that some of the inflation developments earlier this year were temporary.  You said that some of the energy and food price movements fed through to the core prices.  In the past, we have always told the story that when those kinds of prices go up, they do not feed through to the core, and so this is not something that we need to worry about.  Is this a change in the view of the staff about the pass-through to core inflation when energy prices, in particular, go up", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Some of the news we\u2019ve received over the past several weeks has been pretty good.  Consumers are buying motor vehicles and other goods at a faster clip than we had expected, and consumer sentiment moved up off its recent lows.  In addition, the unemployment rate dropped and new claims for unemployment insurance have been edging down.  However, I\u2019m not convinced that we\u2019ve actually seen much sustainable improvement in these two areas, and that\u2019s what I\u2019d like to focus on right now.  I should also say that we\u2019ve seen zero improvement in the housing market, but I won\u2019t discuss that today.  A lot has been said about Europe, and I won\u2019t add anything to that discussion even though the situation is critical to our country\u2019s growth prospects. In the labor market, all indicators other than the unemployment rate are pointing to only modest, if any, improvement.  Job gains have been disappointing.  Unemployment insurance claims are only creeping lower, and hiring plans are pretty stagnant this year.  Even the unemployment rate declines don\u2019t look that great.  Of the \u00be percentage point decline in the unemployment rate over the past year, about \u00bc percentage point of it may be due to people dropping out of the labor force when their unemployment benefits run out, and probably some others are dropping out due to discouragement. The rest of the improvement is pretty paltry for a recovery.  Two and a half years into the recovery, there are still 24 million underemployed people.  I think the decline in the unemployment rate exaggerates the improvement in underlying conditions, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the rate moves back up a bit in December.  At the current pace of improvement, it will be years before the labor market can be described in positive terms, and by that time we might well have started to see a loss of skills and networks among the unemployed and underemployed, which could cause a long-run erosion of the economy\u2019s productive potential, an outcome that we should all want to avoid. Turning to consumer spending, while I\u2019d like to believe the surprisingly strong consumption recently is going to continue, it just doesn\u2019t seem sustainable given all the other information.  Real disposable personal income declined in both the second and third quarters\u2014not much recovery there.  The latest data on services from the quarterly services survey were also pretty weak in the third quarter.  Consumer sentiment is still below the levels from last spring.  While it\u2019s encouraging that sentiment has moved up from the panicky levels of the late summer, it still remains at levels we usually see in recessions, and frankly, if the extremely low numbers we saw in September were associated with households\u2019 concerns about policymaker paralysis, the current debate about the payroll tax cut and the failure of the supercommittee is not likely to help. One piece of the sentiment data that seems especially downbeat is households\u2019 expectations of their own income expectations.  These figures have not budged from their lows at the 2008 trough.  If households don\u2019t think incomes are going to improve, it\u2019s hard to see why they would begin to spend in earnest.  Moreover, many households are still adapting to the $7 trillion decline in household wealth, particularly the sharp drop in real estate wealth that occurred over the past several years.  Consumers probably are still trying to rebuild their nest eggs and replenish their retirement accounts, and that will likely continue to curtail their spending in the quarters ahead.  With all of this pessimism weighing on households, I don\u2019t believe that the recent sharp drop in the saving rate, which now stands at 3\u00bd percent, is really sustainable.  Rather, I expect household spending to be pretty unimpressive going forward.  I\u2019ll stop there", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The recent data suggest that the moderate economic recovery remains on track.  While the European situation poses a risk to this outlook, I see no evidence to suggest that the Fed should act preemptively to stave off financial market effects of the European situation beyond what we have done already with the central bank swap lines.  Over the past several years, we have developed many tools that we can use in the event of a financial crisis, and we must be vigilant and be willing to act as needed.  My best guess is that Europe will muddle through somehow and avoid a full-fledged financial crisis, whose probability I think remains low.  Europeans are likely to do what is necessary to avoid a total collapse. We continue to provide a large amount of monetary accommodation to support the U.S. economy as it continues to recover.  I see no evidence that trying to push interest rates even lower will have much effect on what ails this economy or help resolve the European crisis.  Trying to tweak our policy for little or no effect seems to risk our credibility.  I also fear that our continued efforts to tweak monetary policy, or to signal that we might do so, can add to the kind of policy uncertainty that so many of us have heard from our business contacts is inhibiting both investment and hiring. Thus, I can support taking no further action at this time, as in Alternative B.  I am not confident that inflation expectations will remain anchored over the medium term if we keep trying to increase the degree of accommodation.  In my view, we have taken some significant risks with future inflation.  Unless we are extremely mindful of those risks, and are prepared to act\u2014perhaps aggressively and at the appropriate time and in the face of what may prove to be substantial political pressure\u2014inflation may prove to be a serious problem at some point down the road. Regarding language, I am okay with Alternative B language as in the Tealbook.  But my hope is that if we are able to go ahead and publish our policy paths in the SEP in January\u2014as we will discuss later this afternoon\u2014that we will be able to extricate ourselves from this calendar date issue as forward guidance in the statement.  As you know, I dissented in August in part because of the use of the calendar date.  I didn\u2019t favor this type of communication, since it makes it less clear that our policy is conditioned on the outlook for the economy.  Making the policy path projection part of the projection exercise is a good way to emphasize the ties between economic conditions and policy.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  At our last meeting, President Williams suggested that he found it useful to consider the recommendations of simple policy rules when thinking about the appropriate formulation of policy, and in the past, the Chairman, Governor Yellen, and I have expressed similar views.  Along those lines, if you look at Tealbook, Book B, it looks at the implications of a variety of simple policy rules for the path of accommodation.  This is a line of rule-based analysis, and I continue to appreciate these kinds of analyses. But I thought that the treatment of the LSAPs in the analysis in the Tealbook was a little incomplete.  In this regard, I would say two things.  First, I think the current level of accommodation should include the best estimates of the accommodation that the FOMC is providing from its large-scale asset holdings.  Second, the prescribed evolution of accommodation should include the use of asset purchases, especially since asset purchases are explicitly being considered in Alternative A. I believe that the best current Board staff estimate of the impact of our current asset holdings is that they are providing accommodation equivalent to a reduction of 2\u00bd percentage points in the fed funds rate.  With that estimate in mind, when I look at the graphs on page 7 of Tealbook, Book B, it seems that if I use these simple rules, policy is currently overly accommodative and, hence, Alternatives A and B would both be inconsistent with the recommendations of these rules.  This is all based on the Tealbook\u2019s estimate of potential.  Like President Bullard, I would be inclined to use a slightly lower estimate of potential.  Actually, President Bullard used a much lower estimate of potential. With that said, I do see two reasons for caution.  First, the recommendations of these rules seem highly inconsistent with the optimal control simulations on page 3 of Tealbook, Book B.  The unconstrained optimal policy simulation implies that the Committee should be buying something like $3 trillion of long-term assets over the coming year.  Second, several members of the Committee have suggested the impact of monetary policy is not being destroyed but being blunted by current household credit conditions.  This impairment of monetary policy, as long as it\u2019s not being reduced to zero, would lead one to use more accommodation. At this stage, these reasons for caution strike me as somewhat imprecise, and I would find it useful at future meetings to have staff work that fleshed them out in some way.  Is there a way to put some kind of fudge factor in the policy rules that make them accord better with the unconstrained optimal control solution.  In particular, we often talk about the Taylor 1999 rule as being a very accommodative rule.  Is there a way to make it line up better with the optimal control solution so that we can use it for guidance in thinking about how policy should evolve, but also have the level match up at least a little bit closer to what we have in the unconstrained optimal control solution.  Second, what is the staff\u2019s best estimate of the current real impact of monetary accommodation on the economy.  How is our level of monetary accommodation translating through to the real economy.  These are tough questions, but I think it would be helpful for us to move them from the realm of the qualitative into the realm of the quantitative as best we can. Despite this current imprecision of these counterbalancing considerations, I am willing to go along with Alternative B at this meeting.  However, I would strongly prefer that we use the version of paragraph 5 that was in the last statement for a couple of related reasons.  One is related to what President Lockhart said in his statement.  We should avoid using any language beyond the updating of economic conditions.  We don\u2019t want to be indicating anything that would disrupt markets in any fashion.  That\u2019s the practical consideration. More philosophically, the new version of paragraph 5 implies that we see financial market conditions as being an important factor in the making of monetary policy over and above the information that those conditions provide about the economic outlook, and I think this is problematic.  Our mandate is not to make sure financial markets function well.  Our mandate is to promote price stability and maximum employment, and obviously financial market developments matter, but only insofar as they affect the outlook for prices and employment.  For both of those reasons\u2014not rocking the boat and for this more philosophical consideration\u2014I would favor Alternative B but with the old paragraph 5.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support Alternative B.  Recent economic data show that at best a moderate recovery is in train.  Inflation is trending downward, heading below 2 percent.  We are currently falling short on both parts of our dual mandate, and I expect, as many others, that this will remain true for many years to come.  In these circumstances, the current highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate. Nonetheless, as others have mentioned, the expected outcomes are highly unsatisfactory.  By my own calculations of a super long-run outlook that extends the Tealbook\u2019s long-run outlook [laughter], we will not achieve either of our mandated goals until early 2018, which is a decade from the beginning of the recession.  One way to improve on this dismal prospect is to upgrade our communication of our long-run goals and principles and of our policy projections.  This should help further anchor expectations and enhance the effectiveness of our policy actions.  I will return to this topic in our discussion later today. As a final note, I want to return to a topic that President Fisher mentioned earlier today, and he and I have mentioned in previous meetings, and that is that I am particularly concerned about the possibility that the ongoing crisis in Europe could blow up with little advance notice.  In that case, the market reaction, including massive safe-haven flows to the U.S., could drive the entire Treasury yield curve down to very low levels, potentially making our current unconventional tools of forward guidance and Treasury purchases largely irrelevant.  As I have said before, we need to plan now about the options we have if such a scenario materializes and not wait until we are in the teeth of a full-blown crisis.  Thank you", " MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor more accommodation substantially for the reasons stated by President Evans, and more specifically, I\u2019d be inclined toward paragraph 3 of Alternative A.  But, I\u2019m not going to advocate for paragraph 3 of Alternative A for two reasons.  One, obviously, we haven\u2019t laid the foundation for additional MBS purchases right now either internally or externally.  Two, maybe less obviously, I do have some sympathy for those who have observed that the efficacy of various monetary policy instruments in the absence of good fiscal policy is more constrained and more limited than we\u2019d like it to be.  It would be useful to maximize the effects of MBS purchases and consequent reductions in mortgage rates, and that can best be done through further pursuit of a variety of initiatives, which now, for the first time in a while, seem to be under consideration more seriously both by the Administration and by the Congress.  If we followed Bill\u2019s advice and proselytized for the adoption of some of these additional measures by the political branches of government, action we took to lower mortgage rates would be augmented or amplified in the economy itself. Having said that, I do look forward to a vigorous debate in January on some of the issues that have been latent in what many of you have said.  I do think the question of efficacy is a serious one.  I honestly don\u2019t understand the inflation concern.  So I\u2019d be interested in hearing more about that in January. With respect to specific language, for the same reasons stated by Betsy, I wouldn\u2019t favor a change in paragraph 4 right now.  Get our communications a little bit straighter.  On paragraph 5, I\u2019m sympathetic to the point Narayana made and for an additional reason, Mr. Chairman.  When we do change the language, I think people ask themselves, \u201cWhat do we think has changed in the world.\u201d  I don\u2019t assess the risks from Europe any greater now than I did at the last meeting.  I assessed them quite high at the last meeting, but no greater right now, and so if someone were to infer from this that somehow there\u2019s some greater concern we have, that wouldn\u2019t be quite reflective at least of my own view.  Thank you", " MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before I turn to my preference for policy options, I note some discomfort in the way the labor market is characterized in each of the three policy alternatives.  Even in Alternatives A and B, the wording is that indicators point to some improvement in overall labor market conditions, and that is too strong.  As I said in my earlier statement, although I am encouraged by the decline in the unemployment rate, I think it may be temporary, and I am not particularly impressed with the direction of other labor market indicators.  I share some of President Kocherlakota\u2019s concerns about an undue focus on the unemployment rate to the detriment of other labor market indicators and look forward to further discussions in this area. I will turn now to my policy preferences.  Over the past year, observing the sluggish pace of recovery and the disappointing progress we are making toward fulfilling our statutory mandate, I have wondered whether the problem is that monetary policy is currently powerless to address the weaknesses in the labor market or whether we have just been setting monetary policy too tight, either because we underestimated how much monetary stimulus was needed this year or because we are being overly cautious with our nontraditional tools. Regarding the first point, it seems to me that monetary policy surely is not as powerful as it has been in the past.  While I have confidence in our ability to affect longer-term interest rates, the inability of already very low rates to stimulate housing demand suggests this usually important transmission channel depends on factors that monetary policy is not equipped to address.  Monetary policy cannot, for example, address the various obstacles and frictions that are limiting access to mortgage credit among creditworthy borrowers to refinancing, facilitate deeds in lieu and short sales when remaining in the property is not viable, or improve the incentives of mortgage servicers.  Around this table, we have not been able to directly address the ongoing problems in the U.S. housing market, which continues to impede our economic recovery.  But this doesn\u2019t mean that monetary policy is completely powerless.  For me, this has been one of the fundamental challenges I have struggled with during my time on this Committee. It occurred to me last night that monetary policy transmission might be analogous to the problem of the plumbing of the kitchen sink.  When you look into your sink in the morning and see that the remnants of last night\u2019s dinner have adhered to the drain, do you roll up your sleeves and pull out the spaghetti and pieces of garlic bread, or do you blast the water from the faucet harder to force it all down.  [Laughter]  The critics of more monetary policy accommodation are probably people who don\u2019t advocate the water-blast-from-above approach, but believe the clogging culprits need to be removed first, one at a time, and, they might add, not by them.  [Laughter]  The advocates of more monetary policy accommodation believe one big blast from the water faucet might just do the trick, and if that blast is powerful enough, it will sweep away all of the stubborn debris clinging to the sides. What we have learned since the crisis began is that it is pretty challenging to pull out all of the flotsam and jetsam from the drain.  You think you\u2019ve got it all, and, lo and behold, it is not just spaghetti and scraps of garlic bread, but also lettuce and coffee grinds.  You may think it is just last night\u2019s feast, but when you are pulling it all out, you realize it is also the debris of dinners past.  Maybe the blast of water or several repeated blasts in succession could do the trick instead.  This is a homespun way of saying that there is a considerable amount of evidence that we may be setting monetary policy too tight as we rely on others to clear the impediments to growth. For instance, the simple policy rule prescriptions in the Tealbook are concluding that, unconstrained, we should lower the fed funds rate a couple of percentage points, and the optimal policy prescriptions are showing something similar.  Moreover, these simple prescriptions are for interest rates that have their usual stimulative effects on the economy.  In the current environment, when some transmission channels are clogged, you could argue that we should be doing even more than these exercises imply. I am becoming persuaded that we need to be moving monetary policy in a more accommodative direction in order to make more rapid progress in meeting our statutory mandate.  In other words, we need to turn up the water stream.  Even if we can\u2019t get all conceivable benefits of the traditional transmission channels, further expansionary monetary policy could still have a positive effect on equity prices and household wealth.  Lower interest rates might stimulate business investment, and dollar depreciation would tend to increase the competitiveness of domestically produced goods and services. For this meeting, I support Alternative B.  It remains uncertain how much progress fiscal policy makers and housing policy makers are making in clearing the drain.  But the pace of these efforts may be increasing.  We need additional information to get a better sense of if and when we should turn up the water again.  I am also concerned that a move from us that we haven\u2019t clearly telegraphed and explained might be interpreted by markets as a sign that we think the situation in Europe is, well, going down the drain\u2014a signal we should not send right now.  Thank you", " VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Little split between the hawks and doves there", " MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  You made reference to the first item being, in your view, a quasi-constitutional item.  Was that to distinguish it from the second item", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, appreciate the work of the communications subcommittee on this issue.  I generally favor increased transparency, but I continue to harbor considerable doubts about whether this is the best way, or even a good way, to provide increased transparency with respect to the likely future path of policy.  I am referring to the SEP enhancements here. I tend to agree with many of the points raised by President Fisher on this matter in his memo to the Committee, and let me outline just a couple of my thoughts.  While the SEP is fine as far as it goes, when it comes to policy projections, it may be advisable for the Committee to provide a more detailed assessment of the state of the economy.  This could be done through a U.S. version of a quarterly inflation report as is done, for instance, in the United Kingdom.  Such a report would give a view of the many elements in the economy and the many factors that come into making a forecast of future economic conditions.  Such a forecast should be based upon the market perception of future policy at that juncture.  This is what other major central banks do.  It seems sensible to me.  I see this as an appropriate way to give a complete, technical assessment of the economy for public use at regular intervals.  I say technical assessment in the sense that you have a lot of data there, a lot of numbers on charts, as opposed to speeches and interviews that we do, which are more qualitative. One advantage of such an approach is that the Committee could describe the future path of policy on many dimensions, as opposed to only the funds rate path.  In particular, balance sheet policy could be described in full.  This seems particularly important during the next few years as the policy rate seems likely to remain near zero.  This is an important element of what we\u2019re doing here, putting more emphasis back onto the funds rate just at the time when we can\u2019t really do very much with the funds rate and we are looking for other policy levers to move.  That aspect of it is a bit counterproductive. One element of President Fisher\u2019s memo is that the policy rate forecast, as envisioned, may not provide a reliable guide as to what the Committee will actually end up doing.  For the countries that have tried this type of policy projection approach, my understanding from the available literature is that the path of future short-term interest rates has been no more forecastable under the regime of releasing policy projections than it was under the regime of not releasing policy projections. This causes me to wonder about the efficacy of this effort.  We have a chart that we sometimes pass around in St. Louis.  It is a chart of the Riksbank policy path.  I should have brought it with me, but I didn\u2019t, but I\u2019ll tell you what it is.  It shows the actual policy path as it has moved, and it shows all of the projections at each date, which look like branches on a vine, because they are all going off at orthogonal directions from where the actual policy path went.  When you use data like that and then try to figure out whether this is really enhanced transparency about short-term interest rates in Sweden, the answer comes back from the econometrics that it hasn\u2019t really enhanced or changed anything, because the policy path keeps changing in response to economic events, which is exactly what you would like it to do.  Given these considerations, my preference would be to consider this matter further before going ahead.  Again, I am not against transparency, I am just not sure that this is a good way to go about providing more transparency. On the statement of longer-run goals, I support this statement as written, and we should go ahead and adopt it at the January meeting.  This statement seems very much like the type of statement that might appear in Chairman Bernanke\u2019s textbook, which I regard as very much reflective of the conventional wisdom or the mainstream view on these matters.  In this regard, I do not expect the statement to be particularly controversial.  I know that the Chairman has been working on adopting an appropriately flexible inflation targeting framework for some time, and I think the adoption of this statement of longer-run goals would be an important step toward establishing flexible inflation targeting in the U.S.  The U.S. is a laggard on this issue within the central banking community internationally. One of the questions is:  Should this be a living, breathing document.  I would take the constitutional view on this, which is that you would want to make changes only with the broadest possible support of the Committee.  I would do that only once a year and with very strong support, and change it only at that type of juncture and not be tinkering with it continually.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I just have one comment.  This morning some argued that financial problems should make us less willing to ease, because they didn\u2019t think it would have much of an impact.  Others argued that financial problems should make us more willing to ease, because we should offset the problems.  Either way, if financial market conditions impact the degree of accommodation that we are going to choose, then we should acknowledge it.  This is to be transparent publicly.  I would prefer financial stability be included, like it was in the earlier draft.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I would also like to acknowledge the work of the subcommittee.  This is a difficult task, and I recognize that dealing with me was a big part of the difficulty.  [Laughter] I would like to start at the statement of longer-run goals and policy strategy.  With the addition of the paragraph on employment that President Lacker would not have written, I can accept the statement.  And I agree that if it\u2019s adopted, it should be a living, breathing document, subject to revision, but that is with recognition of the effort that it took to wrestle this beast to the ground the first time.  [Laughter]  I will not object to its adoption, not in a straw poll, not in an official vote, and not in a speech.  That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that I think it is a great idea.  I still don\u2019t see that it adds real clarity to the public understanding of our framework.  It will be viewed, for all the intricate language of the compromise, as an inflation target at about the level the public thought it would be. The subcommittee has carefully drafted this statement to eliminate most objections, including mine.  And as heroic as that effort has been, in doing so, I fear they have created a document that is subject to varying interpretations, both in this room and on the outside.  And I agree with Governor Tarullo that agreement on the statement doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to agreement on principles.  So if I don\u2019t think it adds information, I do think that it has the potential to stir up political heat on all sides.  But as I said, I won\u2019t object. As to the inclusion of the fed funds projections in the SEP, I have similar feelings.  I don\u2019t object to their inclusion.  They will confirm, for all to see, that there is definitely a range of views about the appropriate path of the fed funds rate, and they will provide some clarity about the degree of that variation.  But for those who think that publishing these forecasts might signal that rates will be low for a long time, what I see from the sample actually goes in the other direction.  Moreover, I think they will limit the effectiveness of any potential statement, such as the one that was offered in option A.  It is hard to make a credible statement that the Committee now anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate at least through the end of 2014, when in fact only four respondents expected the first increase to come later than 2014.  Similarly, the projections for unemployment and inflation in those time frames may not line up.  As a matter of fact, they did not line up between the language in option A and the sample in the December 2 memo.  I am all for transparency in communication.  But as we add new information, it becomes nearly impossible to take it back, even if it no longer conveys the message that we want to send. The additional attention to the SEP that has been achieved in the press conferences is a positive step.  But I would caution that as we add more communication devices, such as the statements on exit and long-run strategy, and as we add more information to the SEP and to the meeting statement, that we need to pay attention to the consistency of the message across all of these Committee communications, or we will confuse the public or, worse, lose the credibility of those communications.  It is bad enough when we create cacophony as we each speak in our individual capacities about our different viewpoints.  It will be an even bigger problem if our Committee communications themselves send conflicting signals.  Thus, depending on the contour of the SEP projections that we publish, I can envision scenarios where we might be limited in the forward guidance that we can credibly include in the meeting statement. I would urge caution, as President Pianalto and President Kocherlakota have suggested, that before we move forward with publishing everyone\u2019s individual projections, we also look at the potential for crafting a Committee projection.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman"]}
