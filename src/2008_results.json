{"2008FOMC20080109confcall.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Yes, Dave.  So there is a lot written about nonlinearity and macroeconomic dynamics.  There are these regime-switching econometric models characterizing real data.  There is the 0.3 thing\u2014I think it is 0.3\u2014 that people talk about regarding the unemployment rate:  It doesn\u2019t go up by more than 0.3 without going up by a ton.  You guys are surely aware of those econometric properties or those methods of characterizing the data, and while your econometric models may be strictly linear in some sense, what you give us is your best judgment, right.  Am I to take your forecast as reflecting the probabilities of nonlinear dynamics or not.  If it doesn\u2019t, are nonlinear dynamics something you believe in, that you think we should internally adjust your forecast with, or not", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with both the concerns that you expressed and the analysis that you offered.  Based on the data we now have in hand, I support a 50 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate in the near future.  I think a very good case can be made for moving down 25 basis points today, and it would be my preference.  According to what Bill Dudley said, markets apparently do attach some probability to a move of that magnitude before the January meeting.  I could also support a 50 basis point move today, but I am concerned that it might be taken as a sign of panic by the Committee and somehow wrongly indicate that we have inside information showing that things are even worse than markets already think or, alternatively, be seen as an overreaction to the employment report.  But if we don\u2019t move today, I do think we need to take decisive action in January, and I hope you will give a strong signal that we will do so in your speech.  I agree with the staff\u2019s assessment that the outlook for economic growth has weakened since December, and I also see the downside risks to the forecast as having increased since then.  We have revised down our 2008 forecast also because of the sharp increase in energy prices and the deterioration we have seen in financial conditions just since December.  It is good that conditions in money markets have improved somewhat, but equity prices have fallen very substantially\u2014I guess around 6 percent since our last meeting.  Credit spreads are up, and borrowing rates for many borrowers are higher in spite of a decline in Treasury yields.  I also find the labor market developments worrisome.  I try not to put too much weight on any single monthly observation, but I find it entirely believable and consistent with everything else we are seeing that we have entered, at best, a period of slow employment growth.  It is something that we have been expecting all along.  It helps to resolve some of the puzzles we have been discussing about why labor markets have been so strong relative to goods markets. It is true that consumer spending has been amazingly robust so far, but I find it unimaginable that it can continue when slow growth in disposable income is added to everything else that is weighing on households, particularly rising energy prices, accelerating declines in house prices, and falling stock prices.  It seems to me that, with the stagnant or contracting labor market, the odds of a recession\u2014and, as you argued, a potentially very nasty one\u2014have risen.  I am also very worried about the possibility of a credit crunch if higher job losses begins to make lenders pull back credit.  It is true that on the inflation front the recent news hasn\u2019t been particularly good.  It certainly is true that there are upside risks.  But I do take comfort from the fact that inflation compensation has remained well behaved and that we already have slack in the labor market and more seems likely to develop. I support a significant rate cut not only because of the downgrade to the economic forecast since December but also because I think the stance of policy even now with the actions we have taken\u2014I agree with you\u2014is still within the neutral range.  Given current prospects and the asymmetric nature of the risks, particularly the high tail risk associated with the credit crunch, I believe that policy should be clearly accommodative.  So having revised down my forecast, I would support a significant funds rate cut as a way to catch up with where policy should be", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I recognize that the risks on the economy are elevated.  I have recognized it for some time.  My concern is that the risks are elevated as dangerously, if you will, for inflation as for the slowdown.  We have at this point a situation in which we have revised up our inflation numbers and yet that is after we have cut 100 basis points, which we have not seen the full effect of.  Those rate cuts are in process now, and they are not going to address the housing issue, given its circumstances, and they are going to work slowly through the rest of the economy as we move forward.  We have revised up in our estimates the fourth-quarter real GDP numbers, and I think that is important to note even though I know our risks overall are elevated for growth, given some of the data coming in.  Job growth came in disappointingly.  It did so also in September, and it was revised up significantly after that.  I don\u2019t know if the numbers will be revised up, but I would like to go cautiously, recognizing that they have been revised up in the past.  I think there are tail risks.  There is an important risk of the economy slowing, perhaps going into recession.  I think that there is an elevated risk of the inflation numbers continuing to creep up as they have over the past several months.  If these inflation numbers continue to rise as we decrease interest rates, there is a very serious cost that will have a very significant detrimental effect on the economy in the long run, which we need to keep sight of. My concern\u2014as others have expressed, but it is a very serious concern on my part\u2014is that we say we can reverse the policy position or raise interest rates later.  But it is extremely difficult, and understandably so, because the earlier actions will still be having an effect while the economy shows a slowing.  When it starts to pick up, we won\u2019t be sure, just as now, whether we really are going to accelerate and whether the economy is going to pick up.  So we delay in reversing those actions, understandably so.  So that is why I want to be very cautious about coming down with our interest rates because we will be very cautious going up with our interest rates on the other side of that. I am very pleased that you have not put an actual proposal on an action today.  I would be very uncomfortable with that.  I think we need to have a full discussion with more information before we commit to any kind of interest rate moves at our month-end meeting.  I understand the risk, but I think it requires a lot of analysis as we look both at inflation and what that may mean to us if it\u2019s rising and at the real danger of a recession.  Thank you"], "2008FOMC20080121confcall.txt": [" MR. POOLE.  Thank you.  I accept all the discussion about the risks of recession and the risks of the financial markets.  All those are relevant to what we do next week.  But the key issue for me is what we get by acting now rather than nine days from now.  I note that the stock market has declined, despite the fact that the market has built in the expectation of 50 basis points, with some probability of 75.  If we do today pretty much exactly what is expected of us nine days from now, it is not clear that we are going to accomplish a lot that is positive, and I believe that we run the risk of upsetting things in a couple of ways. First of all, whenever we act between meetings, we set a precedent, and what this will do in the future, maybe even in the very near future, is that whenever we have a stock market decline of this magnitude, if we get some more of them\u2014and we could easily\u2014or whenever we have some bad economic data\u2014and we certainly could have some\u2014there will be speculation in the market as to whether the FOMC is going to jump in with an intermeeting policy action.  So we have to be confident in our own minds that we are not setting a precedent that we will live to regret. Second, this action will not be viewed in the marketplace as anything other than a direct response to the stock market.  I understand the comments about the other strains in the financial markets.  Although the thing that we have most commonly pointed to, and it has occasioned the most market discussion, has to do with the behavior of the LIBOR rate, LIBOR seems to have settled down.  It is trading below fed funds, and the further out you go in the future, the lower is LIBOR.  So it seems to me that that situation has largely returned to normal. So before I am willing to support, I need to hear compelling arguments as to what we gain from acting today rather than nine days from now and what the risks of acting today are.  I think there are downside risks in acting today rather than nine days from now, and to me that needs to be the focus of our discussion.  I agree that the economy is weak, and I agree that there are a lot of problems in the financial markets.  Thank you", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, of course, I support your recommendation.  I think it is the right thing to do.  Even with this move, I think we are likely to have to move significantly further.  It is hard to know how much more and what the optimal timing of further actions is going to be.  It is very important, in the context of a move, that we signal\u2014as your statement does\u2014that we will do what is necessary to provide a meaningful degree of accommodation, a meaningful degree of insurance against a more adverse set of financial and economic outcomes.  If we were to wait until the meeting, we would be taking just too much risk.  I think it would be irresponsible to take the risk that we would see a substantial further deterioration in confidence and in market prices, which would do substantially more damage to market functioning than we have witnessed so far. I think you said on January 9, Mr. Chairman, that the risk we have to worry about is not so much that we have simply a mild, short, and shallow recession but that we face a much deeper and more protracted economic downturn with much more damage to the financial system that would ultimately require, if it were to happen, much more action in terms of monetary policy with perhaps more-adverse consequences for future incentives and for the economy as a whole.  I think that that is a risk we have to worry about.  It is very hard to judge what the probability of that risk is.  None of us can know for sure what the next nine days would be like if we did not act.  None of us can know the probability that the market will work through this stuff on its own.  It is a matter of judgment, and I think your judgment on this is right.  I strongly support it.  I just would say again, although I don\u2019t think any of us can support this with hard, quantifiable evidence, that conditions are so fragile and so tenuous now that by not acting tomorrow morning we would be taking an irresponsible risk that we would see substantial further erosion in confidence.  That would put us in a much weaker position to mitigate these risks going forward", "   MR. LACKER.  I can support a 75 basis point cut in the funds rate this month, Mr. Chairman.  I had been thinking of something less.  The data last week were clearly negative, clearly disappointing, so I could support 75 at our meeting.  Like President Poole, I have real reservations about moving now rather than waiting until our meeting.  I think that in the situation this is inevitably going to be viewed as a reaction to the falloff in equity markets.  Interpreters are going to take into account that we could have moved last week, after the slew of real data\u2014Thursday afternoon, for example, after the housing report\u2014or we could have waited until our meeting ten days from now.  I worry about the message that this tactical choice sends about our strategy.  I worry about what it says about what drives our reaction function and what we believe that we can control or offset.  I share President Poole\u2019s concern that what we gain isn\u2019t clear.  I can appreciate the possibility of financial market fragility, but I don\u2019t see the level of the funds rate as real closely tied to conditions of fragility.  I don\u2019t think a funds rate change is going to save the monolines.  I don\u2019t think it is going to save financial institutions from the monolines.  So I have reservations and would rather wait until our meeting.  But I can support moving 75", " MR. FISHER.  There are some pros to moving now, and there are some cons.  Clearly, one of the pros is that we would have the element of surprise.  It is a holiday.  We have the benefit of some knowledge of new data and what has happened in the market starting in Asia and rolling through Europe, which Bill walked us through.  I do have some concerns, however, Mr. Chairman.  I know you know what they are.  I articulated them in a speech in Philadelphia, and we discussed these a bit.  I have basically the same concerns that President Poole, President Hoenig, and President Lacker have.  The question is, What do we get for this.  What expectations do we build in for future decisionmaking.  My biggest concern, however, is that I have yet to see convincing evidence that we are seeing movement on the inflation front.  If we were to cut rates to this level today, as of now, in terms of the headline CPI and PCE numbers, we would have a negative real rate of interest, and I don\u2019t understand quite fully what the consequence of that would be.  The projections in the Greenbook are just that\u2014they are projections.  They can be right, and they can be wrong, as thoughtfully as they are constructed.   Unlike President Rosengren, although I am only about 30 percent of my way through my CEO calls in preparing for the meeting, I don\u2019t hear a widespread expectation of recession.  I do hear a concern about slowing down, and we have seen that in all of the indexes that I like to talk about in the meetings from the credit card payables, delinquencies in payments, the Baltic index, et cetera, et cetera.  But the words \u201csevere recession\u201d I have yet to hear from the lips of anybody but those in the housing business, and for them, it gets more severe with each passing moment.  So I am not convinced of the economic case, and yet I can see where there are some benefits to moving now.  The real question is, What do we do next.  If the markets react by blowing us off, does that mean that we will be expected to move aggressively at the next meeting and then the next meeting after that.  Or as President Poole has mentioned, does that mean that we will have to have some more interim meetings.  I am a little worried about being trapped by this concept of being behind the curve.  There is a fine line between being behind the curve and what may be an overreaction.  But, Mr. Chairman, I don\u2019t have a vote at this meeting, and I would just ask you to consider the arguments that have been put forward by Mr. Poole, Mr. Hoenig, and Mr. Lacker and the ones that I have just given.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think we are in a very, very difficult position.  I don\u2019t want to reiterate many of the points that have been already made.  I certainly appreciate and am sympathetic with the point of view that markets are fragile.  Market expectations, in terms of what they seem to be building into the path of the economy going forward, seem to me extraordinarily volatile and pessimistic.  I am very concerned about that.  That bothers me.  But at the same time I also am very concerned about the expectations this sets.  While the U.S. market was closed today, we have heard what has gone on in the foreign markets.  I am very concerned that we are going to be interpreted as reacting to the stock market declines, and I think my concern is that lowering the funds rate terribly rapidly with intermeeting moves is going to set up a dynamic that is going to drive us into more and more of these and drive the markets into expecting more and more from us.  It is not clear to me that the fragility that exists in the market in fact will be solved by rapid cuts in the funds rate.  I share President Lacker\u2019s concern that it is not clear that lowering the funds rate is a solution to the problem of the monoline insurance companies or others. Having said that, I nonetheless would certainly be supportive of a very dramatic action at our regularly scheduled meeting.  Frankly, I am very torn right now as to whether to support this intermeeting cut.  My gut instinct tells me \u201cno,\u201d but I also have to recognize the views shared by a number of our colleagues who are concerned about the fragility of the markets and the signals we are sending.  If we decide to go through with this today, I think that we will find ourselves in a very tough position at our next meeting as to how much more will be expected from us and at what rate.  President Poole or President Lacker pointed out that it was partly our aggressive rate-cutting in some periods that helped foster some of this, and we may be setting ourselves up for another fall.  I share Governor Mishkin\u2019s view that if, in fact, we are to get aggressive, we also have to be willing to take it back when times change.  I understand that view, and I can live with it, except the history of this institution is that we haven\u2019t been very aggressive in doing that or demonstrating our ability to do that. So I have a lot of concern and caution about this move.  I think it is going to affect expectations of us as we move forward, and I think we need to be realistic about what it is we are buying with this.  I am not sure we are buying very much.  Maybe we will calm some market nerves.  If so, that would be great, and it may be of short-run benefit, at least over the next nine days.  I worry what it is going to mean for us over the next nine months as we move forward.  So those are my views.  I am not a voting member at this meeting, but I just wanted to share those views.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. POOLE.  Yes, if I may.  I have a question of fact first and then a further question.  Do we know at all what the ECB and the Bank of England are considering given that the markets were open and they are the ones who have seen markets and know what is going on there today", " MR. POOLE.  I think the market\u2019s view, then, is going to be that we are responding to the markets abroad.  Our own market has been closed.  I understand the futures market, but there are a lot of people who don\u2019t understand the futures market or know of its existence.  So I think that the investor on the street, if you will, will be saying that we are responding to foreign markets.  In terms of the problems in the financial markets, the monoline insurers and others, that is a problem of the capital of those firms.  Cutting the funds rate does nothing to build up capital for those firms.  I still come back to the point that I do not see a convincing argument for acting today rather than nine days from now, and I see lots of downside to acting today because of the problems that it is going to create for us in the future.  I really believe that, and I just don\u2019t see the argument for acting today", "  MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.  I think it is very clear that the numbers have weakened significantly from where we were before.  In some sense, the pieces are starting to fall in the puzzle, and we were uncertain before\u2014we are still uncertain\u2014but there is a lot more evidence of significant downside risks.  So things, unfortunately, have been clarified on that side.  We have also gotten some data that are not particularly welcome on inflation, which suggests that there are still some challenges there, both in headline and in core.  At the last meeting, a lot of us focused a lot on the potential for a regime switch.  We haven\u2019t really talked about that much here, but I think this evidence suggests that there is much higher probability of a fairly rapid shift from a growth state to a recession state.  That is being reflected in the financial market, so it is just a different way of saying similar things that the Chairman, Governor Kohn, and others of you have said. I think Bill would also say that the credit default swap spreads on a number of the financial institutions have been going up, even as some of the liquidity issues have been coming down.  There are very strong concerns about significant losses coming down the line\u2014concerns not only about the monolines but also, as the Chairman said, about losses just because of the problems in the consumer sector\u2014increasing delinquencies in a variety of areas, not just in subprime mortgages.  That is going to put a lot of stress on bank balance sheets.  Even though the banks have been nimble in bringing in a lot of capital, they have also had astonishingly large losses.  If they continue to have these losses going forward, they just will not be able to churn out the funding that is necessary to keep an economy growing certainly at anything that is close to potential, probably nothing that is close to a positive rate of growth. So it seems that it is sensible to buy some insurance and buy it through taking a bold, decisive action now.  The question, of course, is whether we do that now or whether we do that in nine days.  People have talked about the tradeoff that we have between the value of acting now and averting the possibility of very negative outcomes over the next nine days and some concern about developing a bad expectations dynamic and problems of people thinking that we are responding to the equity markets in and of themselves, not what the equity markets are signaling about the real economy.  But I think things are different now than they were earlier in the month, when I was not very supportive of moving at that time.  First, we now have more data in a variety of areas, and we have the concerns about the monolines.  We have a more substantive basis on which to move, so it doesn\u2019t look as though we are responding to just one particular thing; the pieces are there together.  Second, there is a much clearer foundation from the Chairman\u2019s testimony and speech, in which he made it very clear that we would be thinking about and seriously contemplating bold action.  So now there is a foundation for this.  This is not just coming out of the blue or coming out of some rumors in the market.  I think that is a very different situation from the one we had before.  Third, I think it is actually beneficial that we have the meeting coming up in nine days.  That gives us an opportunity to refine the message fairly quickly if we feel we need to and to take further actions if we need to.  So I come out, on balance, thinking that the risks are too high not to act now.  I acknowledge some of those downside risks, but I see that there are very strong benefits to acting now. But I do hear some of the concerns that people have raised, and I had some of these concerns also, particularly with respect to inflation.  I might suggest that in the last paragraph in the proposed FOMC statement, which I am fine with, perhaps a way of showing a little more concern about some of the inflation issues is in the second half of that sentence, where you say \u201cbut it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully,\u201d to say instead \u201cbut it will be necessary to continue to monitor those inflation developments carefully.\u201d  That might buy us a little there because the statement is a fairly large move away from what we have said before.  This phrase is about the only one that we have repeated from before, and I think strengthening that phrase may be beneficial.  But I am supportive of the statement as is.  Perhaps it could be improved with a little strengthening there to address some of the concerns, but I am very much supportive of the overall 75 basis point move now.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. HOENIG.  It is, I guess, helpful, but let me ask this.  A point that was made earlier, when you said that we are moving to where we need to be, in terms of the real rate, taking total inflation, we are moving to real rates that are negative.  I am fairly confident that, while this is a bold move, it is also a precursor to another move a week or nine days from now, which would put us in an even more negative position, when we are projecting the economy to be slowing and when, in fact, total inflation is above\u2014currently at least, year over year\u20144 percent.  I understand the concerns about the markets and people\u2019s uncertainty.  But we are taking these very dramatic actions right now, more perhaps than what we need when you say \u201cwhere interest rates need to be.\u201d  If we were to go 50 basis points now and 50 basis points at the next meeting, we are still moving down, but we are taking it in a more measured form.  I am not convinced that isn\u2019t a better way of going, given where we are with the economy and given where we are with our projections looking forward.  That is really something that maybe you could at least address\u2014the negative levels of the real rate in terms of your comfort going forward and where we need to be", " MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I hear you, and I appreciate your concerns.  I do understand that there is a psychology in the market that is having its effect.  I think if we make this statement as strong as we can about the need to watch inflation, and if we understand among ourselves that, as we take this action today and the follow-up actions that I am certain we are going to take, we will watch these inflation numbers, including broad asset values\u2014I know we don\u2019t prick bubbles and that sort of thing, but watching these broad asset-price movements\u2014that would be very, very important, at least to think about.  I do not wish to be dissenting on this, as troubled as I am about it.  I do understand the psychology of it.  For those reasons, I am willing to go along with this.  But I worry about our ability to deal with reversal as this takes place, especially given where our projections for growth are right now and my concern that we already have inflation above 4 percent.  So I defer to you at this point.  I would vote for it because I think the psychology of the marketplace is, of course, rather fragile, and I will leave it at that.  Thank you"], "2008FOMC20080130meeting.txt": [" MS. MOSSER.  May I add one factual comment to that", " MR. LACKER.  Foreign banks were $19 billion out of $20 billion at the first auction; $18 billion out of $20 billion at the second auction; and a declining fraction thereafter, President Fisher", " MR. LOCKHART.  Bill, in your remarks, you devoted quite a bit of time to the deteriorating situation in the monolines, the implication being that the risks they may have affect the whole system.  In the normal course, do we have direct contact with them to get any insight beyond what we get through analysts and rating agencies.  I think you said that they are not terribly transparent in terms of asset class and individual securities as to what they really hold.  Have we had any direct dialogue just to inform ourselves as to what the real situation is", " MR. DUDLEY.  Another thing that is not very well known is what their assets consist of.  We have rating buckets, but we don\u2019t know what those ratings actually apply to.  We don\u2019t know who they have reinsurance with.  Some people think that they\u2019re reinsuring each other to an extent or they have reinsurance with subsidiaries that they own so that the insurance is not at arm\u2019s length.  So there\u2019s quite a bit of cloudiness about what their true condition is", " MR. LOCKHART.  Yes.  My staff is suspicious that the employment numbers have actually been weaker than the data have shown.  They have been focusing on the birth-death model and the payroll survey is based upon assumptions related to the birth of construction firms, which logically would not be creating jobs in this environment.  Do you have a take on that issue", " MR. POOLE.  The reason I raise the question is that it seems to me very important that we have some interpretation as to what we make of all this and what we want the market to make of all this.  In particular, let\u2019s say the observation that the projections or the risks are weighted to the downside.  You might get some people saying, \u201cWell, if we get some employment reports or others that in fact come in weaker than anticipated, that means that the Committee is on the edge of pulling the trigger to respond to it.\u201d  That might be a possible message that people would take from this.  If that is not the message that we want to convey, then we had better be very careful how we talk about these", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Nellie, I have two questions for you.  One is on exhibit 9, where you forecast in the middle right panel the rate of increase in defaults on subprime ARMs.  If you compare that with your reset rate estimate and your house-price assumption or the house-price assumption in the market, I wonder whether that looks a little optimistic.  Can you just say a little more about why, under the baseline scenario, given what has happened to house prices already and what is ahead, you wouldn\u2019t think that would be substantially greater", " MS. LIANG.  We have revised this forecast up quite a bit since the first time we looked at this maybe in June or August, in part because of lower house prices and tighter credit conditions.  The model requires as inputs defaults and prepayments, and the prepayment rates have been fairly slow but not zero.  The 2006 vintage, as it approaches its first reset, has been that 20 to 25 percent are able to prepay.  They are able to find something.  So we don\u2019t want to assume that none of them will be able to.  The model would approach both of those, so that is the positive side.  The downside is that our forecast, with the national house-price assumption of roughly minus 7 over the forecast period, does imply house-price declines on the order of minus 20 percent a year or more in California, Florida, and some other places.  That does leave the loan-to-value ratio, as I mentioned, pretty high for many borrowers.  We have never had this kind of episode, so we have to make a judgment about the point at which subprime borrowers walk away from their houses.  The current assumption is that at about 140 percent we just say you are out; but it has to be almost an assumption that, if by then you hadn\u2019t defaulted, we would push you out.  So there is an upside.  On the other hand, saying 40 percent of the outstanding stock will default over two years sounds like a big projection as well.  So we tried to balance.  There are risks on both sides, for sure", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have three questions.  Let me go to Brian first.  This is more of a comment.  In your description of the forecast, you referred several times to the notion that there might be slack in the economy in 2010 based on these numbers.  I guess my reaction to that, while I was kind of skeptical, I am not sure exactly how you infer that from what was reported.  Certainly, that seems to be true in the Greenbook forecast, but trend growth seems to be as good as or better than it was in the last projection.  In 2010, inflation\u2014true\u2014is a little higher.  The unemployment rate may be a 0.1 or 0.2 percentage point higher.  But unless you infer something about what people thought the NAIRU might be, I don\u2019t know how you would necessarily infer that the reason inflation went up in these forecasts was that there was slack in the economy in these projections.  So I just wanted to caution about the language we use in how we describe what we see here without necessarily inferring something about whether, in any individual person\u2019s forecast, there may or may not have been slack.  In mine, there wasn\u2019t in 2010, but I don\u2019t see that necessarily follows from what these numbers look like.  That was my only observation here", " MR. PLOSSER.  I have two other questions that I would like to pose.  One is the change in the Greenbook\u2019s assumption about the increase in potential GDP.  In particular, I am curious because what it essentially does, it seems, is to build in a significant amount of slack or output gap in 2009 and 2010 that didn\u2019t exist in the last Greenbook.  I am inferring that part of the reason the more-aggressive easing in the policy assumption does not have any effect on inflation to speak of is that it is offset by the increased gap that you have built in.  So I would like a little more explanation about the justification for building in a greater gap or a higher potential.  But I am also curious to know, if you hadn\u2019t done that, what your forecast for growth and inflation would look like in, let\u2019s say, 2009 and 2010.  Could you give some guesstimate of how that might have affected it", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  The path of the gap would have been to a first approximation unchanged going forward.  Some of the greater resource utilization now and going forward is a combination of the fact that we haven\u2019t really changed our view on the labor market, aside from once we took on board the new unemployment rate data, but that we did change on the product market.  Going forward, the way it evolves further on, we see the labor market gap opening up a little more and the output gap opening up a little more\u2014that is driven primarily by our sense that the economy in an underlying sense is weaker\u2014and we have made an adjustment for that with the monetary policy assumption.  But it is not quite enough.  We haven\u2019t lowered the funds rate as much as we would have needed to do to totally wipe out that fact and keep resource utilization constant going forward on the product side.  This is a difficult question.  It was a difficult one for us, definitely, going through it because we had many moving parts", " MR. PLOSSER.  My last question is also related to some adjustments that struck me in the panel you talked about where you constructed the revised estimates of r*.  The first item on your list that you talk about was that the equity premium had gone up, and that was a big factor.  So I have a couple of questions.  That was an adjustment factor.  Now, the way I would think about the stock market declining would be primarily having a wealth effect that works its way through consumption\u2014that would be the normal channel.  Yet the Greenbook and this discussion seem to suggest that somehow there was an additional adjustment made because of the rise in the equity premium.  Is that correct or not, or is it just the wealth effect that you are talking about.  Are these separate", " MR. STOCKTON.  Yes", " MR. PLOSSER.  I didn\u2019t understand that this was just primarily the wealth effect or whether you were referring to something different", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I broadly agree with the Greenbook forecast for economic growth this year and with the assessment that the downside risks to that forecast are considerable.  The severe and prolonged housing downturn and financial shock have put the economy at, if not beyond, the brink of recession.  My forecast incorporates fiscal stimulus of the same magnitude as the Greenbook and monetary stimulus that is somewhat larger.  I have assumed a 50 basis point cut at this meeting and an additional 25 basis point cut during the first half.  My forecast shows growth of 1\u00bd percent in 2008, like the Greenbook, but it has a more pronounced acceleration in 2009 as the monetary and fiscal stimulus kickstarts the economy.  The unemployment rate edges up this year to 5\u00bc percent before dropping gradually next year toward the natural rate of 4\u00be.  I am especially concerned about the outlook for consumer spending.  The combined hits to equity and housing wealth will extract a considerable toll, and consumer spending will be further depressed by slower growth in disposable income due to weaker employment growth.  Delinquencies and charge-offs on most forms of consumer debt have already risen, and slower job growth seems likely to exacerbate this trend, prompting financial institutions to further tighten credit standards and terms.  In my forecast, such developments reverberate back negatively onto economic activity. Like the Greenbook, I downgraded my economic outlook substantially since our last in-person meeting.  The December employment report was probably the single most shocking piece of real side news prompting this revision.  But knowing that it is unwise to put too much weight on any single piece of data, I have been examining the question of whether that report was more signal or noise.  The drop in initial UI claims to relatively low levels in recent weeks makes such an assessment important.  Because the behavior of both series may have been affected by seasonal factors near year-end, it seems worthwhile to examine a broad range of data bearing on the labor market.  My conclusion is that the labor market has indeed been weakening since mid-2007, and the extent of weakening, while relatively modest thus far, is quite typical of patterns seen when the economy is tipping into recession. Independent evidence of a weakening in the labor market comes from the household survey.  Even when adjusted for definitional and measurement differences from the payroll survey, the household survey shows a fairly smooth trend of declining employment growth during 2007.  The drop in payroll employment in December helped bring the establishment data into closer alignment with the household employment data.  In the payroll survey, the slowdown is concentrated in construction and finance.  In the household series, higher unemployment is actually widespread across sectors.  The household survey also contains other signs of a weakening job market:  a 25 percent increase in the unemployment rate for job losers, which accounts for the lion\u2019s share of the overall increase in aggregate unemployment; an increase in the number of newly unemployed job losers, which can be thought of as a broader measure than UI claims of inflows into unemployment; and an increase of 5 to 10 percent in the estimated expected completed duration of an unemployment spell, suggesting a reduced pace of outflows from unemployment.  The labor force participation rate of men and women of age 16 to 24 years has also fallen notably in recent months.  Labor force participation rates for this group have been edging down since the last recession, but the decline accelerated in 2007, and historically this group is among the first to respond to weakening labor market conditions. Data from the JOLTS survey, which we discussed in the Q&A round, confirm the weakness revealed elsewhere.  The job openings, or vacancy, rate is down, consistent with the reduced pace of outflows from unemployment, as reflected in continuing UI claims and unemployment durations, and layoffs and discharges are up sharply.  Other data cited in the Greenbook, Part 2, such as net hiring plans for Manpower, and NFIB and survey measures of job availability and unemployment expectations further corroborate a slowdown.  With the aggregate unemployment rate now up only 0.6 percentage point off its low, I would describe the deterioration in the labor market thus far as modest, but it is noteworthy that an increase in unemployment of this magnitude, in the space of 12 months, has occurred only twice since 1948 outside of recessions. While my modal scenario contains a near-term slowdown rather than a contraction, it is actually pretty rosy compared with what I fear might happen.  My contacts have turned decidedly negative in the past six to eight weeks, and further financial turmoil may still ensue.  On consumer spending, two large retailers report very subdued expectations going forward following the weak holiday season, which involved a lot of discounting.  On hiring and capital spending, my contacts have emphasized restraint in their plans due to fears that the economy will continue to slow.  A serious issue is whether the tightening of credit standards that is under way  will deepen into a full-blown credit crunch.  The new Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey shows a noticeable tightening in lending standards, and this is confirmed by my contacts.  For example, senior officers of a large bank in my District recently described a variety of new steps they are taking to protect against credit losses.  They are tightening underwriting practices across the entire consumer lending and small business loan portfolio", "  Why that much rather than\u2014 MS. YELLEN.  A larger amount.  I wouldn\u2019t attach too much significance to the precise figure\u2014it\u2019s somewhat more", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my view, economic conditions have deteriorated significantly since our December meeting.  Taken as a whole, the stories that have been relayed to me by my Fourth District business contacts have been downbeat, and several of the contacts are concerned that we may be slipping into a recession.  I\u2019m hearing that consumer spending has declined appreciably since the soft December retail sales numbers were reported.  The CFO of one of the nation\u2019s major department store chains told me last week that her company\u2019s January sales are shaping up to be the worst that they have seen in the past twenty years.  She said that they had already cut back some of their buying plans because of the weak holiday sales, but after seeing the numbers for the first three weeks of January, she is concerned that they have not cut back buying plans enough.  In December I had heard some upbeat assessments about the demand for capital goods and exports, but in January the incoming numbers are softer, and expectations for the coming year are less optimistic than they were just a month ago. I\u2019m also concerned that I\u2019m now detecting the first signals of a credit crunch.  Bankers in my District tell me that they\u2019re finding it much more difficult to issue debt and that they are safeguarding their capital.  I\u2019ve heard several motivations for this, depending on the institution.  Some bankers are simply preparing for further losses.  Some are expecting to have to bring some downgraded assets back onto their balance sheets.  Even those bankers who have adequate capital say that they have become much more disciplined about how they\u2019re going to allocate that capital.  Collectively, the concerns that bankers have expressed to me about capital have convinced me that credit will be less available and more expensive than it has been in quite a while.  Deals that bankers would have done for creditworthy borrowers not long ago are simply not being done today.  Of course, it\u2019s possible that nonbank financial companies will step in and fill the gap, but it is not clear to me that they have the capital and the risk appetites to do so. These developments have had a significant influence on the economic projection that I submitted for today\u2019s meeting.  Like many around the table, I continue to mark down my outlook for residential and nonresidential investment in response to the incoming data and also in response to greater business pessimism about the economic prospects.  In addition, I\u2019ve built in a sharper and more protracted slowing in consumer spending stemming from greater deterioration in the household balance sheet and tighter credit market conditions.  These adjustments have caused me to cut my 2008 GDP growth projection about 1 percentage point since the December meeting, and some of that weakness spills over to the out years.  If credit conditions deteriorate further than I have expected, then my projection would more closely resemble the persistent weakness alternative scenario described in the Greenbook.  But that isn\u2019t my projection for the economy.  Rather, my projection is roughly in line with the Greenbook baseline. My inflation outlook hasn\u2019t changed much from where it was in December\u2014or October, for that matter.  Like the Greenbook, I still project inflation to moderate as commodity prices level off and business activity wanes, but the risks to my inflation outlook have shifted to being weighted to the upside.  The December CPI report was not much improved from the troubling November data, and my business contacts continue to report that commodity prices are being passed downstream.  So I have less conviction in the inflation moderation than I did a month ago.  That said, the downside risks to the economy still dominate my thinking about the outlook today.  I do believe, however, that our policy response to date combined with an additional rate cut tomorrow will allow the economy to regain some momentum as we move into the second half of 2008.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The contours of our forecast are broadly in line with the Greenbook:  Growth well below potential for the first half of this year results in additional slack in labor markets with a consequent reduction in the core rate of inflation over time.  Our forecast returns to full employment by 2010 only if we reduce interest rates more than they are in the Greenbook.  Thus, our baseline forecast assumes that we reduce rates 50 basis points at this meeting followed by additional easing in 2008, which eventually results in core inflation below 2 percent and the unemployment rate settling at our estimate of the NAIRU, somewhat below 5 percent.  But even with this easing, there are significant downside risks to this forecast.  Historically, increases in unemployment in excess of 0.6 percent and forecasts of two or more quarters of real GDP growth below 2 percent have almost always been followed by a recession.  In fact, a variety of probit models looking at the probability of recession in 2008 indicate an uncomfortably high probability of recession, in most cases above 50 percent. Several factors make me concerned that the outlook could be worse than our baseline forecast.  First, we have consistently underestimated weakness in residential investment.  While our forecast assumes a gradual decline in real estate prices, it does not have a substantial feedback between rising unemployment rates causing further downward pressure on real estate prices and the health of financial institutions.  Were we to reach a tipping point of higher unemployment, higher home foreclosures, increased financial duress, and falling housing prices, we would likely have to ease far more than if we were to act preemptively to insure against this risk.  Second, our weak consumption is driven by negative wealth effects induced by weakness in equity markets and modest declines in real estate prices.  However, the heightened discussion of a potential recession could easily result in a larger pullback by consumers.  This would be consistent with the behavior of rates on credit default swaps of major retailers, which have risen significantly since the middle of December.  Third, banks are seeing increasing problems with credit card debt.  Capital One, one of the few concentrated credit card lenders, has had their credit default swap rate rise from less than 100 basis points to more than 400 basis points as investors have become increasingly concerned about the retail sector.  While liquidity concerns have abated, credit risk for financial institutions has grown.  Rates on credit default swaps for our largest banks have been rising since December, despite the announcement of additional equity investments.  In addition, the greatest concern I hear raised by the financial community in Boston is a risk posed by the monoline guarantors.  The movement in equity prices last week as a result of highly speculative statements on resolving the monoline problem indicates a sensitivity of the markets to significant further deterioration in the financial position of the monolines.  Fourth, our model does not capture potential credit crunch problems, although supplementary empirical analysis conducted by the Boston staff suggests that such problems pose additional downside risks to our outlook.  Bank balance sheets continue to expand as banks act in their traditional role of providing liquidity during economic slowdowns.  While the balance sheet constraints are likely to be most acute at our largest institutions, further deterioration in real estate markets is likely to crimp smaller and midsize banks that have significant real estate exposures. Given my concerns that we could soon be or may already be in a recession, I believe the risks around our forecast of core inflation settling below 2 percent are well balanced.  Inflation rates have fallen in previous recessions, and I expect that historical regularity to be maintained if growth is as slow as I expect.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KOHN.  Thank you.  Thank you, Vice Chairman Geithner, for a little less gloom here.  I didn\u2019t expect the bright side from that source.  [Laughter]  Like everyone else around the table, I have revised down my forecast, which looks very much like the Greenbook:  a couple of quarters of very slow growth before a pickup in the second half of the year spurred by monetary and fiscal stimulus.  The collapse of the housing market has been at the center of the slowdown, and most recent information was weaker than expected.  There is no sign in the data anyhow that a bottoming out is in sight.  Sales of new homes have dropped substantially, and that must reflect reduced availability of credit, especially for nonprime and prime nonconforming loans, and perhaps buyers\u2019 expectations of further price declines.  As a consequence, a steep drop in housing construction has made only a small dent in inventories, and those will continue to weigh on activity and prices.  Indeed, house-price declines in the Case-Shiller index picked up late last year.  I think we just got November. It looks increasingly as though other sectors are being affected as well, slowing from the earlier pace of expansion and slowing a little more than expected.  You can see this in broad measures of activity, as President Stern pointed out:  industrial production, purchasing manager surveys, and the employment report.  I think it is also evident in some measures of demand.  Retail sales data suggest a deceleration in consumer spending late in the fourth quarter.  Orders and shipments for capital equipment excluding aircraft picked up in December, but that followed a couple of months of flat or declining data.  A slowdown in consumption and nonhousing investment probably reflects multiplier-accelerator effects of the drop in housing, a decline in housing wealth, and additional caution by both businesses and households given the highly uncertain and possibly weakening economic outlook.  Certainly the anecdotes we\u2019ve heard around the table reinforce the sense of business caution. But like other people, I see the softening outlook and the spread beyond the housing sector as importantly a function of what\u2019s going on in the financial sector and of the potential interaction of that over time with spending.  We have seen improvements in short-term funding markets, in spreads, and in the leveling out of the ABCP (asset-backed commercial paper) outstandings, but investors and lenders seem increasingly concerned about the broader economic weakness and spreading repayment problems, and they are demanding much greater compensation for taking risk in nearly every sector.  To me one of the defining characteristics of the period since, say, mid-November is the spreading out from the housing sector of lending caution to other sectors in the economy.  Nonfinancial corporations have experienced declines in equity prices.  Credit spreads on both investment-grade and junk bonds have increased.  A substantial portion of banks reported tightening terms and standards for C&I loans.  Commercial real estate sector lenders are very concerned about credit.  Spreads on CMBS have risen substantially, and most banks\u2014like  percent\u2014tightened up on commercial real estate credit, and that has to affect spending in that sector over time.  Banks tell us that they are being more cautious about extending consumer credit, as President Yellen noted.  A number of large banks noted a pullback in this area and deterioration in actual and expected loan performance when they announced their earnings over the past few weeks.  There have also been increasing doubts about how robust foreign economies will remain, and this was evident in equity markets around the globe and in rising risk spreads on emerging-market debt.  The staff has marked down its forecast of foreign GDP growth again this round.  The total decrease in projected foreign growth in 2008 since last August has been around \u00bd percentage point, and this is at a time when we are counting on exports to support economic activity. The extraordinary volatility in markets is, I think, indicative of underlying uncertainty, and that underlying uncertainty itself will discourage risk-taking.  The uncertainty and the caution are partly feeding off the continued decline in housing, the still-unknown extent of the losses that will need to be absorbed, and the extent to which those losses are eroding the capital of key institutions like the monolines.  The monoline issue raises questions about who will bear the losses and provides another channel for problems spreading through the credit markets, through losses being felt or credit being taken back on bank balance sheets, making them more cautious, and even more directly, into the muni market through the monolines.  Despite these developments, my forecast for 2008 was revised down only a few tenths from October.  But that is because of the considerable easing of monetary policy undertaken and assumed in my forecast.  I assumed 50 at this meeting, and unlike that piker, President Yellen, I assumed another 50 over the second quarter", " MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  Well, if that\u2019s the optimistic scenario, I think we had all better pray.  But I think it\u2019s a relatively balanced scenario that accurately reflects the risks that are there.  The Greenbook has done a very good job of trying to thread the needle, and I think making a close call for contraction but not actually calling it seems to be very reasonable.  The kinds of insurance discussions in both the Greenbook and the Bluebook and that we\u2019ve had preliminarily here make a lot of sense.  Our models have never been successful at assessing turning points, and that is true whether they are the typical linear models, nonlinear models, probit models, Markov switching models, or other things like that.  We sort of know once we\u2019ve switched, but it\u2019s hard to get that transition.  As many people have suggested, there are an awful lot of indicators that would go into those kinds of models that would flash for contraction being likely.  I think that is correct, but that makes it very difficult for us to assess what will happen.  So I think\u2014as well reflected in the projections\u2014a lot of downside risk is there. I do share some of the optimism about improvements that we\u2019ve seen in the financial markets, but I had that feeling in October and November, and it is hard for me to really understand exactly what drove the subsequent deterioration.  Certainly there were some issues around year-end, but it seems that more issues than just the year-end were driving the fairly significant reversal of improvement that occurred during October through mid-November and the fairly sudden backing up.  So I\u2019m concerned that, since I don\u2019t really understand what happened there, I don\u2019t want to take too much comfort from what has happened so far.  But I also don\u2019t want to dismiss what has happened so far because it\u2019s certainly conceivable that things will move in a more linear way forward for improvement. One issue that I raised both at the last FOMC and in our various conference calls related to some discussions I\u2019ve had with the major credit card companies, which in some sense have a very good feeling for real-time consumption.  I\u2019ve talked with two major credit card companies, and they both had very negative views of what had happened in the very sharp transition consistent with a switch into a contractionary state from the discussions before the October FOMC versus before the December FOMC.  But in the most recent discussions, basically it flattened out.  It\u2019s certainly not recovering, but it is not a continuing downward trend, which at least in my view provides a great deal of comfort because I was very concerned about the nonlinear break to a very low consumption state, and I think there\u2019s less evidence of that.  I won\u2019t go through the specifics of what they said, but basically we\u2019re still seeing challenges and increases in personal bankruptcies, slower repayment rates, more people slipping from 30 days overdue to 60 days overdue, et cetera, et cetera.  But it\u2019s not as dramatic a change, and it\u2019s sort of within the range that they have been anticipating given the data from December.  Also as someone mentioned, and I have forgotten who, these numbers are still at relatively low levels.  Now, the change is in a very bad direction and certainly could move very quickly, and we\u2019ve seen that in other recession scenarios.  But fortunately it seems, at least from this anecdotal evidence, that it isn\u2019t a significant change to the downside, and it\u2019s possible that it could just be re-flattening out.  My concern is still that sort of \u201cslow burn\u201d scenario that I\u2019ve talked about and that Nellie and others have fleshed out on the pressures on banks\u2019 balance sheets.  I liked Nellie\u2019s very politically correct phrase \u201cunplanned asset expansions.\u201d  That\u2019s a very nice way of putting like \u201coh, my goodness, something is suddenly on the balance sheet that we didn\u2019t expect\u201d\u2014SIVs, asset-backed commercial paper, and so forth.  I think people are still waiting for the other shoe to drop, and the other shoe certainly could drop.  There may be things that we haven\u2019t fully anticipated, but we know that there are still leveraged loans that they can\u2019t get off their books, a pipeline that\u2019s still coming on.  We know that many banks are still making mortgage loans and cannot get those off their books\u2014at least the jumbo ones.  It\u2019s conceivable that raising the limits at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae may help in the short run even if there may be costs in the longer run.   A number of other things could suddenly come on the balance sheets.  The example of what happened at SocGen is just another uncertainty that could be out there.  So even at a major financial institution that was generally quite well respected, something like this could happen.  A lot of finger pointing and a lot of uncertainty can come from that, and that\u2019s broadly reflected in the CDS spreads.  About the point that Bill Dudley made in conversation with President Rosengren about being careful to say, well, CDS spreads are lower in Europe and that suggests there\u2019s less risk in Europe\u2014you have to take into account the reaction function by the governments, by the regulators, in terms of recapitalization, as Governor Warsh made reference to.  There are very real challenges, but overall we have seen these CDS spreads go up quite a bit.  So I think that concern about the negative dynamic scenario that people talked about is real, and that\u2019s why it is very important to be thinking about buying insurance. With respect to inflation, certainly some of the numbers have been worrisome.  It is clear that inflation uncertainty is up.  We can disagree as to exactly what that means either about credibility or whether it is just uncertainty or whether it\u2019s upside or downside scenarios, but I think it is up and that is something we should be concerned about.  We should carefully craft our message to take that into account because uncertainty can lead to unanchoring of inflation expectations, and that is something that we certainly don\u2019t want to see.  I don\u2019t see evidence of unanchoring yet, but I do see a potential first step in that direction, which does concern me.  The simple fact that a memo had to be written about what was going on with respect to some of these sharp movements suggests that it\u2019s not clear.  Although the memo was excellent, I think there are elements in it that suggest we don\u2019t fully understand and we need to be very careful about that.  Thank you", "  [Laughter]   MR. MISHKIN.  By the way, if you know my wife, no it wasn\u2019t close.  The second issue is that the potential for weaker house prices, which really is a significant possibility, not only could lead to lower household wealth but, more important, also could reduce the value of collateral for households and as a result mean that the relaxation of credit constraints that collateral affords is no longer there.  That could have major implications in terms of household spending, so it is also a very substantial downside risk to PCE.  The third issue is that we also see that the financial disruption has already gotten worse.  The good news is that there has been improvement on the liquidity front, and I give a lot of credit to the TAF, which was superbly thought out by our staff and has been quite helpful.  However, credit conditions have worsened.  Particularly worrisome\u2014and something that hasn\u2019t been discussed much\u2014is that the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey had substantial tightening.  Usually when you see this kind of tightening, it could indicate that we could have serious negative economic consequences.  Again, that actually makes me very nervous.  Finally, to get even more depressed, there really is potential for a negative feedback loop that has not yet set in.  The financial disruption that we\u2019re seeing right now could then mean a more substantial worsening of the aggregate economy, and that could make the financial markets have even more strain, and you have a problem.  So I really worry about the downside risks and think that they are very substantial and that we should be very concerned about them in thinking about what the appropriate policy stance is. On the issue of inflation, I\u2019m more sanguine.  I see inflation going down to 2 percent by 2009.  The key here is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded\u2014in fact, are grounded at a level that is consistent with my inflation objective, around 2 percent on PCE, which might be different from others\u2019 views, but that\u2019s where I am right now.  In that context, given that inflation expectations plus expectations about future slack in the economy are the primary drivers of inflation dynamics, I actually think that inflation will come down.  It is true that the recent inflation numbers have been very bad; but in thinking about the overall risks, I\u2019m a bit different from the average person on this Committee because I think the risks are balanced and actually somewhat to the downside.  The reason I say this is that I think that inflation expectations are grounded.  At the same time, there is a substantial downside risk in the economy that could really widen slack in the economy, and that would mean that inflation would come down. I don\u2019t want to be too sanguine on the issue of inflation expectations being grounded.  In fact, one thing that I think we have to monitor very closely is what\u2019s happening in terms of inflation expectations, particularly financial markets\u2019 views of inflation expectations.  In a sense, I think of that as the canary in the coal mine.  We are also going to want to look at expectations spreading to professional forecasters and to households, but I think information would come in first in terms of the financial markets for the reason that they put their money on the table and react quickly.  That\u2019s one reason I think it\u2019s very important to look at things like inflation compensation.  But we do need to look at this and do the analysis.  My reading of the analysis that the staff gave and my thinking about the issue is that there is just no evidence that inflation expectations have gone up.  The story is extremely hard to tell to go in that direction.  However, it is very easy to tell a story that inflation uncertainty has gone up a lot, and this is something that President Evans talked about and we talked about at the very beginning of a long day.  In this context, that does concern me, and it really tells me that we have to think about whether we can better anchor inflation expectations.  So I think that this is something that we have to be concerned about, but I do not think that what has happened in inflation compensation is that the canary is dropping dead at this stage.  But we do have to monitor this very, very closely, and again, it\u2019s part of the risk-management strategy that I think we have to pursue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. MISHKIN.  So even though you know I am a fan of\u2014well, let\u2019s put it this way, you said moderation, and I am not a fan of moderation in many dimensions.  But there is a potential cost here that is not articulated, which is that if there is a very aggressive easing and it has an effect on inflation expectations, then the more benign scenario that we have in terms of cost may not be there.  This is one of the reasons that, if we think about a risk-management approach, we have to think about whether we can do it more systematically.  What kind of communications would be attached to it.  Also, what kind of information would we have to watch out for to make sure that we don\u2019t unhinge inflation expectations.  So although I think this is a terrific box and it was very, very useful, there is a bit of a qualm here.  It is also very hard to model the issue of what would happen to expectations.  So I am not complaining in any way about the usefulness of this; but we should have another concern, which is how we would manage inflation expectations if we pursued an approach like this.  Thank you", " MR. MADIGAN.  I think my response is that it is very difficult to say how your communications should or will evolve going forward at this point because of the very substantial uncertainty in the economic outlook, which shows up very clearly in the Committee participants\u2019 economic forecasts.  Presumably, what you say will depend on evolving circumstances.  In terms of the yield curve, again, I think that is difficult.  That will depend on the interaction of market participants\u2019 perception of incoming economic information with their sense of your own policy reactions", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  In both cases.  But the question is whether it is viewed in the context of what is happening to output and inflation, whether they say, \u201cYes, that fits with the historical pattern of stabilization,\u201d or whether, because the recession didn\u2019t emerge, this looks as though it was after the fact an ease in policy that was not warranted.  Then the question is, Do you take it away quickly, or do you take it away slowly", " MR. MISHKIN.  Yes.  I just want to make a comment about what President Geithner said and follow up on President Evans\u2019s question.  One thing that the simulation doesn\u2019t get at is the adverse feedback loop.  It\u2019s just not built into the model.  So the benefits of pursuing a risk-management approach are not as clear as they would be if they were included in the simulation.  However, I would like to focus on President Evans\u2019s issue because I think it really is critical.  He asked about how we might know whether or not we should reverse and talked about things like the yield curve.  But one thing that is important to recognize in this scenario is that I think it is very unusual in terms of this Committee\u2019s past behavior.  But I don\u2019t know.  Don, you are my man who is the ancient mariner here.  Have we ever reversed this quickly in past episodes", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the Greenbook, my projection for the real economy incorporates a sharp decline in the equilibrium real fed funds rate.  Given the large risks facing the real economy, I think we need to take precautions against having a restrictive fed funds rate target.  I think a 50 basis point cut in the target fed funds rate today may be large enough to eliminate that possibility, although there is plenty of uncertainty around that estimate, as we have been discussing.  Based on my analysis, comments from my business contacts, and what I have heard from all of you at this meeting, I feel very comfortable supporting this position today.  The economic environment has been volatile and highly uncertain, and I realize that my outlook could change appreciably in the weeks and months ahead.  I can imagine that my economic projections will evolve in a way that supports even further reductions in the fed funds rate target. At the same time, as I said yesterday, I am concerned about inflation risks and that they may now be elevated.  I can also imagine scenarios that would lead me to want to pursue a more restrictive policy than would be appropriate based on the downside risk to growth alone.  At some point, on the margin, inflation concerns could become my dominant concern.  We know that inflation expectations play a crucial role in determining the inflation outlook.  We have been talking about that.  But, unfortunately, we don\u2019t really know all that much about what it is going to take to unanchor inflation expectations.  It is hard to know for certain how far out on the ice we can skate without needing to worry that the ice has become too thin.  I know that we are bringing our best thinking to bear on this issue by developing diagnostic tools such as the decomposition of inflation compensation into its component parts, as we talked about yesterday and this morning.  I hope that we are going to come to learn that these tools are useful guides to policy, but we just don\u2019t have enough experience with them to know how much confidence to place in their estimates. Yesterday Governor Kohn told us about his conversation with Paul Volcker and that Paul Volcker told him that unfortunately we do have experience of seeing the erosion of public confidence in our ability to meet our price stability objective, and we know from this experience that it makes the attainment of price stability more costly.  But today I support the policy directive expressed in alternative B.  My concerns today are more with the downside risk to economic growth.  Given what I know today, I think it is the right course of action.  I have discovered during the past couple of weeks that I can be very nimble when it comes to the reduction in our fed funds rate target.  If inflation developments require, I want to be just as nimble in the other direction.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN.  He proposed, as I recall, changing two sentences, eliminating the one that referred to downside risks and also changing the last sentence.  I would not want to see the downside risk sentence eliminated; I would change only the very last sentence", " MR. PARKINSON.  Mike is going to address that in his briefing.  I guess I\u2019d prefer to delay and just simply say that I think we can point to aspects of their methodology that look fairly weak so that it wasn\u2019t simply an ex post result but one that should have been foreseen at least to a degree if they had had a stronger methodology ex ante.  Obviously that\u2019s Monday morning quarterbacking, but still you can point to specific things that were weaknesses", " MS. YELLEN.  I wanted to support President Poole\u2019s comment.  I remember very well back at Jackson Hole in 2005 that Raghuram Rajan presented a paper in which he emphasized the misalignment of incentives between investors and managers and the fact that almost everyone down the line right up to the investors themselves should have had incentives here.  I don\u2019t know what they were thinking, but everybody was rewarded for the quantity and not the quality of originations.  He warned us before any of this happened that this could come to no good, and I think he did have some suggestions about compensation practices.  These were not popular suggestions.  So I think this is worth some thought.  I don\u2019t know what the answer is in terms of changing these practices.  Maybe the market will attend to them, but it seems to me that we have had an awful lot of booms and busts in which this type of incentive played a role.  Your presentation and the paper started from the fact that you note the deterioration in underwriting, but we should go one step backward.  I suppose another issue here is what we saw in our supervision and whether we acted appropriately given what we saw.  That raises a number of issues that I won\u2019t go into at the moment but that I think we need to be sensitive to", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a question on exhibit 4, the bottom two panels.  You have the four banks there, and when you look at the capital ratios, it doesn\u2019t look that discouraging.  But when I look at the credit default swaps, it looks a little less encouraging.  So if I put Wachovia on this, I believe Wachovia\u2019s credit default swaps now are up to 166, which would be much higher than your scale is right now.  So it would be interesting actually to add Wachovia to that list.  The second thing is what you take from the fact that the capital ratios don\u2019t look so bad but the credit default swaps and what the markets are looking at indicate that, in the past month and a half, people\u2014despite the capital infusions\u2014are actually exhibiting more concern about the default experiences that might occur", "  MS. HIRTLE.  Mike has described how the rating agencies treated structured-credit products; a closely related issue is how investors used these ratings.  Did investors rely too much on ratings in making their investment decisions.  Did they take false comfort from ratings and not really appreciate the risks they were assuming, leading to excessive growth of the market for subprime structured credit.  As noted in the top panel of exhibit 7, our approach was to examine these questions through the lens of one representative type of institutional investor:  public pension funds.  Public pension funds are an informative example of investor use (and misuse) of credit ratings for several reasons.  First, public pension boards of directors are composed largely of representatives of the employees and retirees covered by the pension plan and have only limited financial expertise in some cases.  Second, survey evidence suggests that a high portion of these funds use credit ratings in their investment guidelines.  Finally, relative to some other investors, many public pension funds provide significant public information about their activities.  While we need to be cautious in generalizing, we believe that practices in the pension fund sector reflect the tensions faced by other institutional investors in making risk assessments and investment decisions.  We examined the investment practices and fund governance of 11 public pension plans.  These plans ranged from the largest fund\u2014CalPERS, with $250 billion in assets\u2014to six much smaller plans with assets of $6 billion to $11 billion.  We used the funds\u2019 2006 comprehensive annual financial reports, which were generally the most recent available, and the funds\u2019 websites to generate our information.  We focused specifically on the funds\u2019 fixed-income segments, since this is the asset class in which structured-credit products would likely be held and for which credit ratings are used. The middle panel lists some key conclusions from this review.  The first is that these funds have developed workable market solutions to address inexperience or lack of financial sophistication among their managers and board members.  These include hiring professional investment managers to make investment decisions on their behalf and, perhaps as significantly, hiring investment consultants to structure asset-allocation strategies, to select investment managers and develop mandates guiding their actions, and to monitor and assess fund performance.  While these funds clearly obtain significant professional advice in managing their investments, our review suggests several ways in which these arrangements could be improved in light of recent financial innovation.  Specifically, the mandates guiding investment managers have not always kept pace with the growth of structured-credit markets.  These mandates typically require managers to meet or exceed returns on a benchmark index or of a peer group of investment managers, while constraining the risk the managers may assume.  Credit ratings play an important role in these risk constraints\u2014for instance, by imposing a minimum average rating for the portfolio or a minimum rating on individual securities.  However, few of the funds we profiled made significant distinctions between structured-credit and other securities in these credit-rating-based constraints, although there were sometimes other limits on the aggregate share of asset-backed positions.  The failure to make this distinction provides scope for investment managers to generate higher returns by moving into structured-credit products, without raising warning signals about the additional risk these positions entail.  This is not necessarily a \u201cna\u00efve\u201d use of credit ratings by investment managers, as they could well have recognized that higher-yielding structured-credit products embodied significant additional risk relative to similarly rated corporate debt.  Instead, it reflects a previously effective mechanism used by fund boards to convey risk appetite to these managers falling out-of-date with the emergence and rapid growth of a new form of credit instrument.   As indicated in the bottom panel, our key recommendation is that the pension fund industry and other investors should re-evaluate the use of credit ratings in investment mandates.  In a narrow sense, these mandates should distinguish between ratings on structured credit and those on more traditional corporate credit.  However, the more fundamental point is that mandates would do a better job of enforcing desired risk limits on the overall portfolio if they acknowledged differences in risk, return, and correlation across instruments rather than relying on generic credit ratings.  A second important point is that investors should ensure that their investment consultants have independent views of the quality and adequacy of credit ratings for the types of positions in their portfolios.  This is particularly important if mandates guiding investment manager behavior feature credit ratings as a key risk constraint.  That completes our prepared remarks.  We would be happy to take your questions before we proceed to the final presentation", " MR. FISHER.  Going back to exhibit 5, the second panel, your point that we have no evidence of conflicts of interest having an effect on ratings, I am thinking about the investor-practices presentation.  There is an inherent conflict of interest because the issuers pay the raters.  By one account, Moody\u2019s earned 44 percent of their revenue in 2006 from rating structured products.  I have always wondered\u2014and by the way, I have been on the side of the table that has worked a rating agency and have gotten what I wanted\u2014what about just a common sense solution, which is that the investors rather than the issuers pay the rating agencies", " MR. GIBSON.  There is.  We are not denying that there is a conflict of interest.  We looked at some of the mechanisms that rating agencies have put in place to address conflicts of interest, and that is something that every rating agency is aware of.  The only question is whether the mechanisms that are in place to address conflicts of interest were working or whether they need to be enhanced.  Our conclusion was that we don\u2019t really have the detailed information to know whether there were specific conflicts of interest, and we are looking to the SEC to provide that detailed information.  But lots of other things seemed to go wrong with the rating agencies that don\u2019t rely on conflicts of interest as an explanation.  I think people who have looked at the question of the issuer\u2019s paying versus the investor\u2019s paying feel that, given how costly it is to rate these things even in the mediocre way that it has been done, it would be difficult to generate enough revenue through a pure investor-pay model.  That is not to say there couldn\u2019t be more competition between the two kinds, and there are some proposals out there to do that", " MR. FISHER.  Arthur Andersen", " MR. MISHKIN.  Right.  But this is the typical Federal Reserve cautiousness, and I am pushing you a little harder", " MR. MISHKIN.  One quick follow-up on that\u2014is one implication that we might take from this that structured products are just so complicated that they may never get good ratings or sufficiently good ratings, so the market really has to shrink.  Could the rating agencies just fix themselves up so that they actually could do decent ratings.  I\u2019m trying to get a feel for this.  It really relates to the issue that Bev raised, which is you want to differentiate between the two.  But is there something inherently problematic so that maybe people should just realize that these structured products are just not such a great thing.  Financial engineering can go too far", " MR. HOENIG.  My comment is on the conflicts of interest as well.  The only thing I would like to add is that this is not the first time the rating agencies have miscalculated the risk and put that out there.  The incentives are designed to do exactly that, and it will occur again.  I think this statement is too generous to the rating agencies.  The incentives are driving them to do this, they did it, and they will do it again in the future.  It is just inherent that, when you are going to make that kind of money and if you can get it down to working with them and pushing this stuff out, it really is a matter, for those who use them, that you get what you pay for", " MR. POOLE.  I didn\u2019t know anything about SIVs before last summer, but I must say when I began to learn something about them, I was astonished because it would seem to me that, in Finance 101, you don\u2019t finance long-term, risky assets with short-dated paper.  There\u2019s a maturity mismatch, and there\u2019s a rollover risk, and we\u2019ve known about that kind of thing for 100 years, I suppose.  So my question is, Could these things have been marketed as standalone entities without the banks\u2019 sponsorship, which was there in, I guess, most cases.  Second, if they wouldn\u2019t really fly as standalone entities, it would seem to me that the regulators should have insisted that they be consolidated on the books of the bank", " MR. GIBSON.  SIVs had partial liquidity backup lines from banks covering one week\u2019s maximum withdrawal or two weeks\u2019 maximum withdrawal.  That was the way to a rating.  The SIVs were operating under the regulation of the rating agencies.  The rating agencies modeled their portfolios, and they modeled the inflows and outflows, so I think it\u2019s fair to blame the rating agencies at least partially for allowing the SIVs to grow to $400 billion or whatever it was", " MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My question is on exhibit 6, and the question is, Are we making any progress here.  In particular, are the rating agencies stepping up to the process of doing different ratings, different nomenclature for the structured finance.  My impression is that  there is a lot of resistance, at least there was as of a few weeks ago", " MR. GIBSON.  Your impression may be more informed than mine, but I would say that the rating agencies are doing a lot of self-examination now.  I haven\u2019t seen them willing, in my opinion, to go far enough in the directions that we\u2019ve outlined.  A lot of their recommendations focus on managing conflicts of interest and doing a better job of separating compensation from the rating and things like that.  I would say that I haven\u2019t seen enough on the sort of recommendations that we are pushing", " MR. MISHKIN.  Torture works", "  That\u2019s just one possibility MR. KROSZNER.  For sure, although I think we tried something like that with the Sarbanes-Oxley issues of independent research\u2014because this in some sense is a parallel to independent research\u2014and even required funding of that, and that doesn\u2019t really seem to have taken off.  So it seems as though the model, even with its flaws, is the only one that seems to be sustainable.  But drilling down more into where those flaws are, in some sense we\u2019re seeing a privatization\u2014I\u2019m not quite sure what the right word is\u2014with some of the very sophisticated investors effectively building their own internal credit rating agencies.  That\u2019s what hedge funds do, and so you\u2019re getting in some sense a loss of the public rating\u2014a kind of free rider problem or whatever is the right way to characterize it.  In some sense there may be a loss because you\u2019re getting this to be just purely private, but maybe that\u2019s a gain because those are the only guys who should be in this game.  It certainly makes it difficult to sustain the credit rating agency or industry", " MR. GIBSON.  We have kind of a dual problem in that we want investors to do a better job of evaluating the risks, and maybe better ratings would help on that.  At the same time, the existing rating agencies did a bad job, so we have to criticize them.  We have to find some way to reconcile those", " MR. LOCKHART.  But is your impression that those supplemental parties, the consultants and the asset managers themselves, have the credit analysis and valuation capability to address sophisticated structured products", " MR. PETERS.  Yes.  My perception is that the people who were further down on the list made active decisions to get out of the business or reduce their scale of the business, not necessarily just on gut feeling but because they had invested earlier on in the staff and the models to evaluate the product space.  So they understood that the economics of the subprime business had deteriorated and that the risk relative to the return was rising, and they made an active decision, usually, to retract a bit from that space.  Now, they may have made those decisions gradually and incrementally over the year from mid-2006 forward.  It wasn\u2019t one stress test, but it was a thorough understanding of the economics of the actual business that drove their decisionmaking", " MR. PETERS.  We need to be careful with the nomenclature.  Stress testing right now in the industry encompasses a lot of things, and people will tell you that they do stress testing, but they are really doing static shocks.  What we are talking about is not a historical analysis but a kind of forward-looking scenario that builds in your view of the world.  Those are the firms that, again, made more-active decisions to reduce their exposures", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Just very quickly, you did a terrific job.  I think it\u2019s important, though, to recognize that this isn\u2019t done yet, and we\u2019re not going to know fundamentally how we feel about the relative strengths and weaknesses in the system until we see how this plays out.  Don\u2019t let these initial presumptions\u2014either the diagnosis or the prescription, particularly your list of prescriptions\u2014harden too much because there are some judgments that we\u2019re just not going to be able to make until the dust settles and we have a little time for reflection in that context.  I think a lot of damage has been done to the credibility of our financial system.  It\u2019s not clear how much damage because we don\u2019t know how this is going to play out.  But damage has been done, and we are going to bear a lot of the burden of figuring out how to craft a compelling policy response, recognizing of course that regulation may be part of the problem and won\u2019t necessarily be part of the solution.  Anyway, mostly I just meant to compliment you.  You did a great job, and I think it\u2019s helpful really to have this much work done early on in getting us to the point where we know what we\u2019re going to do to the system to make it less vulnerable to this in the future.  Even as we manage the crisis, I think it\u2019s good to have made that investment and a good tribute to the strength of the system that we were able to devote these quality resources even though we\u2019ve all been busy managing the storm"], "2008FOMC20080310confcall.txt": ["   MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  The second concern\u2014I want to go back to President Fisher\u2019s and President Hoenig\u2019s comments\u2014I am a bit nervous about the slippery slope here.  Once we start taking assets of a particular class that is in distress, are we setting ourselves up for potential risks down the road, when all of a sudden some other asset class that is commonly used in both trading and securities, whether by mutual funds or banks, comes under greater duress and for which spreads widen significantly.  Are we going down a path here in which we are going to implicitly provide support for a whole range of potential asset classes.  I worry a bit about where this might lead us over a longer period of time.  That is related to my question.  Maybe I missed it reading the document or in the discussion.  This facility is different from the traditional lending facilities that we have in place primarily because of the term, even for the non-schedule 1 assets.  Are we going to bill this as something different, and if so, does that mean we can remove it at some point.  How long do you anticipate this facility being in place, and how do you think about the magnitude of the operations that we want to open the door for", " MR. ROSENGREN.  I just want to follow up on one of Bill Dudley\u2019s comments.  I noticed in the terms and conditions that it included that the New York Fed reserves the right to reject or declare ineligible any bid entirely at its own discretion.  Under the TAF, we require that people be qualified under the primary credit program.  Are we planning on using a credit standard equivalent to what is done for the TAF for the broker\u2013dealer community.  Do we currently have the capacity to make that determination", " MR. FISHER.  I guess my concern is that the safety-and-soundness disciplines that we apply don\u2019t appear to be applied to these broker\u2013dealers.  I guess the real question is that we can fly blind for a little time and we can try something\u2014and I am for trying something\u2014but if this doesn\u2019t lead to some broader regulatory authority or some change in the nature of the regulatory authorities, if we are indeed going to have counterparties in this sense that are outside our realm of regulation, I just wonder what the end game here is.  Mr. Chairman, I am saying that I think we need to really think that through.  We can react to what we are seeing going on in the marketplace, but I would feel much more comfortable as we go through time if we could understand what the end game is and what we want to get in return long term for providing this hopefully short-term solution to the liquidity crisis\u2014that is the point I am trying to make", "  I suppose this is voluntary, but if we pick out somebody and say, \u201cYou can\u2019t participate,\u201d and if it\u2019s wildly successful\u2014 VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  But this is voluntary like the TAF.  In that sense, it is equivalent.  But you are right; it would be a consequential act for us to say to a primary dealer, \u201cWe are going to restrict you to X\u201d or \u201cWe are not going to consider you eligible any more to bid.\u201d  It would not be, we would hope, a visible act.  But, of course, in taking the action we would be responsible, in some sense, for contributing to the failure of that institution", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Let\u2019s start with President Lacker, then.  President Lacker", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As all of you know, throughout this episode I have opposed measures using our balance sheet to attempt to arrest credit market developments, and so it will come as no surprise that I oppose, respectfully, this measure as well\u2014and for similar reasons.  These measures are all aimed, one way or another, at altering the relative prices of some financial claims.  I think the burden of proof ought to be on those who are advocating such measures to provide evidence of some sort of market failure.  I have yet to see a plausible case for market failure that would warrant such intervention by a central bank here.  In this case, I don\u2019t think the concerns raised by the New York staff memo really come close, and it strikes me that they could equally well rationalize buying tech stocks in late 2000.  More broadly, our efforts to ameliorate credit market conditions appear to be motivated by the notion that exogenous malfunctions internal to credit markets endanger the real economy.  But it seems much more plausible to me now that the credit market phenomena we have been seeing over the past year are driven entirely by the evolution of expectations regarding the fundamental real return on mortgages and other primitives. I have a deep concern that is particular to this proposal.  This proposal crosses a bright line that we drew for ourselves in the 1970s in order to limit our involvement in housing finance.  Legislators at that time were proposing various schemes that would involve using our balance sheet to fund various housing initiatives of one sort or another.  In the current climate, legislators seem to be casting about for funds to bail out mortgage borrowers.  Given the extent to which we have been singled out far more than any other federal regulators as scapegoats for this episode, it would be natural for them to contemplate raiding our portfolio\u2014not to mention, in fact, that our portfolio is larger than other regulators\u2019 portfolios. Whatever one feels about the advisability of fiscal policy of that sort, I think the legal memo did a creative job of interpreting the Federal Reserve Act as allowing direct ownership of this form.  But I think we should view opening up this sort of expansive interpretation of the act as a relatively irreversible step because it will be next to impossible to put this interpretation back in the bottle and argue that the act prevents us from holding particular mortgage-backed securities outright.  Setting this precedent is going to measurably weaken our ability to resist congressional proposals to use us and our balance sheet for off-budget fiscal policy.  So, again, Mr. Chairman, I respectfully oppose this term securities lending facility", " MR. KROSZNER.  Thanks.  I, too, support this facility, but I share with Governor Kohn some of the struggles over it.  Are we crossing certain lines.  Are we going a bit further than we might feel comfortable doing.  Those questions are very serious ones, and the questions that have been raised about the program are quite valid.  But given the conditions in the market and, at least as far as I\u2019m concerned, the clear connection between solvency issues and liquidity issues and the fact that the only way we have to get indirectly at the solvency issues is through these liquidity provision mechanisms, I think that we should go forward with something like this. It is crossing a line in terms of counterparty risk understanding and control.  That\u2019s something that I\u2019m certainly concerned about.  We have pretty good relations with the SEC, but it\u2019s always different to be having good relations with the supervisor as opposed to actually being the supervisor or having the experience of supervising those institutions.  So I think that is an important issue.  There are concerns about the interpretation of what we are doing that could lead to moral hazard concerns.  There are also concerns that this may be just another step along a path that we haven\u2019t really defined well.  That is very important, and I very much agree\u2014actually, I have forgotten who made these comments earlier\u2014that we really need to think about the full path of where we\u2019re going because we did the TAF and that seemed to have a good effect initially but it doesn\u2019t seem to be having quite the same effect as we had hoped. I don\u2019t really understand why some of the risk spreads have blown out again in the last week or two.  That doesn\u2019t mean that we need to study it to death and that we can act only after we understand the origins of it.  But I think we need to have a bigger-picture view to see what is going to go next and how to respond going forward to people who say, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve tried five different little things, and none has really worked, or they work as temporary palliatives.\u201d  So I think we really need to understand the origins of this better to better understand how we can respond.  We may have to respond very boldly in ways that we haven\u2019t done before, but trying to get that big picture of that direction could be helpful to the markets.  We may not actually have to take some of those steps if they see that we could go there, but we would understand better what we will be needing to do down the line. I\u2019m hopeful that this could stop some of the problems, but I fear that it may be like the TAF initially.  We\u2019ll do something that gets us in a good place for a short time, but then some of the bad dynamic between liquidity and solvency can come back, and we\u2019ll be back at a similar place in the not-too-distant future.  I am supportive of this, but I do think we have to think about the bigger picture.  Thank you"], "2008FOMC20080318meeting.txt": [" MR. ROSENGREN.  I\u2019d like to commend the New York Fed staff for what I know has been a very difficult time over the past week.  My question is almost the opposite of President Lacker\u2019s.  He raises some interesting points, but I wonder.  Given the stigma issues involved and what\u2019s just happened with Bear Stearns, you would think that borrowing at any kind of penalty rate for an investment bank, which arguably is more susceptible to runs than the typical commercial bank, is something that no one would take advantage of because of concerns about stigma.  Is there any evidence that there\u2019s more stigma.  How are the primary dealers viewing this, and have they raised concerns about confidentiality and what would be disclosed", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Since we met at the end of January, there has been an utter dearth of good news concerning both the real and the financial sides of the economy.  On the real side, I just can\u2019t recall any intermeeting period in which nearly every single data point was dismal.  On the financial side, there have been occasional good days, but the net changes over the intermeeting period have been negative across the board in both the equity and the credit markets, so financial conditions have unambiguously tightened.  These developments are familiar to all of us, and I won\u2019t take up time to review the specifics. My overall sense at this point is that the effects of the severe and prolonged housing downturn, the financial market implosion, and the price increases for oil and other commodities have now spread to most corners of the economy, including the major segments of consumption and business fixed investment.  Exports represent about the only source of strength, and while that is welcome, I must say that the economy is pretty clearly in trouble when the contribution to real GDP growth from exports exceeds overall real GDP growth, as may well happen this year.  The bottom line is that, like nearly everyone else, I have downgraded my economic outlook substantially.  Assuming that the stance of policy is eased substantially at this meeting and additionally by midyear, I see the economy as essentially in recession during the first half before picking up somewhat in the second because of the effects of monetary and fiscal policy. However, I certainly see large downside risks to my forecast, and I think the Greenbook\u2019s view that recessionary nonlinearities have already set in seems to me to be within a reasonable range of outcomes.  In fact, we have also been looking at monthly data on coincident business cycle indicators, and that examination suggests to us that the NBER may well date the beginning of the recession to last November. The prospect of this outcome has been made more palpable for me by the rather sudden increase in the frequency and intensity of pretty dire comments I am hearing from my contacts.  First, I have heard widespread reports of reductions in capital spending plans due to caution or pessimism regarding economic growth.  For example, a large manufacturer and retailer of outdoor sports equipment reported that technology and infrastructure spending has been cut by at least a third in 2008.  In another example, a large player in commercial real estate in the San Francisco Bay area described how projects are being canceled because the financing spigot has been shut.  Indeed, nonresidential construction is one sector where I think the Greenbook may be too optimistic.  I envision growing weakness there. Second, my retail contacts suggest that spending has softened further in the wake of a weak holiday season, and expectations are for continued weakness at least through spring.  For example, the CEO of a large high-end national retail operation reports that for January and February he has seen declines in sales that haven\u2019t been experienced for almost fifteen years.  These declines have created tremendous pressure on inventory levels requiring large markdowns with negative effects on profits.  Vendors are reeling from the cancellation of orders, the return of goods, and sharp reductions in new orders. Third, a number of contacts have provided comments reinforcing the view that a significant credit crunch is under way.  Slightly more than half of the comments received on this topic indicate that credit standards have tightened significantly in recent months.  In one example, the CEO of a bank in my District reports that several of the nation\u2019s largest mortgage lenders have suspended withdrawals from open home equity lines out of concern that borrowers could now owe more than their homes are worth.  As a final anecdote, a banker in my District who lends to wineries noted that high-end boutique producers face a distinctly softening market for their products, although sales of cheap wine are soaring.  [Laughter]  Now let me turn to inflation and inflation expectations.  Of course, much of the recent data have been disappointing, having been pushed up by rising energy and other commodity prices.  Though I was heartened by Friday\u2019s CPI report, this one observation hasn\u2019t changed my overall impression that prospects for core inflation this year have worsened a bit since we met in January, and I have raised my projection for core PCE inflation about \u00bc percent in 2008, to 2\u00bc percent.  These data raise the issue of whether cutting rates as much as needed to fight a recession may risk persistently higher inflation and inflation expectations.  But I tend to think this risk is manageable.   First, as I have said before, I view inflation as less persistent now than it once was, tending to revert fairly quickly to its longer-run trend.  We have recently reviewed and updated our econometric evidence for this and found it to be even more convincing now than it was a couple of years ago.  Of course, it is important to remember that the current lack of persistence presumably is due to our enhanced credibility, so we do have to be careful to maintain it.  Recent increases in inflation compensation in Treasury markets highlight the risk that our attempts to deal with problems in the real economy possibly could lead to higher inflation expectations and an erosion of our inflation credibility.  But inflation compensation is just one indicator of inflation expectations.  I very much like the Board staff\u2019s approach, which is in the current Bluebook, of combining the information from a wide variety of indicators into a principal-component-type model.  I found it reassuring that the resulting index of inflation expectations and uncertainty is still within the range of variation that we have seen over the past decade or so. Second, I tend to think that developments in labor compensation are an important part of the transmission process for monetary policy to inflation.  Before we get into too much trouble with inflation and inflation expectations, I would expect to see labor compensation begin to rise more rapidly.  I find it reassuring that both our broad measures of compensation have expanded quite moderately over the past year, and productivity growth has been fairly robust.  So after incorporating its effects, unit labor costs are up less than 1 percent over the past four quarters. Finally, the more pronounced slowdown that I expect for economic activity is likely to put somewhat greater downward pressure on inflation going forward.  Overall, I expect core PCE inflation to fall below 2 percent next year under an assumed leveling out of energy and other commodity prices and the projected weakening of labor and product markets", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Clearly, the incoming data on activity have been weaker than we expected.  I think they point to a downturn in GDP in the first half of the year similar to that in the Greenbook.  While the February CPI report was welcome news, on balance I think the inflation picture continues to be troubling.  I noticed a marked change in the sentiment of my business contacts this round.  Many more are now telling me that the problems on Wall Street are affecting their financing.  Credit availability is now an issue.  With regard to borrowing from banks, these reports seem consistent with the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  Credit is an issue for those tapping nonbank sources as well, as in the comments that President Yellen made.  As an example, back in December a major shopping center developer indicated that, even though the commercial-mortgage-backed security market had dried up, he was still able to obtain financing on reasonable terms from other sources, such as life insurance companies.  Last week he told me that these sources had dried up, too.  He\u2019s now trying to raise equity funding, which he considers very costly and an unappealing alternative. Many contacts also expressed increased nervousness over the economic situation and its likely impact on demand for their products.  Manpower\u2019s CEO told me that their business had deteriorated in recent weeks.  Some of his clients were trimming staff because of a lower current demand, and many others were being cautious and cutting back in expectation of future weakening.  Still, even though restrictive financing and heightened caution are weighing on households and businesses, there is a sense from my contacts that spending is not collapsing at this point, and exports of capital equipment in the agricultural sector continue to do well, similar to President Hoenig\u2019s comments. Another common theme I heard from my contacts is that, while the Fed\u2019s innovative response has helped, they do not expect that these measures will do a lot to solve the financial sector\u2019s fundamental problems.  I doubt that any of us disagree with that.  As one of my directors put it, \u201cMonetary policy is not enough.  We need a solution to the subprime mess.  Once that happens, the contagion will run in reverse.\u201d  I believe our innovative policies are helpful for facilitating market functioning, but they don\u2019t address the root problem.  Markets want a firmer sense of where prices for stressed assets will bottom out and of the magnitude of the portfolio losses that will be taken by major financial players.  Unfortunately, it will take a good deal of time before these uncertainties will be resolved, and I\u2019m not sure what we can do to speed the process.  After all, a number of these losses are going to stem from mortgage delinquencies that have not yet occurred and perhaps from homeowners who have not even contemplated that outcome.  This means that financial headwinds likely will be weighing on the real economy for some time, as President Stern said.  I agree with his comments there.  The substantial uncertainty over the length and breadth of this process adds uncertainty to the medium-term outlook for growth.  So while I am hopeful that the economy will begin to recover in the second half of the year, I\u2019m a lot less confident of that outcome than I\u2019d like to be. Turning to inflation, Friday\u2019s CPI report was about the only good news I heard during the intermeeting period (I think last time the reports weren\u2019t very good either, President Yellen), although as the Greenbook Supplement points out, the less favorable translation to PCE prices takes out some of the luster.  It\u2019s no surprise that many of my contacts pointed to increasing pressures from higher costs for food, energy, and other commodity inputs.  I also heard numerous reports of higher costs being passed downstream.  One notable case was for wallboard.  Even though demand is weak and the industry had plenty of excess capacity, higher costs for energy inputs were resulting in the first increase in wallboard prices in 20 months.  The director who reported this was concerned that pricing behavior is moving toward a cost-plus mentality.  This is, after all, his industry.  If so, this would have negative implications for inflation expectations.  However, I see this as a risk and not a base case scenario because the resource gaps opening up in the economy should bring inflation down.  Firms will find it difficult to pass through cost increases in an environment of weak demand.  Businesses and financial market participants will be aware of this difficulty in passing through costs, which should help keep down their inflation expectations. That said, even in a weak economy, firms will have only so much room to absorb costs, and pressures from higher prices for energy and other commodities and for imported goods pose a risk to the outlook.  In addition, while I expect inflation expectations to be contained, there are risks on this front, too.  Some can see a low fed funds rate path, such as that assumed by the Greenbook, as an indication of a lack of resolve on inflation.  I don\u2019t agree with that assessment, but it\u2019s an increasing risk that we will be running, particularly if the inflation news breaks in the wrong way.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  We\u2019ve seen two striking macroeconomic developments since our last meeting.  We now have compelling evidence that a recession is in train.  We now have compelling evidence of erosion in our inflation credibility.  Information from our District corroborates a recession call.  Various survey indicators and reports from contacts point to weakness in manufacturing, commercial real estate, and consumer spending.  No signs have yet emerged of a bottom in housing.  The national reports on employment and retail sales for February have sealed the case for recession.  It now appears that payroll employment peaked at the end of \u201907 along with real income and household spending, and to make matters worse, anecdotal reports suggest that the January fall in nonresidential construction is only the beginning of a sustained deterioration.  I\u2019m now expecting a period of declining employment, declining nonresidential construction, and flat-to-sluggish consumption.  Equipment and software spending may decline as well.  Past contractions suggest a trough later this year.  More severe scenarios seem unlikely to me, however.  The Great Depression, for example, involved us keeping real rates well above 5 percent for several years as activity slowed and the price level declined 30 percent. It will take some time before the ultimate size of mortgage foreclosure losses is known well enough to substantially reduce the uncertainty attached to mortgage-backed security returns, and it is not clear that interest rate changes will affect that timetable much.  In the meantime, I would expect to see repeated bouts of financial turmoil.  When particular markets or entities come under stress, I would also expect to see even wider speculation about and calls for new Fed lending.  It\u2019s even possible that fluctuations in the perceived prospects for such intervention add to financial market volatility, much the way conjectures about IMF programs seemed to add to market volatility in the 1990s. After a string of adverse inflation reports, the CPI came in virtually flat for February.  While this certainly helps for many reasons, including those Mr. Stockton cited, I\u2019m not inclined to make much of one month\u2019s report.  The overall CPI is still up over 4 percent year over year, and given the recent behavior of oil and gasoline prices, inflation is likely to be high again in the March report.  In any event, I think there is no comforting way to rationalize the substantial rise in the five-year, five-year-ahead inflation compensation we\u2019ve seen since the beginning of the year.  This measure of inflation was previously ratcheted upward by similar amounts in early 1999, early 2001, mid-2003, and early 2004.  In each of these episodes, our actions and statements communicated an increase in our concern about growth prospects, and market participants seem to have inferred a corresponding reduction in our commitment to price stability.  The net result over that period is that five-year, five-year-ahead inflation compensation has drifted up significantly over the past ten years, from below 2 percent to now above 3 percent.  This expectational drift is likely to overwhelm, in my view, any transitory effect of increasing slack. I believe inflation expectations no longer qualify as well anchored.  Moreover, they no longer seem consistent with the credibility of even a 2 percent inflation objective.  I believe that this substantial erosion in our credibility is occurring because of our aggressive policy moves and the perception that the hierarchy of our macroeconomic priorities has changed.  It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if our recent credit market interventions are bleeding over into a skepticism about our general approach to time-consistency problems.  It cannot help to allow our credibility to drift around.  I do not think we want a regime in which long-run inflation expectations ratchet up whenever growth slows significantly.  Ultimately we will be forced to act to restore credibility.  This just adds needless volatility to financial markets and the economy. I believe we need to adopt a strategy of easing much less aggressively going forward than we have to date and than markets expect.  President Stern cited the 1990-91 recession and the fact that both the federal funds rate and inflation came down during that recession.  But surely the pace of easing then had something to do with the fact that inflation came down.  Unless we\u2019re willing to let inflation expectations continue to drift, we have to disappoint markets sometimes.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  President Fisher, did you just say the efficacy of \u201cany\u201d cut in the fed funds rate", " MR. FISHER.  Just very quickly, I said that the liquidity situation we\u2019re in diminishes the efficacy of fed funds policy; I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s not a worthwhile tool.  Second, I was fully supportive until we got to 3.5.  Then we went from 3.5 to 3 percent.  Everything we wanted to go one way then went the opposite way.  So I just made the observation that it didn\u2019t seem to be effective.  Third, I think I spent even more time in Japan than President Geithner, who is an expert on Japan, and you cannot compare the two economies.  They are geared totally differently, with totally different efficiency.  I\u2019d be happy to debate that at a later point.  I think it\u2019s a very poor analogy.  Now, having said that, I respect the enormous macroeconomic downside risk that we have\u2014and I have one of the most pessimistic forecasts\u2014but there\u2019s a price to be paid for what we\u2019re doing unless it is efficient, and that price is reflected in inflation expectations.  That\u2019s my point, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m going to cede all of my time to you, except to acknowledge and to point out that there\u2019s much I agree with that has been said around the table, particularly with how people characterize the growth outlook and the risks and what\u2019s happening in financial markets and to the outlook.  I can\u2019t say that stuff better than it has been said.  But there\u2019s much I disagree with in what\u2019s been said, particularly on the inflation side, about the lack of credibility. I just want very quickly to say a couple of things about how we talk about this stuff based on what\u2019s been said.  First, some of you at this table may believe that we are losing credibility, and you may be losing confidence in the capacity of this Committee to mitigate the risk to our long-term inflation objectives.  If you say that in public, you will magnify that problem, and just because you believe it does not make it true.  I believe that you should have more confidence in the commitment of this Committee to do what is necessary to keep those expectations stable over time.  Second, the stuff about capital and the financial system is very, very important.  It is very hard to make the judgment now that the financial system as a whole or the banking system as a whole is undercapitalized.  Some people out there are saying that.  In some states of the world, particularly if there is no liquidity, then any financial system will be systematically insolvent.  But based on everything we know today, if you look at very pessimistic estimates of the scale of losses across the financial system, on average relative to capital, they do not justify that concern.  It is very important to make distinctions in what we say about that.  It is very different to say that their distribution is uneven and to say that for some institutions those losses may be large relative to capital.  That is obviously the case; we have already seen that to be the case.  It is important to make the distinction between the average and the distribution.  Although the average losses look relatively manageable relative to capital, the system is short of capital relative to what would be ideal, given that we\u2019ve had the collapse of a very large part of the nonbank financial system.  Banks as a whole are not large enough now, even with their capital cushions, to compensate for the scale of disintermediation of that type of nonbank finance.  Those are very important distinctions to make in this case.   There is nothing more dangerous in what we\u2019re facing now than for people who are knowledgeable about this stuff to feed these broad concerns about our credibility and about the basic core strength of the financial system.  So I just want to underscore the importance of exceptional care in how we talk about those things, even in private.  A lot of people out there who should know better\u2014none of us is guilty of this\u2014are casting broad aspersions about solvency that are very dangerous in this context.  May we get to the point where those concerns are justified.  Of course we may get to that point.  If we systematically mismanage policy, we may get to that point.  But please be careful in that context. I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Chairman.  I meant to cede all my time to you.  [Laughter]  Finally, I have to state for the record that I did submit our forecast.  To state the obvious, it\u2019s close enough to the Greenbook on most things, and, given the range of uncertainty, there\u2019s no material between our view and the Greenbook\u2019s", " MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I think this is a mistake.  I want to take just a second.  I understand why we\u2019ve been lowering the rate, trying to keep the problems from spreading over to the real economy.  I\u2019ve been reluctant because our practice has been to go too low and to create a new set of circumstances that we have to deal with although I\u2019ve understood, given the seriousness of this financial crisis, that we\u2019ve had to go down.  I have been and continue to be very supportive of the use of our TAF and our other vehicles to provide liquidity to the market to help address and stanch the panic.  The fact of the matter is, though, that there is an enormous amount of loss.  Whether there is enough capital in the banking industry, we know that there is a solvency issue out there, and these actions, while they provide liquidity, cannot solve that problem.  That\u2019s where fiscal policy goes.  But I\u2019m not sure that our continuing to lower rates isn\u2019t allowing others who should be addressing this to look to us to solve the problem that is not ours to solve, and that concerns me about where we are. The fed funds rate at 3 percent nominal, I think, is a stimulative rate in terms of where the real fed funds rate is.  In an environment where we now move down even lower than that, we are inviting other speculative activities.  Liquidity has to go somewhere, and it is going there fast.  I think there\u2019s a danger in doing that, and this 3 percent will stimulate the economy forward.  Two and a quarter will stimulate the economy forward and introduce other significant risks both to speculative activity and to inflation, and that\u2019s why I think we should be more careful in going forward.  Now, doing nothing will shock the market, but I\u2019ll tell you that the market has been shocked as much by some of the new actions we have taken as if we said, \u201cHere it is at 3 percent.\u201d  There are a lot of people on the sidelines waiting for us to stop so that they can come in and take advantage of the situation.  So there are lots of reasons that I would much prefer to hold at this period, and I felt compelled to express that view.  Thank you", " MR. ROSENGREN.  News of the problems at Bear Stearns and the very fragile situation in financial markets complicate our decision today.  Federal funds futures indicate that the market is anticipating a reduction of at least 75 basis points and probably more than that.  Normally the expectations of financial market participants would not factor heavily in my decisionmaking.  However, given the fragility in the market and my own expectation that, even with this move, further easing will be necessary, I strongly prefer alternative A.  While I view alternative B as a significant action, I would have concerns about likely market reaction given the gravity of the situation in financial markets and the possibility that a recession may not be mild, given falling collateral values and financial difficulties at many of our major financial institutions.  A 50 basis point move would merely offset the increase in credit spreads that we have seen since the past meeting.  In addition, the Boston forecast and the Greenbook forecast with a 50 basis point ease leave the unemployment rate well above the NAIRU but with inflation rates below 2 percent by the end of 2009.  Easing less than 50 basis points at this meeting would seem entirely inconsistent with the economic and financial deterioration we have seen since the last meeting", " MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I came to the meeting preferring alternative B\u201450 basis points.  I certainly can bring myself to support your proposal\u201475 basis points.  I don\u2019t view it as a fist pounder, but let me make the case for 50 basis points, at least as I think about it.  First, I do think it is a movement that acknowledges financial instability and the growing real weakness.  As I argued in my earlier remarks, it may set the scene for decoupling rate policy from liquidity actions if conditions allow.  I think the action makes a minimal acknowledgement of inflation risk, and it may signal the view that lower rates can do only so much and that, best case, the market will have to proceed to sort out the market problems and, worst case, the fiscal authorities will have to deal with them.  Although I am not a trained psychologist, let me just propose that, in dealing with market psychology, there may be some value in appearing to firm up our rate-movement policy and to set one element in the fluid situation with greater fixity than it has been in recent weeks.  That might generate the kind of firming dynamic and even help produce a turn in psychology.  That\u2019s a lot to ask for simply 50 basis points, but I also prefer the language of alternative A to that of alternative B, and I think Brian said that you could conceivably apply alternative A language substantially to a 50 basis point cut.  So in general I like that approach.  Thank you, Mr", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  This is the Bluebook equilibrium real funds rate chart.  But any way you look at it, the real fed funds rate is closer to best estimates of equilibrium than during any downturn of the past two decades or similar periods of time.  There is no gap between the estimated real rate today and the center of the estimate of where equilibrium is.  If you look back to what that gap was in 1992, in 2001-02, or in 2003, there was a substantial gap, as most judgments about policy would suggest was necessary.  I understand that there is a huge amount of uncertainty about estimates of equilibrium, but we can\u2019t be facing both the most serious risk of a financial crisis and of a deep, prolonged recession in 50, 30, or 20 years and at the same time the risk of having a very substantial rise in underlying inflation over the medium term.  It seems to me that we are going to have one or the other.  The choice we face, of course, is which risk we are prepared to take.  Which mistake is the easier to correct for.  It is a very hard judgment to make. But I think we have to be confident that, if we end up being successful in averting the risk of a very, very dangerous, damaging spiral in the financial markets with the consequences of a very deep recession or a deeper recession than in the early 1990s, then we will be able to deal with the likely consequences that we will have more inflation and less moderation than we now anticipate.  I guess I don\u2019t understand why we would not be confident in that.  So let me just say that I don\u2019t think this is easy.  Like many of you, I think that it would be great if we got away with 50, but I think that is not tenable\u2014not even close in this context. Even though it would be nice if we had a consensus in the United States about a set of fiscal measures that we think would be good on the merits, we can\u2019t make monetary policy in a framework where we condition our actions on actions by the Congress.  In an environment like this, it is not possible.  If we do the right thing, does that mean it takes the pressure off them.  Maybe, but probably not so much.  But it can\u2019t constrain us from doing what is appropriate now. Just one final thing:  People who know this stuff quite well, who are reasonably calm people, say, \u201cThis is possibly the worst financial crisis in 50 years, and the most challenging set of pressures facing the central bank in 20 or 30 years.\u201d  Think about that in this context.  Okay.  It is no surprise that we disagree; it is no surprise that the range of agreement about what we see and what we should do is going to be wide in that context.  But just think very carefully about the signal it sends to the world at this moment to be explicit in public about the degree of dispersion about our views.  Just think carefully about it because this is a special moment.   I fully support the language and the action in alternative A.  President Fisher, I would not amend the last sentence to say \u201cwithout sacrificing\u201d partly because I think we need to project confidence in our capacity to manage long-term inflation outcomes.  I am ambivalent, as you know, Mr. Chairman, about that clause that President Fisher suggested we delete about reflecting a projected leveling out.  The virtue is that it explains and underpins, therefore, the basis for a medium-term forecast.  The vice in it is that, as the Chairman himself said, the first part may seem like a thin reed on which to base our forecast, given what has been happening.  I actually think, Governor Mishkin, that acknowledging some indicators of inflation expectations\u2014it is really about uncertainty having increased\u2014is helpful to our credibility.  At the margin, it helps, even though, sure, you can say that we really can\u2019t know what they are telling us about the market", " MR. MADIGAN.  I think an issue with \u201cedged higher\u201d is that it really does sound as though you have some very specific measures in mind", " MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I don\u2019t want to prolong this too much, but in response to the Vice Chairman\u2019s comments, I am not sure I follow what you are saying.  I think the model that you showed us, in terms of where the equilibrium rate is, is a short-term model.  It is based upon a variety of estimates and output gaps, and I think there is plenty of room for disagreement around that model.  So the fact that we have different views on this Committee is very healthy.  Even to the world it can be very healthy because a lot of people out there have a different view of this and are wondering if there is any variance of views within this Committee.  I think that can serve as useful a purpose as uniformity without objection"], "2008FOMC20080430meeting.txt": [" MR. HOENIG.  That was my first question.  The second is that we have been entangled before in appearance issues.  If we feel that we are doing the right thing, that doesn\u2019t give me much concern.  On the substance, do you judge that the tightness in the market is such that this action is necessary to facilitate liquidity, or will this only marginally improve things.  If it is marginal, the appearance issue becomes more entangled, I think.  If it is pretty clear that we have some liquidity issues and that this will address them, then I would feel much more comfortable with it", " MR. DUDLEY.  If I may come back to the issue of the AAA securities and the spreads, those are AAA-rated securities for which the spread has widened hundreds of basis points.  If the loss experienced is not unusual relative to the cycle, then it\u2019s hard to understand why AAA-rated securities would be selling at several hundred basis points over Treasuries.  It is impossible to square that circle", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, we have seen the breakdown of a particular structure of lending that was based on the credit ratings.  The credit ratings have proven to be false.  Therefore, there is an informational deficit\u2014an asymmetric information problem, would be my interpretation\u2014which has, in turn, triggered a massive change in preferences.  But I don\u2019t think we are going to settle this at the table here.  President Evans", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The question that I have gets to the appearance issue, and it is not really about the immediate concerns.  To the extent that the markets are not functioning that well, this could be useful, and so I don\u2019t really have any disagreement with that.  But the facilities that we are talking about currently have a temporary nature to them.  The term auction facility is temporary, although of course the Board could make it permanent.  The term securities lending facility is an expansion of a program.  What\u2019s the permanence of that and the primary dealer credit facility as well.  As we allow other forms of collateral to be taken, what implications might that have for the future if we try to make these more permanent.  This is simply a question; I don\u2019t know what the answer is.  Do we feel comfortable with these forms of additional collateral on a permanent, ongoing basis, if we were to do that; or do we think it would be possible to turn that off.  How costly would it be", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, may I just raise one other point.  I think President Lacker touched on this.  I am concerned, in terms of the eventual optics, about the fact that the TAF is being drawn on predominately by foreign banks.  My numbers here are that the last one was 78 percent foreign bank participation and the previous one was 91 percent.  I think there we may have some political vulnerability.  Again, I just put it on the table for us to consider.  I am almost more worried about a backlash on that eventually than what we are talking about currently", "   MR. MADIGAN.2  I will be referring to the package labeled \u201cMaterial for Briefing on FOMC Participants\u2019 Economic Projections.\u201d  Table 1 shows the central tendencies and ranges of your current forecasts for 2008, 2009, and 2010.  Central tendencies and ranges of the projections published by the Committee last February are shown in italics.  Regarding your monetary policy assumptions (not shown) about three-fourths of the participants envisage a moderately to substantially higher federal funds rate by late next year than assumed in the Greenbook, a path perhaps similar to the one incorporated in financial market quotes.  Most of you conditioned your projections on a path for the federal funds rate that begins to rise either in late 2008 or sometime in 2009, in contrast to the Greenbook path, which remains flat through 2009.  Many of you were less clear whether you differed from the Greenbook path  2 The materials used by Mr. Madigan are appended to this transcript (appendix 2). over the near term; but with a little reading between the lines, it seems fair to say that most of you assumed a slightly higher funds rate over the near term.As shown in the first set of rows and first column of table 1, the central tendency of your real economic growth forecasts for 2008 has been marked down nearly 1 percentage point since January.  Most of you pointed to weak incoming data, tight credit conditions, falling house prices, and rising energy prices as factors that prompted you to lower your growth expectations for this year.  About half of you forecast a decline in economic activity over the first half of the year (not shown), with another quarter of you seeing a flat trajectory over that period.  However, only four of you used the word \u201crecession\u201d to describe the current state of the economy.  None of you has a more negative first-half outlook than the Greenbook.  The downward revisions to your growth forecasts are roughly equal across both halves of 2008, and so the contour remains one of a rising growth rate over the year.  Members\u2019 projections for the speed of the recovery in late 2008 exhibit considerable dispersion, with some calling for a quick return to near-potential growth supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus, and others seeing a prolonged period of weakness owing partly to persisting financial headwinds.  Most of you appear to expect growth to return to near its trend rate in 2009 (column 2) and to move slightly above trend in 2010 (column 3).  The Greenbook forecast for real growth in 2008 is near the low end of the central tendency of FOMC members\u2019 projections, but it is at the high end in 2009 and 2010.  The second set of rows indicates that you have revised up your projections for the unemployment rate throughout the forecast period.  Of those of you who provided estimates of the natural rate of unemployment, most expect unemployment to remain above the natural rate in 2010 with the others seeing a return to the natural rate.  As shown in the third set of rows, your projections for headline PCE inflation in 2008 have been revised up a full percentage point, largely due to the surge in the prices of energy and other commodities.  Incoming information has also prompted a small upward revision to your projections of core PCE inflation this year (the fourth set of rows).  The rate of decline of core inflation in 2009 is essentially unchanged from that in the January projections, presumably reflecting the offsetting effects of the higher unemployment rates in the April projections, on the one hand, and the lagged pass-through of this year\u2019s higher food and energy prices, on the other.  By 2010 the prolonged period of economic slack pushes down core inflation to around the same rates that were projected in January.  Although the central tendencies for headline inflation, the third set of rows, also decline markedly over the forecast period, overall inflation is projected to be about \u00bc percentage point higher next year than you anticipated in January.  Nonetheless, by 2010, headline inflation is expected to be in essentially the same range of around 1\u00be to 2 percent that you forecasted in January.  Your inflation projections for 2010 are close to their values in January, but more than half of you raised your projections for the unemployment rate in 2010 significantly more than 0.1 percent.  To the extent that the higher unemployment rate projections are viewed as implying an economy operating below its potential in 2010, outside analysts may infer that you expect inflation to edge down further beyond 2010.Turning to the risks to the outlook, as shown in the upper left-hand panel of exhibit 2, a large majority of you regard uncertainty about GDP growth as greater than normal.  The upper right-hand panel shows that most of you perceive the risks to GDP growth as weighted to the downside.  Correspondingly, the risks to unemployment, not shown, are seen as weighted to the upside.  You typically attributed the downside growth risks to the potential for sharper declines in house prices and persisting financial strains.  Overall, the distributions of your views on the uncertainties and skews regarding growth are little changed from January.  However, as shown in the lower panels, your perceptions of the risks regarding inflation have changed noticeably since January.  As shown in the lower left panel, only half as many participants now see the degree of uncertainty regarding the inflation outlook as historically normal, and twice as many see the uncertainties as larger than usual.  As indicated to the right, fewer see the risks to their outlook for overall inflation as balanced, and more see the risks as skewed to the upside.  Your narratives indicate that you see the upside risks to inflation as deriving from the potential for continued increases in commodity prices, further depreciation of the dollar, and an upward drift in inflation expectations.  That concludes our remarks", "  [Laughter] MR. STERN.  Well, sorry.  The more fundamental question is that I have been trying to get comfortable with an outlook that would have core inflation leveling off and maybe declining a bit, and that\u2019s the forecast I have.  But I took your presentation, which I think was certainly on the right topic, to say that the risks around the core inflation forecast seem to be symmetric at this point.  Is that a fair characterization", "  You\u2019re right that, if expectations truly became unhinged and people began to view the entire inflation process as generating some greater upward momentum, it would have implications both for inflation and\u2014 MR. PLOSSER.  A lot bigger than just the rise in expectations", " MR. STOCKTON.  I think I can assure you that our models of inventory investment are not very good", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes, just a follow-up.  Another way to ask my question is, Given your assumptions about the fiscal policy stimulus and tax rebates, if I took the view that your estimate of spending was not really 50 cents, 40 cents, or 60 cents but really 10 cents\u2014most of it will get saved and not spent\u2014how would that affect your inventory assumptions and, therefore, the path over the next several quarters", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In looking at the latest Blue Chip forecasts for GDP growth, I noted that the range between the highest and lowest is among the largest on record.  The 10 most optimistic forecasters are predicting over 2\u00bd percentage points faster Q4-over-Q4 growth than the 10 most pessimistic ones.  Such forecast dispersion is indicative of the unusually high degree of uncertainty that we are facing.   The Greenbook presents one of the most pessimistic economic forecasts; yet I find its recessionary projection quite plausible and see downside risks that could take the economy well below that forecast.  Although I found it especially difficult this time to decide on the most likely outcome for the economy, I ended up submitting a forecast that shows somewhat more growth in 2008 than the Greenbook, even though we shared the same assumption concerning monetary policy this year.  My forecast projects 2008 growth of \u00be percent.  This averages no growth in the first half and 1\u00bd percent growth in the second.  The unemployment rate increases to just over 5\u00bd percent by the end of this year, a bit lower than the Greenbook.  In one critical area\u2014namely, the adverse effects of financial sector developments on the real economy\u2014I remain just as pessimistic as the Greenbook.  Although the likelihood of a severe financial panic has diminished, the risks are by no means behind us.  Moreover, credit conditions have turned quite restrictive.  This credit crunch reflects the drying up of financing both for markets that were important sources of business and consumer credit and from banks that are contending with capital-depleting losses and illiquid assets. Among banks, the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey noted a clear tightening of lending standards, and my own discussions with bankers confirmed this point.  They say they are carefully reassessing and significantly curtailing existing home equity lines of credit as well as unsecured consumer loans of all sorts.  Banks are also clamping down on the provision of revolving business credit, even to very creditworthy customers.  For example, the treasurer of Chevron, a highly rated oil company that, as you can guess given energy prices, has a very strong profit outlook, recently complained to me that banks were reluctant to extend even its credit line.  Such reluctance is also evident for lending to students, consumers, and other businesses.  The risk of a deepening credit crunch remains as a weak economy\u2014especially with further sharp declines in housing prices\u2014escalates credit losses, harms financial institution balance sheets, and causes them to scale back lending even further.  My sense from our business contacts is that their perception of reduced access to credit is causing them to manage their firm\u2019s liquidity more carefully and is leading to some deferrals in capital spending projects as a precautionary measure.  Certainly the mood is decidedly more pessimistic and cautious. Amid the gloom of the credit crunch, I do see a possible silver lining in that it may amplify the effects of the fiscal stimulus package, and this is part of the reason that my forecasted downturn is a little milder than the Greenbook\u2019s.  In particular, because of the credit and liquidity considerations, the latest fiscal package could well provide a bigger bang for the buck than the tax rebates in 2001.  First, the current tax rebates are more directly targeted at lower-income households, which are more likely to be credit constrained and to spend the cash once it\u2019s in hand.  Second, given the current tightening of credit availability, households will likely spend an even greater fraction of the tax rebates than they did in 2001.  Of course, there is considerable uncertainty about assessing the potential size of these effects.  But over the next few months as the checks go out and the retail sales reports come in, we should get a pretty quick preliminary read on how things are shaping up. Regarding inflation, the most worrying developments since we met in March have been the price surges for a wide variety of raw materials and commodities, especially the jump in the price of crude oil.  From the U.S. perspective, this run-up in prices represents mainly a classic supply shock, which could threaten both parts of our dual mandate, although the decline in the dollar has slightly exacerbated the severity of the impact.  Like the Greenbook, my forecast for inflation does take commodity price futures at face value and foresees a leveling-out of prices going forward.  Although I must say, after four years of being wrong, I am beginning to feel like Charlie Brown trying to kick that football.  The most recent core consumer price data have shown some improvement, and like the Greenbook, I\u2019m optimistic that core inflation will subside to around 1\u00be percent over the forecast period, assuming that the commodity prices do finally level off and compensation remains well behaved. An interesting analysis by Bart Hobijn of the New York Fed as well as my own staff implies that, in an accounting sense, pass-through from the run-up in oil and crop prices may have boosted core inflation as much as 0.3 percentage point over the past two years.  So a leveling-off of these prices could lower not only headline but also core inflation.  My core PCE inflation forecast is a tenth or two lower than the Greenbook this year and next also because we assume lower pass-through of the dollar depreciation to non-oil import prices.  We have been reexamining the data on this issue and find the evidence quite convincing that pass-through has been quite low recently\u2014lower, for example, than embodied in the FRB/US model. With respect to inflation expectations, market-based measures have now edged down.  We took little comfort from this fact, however, because we had viewed the uptick in inflation compensation in recent months mainly as a reflection of a higher inflation risk premium and not a reflection of higher inflation expectations.  I am also somewhat concerned that the median expectation for inflation over the next five to ten years in the Michigan survey has ticked up", " MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As has been described by most around the table, official data on the real economy suggest weakness but haven\u2019t materially changed since we met in mid-March.  Others have talked in more detail about weakening labor markets, poor consumer sentiment, and worrying trends in consumer spending.  Certainly the reports through March that I have received are that consumer spending in March was as bad as anyone who was in the business of retail or credit card spending could have envisioned.  That is certainly disappointing.  Oddly, there are at least some preliminary data through the first few weeks of April of some improvement, but I don\u2019t take much signal from them.  Also, obviously, as others around the table have said, the tone, trading, and expectations of financial market participants have improved markedly.  If only I were as confident.  Whereas market participants only some weeks ago saw fear, they now perceive promise.  Whether that is the triumph of hope over experience only time will tell, but I am skeptical.   Let me talk for a few moments about a couple of positive factors that should be helping and four or so negative factors.  First, on the positive side, I want to give voice to the capital-raising that a couple of others around the table have referred to.  We and the Treasury have been calling for some months for capital-raising across all types of financial institutions.  The questions then were whether financial institutions were willing to take the dilution and go raise capital.  At least equally as important was whether there would be sufficient investor demand.  I think the answer to both of those questions appears to be \u201cyes.\u201d  Investor demand from nearly all sources\u2014including sovereign wealth funds, hedge funds, and traditional long-only managers\u2014has funded virtually all classes of financial institutions\u2014that is, investment banks, money center banks, regional banks, and community banks\u2014across the capital structure\u2014equities, convertibles, and preferred debt\u2014in a huge range of distressed and more-stable situations.  I think that is invariably a very encouraging sign, and we should only be so lucky that those markets remain wide open.  Is this improvement likely to be enduring.  This strikes me as pretty consequential as to whether or not we see the economy respond as favorably in the second half of this year as the Greenbook suggests.  Is the improvement in equity markets, in leveraged loans, and in high-yield markets and the narrowing of CDS spreads sustainable, or is there more bad news to come that is not priced into the market.  My own view is that balance sheets are on the road to repair but that income statements for these financial institutions remain highly challenged.  March was a terrible month for financial institutions\u2019 profitability, which should make it harder for credit to expand, as would be hoped for with any sort of V-shaped or U-shaped recovery. The second positive factor, building on the increase in capital, is really what is going on among the Fortune 2000, particularly the nonfinancial Fortune 2000.  Earnings look pretty stubborn and solid.  Though they have come off their peaks, corporate profit levels are quite remarkable for all of the things that are wrong in this economy, and they look to me to be anachronistic with previous periods of recession.  The balance sheets of those Fortune 2000 companies look excellent.  The investment-grade markets remain wide open.  I think the question is whether those Fortune 2000 will be hiring workers during the next two or three years in the United States, and on that front, I am probably reasonably skeptical. So if those are the positive factors, let me turn to the negative.  First, consumer weakness seems to be spreading.  The largest credit card providers report that credit card spend is deteriorating\u2014again, absent a couple of odd noises in April\u2014and that the strains showing up as delinquency, which were once only in states where housing issues were predominant, now seem to be in other states as well.  Second, credit availability for small business seems under remarkable pressure.  Not only has the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey continued to be disappointing, large money center banks appear to be pulling back from some segments of the small business markets entirely.  Third, interbank funding market problems, as others have discussed, seem inconsistent with the broader improvement in credit markets.  It is a troubling sign that all might not be as well as it appears in this curative process.  A fourth and final negative factor is inflation.  The Greenbook, which has a much more benign forecast for inflation than I do, revised up the forecast for core and headline inflation in the second half of 2008, as David said.  I am still more worried about inflation prospects.  As for inflation expectations and possible second- and third-order effects of these changes in prices, trading and anecdotes over the last several weeks and months continued to be troubling.  I have spent less time in my remarks on inflation than on growth but only because I suppose there is less to say.  The trends are troubling.  The relationships among our policy actions, the foreign exchange value of the dollar, and commodity prices are worth further scrutiny.  In summary, although we should be pleased with the official data on the economy as not deteriorating in the intermeeting period and with financial markets that have certainly exceeded my own expectations for improvement, I remain quite concerned about pressures on both sides of the dual mandate\u2014a discussion that we will take up more in the next round.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. ENGLISH.  I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m not sure", "   MR. FISHER.  Well, Mr. Chairman, I was listening very carefully to Governor Kohn, as I do the rest of my colleagues.  I noted your comment that it doesn\u2019t buy us much.  I\u2019m worried that it may cost us much.  Had I gone first, I would have made arguments similar to those of President Plosser and President Evans.  I am in favor of a pause.  I think that is pretty clear.  I want to stress a couple of things I mentioned yesterday because I think they\u2019re important.  I am concerned about our costs regarding what I call a different kind of adverse feedback loop, which is the inflation dynamic whereby reductions in the fed funds rate lead to a weaker dollar and upward pressure on global commodity prices, which feed through to higher U.S. inflation and to cutbacks in consumption by consumers and actions by employers to offset the effects of inflation.  I quoted a CEO, whom I consider to be very highly regarded, regarding his company\u2019s behavioral patterns.  This is someone, by the way, who was in the business in the 1970s.  He said, \u201cWe\u2019re learning to run a business, once again, in an inflationary environment.\u201d  That quote bothers me because it shows a behavioral response.  This goes beyond the issue, but I thought that comment you made yesterday about relative prices, Mr. Chairman, was very interesting.  But it shows a behavioral response, and behaviors eventually become habits, and habits become trends, and I\u2019m worried about that. There was a period when I felt that we were at risk of a repetition of the 1930s.  I think the liquidity measures that we have taken\u2014which I have fully supported, and I applaud you, Mr. Chairman, and the New York group for thinking these through with the staff\u2014have provided the bridge that we spoke of yesterday.  Don, you mentioned the 1970s.  I am no longer worried about the 1930s, although I think there are tripwires out there that are very, very serious.  You pointed to them in your intervention.  You are right; under Bill Martin these pressures were put in place.  But somebody mentioned yesterday\u2014it may have been Vice Chairman Geithner\u2014that he wasn\u2019t around in the 1970s.  I actually sat by President Carter\u2019s side when he got lectures from a left-wing socialist named Helmut Schmidt and by a right winger named Margaret Thatcher.  Their points were that you cannot risk appearing to be complacent about inflation.  I worry that we risk appearing to be complacent about inflation.  I am speaking within the family here, but I sense that we are giving that appearance on the outside.  The question really is, Is it worth \u00bc point.  What is the risk\u2013return tradeoff here.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth cutting \u00bc point.  I think it is worth staying where we are.   I know that the markets anticipate X or Y.  We had a conversation about that yesterday.  I made my living in the markets.  The markets come and go, and I am happy to hear Governor Kohn say that we are not influenced by the markets.  I don\u2019t think we should be.  Their reactions are momentary.  But I just don\u2019t feel the risk\u2013return tradeoff makes it worthwhile for a \u00bc point cut here unless we saw evidence of substantial downside slippage beyond what we are all discounting for housing, which is very negative.  I have spoken about a price correction of 35 percent from peak to trough, and we\u2019re not there yet.  It would have to be more negative than that to convince me to cut rates further.  So, Mr. Chairman, I respectfully submit that we should pause, and that\u2019s how I plan to vote.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative B with the wording that has been proposed.  But I do appreciate that there is a case for alternative C as well, and I understand and appreciate the arguments that have been made in favor of it.  On the pure economic merits, I definitely support a 25 basis point cut.  As I noted in my comments on the economic situation, it appears that the economy has stalled and may have fallen into a recession.  I share the same concerns as Governor Kohn and President Stern.  My forecast is close to the Greenbook.  I think a further easing in financial conditions is needed to counter the credit crunch, and I believe that a cut in the federal funds rate will be efficacious in easing financial conditions. Although the real federal funds rate is accommodative by any usual measure of it, I completely agree with Governor Kohn\u2019s discussion of this topic.  This is a situation in which spreads have increased so much and credit availability has diminished so much that looking at the real federal funds rate is just a very misleading way of assessing the overall tightness of financial conditions.  I consider them, on balance, to be notably tighter than they were in the beginning of August.  I don\u2019t agree that further cuts in the federal funds rate will be ineffective in helping us achieve our employment goal or counterproductive to the attainment of price stability over the medium term.  Given that a 25 basis point cut is what the markets are now anticipating\u2014it is built in\u2014I would not expect this action, coupled with the language in alternative B, to touch off further declines in the dollar or to exacerbate inflationary expectations. That said, I did see arguments in favor of alternative C as well.  I can see some advantage in doing a little less today than markets are expecting as long as we reaffirm that we do retain the flexibility to respond quickly to further negative news with additional cuts.  A case that could be made for pausing is that we will soon get information relating to GDP in the second quarter and get a better read on just how serious the downturn is.  With respect to market and inflationary psychology, I also can see a case for doing less than markets expect.  It is true that some measures of inflation expectations have edged up a bit, and I would agree with President Fisher that perhaps a pause would counter any impression that we have become more tolerant of inflation in the long run.  But I don\u2019t think we have become more tolerant of inflation in the long run, and I did see today\u2019s reading on the employment cost index as further confirmation that at this point nothing is built into labor markets that suggests that we are developing a wage\u2013price spiral of the type that was of such concern and really propelling the problems in the 1970s.  On the other hand, I agree with President Plosser, too.  Wages aren\u2019t a leading indicator.  We have to watch inflationary expectations.  So I don\u2019t think that is definitive.  Nevertheless, I do find it quite reassuring that nothing is going on there at this point. I think doing nothing today might mitigate the risk of a flight from dollar assets, which could exacerbate financial turmoil.  So there are arguments in favor of alternative C, and I recognize them.  But, on balance, I believe that the stronger case is for B", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The FOMC is badly in need of a stopping rule on the federal funds rate.  Continued reaction to bad economic news\u2014and there is likely to be bad news in the coming months\u2014is going to set up serious future problems for this Committee.  The fragile credibility of the Committee is being eroded as we speak, and we will do well to take steps to reassert inflation-fighting resolve at this meeting. The intuition in dealing with the current crisis is that we can use new lending facilities to help return financial markets to more normal operation and that interest rate policy is not that likely to help on this dimension.  But exceptionally low rates can create new problems.  Since lower rates are not really helping directly with the smooth operation of financial markets, I suggest that we put that on hold for the time being and let our past, stunningly aggressive, interest rate moves have an effect through the summer and into the second half of the year.  This would be consistent with alternative C in the policy alternatives. Many participants have emphasized that there will be a long unwinding process.  The Chairman described us as being in the third inning on this, similar to the late 1980s and early 1990s.  During that episode, the Fed went on hold at 3 percent, considered an exceptionally low rate at the time.  That gave financial markets a chance to heal following the S&L problems without creating other problems for the mid to late 1990s.  In retrospect, this policy worked quite well during that era, and it seems to me that something similar could be done today at the current level of the federal funds rate.  Thank you", " MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I\u2019m glad that reasonable people can differ.  I do continue to hold the view that easing policy today is a mistake.  If I were voting on it, I would vote to hold where we are.  With the fed funds rate at the level it currently is, I think that continuing to ease policy in an environment of rising inflationary pressures gives serious erosion to our long-run credibility.  We are seeing increasing signs that inflation expectations are rising.  I see it constantly, as the public\u2019s inflation psychology is changing as well.  This change reflects the large, sustained now, increases in food, energy, and other commodities and accelerating import prices.  I am concerned that maintaining at this highly accommodative policy level for an extended period, while it may bring some short-run stimulus into the economy, increases inflationary risk to an unacceptable level, which will, over the not-too-distant future, begin to distort long-run investment decisions and continue to increase the risk of financial instability and imbalances in the longer-run.  Finally, on the psychology of the markets, holding rates constant, although it might disappoint some on Wall Street, will please many, many on Main Street.  I judge that it will confirm to the world that we are turning our attention to these longer-run issues, and I\u2019m disappointed that we\u2019re not seizing the opportunity to make that statement", " MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I can support alternative B, but I must admit I can\u2019t do it with the conviction that I would prefer to have.  I think market participants will look at our decision today and at the data over the next few weeks and try to measure whether we can hold up to the pause language that accompanies alternative B.  Taking action with a 25 basis point move today, we have to then be prepared to stomach the continued weakness in the real economy that is in many of our projections.  Speaking for myself, I\u2019d say we also have to be prepared when we next meet to hold the line even if we see a retracing of some of the improvements in financial markets.  So in my own base case, the judgment when we next meet will be a harder one.  The economy might look weak; financial markets might look weaker than they are; and trying to signal to the markets in alternative B that we are serious about holding the line at what would then be 2 percent is putting a pretty hard task on us.  I think we\u2019re capable of holding the line there, but we have to hold ourselves to that standard. The 25 basis point move, in and of itself, doesn\u2019t strike me as that consequential.  What strikes me as consequential is the symbolism.  Given the uncertainties that Dave and the team have spoken about, it strikes me that the 25 basis points is not nearly as consequential in effect as what might well happen to the transmission mechanism and the efficacy of this change in federal funds rates on the real economy.  Put differently, if the financial markets can get back to business, they will be helping the real economy, in effect lowering the cost of capital far more than our actions would today. As I said, I think the symbolism here does matter.  By moving 25 basis points today, we\u2019re taking some risks with the dollar.  I think that the dollar improvement we have seen over the past several days and weeks has occurred because there\u2019s an expectation that we are closer to a pause and that this Committee is going to have a tougher decision about whether or not to move than they had anticipated some weeks ago.  Even though the language in alternative B is useful in trying to lay the factual predicate for a pause when we next meet, there will be a lot of folks who will be wondering about our convictions there, and when they do, I think we are assuming some dollar risks.  We are also assuming incremental risks on the inflation front.  Continued easing could well encourage the perception that the FOMC has a greater tolerance for inflation than is prudent, with potential adverse effects on inflation expectations, a further run-up in commodity prices, and a continued decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar. So this is a tough judgment that we\u2019re making, with significant uncertainty.  I take comfort in believing that the language in the minutes and the remarks that we all offer between now and the next time we meet will suggest not that this is a cut with a dovish pause but that this is a cut with an expectation of holding after our actions today.  We are not barring all events because we can certainly imagine the world turning yet again and we can certainly imagine another let-down, particularly in the global economy.  But this is a statement that we want to hold after our action today and that we are prepared to stomach some additional bad news with respect both to the economy and to financial markets.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As many speakers before me have said, this is a pretty close call, and reasonable cases can be made for both alternative B and alternative C.  If you look at financial market conditions, you can see your favorite indicator and say whether things have eased or not eased.  One indicator that I look at when thinking about the transmission of monetary policy is the LIBOR\u2013OIS spread, which has gone up very significantly.  A lot of short-term borrowing is priced off of that.  If we wanted just to keep policy where it was six weeks ago, we would actually have to cut more\u2014not that I\u2019m suggesting that we should.  But if you use that spread as the relevant indicator, it would suggest that, if one were to keep the same stance, or potentially the same stance, of monetary policy, you\u2019d have to cut a lot.  It doesn\u2019t seem as though our liquidity facilities have been effective on this particular dimension.  We had been hopeful that they would be, but they don\u2019t seem to be.  Even with some of the things that we voted on yesterday, we\u2019re still going to see very elevated spreads in some of these markets, still making borrowing costs relatively high and so disrupting the traditional monetary transmission mechanism.  So that\u2019s where I would argue for alternative B. Another argument for alternative B is the potentially protracted slowdown.  I agree very much with President Stern.  As I\u2019ve talked about a lot before, this sort of slow burn is related to the housing market.  The repair and recovery of those markets is going to take a long time.  The spreads are still quite elevated in a number of these markets.  So providing more cushion against the downside risk there for those markets and then thinking about how that risk affects the potential for broader downside risks, in which the housing market seems to be a potential trigger point for negative nonlinear dynamics, again suggests that moving down 25 basis points now is prudent. The key, of course, that people have been talking about is inflation pressures going forward\u2014inflation expectations.  Here a case can be made on either side with some cogency.  One challenge we have right now is that we have a lot of differences in the way to read inflation expectations.  Looking at the five-year-ahead versus the five-to-ten-year-ahead, we\u2019ve seen them spread apart quite a bit and now start to come back together, with the next five years starting to move up but the five-to-ten-year-ahead moving down.  We have a number of other measures of expectations, some of which have moved up quite significantly but maybe primarily because of some relative price movements rather than underlying inflation trends. One thing that is comforting for me on the alternative B side is that during the last year to 18 months, when we have had very low\u2014below 5 percent\u2014unemployment rates, we have seen very little evidence of high wage pressure.  I find it unlikely that it is going to increase as the unemployment rate goes above 5 percent, and I think, as many people around the table do, that unemployment may sustain itself above 5 percent for quite some time.  We also haven\u2019t seen some of the real shocks to energy and commodity prices feed through to core.  Now, that still could be coming.  But we\u2019ve seen very elevated prices in these areas for quite some time\u2014six to nine months\u2014and the most recent readings from the PCE index suggest that they haven\u2019t fed through.  Maybe that is still to come, and I think to be worried about that is reasonable.  It is also reasonable to be worried about implications for the dollar if we were to go for alternative B rather than alternative C.   But the language in alternative B can provide some comfort to the markets that we are unlikely to be pushing much further, given what we see and what we expect, but that we are open to that possibility.  We certainly have a very long time between this meeting and the next meeting.  We\u2019re going to be getting two employment reports, GDP, and a lot of other information, so we may need to revisit some of these issues.  But at this point I would come down for alternative B with the language that we have.  I think it gives us the appropriate flexibility, and I don\u2019t see sufficient evidence of an unhinging of inflation expectations or actual inflationary pressures, at least with respect to core, to say that we need to take a pause now.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "\u201d  Chairman Bernanke  Yes Vice Chairman Geithner  Yes President Fisher   No Governor Kohn   Yes Governor Kroszner  Yes Governor Mishkin  Yes President Pianalto  Yes President Plosser  No President Stern   Yes Governor Warsh  Yes  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I will ask the Governors to join me in the office for the discount rate decision.  Everyone else, why don\u2019t you take a 20-minute coffee break", " MR. HOENIG.  Yes.  Option 1 doesn\u2019t seem to be one of your recommendations, and yet it is something that basically people know how to do.  The idea is to eliminate the pack so that you have the system already in place.  It\u2019s simple; you can learn from it.  Why wouldn\u2019t that be one of the options you\u2019d pursue.  I don\u2019t have any real opposition to option 2, but I was just curious because the transition seemed so simple with option 1.  That is the question", " MR. CLOUSE.  The determination of voluntary targets, as Spence mentioned, is a really big issue that we\u2019d have to study much further.  At least in the context of the simple models, banks will face some probability of an overdraft charge if they are operating with very low balances, so they might have an incentive to set up a voluntary requirement on which they receive remuneration.  On the other hand, they may not view even fully remunerated balances as an especially attractive asset, so there might be some balancing between the desire to hold large enough requirements to stay away from overdrafts and the idea of having balances or assets booked that aren\u2019t particularly high earning.  But this is a major uncertainty for these types of models", " MR. HILTON.  We are finding a great reluctance to do intraday arbitrage.  We\u2019re hearing this from the banks that in the past would do that from time to time.  Coming back to one of the other questions that Don had about what we are hearing about stigma from some of the banks, one of our better contacts, Citibank, as Jim mentioned, used to do a lot of arbitraging and using the discount window, the primary credit facility.  On occasion, after they borrowed to re-lend in the market at a higher rate last year or so ago, they would call us in the morning to let us know how it was that they were helping us out with the funds rate.  That has pretty much stopped cold, and they have decided on sort of classic stigma.  They routinely point to the publication of borrowing data in the H.4.1 release, and they are just not interested in the small gain from that kind of activity while taking the risk in the market of being seen as in dire need of liquidity", " MR. EVANS.  My primary comment in all of this is related to what President Stern, I think, said.  The way the objectives are worded here is \u201cenhanced monetary policy implementation,\u201d and the memo is worded more like, \u201cHow do we get our federal funds rate target effectively.\u201d or something like that.  But there is really no discussion that I could find about the transmission of our policy actions to the economy and to inflation.  Under our current regime, we think, quite confidently, that the short-term federal funds rate prices short-term risk-free assets along the yield curve all the way up to the Treasuries and then corporates are priced off all of that.  I associate that with Marvin Goodfriend, who taught me that quite some time ago.  It\u2019s not money; it\u2019s not liquidity; it\u2019s not the reserves per se.  It would be nice if, for each alternative, there were some discussion that we are preserving our understanding of the policy transmission mechanism or that we are enhancing it or whatever.  President Lacker mentioned the Bank of England\u2014maybe we could set the policy rate as they do.  The question is, What will the markets do in terms of actively arbitraging something that helps price these securities.  This may not be an issue for many of these systems, but until there\u2019s some kind of analysis, I\u2019m not so sure.  It\u2019s not just averaging over the maintenance period, and I think that analysis would be useful", " MR. WARSH.  Governor Kohn shamelessly stole my question", " MR. KROSZNER.  Yes.  In a lot of the discussion you just take as given the stigma associated with the primary credit facility, and you were just discussing that related to the publication of information about the facility.  Is that something that could also be on the table.  That seems to be potentially an instrument for which we might have to consider how much information to provide or about making it less or more attractive, which then would affect which options are more or less attractive.  Is there some reason not to do that", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you.  First, I do really appreciate all the excellent work the staff has done on this topic.  I really learned a lot from these papers.  I thought they were very clear and very comprehensive.  I have just a couple of comments on the questions that Bill and Brian raised in the memo.  The first one has to do with whether or not we agree with the objectives, and I do have a couple of issues.   First, I think that the stated objective of reducing the burdens and dead weight losses associated with the current reserve tax is too narrowly framed in the paper.  My starting point is, about burden, that to cover a given program of government spending, the Treasury has to obtain revenue from some source, and nondistortionary lump-sum taxes are not one of the available options.  So the real question from the public finance standpoint is what to tax and how much.  That means, to my mind, that the issue here is how the magnitude of the welfare gains that would come from lowering the dead weight loss due to the implicit tax on reserves compares with additional dead weight losses that would result from the alternative taxes that would have to be raised to make up for this lost revenue.  Now the answer depends in part on the interest elasticity of demand for reserves, I believe.  I think it is the case that, if the interest elasticity is relatively small, the dead weight loss from the reserve tax is relatively small, and the net welfare gain, taking into account the burdens of raising other taxes to make up for the lost seigniorage, in effect, could easily turn out to be negative. Let me give you an example of where this comes into play.  There is a well-known paper by Martin Feldstein in which he looks at the benefits of moving to price stability, zero inflation, which he favors.  He looks at this issue in that context, and he concludes that there would be net social losses, not gains, from the reduction in seigniorage that would be associated with a move to zero inflation from positive inflation because the dead weight loss due to the shoe-leather cost, also known as the Bailey effect, is smaller than the dead weight losses that would be associated with alternative taxes.  In his analysis they are taxes on labor supply and saving.  I actually think that this is a serious problem with the framing of the objectives in this paper.  It is, in effect, saying, \u201cWe think we should give a tax cut.  We think we should give it to banks, and we think that, because there is a welfare loss\u2014a Harberger triangle\u2014associated with that, this is clear welfare gain.\u201d  Now, I am not pretending to know exactly how this would come out, but I do think that\u2019s the issue.  If it were to come out that this is a net loss, not a gain, a possible implication is that if there were a fallback to option 1\u2014I\u2019m not saying that I favor option 1\u2014there could be a case for paying no interest on required reserves rather than paying interest at the federal funds rate but paying interest on excess reserves at some rate that we would determine. There are administrative costs with having voluntary target balances, and it seems to me that the paper, as we come out with it, ought to try to at least estimate what the administrative burdens associated with options 2 and 5 would be. Another comment on the issue of objectives:  If we are coming out with a white paper, it seems to me that the objective that everybody is now discussing and that was just discussed\u2014namely, that paying interest on reserves would enable us to expand the size of our balance sheet in times of financial crisis, like now, and perhaps greatly enhance the scope for liquidity-altering interventions that would be possible without having to push the federal funds rate to zero\u2014is a real improvement in the tool kit that is available to us to address market disruptions.  I would see it as an advantage of paying interest on reserves.  If you are discussing this right now with the Congress and it is much discussed in the press, I think it is kind of odd to come out with a paper that doesn\u2019t even mention it.  Maybe there are disadvantages and not just advantages.  But it seems to me it should be there. Also, I would just say on the question of options 2 and 5 versus options 3 and 4, an advantage that the paper attaches to having voluntary targets is the ability to moderate the volatility in the federal funds rate.  So it does seem to me that\u2014I understand it may be difficult\u2014the possibility of intervening multiple times during the day as an alternative, if it were possible to change the procedures so that there could be multiple interventions to reduce volatility, would mean that 3 and 4 could be on the table, and there might be less burden associated with those.  So I think that possibility deserves at least careful consideration", " MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  This will be very brief.  Option 2 looks very attractive to me.  I think option 1 may be a fallback position, but like President Stern, given our tendency to move slow too quickly, if that makes sense, I would rather take the opportunity to make a larger step.  So I think option 2 is fine.  Option 5 is interesting, but its distinction is that nobody else is really doing that.  So it would be a little more of a wild card in terms of how we might implement it and how it might work.  But I think it has some merit. I had asked Bill Dudley back in the fall, when we were having trouble meeting the end-of-day targets, about why we didn\u2019t set the price.  The answer I got was, \u201cWell, this was a good time to think about that option in the context of paying interest on reserves.\u201d  I was probably a little disappointed that we didn\u2019t see more of what such a strategy might look like and how it would behave.  Thanks to President Lacker, his interpretation of option 4 is pushing us more in that direction.  I hadn\u2019t really thought of option 4 in that context that way, but I like it.  I still have the view that essentially looking at everything as a quantity-based view of how we go about doing this restricts the way we think about what our options might be.  So I would like to see a little more explanation of what a price target, where we buy and sell, might actually do.  How that might interact with option 4 would be an interesting way to enrich the set of options. Another question I had\u2014and I don\u2019t know the answer to this\u2014is that we have instituted a number of new facilities.  There is the TAF, there is the TSLF, and so forth.  I wasn\u2019t quite clear how those facilities would interact or be appropriate or inappropriate within the context of these things, or whether this would substitute for all of those in some sense.  If we wanted to pull those off the shelf again at some future time, how would they interact with these systems.  I think it would be useful to have a little discussion about what those interactions might be. The last observation is related to President Lockhart\u2019s comment.  How we go about paying interest on reserves has implications for other parts of what the Federal Reserve System does\u2014in particular the retail payment system and the way we calculate cost recoveries and our revenues under the Monetary Control Act.  There are some separate study groups that are thinking about this, but we ought to make sure that we tie these pieces together as we go forward so that we know what the domino effects of going this direction might be.  Maybe there will not be a concern, if we get out of retail payments, how it affects the Monetary Control Act requirements on fees for services and things like that.  I would like to see that loop closed somehow before the end of the discussion.  Otherwise, I want to congratulate the staff on a very thorough report.  I was at the conference as well in February.  I thought it was very interesting, and I applaud the staff on some good work.  Thank you"], "2008FOMC20080625meeting.txt": [" MR. STERN.  Yes.  Bill, on chart 6, just a quick question on the leverage ratio:  Do we know how good those data are.  I mean, to the best of our knowledge, is that reliable stuff", " MR. FISHER.  Just a quick follow-up, Mr. Chairman.  To what extent do you impute the kind of insecurity that comes from competition and broader outsourcing.  If you impute anything there in terms of wage behavior here, to what extent are you assuming going forward that the increase in wages being paid elsewhere might bleed into our wage behavior here", " MR. SLIFMAN.  It\u2019s hard for me to think of it in these probabilistic terms.  I would say that we still think that the economy is going to have these negative effects that are associated with periods of low growth.  Now, whether that is precisely a recession or simply just a low-growth period, it\u2019s hard for me to distinguish", " MR. STOCKTON.  Again, we want to step back a bit from taking this regime-switching too seriously as implying that there are just two states of the world or maybe three states of the world.  There are lots of different states of the world.  What we are trying to do is look at the residuals in our spending equations and ask how they behave in various kinds of periods.  In periods with substantial increases in the unemployment rate, weak payroll employment, and big declines in consumer sentiment, there also are substantial negative residuals in our spending equations, particularly on the consumer spending side.  That is still built into this forecast.  So we have not interpreted the last six weeks of data as suggesting that recession concerns are all behind us, that we were just completely wrong, and that we are now on a much stronger growth path than we previously thought.  If, in fact, you\u2019re worried that the incoming data might be signaling a stronger growth path, then I would take a look at the \u201cupside risk\u201d scenario that we show in the Greenbook.  There we take out all of our spending residuals\u2014those that are incorporated because we thought we might be in this low-growth or recessionary-like state and the ones that are associated with financial turmoil\u2014and you get growth in that case that is a little above potential growth and a path for the fed funds rate that is even steeper than the current market expectations. Now, although we kept these negative residuals in our forecast, we did have to acknowledge the fact that underlying aggregate demand appeared stronger than we thought it was going to be at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  There is an underlying strengthening of aggregate demand in this forecast that shows up as an increase in the equilibrium funds rate of roughly \u00bd percentage point.  So we\u2019re trying to acknowledge the strength of the incoming data, but we want to be clear that this forecast still embeds some significant negative add-factors on spending going forward.  That could be wrong.  Maybe the incoming data are signaling that we are just fundamentally wrong about that aspect of the forecast.  As Larry showed, given the stunning decline in consumer sentiment, the continued weak business sentiment, and the fact that the unemployment rate has risen as much as it has and has done this in the past only in periods of recession, we felt comfortable still presenting you with a forecast that anticipates that aggregate demand is going to be very weak over the next several quarters", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The last two months have brought an interesting shift in my conversations with my business contacts.  Their concerns have shifted from problems in financial markets to the rapid increase in input prices.  Energy prices are the focus nationwide, but steel prices are also capturing the attention of the business people in my District.  Several manufacturers and builders noted that the price they pay for steel has almost doubled since the beginning of this year.  Clearly, businesses are worried about signs of growing price pressures, but their reactions to these price shocks tell a more complicated story.  Many manufacturers have not been able to pass on price increases, resulting in a clear loss to profit margins.  These businesses often report cost-containment or efficiency programs that will affect their hiring and capital decisions for months to come. Interestingly, the consumer price data show a similar dichotomy.  My staff noted that our primary measures of core inflation are not providing a consistent story about the path of underlying inflation.  In the May CPI report, roughly one-third of the weighted price changes increased at rates above 5 percent, and roughly one-third of prices changed by rates less than 1 percent.  For example, while energy costs were up strongly and prices for a number of general service components have been drifting higher, large declines in apparel and vehicle expenses are imparting significant offsets.  The 16 percent trimmed mean indicator showed an alarming 4 percent rise in prices, while the median rose just at 2.2 percent.  The weight of price changes in the 1 percent to 5 percent range was unusually small, making it difficult to estimate the central tendency of the price change distribution with much confidence.  So this makes it difficult to get a good read on where future prices are headed. My District business contacts remain pessimistic about growth prospects.  District retail reports focused extensively on the likely effects of gasoline and food prices on the purchasing decisions of consumers.  Many manufacturers, builders, and distributors are facing complicated output and investment decisions in the context of input price growth and weaker markets.  Overall, most of the business people that I talk with are still quite cautious about their business plans, despite the fact that most of them have found sources of credit and terms that are not too elevated from what they have seen in previous years. In the economic projections that I submitted for this meeting, I raised my near-term forecast for output growth slightly and for headline inflation slightly more.  Over the medium term, my outlook continues to be for modest growth because the housing market, in my forecast, recovers slowly, actually more slowly than in the Greenbook.  My staff estimated a model for national housing starts that takes into account what has happened in the past in states that have seen major increases in foreclosures.  The real estate difficulties that these states faced were much more persistent than anything that we have yet seen in the national data.  The bottom line of this analysis is that, if the patterns of past housing cycles from the states that experienced the boom\u2013bust cycles are repeated at the national level, then housing starts should remain relatively weak over the next couple of years.  Supporting this analysis, three of the large regional banking organizations in my District are increasing their loan-loss provisions significantly in the second quarter based on the continued deterioration in the housing sector.  Based on current projections, these institutions are projecting housing sector credit losses to accelerate in the second half of 2008 and to continue into 2009.  Currently, the weak output growth contributes to my forecast of declining inflation rates, especially the core rate, but I also see evidence supporting that view in the \u201cless worker bargaining power\u201d scenario that is in the Greenbook.  My contacts see very little price pressures coming from labor costs now or in the near future.   Finally, implicit in my forecast for output growth and inflation is a fed funds rate path that includes increases later this year and into next year.  Although additional risks to growth remain, the primary risk to my forecast concerns input prices and inflation expectations.  If commodity prices continue to accelerate, they are going to put upward pressure on both headline and core inflation and downward pressure on output.  That environment could lead to a highly undesirable increase in inflation expectations.  On the positive side of risk to the outlook, I think that the fed funds rate actions that we have taken, in conjunction with the actions that we took in August to bolster market liquidity, have improved confidence, and I have substantially lowered the odds I had placed on financial market meltdown and on a severe recession.  In that sense, since our meeting in April the downside risks to my outlook for economic growth have lessened somewhat, and the risks to my inflation outlook have moved up somewhat. Regarding the issue of providing longer-term forecasts, I have long supported efforts to clarify the underlying objectives of FOMC participants by providing our longer-term economic projections.  Of the proposals that were offered by the Subcommittee on Communications, I favor reporting the average values for output growth, unemployment, and total inflation expected over a five-to-ten-year period\u2014option 3.  The features of these five-to-ten-year projections that I find attractive are that they indicate where the economy might converge and don\u2019t imply too much knowledge of the path to the long run.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. MADIGAN.  Yes", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The growth outlook has improved over the last two months, but the inflation picture has not.  If anything, it has deteriorated.  I think it\u2019s clear, as President Hoenig argued, that we should be tightening policy soon.  The extent to which we brought the funds rate down was predicated on downside risks and the notion that we could reverse course rapidly.  As downside risks now look much less likely, I just don\u2019t see how an argument that 2 percent was the appropriate funds rate in April does not also imply that a higher funds rate would be appropriate now.  Taking back some of that stimulus at this meeting, however, is probably inconsistent with the commitment implied by the Committee\u2019s traditional interest rate smoothing behavior.  So I\u2019m willing to stand pat today with the funds rate. The timing of such moves is going to present us with some trouble going forward, though.  Even if we avoid outright recession, as now seems probable, the unemployment rate is likely to keep rising for a time.  But waiting isn\u2019t going to make it easier for us, in any event, because there\u2019s a likelihood of the fourth quarter\u2019s showing a slowdown when the stimulus wears off.  But inflation is going to increase in the near term as well.  At least that seems likely, and holding rates down while that happens and while inflation expectations are already fairly elevated seems awfully risky to me. I can understand the need for some conviction when we raise rates.  When we began cutting rates aggressively in January, there were some significant uncertainties in the inflation outlook, though.  I hope we don\u2019t set any higher a threshold of conviction for rate increases than we set for rate cuts.  Looking back at 2003-04, and this is strictly in hindsight, one can argue that we erred by waiting too long to reverse course, and I\u2019ve heard you yourself make that argument, Mr. Chairman.  So the logic of risk management works in both directions.  I think we need to keep that in mind", " MR. KOHN.  It\u2019s very difficult.  We don\u2019t know what inflation expectations are.  We\u2019re all using proxies, as came forth very strongly at the Cape Cod conference where we both were, President Plosser.  We don\u2019t even understand very well how expectations are formed, and I think what we\u2019re looking for is how people perceive the cost of capital to finance purchases.  So we\u2019re wondering whether this low interest rate is causing them to bring purchases forward from the future to the present to induce them to buy things, capital goods, right.  That\u2019s the interest rate we\u2019re really looking at\u2014the perceived cost of credit to folks\u2014and I\u2019m not sure that subtracting any rate of inflation is the way to get that.  Obviously, the cost of credit for housing is perceived as hugely high right now.  The cost of credit for automobiles is perceived as hugely high for reasons that perhaps aren\u2019t related to monetary policy.  I don\u2019t think we see a surge in purchases of capital equipment that would suggest that businesses perceive the cost of credit to be very negative.  So I think, because we don\u2019t understand inflation expectations and can\u2019t measure them, you have to look for a lot of different things around the edges to confirm what people perceive the real rate to be.  I just don\u2019t see a lot of information that suggests that people perceive the real rate to be very negative and that it is influencing how they manage their purchases of goods and services over time", " MR. ROSENGREN.  I support alternative B.  At this time, there are significant downside risks to the economy and financial markets, as the collateral damage from the housing problems works through the economy and financial institutions.  At the same time, continued increases in oil and food prices raise the risk that some part of these supply shocks will be incorporated into inflation expectations.  In the absence of more-compelling evidence about which of these two risks will dominate, I would favor remaining on hold at this meeting.  I hope that the economy picks up in the second half of this year and that the financial markets stabilize so policy can become less accommodative, but it is not clear that this will be the outcome.  While the inflation outlook has been affected by continued energy shocks, the future path of oil prices remains uncertain, and recent history has many instances in which oil shocks are short-lived and have little effect on longer-run inflation expectations.  Until we have more clarity on the path of the economy and inflation, policy should remain on hold, and our language should be consistent with that", " MR. MISHKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I do support alternative B and the current language in the statement.  I have no problem with that.  I think it conveys what we need to convey.  Although I think that the next move is very likely to be up and it maybe should be done quite soon, I would argue that we still need to have a lot of flexibility and to think in terms of having a lot of flexibility in where we may have to head in the future.  I want to argue along those lines and outline why I think that is the case. The first issue is something that the Chairman mentioned yesterday, about which I felt very strongly\u2014in fact, I meant to say it, but as always the Chairman says things better than I could in this context\u2014that there really is still a very serious possibility that the shoe could drop in the financial markets.  The Chairman mentioned a set of institutions that we have to be concerned about, and although there has been some improvement in terms of the stress that the financial markets are under, I don\u2019t think we are out of the woods yet.  We are likely to be, but we have to be ready to recognize that things could go south.  So that\u2019s one issue.  The second issue is that the recent positive data we have seen are, again, very tenuous to me.  I\u2019m hoping that they indicate that things are going in the right direction.  But a bunch of things make me very nervous, which I mentioned yesterday\u2014how consumers react in housing crises, consumer sentiment, and the big problem that is going to occur when people have to face very high prices of food and energy, which hit their pocketbook very directly.  So, again, that could be quite contractionary.  The good news that we have seen recently might reverse very quickly.  The third issue is that I think the headwinds could be very substantial in the future, that this cleanup will take a long time, and in that case we could have very slow and subpar growth that could widen output gaps more than the Greenbook and most participants here are expecting.  So I do not consider the current stance of monetary policy to be overly stimulative.  For me it is just about right and very much along the lines of what I think would be optimal policy.  Of course, my view relates not only to the real economy.  I also think that inflation expectations, as far as I can tell so far, are reasonably well contained.  There is very little movement in the measures of inflation expectations that I pay most attention to.  That argues that our stance is about right.  I would also very strongly argue that I do not think that we have taken out a lot of insurance.  I have argued that before.  We have moved less gradually, which I think is very beneficial, and I would commend the Committee in that regard.  But we moved in line with what the forecasts have been telling us optimal policy would be, and I think that is quite important. However, here is why I think we need to have flexibility in the other direction.  If you think about a risk-management approach, it should not be focused just on tail risk to economic growth, which has been our most major concern because of the financial disruption.  It equally implies that, symmetrically, we should be just as worried about tail risk to inflation, particularly to long-run inflation expectations, which I think are the key driver of underlying inflation, which is what monetary policy can particularly deal with.  Here we have a situation in which we have hit the perfect storm of shocks because of the huge supply shock and there are much more serious upside risks and tail risks in terms of long-run inflation expectations.  So I really do worry that with long-run inflation expectations and, therefore, underlying inflation we are in a more fragile situation and that we have to be very cognizant of that in terms of what we do in the future. The bottom line is that we may have to move very quickly to raise rates if any of several things happens.  One is that headwinds are not as serious as I think they are likely to be.  There is certainly a very serious possibility that things could be better than I expect.  I would not be unhappy, so I would not get depressed, about that.  Really more depressing would be if inflation expectations started to look as though they were getting more unanchored.  Particularly, I would worry much more about what happens in terms of inflation compensation and the Survey of Professional Forecasters, paying some attention to consumer surveys but putting a lot less weight on them.  If the canary starts to look as though it is keeling over, we have to move very quickly, and so I am going to watch that canary very, very carefully", " MR. FISHER.  Before the python gets it", " MR. KOHN.  I also had a question, Mr. Chairman, and it\u2019s on the PDCF.  I find some tension in my own attitudes here.  Your leaning all over these people not to borrow helps protect the Board\u2019s decision that this is unusual and exigent, credit couldn\u2019t otherwise be available, and all of that.  So it\u2019s supportive of that.  On the other hand, it sounds really like what we used to do with commercial banks all the time and thought it created stigma in the process.  We don\u2019t want you to borrow.  If you come in and borrow, given that we don\u2019t want you to borrow, you must really be hurting to overcome Art Angulo\u2019s or Bill Dudley\u2019s frown.  So I think the more we do this, the less useful this thing is as a backstop in some sense.  I don\u2019t know.  I don\u2019t have an easy answer as to how to resolve this tension", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  I asked Bill Dudley yesterday a question about what I had heard from the Street\u2014that they perceived that stigma was attached to it.  With this conversation, it certainly appears to me that I was hearing them say that, at least from the investment banks\u2019 point of view, they do feel that some stigma is already attached to it, good or bad.  Now that I\u2019ve heard this discussion, it is consistent with what I was hearing from those Wall Street firms", " MR. LACKER.  That Thursday", " MR. ANGULO.  There are definite differences among dealers.  I don\u2019t have the Bear Stearns cut, but we did a cut recently, and there are very clearly differences among dealers.  As we know, the share of less liquid assets being financed by tri-party has been growing over the last\u2014pick a number\u2014five, seven years.  The trend line is going like that, clearly at a steeper or more pronounced rate than the growth in more liquid or more eligible collateral", " MR. ROSENGREN.  For Bear Stearns, we have one side of the transaction looking at the investment banks.  On the other side of that transaction, you have companies like Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated.  So as we think about who poses systemic risk, we probably want to think about both sides.  In terms of a distress scenario, you have tri-party repos that are very illiquid.  The clearing bank does not want to provide the cash.  As a result they have to liquidate, and you have companies like Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated having to break the buck, and they don\u2019t have much capital to infuse.  So just as we think about systemic risk, as you\u2019re looking at these other organizations, are there other people that you would add to that.  I know for Bear Stearns that Fidelity, Schwab, and Federated played a very large role.  Were there other organizations that we ought to be thinking about that would have the same kind of nature", " MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, on the short term, I think extending through the end of the year is prudent and would support that.  I would say that the possibility of its naturally dying off would be ideal.  I would support that because it is \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d  We should make that clear and work these people out of it as quickly as possible.   On the longer-term issues, I share the view of a lot of what President Lacker said.  A couple of things:  I\u2019m very uneasy about extending our lending and supervisory authority to these institutions on the basis of systemic risk.  The banking industry has been under our umbrella, importantly around transactions activities\u2014that is, payments\u2014and how important they are systemically.  It\u2019s clear, and a line is there.  Beyond that, it is size that\u2019s systemically important.  If we extend this and institutionalize it because we\u2019ve had this emergency and we\u2019ve used section 13(3), then I have to ask what will happen when the next Long-Term Capital occurs that\u2019s larger, more complicated, with a lot more interaction that will affect the markets globally.  What will we do.  To what then will we extend ourselves in terms of supervisory oversight, memos of understanding, agreements for the group of hedge funds that aren\u2019t regulated, and so forth.  So I think it\u2019s important that we focus on the fact that this is an emergency and that we go back to \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d in the future for these institutions so that we have clear boundaries on that.  I think it has served us well and will continue to serve us well.  Then we use our best judgment in exigent circumstances and very sparingly.  I think that\u2019s a lot of what President Lacker said, so I won\u2019t repeat everything else, but those are the concerns that I really do have going forward", " MR. ALVAREZ.  Well, we have had a bit of interaction on the Senate side.  The Senate folks are very interested in what we are doing and whether this would preempt a congressional action.  Chairman Frank has been more sanguine about our doing what is appropriate to deal with the situation now\u2014Laricke may speak to this more at the lunchtime conversation.  But we are building on existing authority.  We are not expanding beyond the existing framework.  We are agreeing to collaborate more, work together more, but we don\u2019t gain any legal or statutory authority through this MOU.  We gain some admission because we are standing next to the SEC.  We expect that the primary dealers and CSEs will be more willing to talk with us because we are with the SEC.  But in the end, it depends on voluntary cooperation by all", " MR. FISHER.  I am a little confused.  You testify in July and then have a speech.  You said that you and Paulson will be speaking.  I think that is a very important point.  It is going to be a tough act because you don\u2019t want to take anything off the table, but you want to keep a lot open and not show your hand.  Well, we don\u2019t know what our hand is yet.  You may, but I don\u2019t think we have it as a group.  So we can\u2019t really show our hand.  Anyway, I don\u2019t know how this is going to be prepared, but I\u2019m sure there are lots of feelings around this table.  This is the substance that Vice Chairman Geithner referred to earlier\u2014these very, very important questions.  But you are going to have to show some leg during that speech.  Obviously, this is a Board issue, but with regard to the FOMC, I would just ask that it be fairly carefully vetted", " MS. YELLEN.  I will be very brief, Mr. Chairman.  I do want to say, with respect to the short-term issues, that I fully support the plan that you laid out.  I certainly favor keeping these facilities in place beyond September.  Even if their use diminishes, I agree with the point that it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate that they are not playing a tremendously important role.  The ramping up of our oversight of these institutions in the agreement with the SEC is a very important part of continuing these facilities. On the long-run issues, it is a wonderful list of questions.  I don\u2019t know the answers to the questions.  I think we really need to dig in very rapidly and do serious work on them.  They are fundamental.  President Rosengren raised a list of issues about this, the same ones that have been very much in my mind.  What institutions.  It is not obvious to me that the right list of systemically important institutions is the primary dealers.  I think someone\u2014maybe President Rosengren\u2014raised the issue of Countrywide, a huge mortgage company.  I certainly worried last summer that it had created systemic risk, and it is not just the primary dealer there.  I also think there is an issue with respect to hedge funds, similar to those that arose with Long-Term Capital Management.  This raises very troubling issues to me about our trying to identify and take on supervision of all systemically important institutions.  This is a very tough issue that I don\u2019t know the answer to.   But also, what is going on raises fundamental issues about how we conduct consolidated supervision.  Even if all the systemically important institutions were primary dealers or mortgage companies within bank holding companies that currently we do have umbrella supervision over, I am not at all convinced that the way we are carrying out supervision now would have prevented a Bear Stearns-type of episode within an institution that is currently solidly under our supervision.  Last summer I was pleased in some ways that we had lost direct supervision of Countrywide to the OTS.  But it might well have been in our domain\u2014six months earlier it would have been\u2014and it could have created a systemically important problem if it had failed.  So just the nature of how we carry out this Fed-lite approach, is that really the right way.  I see us as very focused on process in our supervision of holding companies.  We don\u2019t do a lot of transaction testing.  Obviously, this raises very fundamental issues, even within our existing domain, about how we carry out comprehensive umbrella supervision.  I don\u2019t have any answers, but we clearly need to get on it quickly", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  First, I completely agree that, once we get to the point at which we believe the best policy is to dial this stuff back and transition to a world in which they don\u2019t exist, we are going to want to look at a whole bunch of things\u2014changing terms, changing the relative attractiveness across the auction facilities, thinking about size, and thinking about price.  I think that will be very important to do.  It is very unlikely that the optimal path is going to be that there is a cliff\u2014one day they are there, and the next day they aren\u2019t.  So I completely agree with that. My own judgment is\u2014but it may not be right, and it could change over time\u2014that for the moment we want to have a clean, crisp signal.  Better to say that we are going to extend in the context of these broader initiatives to strengthen the system and not at the same moment alter their terms and relative attractiveness.  But we are going to have to think very carefully over the fall, conditions permitting, and well ahead of whatever the new date is, what the desirable exit strategy is in changing incentives around use. However, my basic sense is not now, not yet, partly because of the complexity of the signal you are sending and the difficulty of how it will be interpreted.  We have done all this stuff in part because we are trying to address a complicated mix of things around incentives, stigma, and that kind of thing.  It is hard for us to predict what the effect would be.  Its purpose is to wean, but to do it now would make the message a bit more complicated.  If the world is strong enough that you can wean them now, why are you extending.  So my basic sense is, absolutely, we are going to have to figure it out by the transition, not quite yet but well ahead of February 15 or whenever it is going to be"], "2008FOMC20080724confcall.txt": ["  MR. LACKER.  With the way that we currently operate the Term Securities Lending Facility now in place, is there any upper limit on the fee that some participant can bid", " MR. LACKER.  Now, if I want funds from six to nine months from now, I can just wait and virtually guarantee that I am going to get those funds by planning to bid just exorbitant amounts for them, right", " MR. LACKER.  We would flood the market with reserves.  We wouldn\u2019t let it get to that, would we.  We would have other tools for addressing a huge spike in the demand for funds at that point.  Presumably it wouldn\u2019t go far above the primary credit facility rate.  I am just probing here about the amount of insurance we are providing.  This seems like a very specific piece of insurance that we are providing in both of these cases, and I am having trouble seeing the link between these and the overall financial strains you are characterizing or seeing in the market.  That is what all of this is about.  That is why I am asking this", " MR. HOENIG.  I have a question that is somewhat different from that.  When you brought this up, I thought that we were asking to extend this into next year but that the idea was to eventually back away from this.  We are setting up this new procedure that suggests to me that it might end up needing to go longer since we are talking quarter-ends and so forth.  I am not there, but I know there are other strains.  Are the liquidity strains suggesting not only that we want to extend this into next year but also that there is a tightening, a worsening, of conditions that means we need to change the approach here and provide even more assurances to the market, so that we are committed to this.  This seems to take us away from rather than toward backing out, and I really am a bit concerned about that. The second question I have on this is about going from 28 days to 84 days on the TAF.  We in Kansas City don\u2019t have a lot of this going on, but we have some; and we haven\u2019t had a lot of concern about the fact that it\u2019s 28 days and not a longer maturity.  Are things happening in the markets such that we would want to do this to help settle things out, or is it merely an administrative change to ease our burden and perhaps theirs as well.  I don\u2019t have a lot of problems with 125 percent coverage ratios, but I am interested in why we are looking to change the maturity.  So I have those two questions for you", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes.  But if they really want a week-long loan, do we really want to be encouraging our depository institutions coming in to just roll it over one day after one day after one day after one day.  It seems to me, that really changes the nature of the way most of our primary credit has been made.  For us, in particular, the collateral that most banks use for primary credit is not the sort of securities that they can pull in and pull out very easily\u2014a lot of it is loan collateral and securities of that type.  If you really want more collateral on these longer-term loans, making it more than just one day, it seems to me, is too short.  I am just wondering if it makes more sense, so that we don\u2019t drastically change the nature of the primary credit window, to say it is longer than 30 days or some other time frame.  I realize it is going to be a discrete point at which it turns over.  But I just think it would be very awkward, and I don\u2019t think it is really necessary for the very short term end", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Bill, if our goal is not to take away something that the banks already have, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to make the 28 days or more the loan that needs to be overcollateralized.  Would that be the right way to think about it", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you.  During the presentation, it was mentioned that many banks were asking for this longer-term TAF.  I am not getting that request here in my District, but I wonder whether any thought was given to keeping the 28-day TAF and then adding the longer 84-day TAF.  Is that even an option.  The reason I raise this question is that I am concerned about the credit risk.  We have had situations in which it has been difficult to assess whether an institution was going to stay in sound financial condition over a 28-day period.  Obviously, it would be even more challenging over an 84-day period.  So I just wondered if it 1s even an option to keep the 28-day TAF and add the 84-day TAF", " MS. KRIEGER.  In terms of the size of the cushion, we did speak with SCRM (Subcommittee on Credit Risk Management) a bit about this, and, of course, there is a variety of views there; and across the System, as we look at the loans that are outstanding, there is a range of collateral that is used.  A good portion of the collateral that is used is not priced securities; it is loans, many of which we do not have the details on, so it is very difficult to establish a good value.  Then, even behind that in quality are nonpriced securities, and we have increasingly seen more of those pledged to us in these times.  So we felt, because it is difficult for us to feel really comfortable with the values of some of these pledged instruments, that taking the cushion did seem appropriate.  For what it is worth, of the more than $150 billion of loans that we have outstanding, they fall short of being collateralized by this extra margin by only about $200 million.  So virtually all the value can be overcollateralized. Now, it is not quite so pleasing a picture if you look at it by the number of borrowers outstanding.  Of the 140 or some borrowers outstanding, maybe 25 of them are short some margin of collateral, if you would impose the 25 percent overcollateralization.  But, again, the values are quite small, even in percentage terms, for institutions.  So as we try to balance, on the one hand, our comfort with some of the collateral we are taking and our ability to value it with, on the other, the longer term, we look to the preference of many in the reserve community who have dealt with institutions whose quality has deteriorated.  We felt we might be doing best by the vast majority of Reserve Banks if we were to introduce the cushion", " MS. YELLEN.  They initially told us that they would take up to the face value of the collateral, and we quickly determined that that is not consistent with Federal Reserve policy.  In point of fact, it is not consistent with the written agreement that the Reserve Banks have with the FDIC, which actually states that the FDIC will compensate us for the market value of the collateral.  So I think that the FDIC here faces a sequence of failures and wants our cooperation.  They did compensate us\u2014we had $500 million outstanding to IndyMac at the moment it failed, and we were immediately compensated.  But our agreement with the FDIC is that they compensate us only up to the market value of the collateral, which we deemed to be close to $1 billion, rather than our haircutted value based on a standard haircut, which was over $3 billion", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I am concerned about the credit risk associated with the term lending here, and I suppose if everybody feels comfortable with it, then that would be all right.  It does seem, though, that the value of these new programs, much as President Stern just mentioned, seems small.  These are temporary facilities exercised under unusual and exigent circumstances.  They are currently anticipated to go away.  I would think that we should be having big value added from additions to these programs.  I wonder a bit about how confident we are about what the market reaction to the introduction of these pretty complicated programs is going to be.  Are they going to wonder about what we\u2019re looking at versus what they\u2019re looking at.  These are supposed to be temporary; but the way we add more to it, it seems as if it\u2019s going to be more difficult to take this away, at least in terms of the expectations of our borrowers and the markets.  We have been doing this as we make comparisons to the ECB and the Bank of England, and they have been doing this for some time.  It sort of suggests that this is something that we\u2019re going to do for a longer period of time.  I am not saying that that might not be the right decision ultimately under the right risk management, but it does seem to be prejudging that a little.  Thank you", " MR. ROSENBLUM.  I want to thank President Yellen for the detailed discussion of the role of the Federal Reserve in supporting IndyMac in its final weeks.  It reiterates some of the fears I have of what we may face going forward.  Extending the term of the TAF to 84 days may compound the adverse selection process whereby those banks that anticipate difficulties may be those most likely to want to go for the 84-day period and bid up the rate that they are willing to pay because they would be anticipating some of the difficulties that we just heard recited. More than that, we in Dallas are worried about the reputation of the Federal Reserve if there is a series of such follow-up events to IndyMac and how it is going to look for you, Mr. Chairman, if you have to testify before the Congress, which has the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and will criticize us for making loans for which foresight is far from perfect:  \u201cHow could you have made such a loan to a bank that everybody who reads the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times and looks at the Internet knows was in trouble, and how could you do it on such preferential terms.\u201d  Such questions damage the reputation of the Fed.  In addition to the credit risk aspects, we have the problem of the Fed\u2019s reputational risk, particularly in the halls of the Congress, during a particularly troubled time going forward. On balance, I think the TOP program does no harm.  We in Dallas are willing to support it, but we still have some reservations.  One of my concerns is that, in the document that was sent out yesterday for the FOMC vote on the TSLF options authorization, there is no mention in the first paragraph on page 3 about this being a special, short-term, end-of-month, end-of-quarter option.  It is just left there in general terms that we are going to offer up to $50 billion in additional draws on the facility, and there seems to be a lack of clarification.  One question I have is, Is the System going to put out a list of frequently asked questions or something of that nature to add clarity.  Another concern that I have is Bill Dudley\u2019s earlier statement that the Fed has other means of easing its balance sheet constraints should the new facilities tie up more funds or encumber more funds on our balance sheet.  We didn\u2019t really have any follow-up on that point.  What are the plans to ease our balance sheet constraints should it become necessary, and does this conflict with the fed funds targets that the FOMC is trying to hit.  We need some explicit discussion of that or at least to raise the questions as we go forward, perhaps at the next FOMC meeting.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", "  MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to have to leave the call, and I just want to say before I go that I think a lot of good questions have been raised here, and I just wouldn\u2019t rush into this.  I think the 84-day term seems to be long in this environment of troubled banks; and frankly, it is not very clear that either of these proposals is really going to buy us a lot.  I am also sensitive to the announcement effects, and I am not quite sure what the announcement effects would be.  So I would prefer to think about it longer before we go ahead and approve this.  Thanks", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I share President Stern\u2019s intuition that the value of these at the margin, given what we already have in place, seems questionable.  Even with some generosity to the theories of financial strain that seem to motivate the mechanisms we have in place, the additional contribution to alleviating stress seems just trivial, just incredibly minor, to me.  I also very deeply share President Hoenig\u2019s concern.  There is an endless stream of improvements we could potentially make to our intermediation efforts here, our lending facilities.  Continuing to invest in more and more improvements just sends the signal, it seems to me, that we\u2019re settling in for the long haul and envision and expect to be offering these for quite some time.  As you all know, I have deep reservations about all of these facilities.  But I would think that the broad consensus of the Committee was that these are temporary, transitory facilities, and in that light I think we ought to be thinking of ways that we are going to wean the banking system off these.  Adding features like this is just going to further entwine the institutions with us and develop further dependency on us and these facilities.  I also think Mr. Dudley said that this was the number 1 desired improvement articulated by dealers.  I think that cannot possibly be a standalone rationale for something like this.  Market participants are bound to think of stuff that they would like us to do, and we can\u2019t let that guide us.  We have to have a sense that we are actually doing something of broader significance.  Finally, I will say that I do strongly support the collateral policy change of making the overcollateralization apply every day that the credit is outstanding.  I questioned the one-day-only part when we first brought it up with the TAF, and I think that would be a step in the right direction.  Thank you", " MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think this has been a really good discussion that has raised a lot of interesting points.  I agree with President Geithner that these are adjustments around the edges that were intended to make the facilities a little more useful in potential periods of stress.  I, myself, was favorably disposed toward the options for the reasons you said, Mr. Chairman, of focusing our balance sheet.  If we\u2019re a little worried about our balance sheet, let\u2019s focus on putting it to work where the stress points in the system are likely to be, which is quarter-end and year-end.  I didn\u2019t see it as promising a further extension.  We would be voting on one through the end of January\u2014that\u2019s what it says, and that\u2019s what it would be.  On the TAF extension, I do think that the financial system and the depository system, regional banks in particular, are coming under increasing pressure.  I think we ought to keep the maximum flexibility to deal with these liquidity pressures.  I would hesitate to go to just 84 days if I thought that meant there was going to be a material tightening of the standards that the Reserve Banks use to grant these loans because of nervousness about the shifting of a bank\u2019s rating over the 84 days.  So I would ask Bill to think again about whether we could run 28-day and 84-day auctions at the same time.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that confusing, to tell the truth.  We run schedule 1 and schedule 2 auctions for the dealers, so I think we ought to give that a little thought so that we\u2019re not forcing the Reserve Banks to make even more difficult judgments about long-term viability than they do now. So on balance, I\u2019m favorably disposed, but I think we need to take on board the discussion we\u2019ve heard here today and think carefully about whether we have these proposals adjusted in the right way", " MR. DUDLEY.  Well, the big problem would be how we would make the transition, because I think we cannot do two auctions simultaneously on 84 days and 28 days and it\u2019s not clear how one would actually transition then to steady state.  We would have to spend some time working on that to see if it is possible to make this happen without having a lot of reserve-management issues because we really don\u2019t want the outstanding amounts to go up or down violently as we\u2019re transitioning.  So we\u2019re just going to have to see if that\u2019s feasible or not"], "2008FOMC20080805meeting.txt": [" MR. PLOSSER.  If we think about the phrase that people use\u2014\u201cfinancial headwinds\u201d\u2014and the credit problems that we see, my interpretation of how the staff has modeled that is on the demand side\u2014of restrained credit limiting demand.  But I can also think of the financial sector as having been hit by a very significant productivity shock, if you will, where the production function for intermediation has taken a huge productivity shock to it.  So in thinking about a model in which that has happened, you might find yourself thinking about the consequences of that, particularly how that affects the path of potential output over the near term.  If you think that type of shock is driving potential output down over the near term, depending on the magnitude of that, it is going to affect your estimates of the gaps and therefore your estimates of inflation and what the economy looks like going forward.  So I guess my second question is, Have you thought much about this, or is much of this incorporated in the evolution of your output gaps or your potential output measures, working through that channel.  If so, what might be the ramifications for inflation and policy going forward", " MR. REIFSCHNEIDER.  We\u2019ve made no explicit adjustment for that in the potential output assumptions we have going in.  Looking back, it was hard to see that there was much, if any, effect, but that\u2019s a risk knowing that there could be some productivity effect and it\u2019s just hard to find", " MR. WILCOX.  May I just augment my earlier answer.  I spoke about the nonresidential building sector.  Another factor taking down overall nonresidential spending is that the lower energy price trajectory reduces our expectation for drilling and mining expenditures, which have also fallen", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Steve, you might want to define \u201ccore import price inflation.\u201d  It\u2019s not analogous to the other core", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Isn\u2019t it true, though, that changes in potential growth also have demand effects as well\u2014to some extent offsetting", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Yes.  It means that it\u2019s another way of saying that you wouldn\u2019t expect the estimates of the now-prevailing equilibrium real fed funds rate to be higher.  Not to stretch this too far, but another way of saying why the likely expected path or the appropriate path of policy doesn\u2019t change in terms of the nominal fed funds rate is that we have these offsetting effects on demand", " MR. EVANS.  I agree with that chain and those risks, but what I thought I was hearing from David was that the staff estimate has in it quite a substantial adjustment process in housing, and then I would expect financial players to share that assessment", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  I was just going to say this.  I think that you can do crude estimates of likely total losses across the U.S. economy and credit markets in a scenario like the baseline scenario in the Greenbook, and if you use Nellie Liang\u2019s study or the stuff done in New York, there\u2019s a huge amount ahead still.  Even though financial market prices now reflect an expectation for house-price declines that are not significantly more optimistic than David\u2019s baseline scenario, I don\u2019t think you can say with confidence now that financial institutions have already provisioned for or written down losses to accommodate that.  Because the trajectory of house prices will depend in part on financial behavior\u2014the availability of credit\u2014as financial institutions catch up and adjust to that and adjust capital and asset growth, et cetera, there is some risk that you\u2019ll push that expected path of house prices down further from where it is.  So if institutions have to prepare for the possibility that you\u2019re going to have a much weaker economic outcome because there\u2019s some probability around that, then there\u2019s a risk that they will produce that outcome through the combined effects of their behavior, which is why we\u2019re living with such a delicate balance", "   MR. LOCKHART.  I just want to point out that we hear a fair amount of anecdotal feedback suggesting that just determining what is the net real price for a house is not so easy because of incentives, particularly in multifamily but also new homes in general.  You pay list, but you get a Mercedes and a year\u2019s worth of gasoline and your lawn mowed and a lot of things thrown in for the seller to hold the price close to what the list is.  So I don\u2019t know how these things are actually measured to take into account those kinds of incentives", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher, I\u2019m going to ask you a very innocent question.  You\u2019ve given many chilling anecdotes over the last few meetings about increases in prices, but the official statistics just don\u2019t show anything like that outside of oil, gas, gasoline, and the direct commodity price increases.  Do you believe that the CPI is not an accurate measure", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Boston forecast used for the June meeting expected that the unemployment rate would peak at approximately 5.7 percent.  Unfortunately, with the July employment report, the unemployment rate has already reached 5.7 percent, and we expect the economy is likely to grow less than potential for the next several quarters.  With the unemployment rate rising in the past three months by 0.7 percentage point and payroll employment declining for the past six months, I am concerned that there remains a significant risk that the second half of this year would look a lot like the \u201csevere financial stress\u201d or \u201ctypical recession\u201d scenarios.  My concern reflects the potential impact of further deterioration among financial institutions and financial markets that may create a significant headwind for the economy and the likelihood that economic problems are growing in other countries, which would slow one of the few bright spots in the economy\u2014exports. Since our last meeting, much has been written about the problems at the GSEs.  Concern with the viability of the GSEs and potential future losses has contributed to mortgage rates rising despite our past easing, the weak economy, and diminished demand for mortgages.  With financial institutions showing little interest in lending to subprime or jumbo borrowers, the increased cost for individuals that qualify for conforming loans is likely to weaken the one part of the housing market that had been relatively resilient to financial problems to date.  For potential buyers, higher interest rates and the likelihood that housing prices will continue to fall provide little current incentive to purchase a home, while the job losses are providing an immediate need for some owners to sell their homes.  We need the housing market and housing prices to stabilize, which I had hoped would occur in the second half of this year, but now it looks as though it will be deferred until next year.   Falling housing prices have created significant collateral damage.  Liquidity problems that began one year ago remain in play.  The capital-constrained financial institutions that are forced to shrink their balance sheets may pose a significant additional problem in the second half of this year.  While many of the largest banks that suffered significant losses last year were able to raise additional capital fairly readily, the capital losses on newly issued bank equity may have reduced many investors\u2019 appetite for providing new capital for banks until it is clear that the economy is recovering.  The falling national housing prices and problems in commercial real estate in some sectors of the economy are now affecting regional and community banking institutions, many of which are unlikely to get equity infusions and thus will be forced to shrink.  A reduction in the willingness to lend, as represented by the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, has often portended a reduction in credit to bank-dependent borrowers.  As we get a more traditional credit crunch compounding the liquidity problems, I am concerned that credit will be less available to consumers and businesses and further slow consumption and business investment. Since the June meeting, the stock market has fallen 7 percent; and with the number of large financial institutions experiencing very elevated CDS spreads and stock prices in the single digits, the failure of one or more relatively large domestic or foreign financial institutions is a real possibility.  In such an environment, the assumption of annual equity prices rising 7 percent in the rest of this year and 12 percent in 2009 as assumed in the Greenbook would seem to have some significant downside risk.  Elevated unemployment rates and a flat or slightly falling trend in wage and salary inflation suggest an absence of the inflationary pressures in labor markets that would lead to rising inflation once energy and food prices stabilize. These factors give me some confidence that we will see core and total inflation in 2009 close to 2 percent.  Since our last meeting, labor markets have been weaker than expected, and oil prices and many other commodity prices have fallen, in part as a result of the concern with a slowing global economy.  Although total inflation measures are clearly higher than any of us would want, these readings appear to be transitory responses to supply shocks that are not flowing through to labor markets.  In fact, evidence from the labor market would seem to indicate that the downside risks to the economy are affecting labor markets through job losses but are not creating an environment in which labor tries to offset supply shocks with higher wage demands.  Thank you", " MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, let me say that the Tenth District probably, on the whole, performed a little better than the national average in the industries that we have; but in terms of job growth, it has slowed.  At the same time, we\u2019re still adding jobs in the region, and our unemployment rate remains relatively low compared with national measures.  Although wage pressures actually do show some elevation relative to our Beige Book survey, they have obviously eased a bit in recent months.  But it\u2019s interesting that, as we talk and monitor the labor conditions and we talk to some of the labor unions, there is a great understanding that they\u2019re losing ground.  They are going to begin entering contracts at the end of this year and in the next year, and how they approach that is extremely important because, again, they are looking and talking now about cost-of-living adjustments and those sorts of things, which gives me some pause.  According to our manufacturing survey, our activity actually strengthened in July, although the expectations for future activity have diminished somewhat.  Not surprisingly, manufacturers producing energy and agriculture and in export-related markets continue to operate at relatively high levels whereas the other areas within the District are showing some slowdown. Let me talk just a second about oil.  Although oil prices have declined, as was noted, they are still high enough that capital spending and production remain elevated and look to remain so in the foreseeable future.  In fact, some of our industry contacts suggest that, as long as expected prices for oil remain in the $70 to $80 range, there should continue to be a fair amount of investment in that particular sector.  As you well know from reading the Wall Street Journal, we did have the SemGroup go bankrupt in the Tulsa area.  It has had, I think, fairly confined effects.  One of our regional banks took some pretty heavy losses.  They\u2019re very well capitalized and did recapitalize some of it, so they\u2019ve not been dramatically affected by it.  Local producers are in the worst bind because they haven\u2019t been paid for some of the oil delivered and there\u2019s no other party to contract with for future deliveries.  So that has brought a lot of uncertainty in the local area about where to provide some of this oil that they\u2019re producing. In my discussions with businesses around the District, it\u2019s interesting that there\u2019s a lot more conversation about and focus on managing your price strategy in this environment.  As has been true for a while, fuel surcharges are prevalent, and firms are able to pass those along with a fair amount of ease.  In addition, businesses are reporting that materials suppliers are placing 10-day to 30-day time limits on their price quotes.  Finally, most price indexes in our manufacturing survey remain near historically high levels, and plans for future pass-throughs have actually intensified. Turning to the national outlook, my outlook for growth has not changed materially since the last meeting.  I expect that growth will slow in the second half because of these higher energy prices, some weakness in the labor market, and sluggish activity in some of the manufacturing sectors.  The fact is that the uncertainty regarding the economic outlook is considerable, and downside risk to growth in the near-term future is there.  These risks are being addressed, from our perspective, by our current stance of accommodative monetary policy.  So we are addressing that uncertainty.  The point I would like to make is that I\u2019m less uncertain about the outlook for core inflation.  We have seen erosion in longer-term inflation expectations, and I believe inflation risks have actually risen.  If core inflation rises in the second half as expected, there is a real possibility that inflation expectations will become unanchored, especially if we maintain our current accommodative stance of policy.  An expected leveling-off of food and energy prices and slack in the economy could help moderate upward pressure on inflation, but I do not think they will be enough to actually bring inflation down to an acceptable level.  In fact, if we maintain the funds rate at 2 percent, I think inflation is more likely to move higher than lower over the medium term, and that concerns me.  Thank you", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Like the Greenbook, our modal forecast shows weaker real activity and slightly higher core inflation over the forecast period.  Downside risks to growth remain substantial, in my view, and have probably increased relative to what we thought in June.  Risks on the inflation front remain weighted to the upside, perhaps somewhat less than in June, but this is hard to know with confidence.  The adverse growth risks are worse for several reasons.  The labor market and labor income are weakening more quickly than expected.  Although there were some tentative signs of stabilization of housing demand in the spring, demand seems to have fallen further since.  Credit conditions are tighter and are expected to be tighter longer, and this seems likely to produce a further deterioration in overall demand\u2014note, of course, the reduction in credit for autos, the rise in mortgage rates, and the more conservative lending standards for consumer and corporate credit.  Growth outside the United States seems likely to slow further.  Of course, fundamental to this dynamic, as has been true for 12 months, each shift in perceptions that the bottom in overall economic growth is further away produces additional stress for financial institutions and markets, adding to the intensity of prospective financial headwinds and to concerns about downside risks to growth. Now, the adverse tail on the inflation front remains significant.  Many measures of underlying inflation suggest a broad-based, if limited to date, acceleration in the rate of underlying inflation.  Market- and survey-based measures of long-term expectations are high.  Surveys suggest that firms are able to pass on some part of the acceleration in energy and materials costs.  On the more positive side, energy, commodity, and materials prices have declined significantly, principally it seems because of expectations of slower growth in global demand.  Growth is moderating significantly around the world, and it\u2019s going to have to moderate further in the most populous parts of the world as central banks there get monetary policy tighter. The growth of unit labor costs has been and is expected to be very moderate here.  Profit margins still show plenty of room to absorb cost increases, and as David reminded us, you can have a relatively benign outlook for the path of core inflation without margins narrowing very dramatically.  Inflation expectations have not deteriorated meaningfully here, even with the flatter expected path of monetary policy in the United States.  Of course, it\u2019s very important that inflation expectations and pricing power moderate from current levels.  If some of the downside risks to growth materialize, this will happen, and inflation risks will moderate.  If, however, the economy continues to prove to be resilient to these downside risks, then we will face higher inflation.  On balance, the rate of growth in underlying inflation suggests that growth in demand in the United States will have to be below potential for a longer period of time if inflation expectations are to come down sufficiently.  This means that we will have to tighten monetary policy relatively soon compared with our previous behavior in recoveries\u2014perhaps before we see the actual bottom in house prices and the actual peak in unemployment. However, at this point, the risks to real growth remain critical.  In my view, we need to have more confidence that we have substantially reduced the risks of a much sharper, more protracted decline in growth before we begin to tighten.  I think it is unlikely that we will be able or will need to move before early next year.  Short-term market expectations for monetary policy in the United States seem about right at present.  I don\u2019t see a strong case for trying to alter those expectations in either direction at this point.  To try to pull forward the expected tightening would risk adding to the downside risk to growth and magnifying the risk of a much more severe financial crisis.  On the other hand, if we avoid some of these downside risks to growth, then policy will need to tighten more quickly, perhaps, than the expected path now priced in the markets. The evolution of monetary policy expectations and of inflation expectations since May illustrates how uncertain the markets are about what path of policy will be appropriate.  But the pattern of changes in both of these measures of expectations suggests that the markets believe we will get this balance right\u2014that we will do enough soon enough to keep underlying inflation expectations from eroding materially.  Thank you", " MR. FISHER.  In terms of the wording in paragraph 3, if we do not raise rates, I am wondering why the second sentence that is now in alternative C wouldn\u2019t be more appropriate for alternative B, and I am wondering what your thinking is about that.  In other words, if we don\u2019t take action, that seems to be a more emphatic statement than what you have currently, assuming no change in rate\u2014\u201cThe Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year,\u201d et cetera\u2014whereas if we are trying to send a signal that we are really concerned and we do not change rates, why wouldn\u2019t we have used, \u201cAlthough the Committee expects inflation to moderate . . . the possibility that inflation may fail to decline as anticipated is of significant concern\u201d.  Then, maybe take the word \u201calso\u201d out of the fourth paragraph.  It just seems to me odd that if we act and describe the risk after acting, the language is even stronger.  Whereas if we don\u2019t act and we want to emphasize that we are remaining vigilant, why wouldn\u2019t we use that stronger language.  I am curious as to why you chose the two or what you feel the tradeoff is there", "   MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative A\u2014no change in the funds rate and a balanced assessment of risks designed to leave market expectations concerning the path of the funds rate roughly unchanged.  Oops, I made a mistake, there is no A.  [Laughter]  So I propose to create it by changing the wording of the first sentence of alternative B, paragraph 4, to read, \u201cBoth downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation are of significant concern to the Committee.\u201d  As it is currently worded, B(4) downplays the downside risks to growth, which have intensified since our last meeting as the credit crunch has worsened and emphasizes inflation risks, which have moderated slightly as oil prices have fallen.  The assessment of risks in alternative B, as it stands, is unbalanced and\u2014as Brian just pointed out and the Bluebook does also\u2014is more hawkish than the primary dealers and most market participants generally expect.  So it is likely to shift the fed funds futures path and other interest rates upward. I see no case, at this juncture, for signaling that we are likely to adjust policy upward before the end of the year.  Indeed, there is a non-negligible probability, to my mind, that the next move will be down and not up.  There is already significant slack in the labor market, and with the economy expected to grow at a near-recessionary pace in the latter half of this year, the unemployment rate is poised to rise further.  This growing slack is working to contain inflationary pressures as evidenced by the stability and low level of wage growth.  I expect that growing slack will continue holding down wage inflation going forward.  Long-term inflation expectations seem relatively well contained, and core inflation has been stable for the past several years.  Finally, a major component of the surge in headline inflation\u2014oil price increases\u2014has finally started to show some sign of reversing direction.  Although the real funds rate remains quite accommodative by the usual metrics, we are clearly not in a business-as-usual situation.  We are in the midst of a serious credit crunch that has, again, worsened during the intermeeting period, as exemplified by the developments at Freddie and Fannie and the other things that many of you have pointed to in our last round.  We are likely seeing only the start of what will be a series of bank failures that could make matters much worse.  Given these financial headwinds, it is not clear to me that we are accommodative at all; I agree, Mr. Chairman, with the comments you just made on this matter. Given my preference for an inflation target of around 1\u00be percent and equal welfare weights on the inflation and unemployment gaps, I view the Greenbook policy path and forecast as a roughly optimal trajectory to the attainment of our goals.  Although core inflation exceeds the level I consider consistent with price stability, unemployment also exceeds the level consistent with full employment.  Given our dual mandate and a forecast that envisions a growing unemployment gap, coupled with declining inflation under the Greenbook funds rate path, I see no case for jolting expectations in such a way as to, in effect, tighten policy now.  I feel especially strongly about this in view of the major downside risks to the economy from an intensifying credit crunch", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  A funny thing happened at my board meeting the other week.  I was all set to prepare them not for a rate change recommendation this time but for one in the not-too-distant future.  By the time I was done, they were asking what the procedure was for dissenting from my recommendation.  So, in fact, they forwarded a recommendation for an increase this time around. You know, we can disagree over the inflationary consequences of a lot of this, but I think there is a message from around the table and the public, our directors, and whatnot, that they do feel that there is a concern about inflation.  So I favor alternative C, although I recognize the reality of today.  I am struggling with the fact that we lowered the funds rate rather aggressively, and things have worked out much better than we expected against the risks that we thought that we were facing.  We could disagree over that as well.  I do take the point that uncertainty is very high at the moment.  But I think that we will need to increase rates sooner than currently expected by markets.  We are counting on a modest degree of slack and our credibility with the public to keep inflation and inflation expectations contained while we leave rates on hold.  But I am concerned that there will be only modest inflationary restraint from the slack that we see and that we may not be able to convince the public that they shouldn\u2019t worry about high headline inflation. I certainly agree that bank balance sheets were pretty good in 2007, but I am concerned that headline inflation has been above core inflation for quite a long time.  I am not sure our own balance sheets would reflect that.  So by following a wait-and-see strategy, we are accepting a large baseline inflation risk.  In addition, there is an enormous tail risk\u2014that is, a return to much higher underlying inflation.  Also, I was a little concerned to see in the dealer feedback to the TAF extensions that some market participants think that we will not increase the policy rate as long as we keep the \u201cunusual and exigent\u201d determination in place.  I am not sure that is a good expectation for them to have.  Fundamentally, it is my opinion that there has been a change in the balance of the economic rationale and risk-management calculus that we used to lower the funds rate to 2 percent.  It is not a huge change, but I think there has been a change.  One year on, the economy has withstood the financial shock in a resilient fashion, especially given the add-on shock from oil.  I don\u2019t know what more we could have hoped for from the vantage point of the fall of 2007 and the losses that have been taken. I think the odds of preventable negative feedback loops that we took out the last 75 basis points of insurance against are somewhat smaller than they were five to six months ago.  Part of our earlier logic to appropriately lower rates to a decidedly accommodative policy stance was to guard against disorderly market conditions that might permanently damage our financial market infrastructure and destroy the financial capital stock in a real, productive sense the way that I think President Plosser was alluding to.  But real forces have unmasked dramatic weaknesses and faults in our financial system, and markets will be evolving to a new intermediation structure.  Our policy can ease transitions only to a degree, but it cannot restore the previous financial status quo, nor should it be aimed at doing so.   During the transition, I would not be surprised if we revisit periods of market volatility as the disadvantaged players are repeatedly challenged to restructure to the new environment.  Counterparties are shying away from previous financial partners, in part because of uncertainty over the risk\u2013return profiles and the transitioning industry structure.  These profiles involve both liquidity risk and credit risk.  I think our lending facilities allow a modest decoupling of the fed funds rate setting to deal with this.  In my view, the balancing of current risks calls for increasing the funds rate in the range of 50, maybe 75, basis points within some reasonably short period of time.  If events change importantly, I would certainly advocate further adjustments in either direction, depending on how those risks adjust.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. HOENIG.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I appreciate the fact that reasonable people may differ, and I do differ.  In saying that, I am not advocating a tight monetary policy.  I am advocating a less accommodative monetary policy.  I recognize Governor Kohn\u2019s point that relative prices are adjusting, and others have made that point.  I think around that context is the fact that we are seeing a systematic increase in the price indexes, both total and core, and I don\u2019t think we should ignore that.  Now, the core is creeping up, but up nevertheless, and it is systematic in my view.  I would feel more comfortable that it was transitory if policy were not so accommodative, which affirms the likelihood of further increases in inflation going forward.  That is really where I am focused, I guess is the way to say it. We introduced the policy that we have, as I think others mentioned, as an insurance policy early on, when we were more in an immediate crisis.  I don\u2019t negate or minimize the tension that we are under, but I do think we have become very accommodative in our policy with negative real rates.  So here we are with this insurance.  We have this subpar growth.  The subpar growth is not going to go away soon, so we are delaying removing the insurance policy.  I worry about that.  I think in the long run that does increase the risk of an inflationary problem of a sizable magnitude later on.  I know we have this immediate problem, but our role also is to take a long-run view, and I think we would be wise to raise the rate now modestly.  It would still be an easy policy.  The effects of that increase might be disturbing to the markets.  On the other hand, it might actually give more confidence to the markets that inflation is going to come down because we are going to insist that it does.  I think there would be some good effects from that.  So that is where I am coming from on preferring that we move rates up slightly at this point.  Thank you", " MR. LACKER.  I\u2019ll dispense with the rest of my prepared remarks and just say that I recognize the real risks ahead of us.  We\u2019ve experienced sluggish growth, and all the downside risks to growth that have been enumerated are very tangible and very plausible right now.  I think we should hold off raising rates at this meeting, but I\u2019m very concerned about the inflation risks.  I find myself leaning toward a tightening campaign earlier rather than later, and I\u2019d like to see the statement do what it can to prepare markets for that.  I liked the first version of alternative B, the one without the word \u201calso.\u201d  I think \u201calso\u201d damps the concern about inflation.  It kind of makes it a little too balanced for my taste.  I\u2019m also concerned\u2014I should say \u201cbroadly\u201d\u2014 that we seem to have left the impression over the past several months, since the beginning of the year, that our concerns about inflation fluctuate.  I agree with President Bullard.  What we ought to view as ideal is an equilibrium where inflation expectations are rock solid and don\u2019t change and, moreover, that people don\u2019t perceive our concerns and worry about inflation or the weight we\u2019re giving in policy deliberations as shifting from time to time.  So that\u2019s an aspect of our communications that concerns me.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  I want to thank everyone for your comments today.  I know we don\u2019t have agreement around the table, but as somebody once said, if everybody agrees, then everybody except one is redundant.  [Laughter]  I listened very carefully to what has been said.  I understand your concerns.  I think hard about them\u2014I do every day.  As we go forward, we will obviously continue to have these fruitful discussions.   I do think that we need to continue to clarify this exit strategy issue.  One point I would make, and Governor Warsh alluded to it, is that we need to think of this as a state-dependent rather than a time-dependent strategy.  We need to be clear not so much as to whether we are or are not going to raise rates but under what circumstances and why and what our objectives are.  On that basis, I reiterate that my greater attention recently to financial and real conditions has to do with my view of the risks rather than my objective function. I recommend no action today and alternative B.  There were a number of suggestions for changes.  I think I will avoid them just to avoid further controversy.  My reasons for suggesting alternative B were well stated by President Pianalto.  It\u2019s hard to judge.  I don\u2019t know what the markets will make of this, but my intention is for it to be slightly hawkish\u2014to indicate a slight upward tilt in policy\u2014which has several functions.  First, if we don\u2019t move, it emphasizes our ongoing concern with inflation and perhaps provides some prophylactic protection with respect to expectations and so on.  On the other hand, if conditions do warrant action, and it could be quick action, at least we will have provided the markets with some warning and some indication of our concern about this issue.  So that\u2019s my recommendation.  Any comments.  Would you call the roll"], "2008FOMC20080916meeting.txt": [" MR. LACKER.  Okay.  I know there was a lot of concern going in yesterday about the tri-party repo market, and I envisioned two scenarios and anything in between them.  One is tri-party lenders pulling away from particular names and moving their funds to other names.  Another, at the other extreme, would be tri-party repo lenders pulling away from the market as a whole.  If you look at the tri-party repo market from the point of view of the borrowers, that is a frightening scenario.  Then the lenders are going to do something with that money.  I have been curious about what they would do.  My understanding is that cash balances, in essentially deposit accounts, piled up at State Street and BONY yesterday and that they were able to do tri-party repos with some institutions that had been pulled away from.  Is that a valid observation.  What are the prospects for that providing some kind of resilience for the tri-party market", " MR. DUDLEY.  Well, I\u2019m not sure about that.  I thought that there was an issue about broker-dealer filing.  I know that the clearing banks are certainly quite nervous about that eventuality, but I\u2019m not a lawyer", " MR. DUDLEY.  The Bank of Japan has requested at the staff level to set up a facility that would be on the shelf for year-end because the Japanese are quite worried that their banks are going to face a dollar funding problem at year-end.  Now, this preceded the recent crisis, so even before this last week they were concerned that the Japanese banks could potentially have problems, and they were interested in exploring with us having a facility in place.  We were actually going to pursue this, and I hope we will have more at the October FOMC meeting if not sooner", " MR. LACKER.  Note here a sense of discomfort with our lending them dollars that they already have and so our serving as a substitute for their mobilizing their own dollar reserves for this purpose.  Obviously, the demand could swamp their own reserves, and at that point I would feel differently about this.  But my understanding is that the distribution within the European system of central banks is uneven, and in some sense this just provides them with a way to circumvent negotiating how those dollars would be distributed from different central banks to different private-sector banks within their own system.  Broadly, I\u2019m uncomfortable with our playing that role", "   MR. DUDLEY.  I think a lot of the programs that we have are actually open ended.  The discount window is open ended in the sense that it\u2019s limited only by the amount of collateral that the banks post there.  The Primary Dealer Credit Facility is open ended in that it is limited only by the size of the tri-party repo system.  My point here is that, if foreign banks worry about capacity limits, even having a large program could in principle not be sufficient in extremis.  But if the program is open ended, the rollover risk problem goes away.  If I lend you more dollars today, I don\u2019t have to worry about getting those dollars back because I always know that the facility is there.  So it\u2019s really the elimination of the ability to flatten out your position if you need to in terms of your dollar exposures", "   MR. HOENIG.  Mr. Chairman, I see no reason to focus on the details of the forecast.  Clearly, the economy is under stress, both as we look at the economic growth forecast and as we look at the inflation forecast.  So I recognize the amount of stress we are under here.  I would say to you, in dealing with that stress, I am fully supportive of the actions that we take in terms of liquidity\u2014the TAF and the other efforts to provide liquidity into the market.  These are tools that we can and should use for these kinds of shocks in a short-term context.  On the other hand, I would encourage the Committee to resist the impulse to ease policy in a sense of doing something.  The issue is not the level of our policy rate at this time.  It is the dysfunctioning of the markets that we hope our liquidity efforts will help address.  To begin to talk about easing or even to put language in there that suggests easing is to cause people, on the expectation that we might ease at some point even if we hold off now, to delay decisions that they would otherwise make that would benefit the economy. I also encourage us to look beyond the immediate crisis, which I recognize is serious.  But as pointed out here, we also have an inflation issue.  Our core inflation is still above where it should be.  Headline inflation has been up, even though there are some signs that commodities and energy are backing off.  But the businesses themselves are saying, \u201cHow do I recover my margin.\u201d  So there is no impulse to pass along those reductions.  We talk about wages and labor backing off.  But they are holding off, they are not backing off, and in negotiations they are much more antagonistic.  Those kinds of pressures will emerge at some point.  Those are the longer-run issues that I think we need to keep in mind as we deal with this immediate crisis.  So I would strongly encourage us to leave rates where they are, to be very careful with our language, not to encourage the expectation of further rate decreases, and to continue to be aggressive in our liquidity provisions as we have been the last several weeks and months.  Thank you", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The recent financial market news is shaking people\u2019s confidence dramatically.  But even before recent events, the evidence was already pointing to more effects of the financial crisis on the real economy than I had built into my projection at our last meeting.  The reports from my District contacts and the incoming data caused me to revise down my near-term output projection even before the latest round of financial market troubles.  The improvement in net exports that was reflected in the second-quarter GDP growth has not encouraged manufacturers in my District to revise up their export projections.  They are still holding firmly to the opinion that the global economy is slowing and that export growth will slow with it for several quarters.  Of course, manufacturers are concerned about weakness spreading further within their domestic customer base. The ongoing turmoil in financial markets continues to affect businesses in my District.  Some of the banks in my District are finding it very, very difficult to attract new capital and to manage their way out of trouble.  I am hearing that credit is harder to come by for many borrowers who in the recent past would not have thought twice about their creditworthiness.  Last week I met with a business contact with a very long and successful track record of buying and operating private companies.  He reported that he had reached a deal with a bank to finance a project at a 7 percent interest rate with the loan amortized over a fifteen-year term.  On the morning of the close just three days later, the bank faxed him the paperwork, which reflected a 12 percent interest rate on a non-amortizing loan with a 10-year term.  So the deal obviously is not going forward.  One of my directors, who heads a very large regional banking organization, reported at our board meeting last week that many banks are shedding assets and that in some cases they are walking away from longstanding customer relationships in order to do so.  He said that investors are very skeptical about putting new equity into banking deals and that those who have done so in the past vow not to be burned twice, let alone a third time. Of course, inflation remains an important issue as well.  My contacts, as Dave mentioned in his report, are not so confident that a broad array of intermediate and retail prices are actually going to move back down as a result of the recent decline in energy and other commodity prices.  Several of my contacts report that major suppliers are trying to maintain their prices despite the decline in raw material costs just to make up for a long period of absorbing price increases.  Nevertheless, most of my contacts agree that the commodity price environment has stabilized considerably, making me more confident that core inflation will gradually slow over the next couple of years.   At our last meeting, my forecast was broadly consistent with the Greenbook baseline.  Today my forecasts for output and prices are broadly similar to the Greenbook\u2019s for 2009 and 2010, although I am expecting more weakness in economic activity in the second half of this year than the Greenbook is forecasting.  My contacts in the manufacturing sector have persuaded me that exports are going to be weaker in the short term than I had previously thought, and I have also revised down my consumption path on the basis of the credit constraints on households.  Although I am more encouraged about the recent decline in energy and commodity prices, I would like to see further evidence of price stability in these markets and also continued stability in inflation expectations for a while longer before I reduce the upside risk that I place on my inflation outlook.  However, a growing risk to my outlook is that the short-term weakness that I have now built into my outlook extends further out into the forecast period.  I worry that my outlook doesn\u2019t fully capture all of the many ways in which financial forces at work in the economy are actually going to restrain spending. On Friday, I was convinced that the best course of action was to keep an even keel in these rough seas\u2014to be flexible, of course, but to look beyond the latest wave crashing over the bow.  Only six weeks ago, inflation risks were on the verge of being unacceptable, and today the troubles of Wall Street are the focus.  I was sure that we were going to be in for many more surprises; I just didn\u2019t know when and from where they would be coming.  So I supported not only keeping our policy unchanged but also keeping our language changes to a minimum even if that language missed some nuances of the outlook.  Given the events of the weekend, I still think it is appropriate for us to keep our policy rate unchanged.  I would like more time to assess how the recent events are going to affect the real economy.  I have a small preference for the assessment-of-risk language under alternative A.  I think it captures my concern that the downside risks have intensified.  However, I can support some of the comments and changes to highlight the financial market strains that were made by President Lockhart and President Stern.  So I can support the language under alternative B with some additional comments about the financial strains that we are facing.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But I think this is a historical fact\u2014that, once the banks became decapitalized, there were also capital injections into the banks in both of those cases", " MR. FISHER.  I am sort of indifferent about this, but I don\u2019t want to forget what Governor Duke was talking about.  It\u2019s not just financial markets; it\u2019s financial developments.  We are also talking about the internal dynamics of what is happening in the banking system and the credit contraction you spoke of.  So we lead off with financial markets.  I don\u2019t want people to think we are focusing only on markets\u2014Governor Warsh, I would disagree on that point.  It\u2019s a minor disagreement, but I think it is overkill", " MR.

As long as we are throwing monkey wrenches into the language, I think we do signal our concern.  In paragraph 2, we put the very first sentence, which says, \u201cStrains in financial markets have increased significantly.\u201d  So we have acknowledged that at the very top of this statement.  So there is no going back on that.  I am a little concerned about what moving back \u201cclosely\u201d means.  Another alternative that I\u2019ll throw out would be, rather than use \u201cclosely,\u201d to say that \u201cthe Committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments.\u201d   SEVERAL.

Mr. Chairman, this may be a conversation for another day, but it seems to me that we\u2019re ending up with more and more concentration\u2014Bank of America, Citicorp, Morgan\u2014and I\u2019m curious as to what we plan longer term so as not to displace the ability of other institutions to play their role in the financial markets and grow their businesses\u2014the super-regionals that are healthy and so on.  But I guess just philosophically what concerns me longer term is that, in response to these actions, there are no other people to take these steps, but we\u2019re creating larger and larger concentrations and bigger and bigger situations where we have too big to fail.  I\u2019d just like at some point to have a conversation on that matter.  I\u2019m not objecting to the move taken, obviously, but it is going to present a bigger problem as we go down the path because we\u2019re getting increasing concentration in fewer and fewer institutions.  Just a comment.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Yes, Brian.  So at 50 basis points under the target rate for excess, it sounds as though your philosophy here is just to limit the tails of the intraday funds rate distribution rather than to attract a lot of funds and replace the Treasury program.  Is that accurate.  I mean, how do you intend to approach that question"], "2008FOMC20081007confcall.txt": ["  [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.

I also support the policy action and really have nothing to add in terms of its rationale.  But in the statement there is really no reference to the coordinated and global nature of the action.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s purposeful.  It does seem to me that we have an opportunity perhaps to reinforce the psychological power of this by referencing it.  So my question is, Why not include some nod to that aspect, which in the minds of so many people seems to be the real power behind this decision.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. PLOSSER.

Let me just state my understanding of this so that I can be corrected by Nathan or by Bill.  These countries hold substantial amounts of their reserves in dollars.  They hold a substantial fraction of those dollars in accounts at the New York Fed.  If they defaulted on their piece of the swap and the falling value of their currency left us with some exposure, we would have the ability to take assets from their accounts to cover any loss.  So it\u2019s better than the fact that this is a sovereign credit and it is better than the fact that we have an asset on the other side of the swap, because they hold substantial foreign exchange reserves with us.  The way to think about this is just as a mechanism to help them transform the composition of their dollar reserves in a way that might be more effective in responding to lender-of-last-resort needs in dollars, rather than having to sell Treasuries or agencies into the market in a period of panic or distress to meet that cash need.  I meant it as a confirming question", " MR. SHEETS.  I agree", " MR. LACKER.  Yes.  President Geithner, you described the EMEs as motivated by a desire to transform their reserves from illiquid Treasuries or from Treasuries to some more fungible and more convenient form of dollars.  That strongly suggests collateralizing their swap line with the Treasuries rather than their own currency.  What would be the disadvantage of doing that", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  The question is whether, in an unlikely but possible state of the world in which they don\u2019t want to pay us back, they could withdraw their Treasuries in advance of defaulting", " MR. PLOSSER.  I guess my question is why we can\u2019t use the swap line that is already in existence", " MR. HOENIG.  No, no.  In fact, it follows right on with what Nathan was just answering.  That is, for the moment we are creating kind of a broader in-list for these four countries and stigma with the non-accepted group at this point.  What will happen, then, if we do have an issue that involves\u2014pick a country\u2014Chile.  Are we going to send them to the IMF.  Are we going to have our subcommittee make a decision as to whether to give them a swap.  If we do that, will that then create uncertainties about others.  Are you really not concerned about the stigma and the implications of this, especially\u2014I guess they are asking this in anticipation of the possibility, even though they think it\u2019s fairly remote\u2014would we not be increasing the probabilities of a problem by doing this now.  I know these are tough questions; but in this environment, I am anticipating a bad event.  So what do we do in the case of that bad event", "  MR. LOCKHART.  Another question for Nathan on swap lines is how this works exactly.  If the pattern holds and Mexico, for example, supports its banking system\u2014in the case of Mexico it is a little different from others, in that all of the large banks are foreign-owned (Citibank owns Banamex, and the Spanish banks own the other two or three large banks)\u2014where does our responsibility stop and theirs begin.  Is it possible for the subsidiary of a U.S. bank or a Spanish bank to draw dollar liquidity in Mexico and with fungible dollars move that around the world.  Or does it in one manner or another stay in Mexico", " MR. LOCKHART.  So in the case of a foreign bank\u2014they lend to a foreign bank in their country, in Mexico in this case\u2014defaulting, whose problem is it.  Is it the home country supervisor\u2019s problem, or is it Mexico\u2019s problem vis-\u00e0-vis us", " MR. LACKER.  What sort of uncertainty might this engender about the likelihood of other countries qualifying.  My recollection is that many economists have claimed that the IMF had this trouble in the 1990s, when interventions would give rise to uncertainty about subsequent interventions in other cases", "  They\u2019re not remotely able to meet the needs of\u2014 MR. PLOSSER.  We don\u2019t know what the needs are yet, do we", " MR. SHEETS.  Again, we\u2019re drawing lines here.  I am not prepared to give these folks carte blanche.  That\u2019s why we\u2019ve added additional safeguards and additional governance structures to these facilities.  Maybe the Committee has a different view on that, but I wouldn\u2019t be prepared to let them do whatever they wanted with these resources", " MR. FISHER.  So what\u2019s his argument.  I would assume that you asked these questions", " MR. SHEETS.  Yes, absolutely", " MR. PLOSSER.  I guess I\u2019ll approve, but with reluctance.  I think this is a very slippery slope.  I\u2019m worried about other central banks ganging up on us as a group, saying that they have to have this.  I would prefer that even these large countries use some combination of the IMF facility plus their own reserves to meet these needs.  I think that would be a better outcome and better for us in that regard.  So that\u2019s a very reluctant \u201cyea\u201d vote.  I\u2019d also insist that any further expansion come back before this Committee", " MR. DUDLEY.  Right, but I still think that generally a bank faced with a choice of having risk with the Fed or selling fed funds to another bank would want to be compensated for that risk of selling, so they are going to get some positive spread", " MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While the LIBOR\u2013OIS spread has narrowed somewhat, the mutual fund industry is no longer experiencing waves of redemptions, and commercial paper market conditions have improved, we\u2019re still not back to the short-term credit conditions that prevailed before the failure of Lehman Brothers.  This outcome is striking considering the historic interventions that have occurred in the past month.  With all of the new government guarantees and equity infusions here and abroad, the limited improvement in short-term credit markets attests to the degree of concern and risk aversion prevailing in financial markets. These concerns are likely to become even more elevated if the economy slows to the degree expected in most forecasts.  Like the Greenbook, our forecast anticipates a significant recession.  The Boston forecast includes three consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth and results in an unemployment rate peaking above 7\u00bd percent.  The weakening labor market and the large losses in housing and stock wealth make it quite likely that consumption will shrink in the second half of this year.  While we need housing to reach bottom, mortgage rates relative to federal funds rates remain quite high, and further job losses are likely to aggravate the upward trend in foreclosures and add to the downward pressure on housing prices.  With limited new home purchases and demand for vehicles weak, consumption of consumer durables is unlikely to recover until next year.  Commercial real estate, which has held up reasonably well, all things considered, is likely to be much weaker next year as new and rollover financing is difficult to obtain and staff cuts and hiring freezes affect the space needed by businesses.  More generally, firms are likely to have little incentive to make new investments until the severity of the downturn becomes much clearer.  Unfortunately, many of our trading partners are likely to face an even more severe downturn, aggravated by their slow fiscal and monetary response to deteriorating economic and financial conditions", " MR. PLOSSER.  Yes", " CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  But it rises because of the financial situation.  I see", " MR. STOCKTON.6  Yes.  You have at your place a table on orders and shipments of durable goods, one of the more inscrutable releases to actually make sense of, but the bottom line is very little effect on our basic outlook here.  As you can see in that second set of numbers, the shipments area excluding the aircraft line was up 2 percent in September.  That was actually a little stronger than we had penciled in, but only enough to add a few basis points to GDP growth in the third quarter.  Then you can see that it has basically been averaging flat for the last two months.  This is a September figure, so it\u2019s fairly dated at this point.  The orders figures, the set of numbers above\u2014again looking at the \u201cexcluding aircraft\u201d line\u2014have been coming down.  I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019re collapsing, but they\u2019re certainly weakening some.  So this really has no appreciable effect on our outlook for a small decline in equipment spending in the third quarter and a more appreciable decline in the fourth", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I favor alternative A, a 50 basis point cut in the funds rate.  This action, and even more, is justified by the dramatic developments since our last meeting\u2014a deepening of the recessionary outlook worldwide, the near meltdown of the global financial system, and the abatement of inflationary pressures.  Frankly, it is time for all hands on deck when it comes to our policy tools, and the fed funds rate should be no exception.  Although we cut the funds rate 50 basis points a few weeks ago, the Greenbook inflation projection was revised down more than that, so the ex ante real funds rate actually edged up over the intermeeting period. We need to do much more and the sooner, the better.  One might argue against such a policy move in favor of a wait-and-see approach to better gauge if the recent flurry of policy initiatives will turn things around.  In normal times, I would have some sympathy for this argument, but these are about as far from normal times as we can get.  We are in the midst of a global economic and financial freefall, and the confidence of households, businesses, and investors is in shambles.  The adverse feedback loop is playing out with a vengeance.  Lenders continue to ratchet up terms and standards, sapping the ability of households and businesses to spend.  As the economy weakens, further loan defaults will mushroom. I think strong, clear action is needed.  Historical precedents, such as the case of Japan, teach us that it is a mistake to act cautiously as the economy unravels.  I think the clear lesson from both economic theory and real-world experience is to lower rates as quickly as possible to avoid a deeper and more protracted recession, not to keep our powder dry or to wait to use tools until later if they are available to us now.  The more medicine we give and the sooner we give it, the better.  The Bluebook optimal policy simulations tell us that, absent the zero bound, the funds rate should be lowered well below zero next year.  Since that is not an option, we should do the most with what we\u2019ve got and cut the funds rate aggressively now", " MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I strongly favor alternative A, a 50 basis point cut in our fed funds target rate today.  I think it is important for us to move aggressively and quickly to offset the strong forces that are acting to depress economic activity.  I know that some prefer a more measured response, especially as we move closer to the zero bound, but the lesson I take from history is that more and sooner is better than taking smaller steps over time.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The economic outlook has definitely deteriorated.  On top of the slowing at the beginning of the third quarter, a sequence of policy actions and statements has spread an inchoate fear.  In response to that, a wide variety of economic agents have delayed outlays.  The breathtaking credit market interventions that we have undertaken in the last several weeks are going to make it hard to judge whether those markets are stabilized.  It is going to make it even harder to judge how and when to withdraw.   Governor Duke asked rhetorically what it would take for recovery to begin.  I think it is not going to be a very healthy recovery unless we have made substantial progress toward withdrawing these interventions.  I know it\u2019s probably premature in the midst of a crisis to be talking about the recovery, but a number of people did, and I think it makes sense on the grounds that President Plosser advanced for us to be thinking ahead.  President Geithner talked about the will and the desire and that it amounts to a matter of will to reverse course later on.  I think that in withdrawing these subsidies and these credit market interventions is where we are going to need the will.  It is going to be really hard to disenfranchise somebody who now has access to one of these programs. The inflation outlook has improved.  Expected inflation has come down.  A couple of people have noted that.  That brings the real rate where the interest rate is now\u2014to about zero.  So I can favor a 50 point reduction in the federal funds rate target at this meeting.  I think a funds rate that is, in real terms as best as we can measure it, about minus 1 percent is how we should see our way through here, at least in the near term.  Like President Evans, I will mention the 1930s.  What I take from my reading of the Great Depression is that this is what central banks should do in times like this\u2014keep real interest rates low. Let me make a couple of brief observations.  As I mentioned yesterday, I think we are going to face a challenge communicating about our strategy.  If we need to reduce interest rates to the lowest practical level to which we feel we can reduce them, I think yesterday\u2019s discussion suggests that the Committee could use a refresher course on the monetary economics of the zero bound.  I applaud President Bullard for his breaking new ground by providing a figure from the Journal of Economic Theory.  [Laughter]   I want to put something on the table about the federal funds rate.  We are voting today on the target for the federal funds rate.  The way our operations are conducted now, we are leaving so many excess reserves in the system that we are driving the federal funds rate down to the interest rate on reserves.  The interbank risk premium is likely to become small as the FDIC guarantee becomes well understood and more broadly effective.  The GSEs are likely to catch on that they deserve more on their funds.  Small banks, as Governor Duke says, that haven\u2019t really paid attention to what this new regime is about are going to find that brokers are going to be able to find them placements at closer to the interest rate on reserves.  So I think that the sloppy trading below the interest rate on reserves is going to fade over time.  As long as we have excess reserves at the scale that we do, as long as the Desk has added that many reserves, we are going to have the effective federal funds rate at the interest rate on reserves.  Because we are voting on the federal funds target rate, I think that the Committee ought to have some understanding from the staff that either excess reserves are going to be drawn down to the point that the effective rate is lifted off the interest rate on the reserves floor or\u2014and this would be my preferable course of action\u2014we raise the interest rate on reserves to equal the target rate.  Otherwise, we are voting on something, but we are actually doing something else.  I can understand the desire to err on the side of soft rates.  This is what we did in August 2007.  But as rates go down, we need to be more and more careful about what the Committee is actually voting on", " MR. PLOSSER.  I\u2019d just like to just take a moment to react.  I\u2019m not sure whom you heard saying that the result was primarily a result of this Committee\u2019s actions or the Chairman\u2019s actions or anyone else\u2019s actions.  If those were words you were putting in my mouth, that was not what I said, President Geithner.  I do think I have been supportive of almost all the actions in terms of liquidity facilities; I supported the actions.  I also was supportive of the Lehman Brothers decision.  But I think it\u2019s a far cry from saying that uncertainty about policies contributes to uncertainty\u2014which you agreed to\u2014it\u2019s a far cry from that to saying we lay the blame at the feet of this Committee or the Chairman.  So I don\u2019t know what straw man you were setting up, but it certainly didn\u2019t apply to this member of the Committee.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " VICE CHAIRMAN GEITHNER.  The expected duration of the next part of our meeting is four hours, three hours"], "2008FOMC20081216meeting.txt": ["  CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  There was a sharp decline in the spike in the fails recently", " MR. HOENIG.  Bill, in your discussion on exhibit 13 and around the idea that a number of resets are coming for mortgages\u2014the earlier seven-year ARMs and so forth\u2014and as you also look forward to where mortgage rates are, why are you anticipating trouble with the ability to refinance, given the outlook for mortgages rates", " MR. DUDLEY.  I think you have to distinguish between conforming mortgage markets and everything else.  The conforming mortgage market is doing fine.  Some spreads are a little wider than they have been historically, but our actions seem to have been pretty successful in bringing those spreads in a bit.  So the conforming mortgage market rate is fine.  The problem is in commercial-mortgage-backed securities and nonconforming mortgages.  The appetite to provide financing there is very, very much impaired, especially in the commercial mortgage market", " MR. DUDLEY.  So excluding the guaranteed stuff, the issuance volumes do not look as robust as the aggregate number suggests because so much of that is the guaranteed stuff", " MR. BULLARD.  At the beginning of your comments, you said that you expected further big mark-to-market losses.  Do you mean over and above what markets anticipate now", " MR. WILCOX.  President Lacker, it\u2019s a complicated security, but it\u2019s wrapped by a guarantee that ultimately the Department of Education will make good on to the tune of 97 cents on the dollar.  There\u2019s one little detail that is causing another piece of friction in the market, and that is that, if the servicer doesn\u2019t perform on the loan, then the Department of Education has the right to not make good on the guarantee.  But other than that, it\u2019s about 97 percent guaranteed", " MR. DUDLEY.  It might work eventually, but right now I would guess the spread between the effective funds rate and the target would be bigger than that.  We\u2019re sort of running that experiment right now.  The market consensus is that the Fed is going to reduce the target 50 basis points at this meeting.  That\u2019s incorporated in the current federal funds rate trading because it\u2019s the lowest interest on excess reserves during the two-week maintenance period.  We\u2019re trading in a range of about 10 to 15 basis points.  We don\u2019t have that much information, but right now that spread is probably 35 to 40 basis points.  So I think we probably couldn\u2019t do what you said.  If we worked on it\u2014you know, took the GSEs and made it so that they couldn\u2019t sell fed funds and did a few other things\u2014maybe we could get that spread down to 25 basis points over time.  Brian, do you have anything", " MR. FISHER.  And what is the order of magnitude", " MS. AARONSON.  Exactly.  It is a Lilien type of dispersion index.  This isn\u2019t actually how we calculate it, but it is essentially how the industry\u2019s share of employment changes relative to total employment.  So it is the growth in that industry\u2019s employment relative to total employment.  What we do is that we know that over the business cycle each industry has a typical pattern\u2014durables employment goes down a lot during recessions whereas, say, health care doesn\u2019t go down that much.  Those types of changes aren\u2019t typically associated with sectoral reallocation.  That is, we don\u2019t really think of those things that are typical over the cycle as being associated with an increase in the NAIRU.  We want to take those out, so we take out the typical cyclical movements, such as manufacturing always goes down in a recession and finance is acyclical", " MR. SHEETS.  The European banks are particularly exposed, much more so than U.S. banks or Japanese banks.  A big chunk of that exposure is to central and eastern Europe, and as you suggest, we see significant risks to the European banks as a result of that exposure.  What makes it even a little dicier is that exposure is concentrated in several countries, particularly Sweden, Austria, and to a slightly lesser extent Italy.  Recently there has been significant economic turmoil in Hungary and Ukraine.  The Fund has stepped in, and the EU has helped as well with large financing packages.  The latest one we\u2019re watching very closely is the situation in Latvia, where the exchange rate is significantly overvalued.  The external position looks very, very dicey.  The Fund is in there negotiating a program.  There has been a lot of back and forth about what should be done with the exchange rate regime.  The banking system also looks vulnerable\u2014so what should be done with the banks.  It is not exactly clear how all that is going to be resolved.  My personal feeling is that, given the risks\u2014and the Europeans recognize the extent of the risks\u2014if Latvia goes, it could blow out the rest of the Baltics and then sweep around into Central and Eastern Europe and then feed back into Western Europe.  So I see the risks there as being of first order for the Europeans. Given that recognition, I think that the EU and major European governments are going to do what\u2019s necessary to make sure that the situation in Latvia stabilizes at least for a while.  The end game over the next several years is very much an open issue for a lot of these economies that were in ERM-II and evolving into hoping to adopt the euro.  I think that there are potentially some very pronounced vulnerabilities and some painful adjustment that will need to happen in some of those Central and Eastern European countries.  So absolutely that is a major risk.  It\u2019s one we\u2019re watching as closely as we can", " MS. CUMMING.  Thank you.  I thought I would make a couple of points that underscore the substantial increase in the downside risks that we incorporated into the forecast that you all received on Friday.  That change was really encouraged by our economic advisory panel, which suggested that the downside risks were much larger than we were estimating at the end of November. First, we have been meeting, as of course all of you do, with small business people.  Bill Dudley put a panel of investors together, too, and I have a couple observations out of that and our discussions with community bankers.  One is that the cutbacks in financing are very real.  There is a lot of evidence that the banks are going in and looking at lines and cutting them back to both investors and the small-business community.  The small business community is also on the receiving end of much tighter financial management at their larger customers\u2014that is, the people they\u2019re supplying\u2014as those firms are not paying their bills or are extending the terms on which they pay their bills to a much greater number of days.  That has induced a hunkering-down mentality on the part of the small business owners.  The other sobering thing they pointed out to us\u2014and this is very much in line with Governor Duke\u2019s comments about the community banks yesterday; we hear the same thing\u2014is that small businesses and the community banks can hold out for a while but not forever; margins are getting squeezed, and financing is getting squeezed.  The precautionary actions that the small businesses are taking will help them for a while, but they can\u2019t hold out for more than six or nine months. That is a particularly sobering statement for us in the Second District because, despite the fact that we are at the epicenter of the financial industry in New York\u2014a major driver for the Second District economy\u2014we have only just barely started to feel the effects of layoffs and reductions in activity in the city.  Our regional leading indicator index went down very, very sharply in the month of October, but that is still to be realized in the economy.  In particular, when we have looked at past episodes, the declines in incomes that we have suffered in the region have ranged between 4 percent and 10 percent in the financial industry when we actually get into one of these adverse periods.  That decline is usually spread over three or four years, so we are really talking about something that could last a good bit longer than six to nine months in our District. Second, we do a survey of inflation expectations that is in many ways similar to the Michigan survey, and our survey results are almost completed and are very similar to those of the Michigan survey.  But we do ask one question that isn\u2019t asked there, and that is about the longer run\u2014that is, the 2010-11 outlook for prices and inflation.  From that we can impute a risk of deflation, which was 6 or 7 percent in early October and is now 12 percent.  So that risk of deflation seems to be growing even in the kind of population that is surveyed by the Michigan folks.  Thank you", "   CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I understand.  I\u2019m just saying that there are also different ways to do it.  We could also just target a higher inflation rate, which is probably another way of doing it", " MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As gloomy as our last meeting was, conditions have deteriorated substantially further since then.  Practically all of my contacts reported that economic events had turned sharply lower once again in the last three to five weeks.  This goes well beyond the auto sector and other parts of the District that have been struggling for some time.  The most optimistic comment from my directors was this, \u201cAt least Iowa is going to hell slower than everywhere else.\u201d  [Laughter]  It is tough to follow that accounting joke, you know\u2014that was good.  More seriously, the most optimistic theme I heard from a number of business contacts went something like this, \u201cWe are conserving cash and furiously cutting costs by year-end.  But we hope to pause in the first quarter and take stock of where conditions appear to be heading.  Then, we will act accordingly.\u201d  Frankly, I doubt such a wait-and-see pause in cost-cutting will occur that soon. For the purposes of this meeting and our actions over the next few months, I agree with the main thrust of the Greenbook projection.  We are facing large contractions in the next two quarters, and I don\u2019t expect to see meaningfully positive growth before the fourth quarter.  I think we need substantial further accommodation after today\u2019s meeting.  I see the timing and the size of those actions for the most part being shaped by the large recessionary forces in train and the enormous financial headwinds. The disinflationary forces in play clearly are strong, but currently I do not expect that they will prove large enough to generate outright deflation.  In terms of my earlier question about the Greenbook forecast\u2014as I understand the way it was put together\u2014if the quantitative easing helps, monetary policy would be somewhere between the funds rate at zero and the optimal control.  So, in fact, it would be a little better than I first suspected.  Inflation would be somewhat above that path.  That might be a useful benchmark to watch for if we are fortunate enough for the forecast to be that stable, but time will tell. Quantitative easing should also lead to an increase in the monetary base.  I don\u2019t know if there was any lasting conflict between your comments and President Lacker\u2019s, but I think that what we have contemplated will lead to the base increasing and that will generate expectations about inflation beyond just Taylor-rule dynamics, I would guess.  In fact, there is certainly a lot of discussion and criticism out there that our balance sheet is going to lead to large inflationary risks.  I don\u2019t share that, given how I think we will unwind the programs.  But that certainly would help, and it would move us in that direction.  So I will keep an open mind on deflationary risk.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be brief.  In the Eighth District, there is a clear and sharp downturn, as in the national picture.  There is a clear turn to survival strategies, and you really see that when key CEOs and other figures start talking about lower capital expenditures for 2009, cutting the lower levels in 2008 in half or more.  I think that\u2019s very consistent with the Greenbook.  The effects on our District from any auto restructuring may be substantial, and that is something I have ratcheted up here in the last few months.  A common theme among all contacts\u2014and it echoes some of what has been said around the table here\u2014is that rate cuts at this point will have no effect on the macroeconomy.  Their thinking is, well, of course, since short-term Treasuries are trading at zero\u2014I think one-month Treasuries actually hit zero here a bit ago\u2014they are not going to have any effect.  But as Governor Duke pointed out yesterday, and I think this is an important concern, the impact on bank profitability may be substantial, exactly at the wrong time.  First Vice President Cumming picked that up, too.  I think that is a concern.  I think it suggests favoring an option of de-emphasizing the federal funds rate as a target at this meeting, as we will get to in the policy discussion.  But then you might not trigger this prime rate cut that would otherwise normally accompany a major move by the Fed. On the national picture, I expect a sharp downturn in the fourth quarter and the first quarter.  Expectations are extremely negative now and extremely fluid.  I think that is probably the biggest factor facing us going forward into 2009.  The expectations are so fluid that they portend a deflationary environment if we do not control the situation very soon.  I am also very concerned about the global aspect because we haven\u2019t really seen this kind of coordination across the globe in the rapid movement to probably zero interest rates.  I don\u2019t think we really know what that means going forward.  We are going to be looking at bad news coming in at least until summer, and we have no way at this point to signal a reaction to that bad news via normal policy.  That is the gravity of the situation, and in some ways it is the downside of a preemptive policy.  Had I been on the Committee earlier this year, I would have supported the preemptive policy to try to avoid this situation.  But one downside of it is that you do not have the ability to continually react as bad news comes in. In sum, I think we are moving to a Japanese-style deflationary, zero nominal interest rate, situation at an alarming pace.  To stay in the game and control expectations, we need a Volcker-like transformation, something like\u2014although the situation is different\u2014the \u201979 announcement, which knocked private-sector priors off the idea that they should trigger all reactions to announcements on nominal interest rates.  You need a dramatic move that emphasizes this new reality.  Continued focus on the federal funds rate at this point would not face that reality.   Above all, we have to establish in the minds of the private sector\u2014and maybe in our own minds as well\u2014that we control medium-term inflation.  We should take the attitude that we can create the inflation we need to stay near target by one means or another.  I think, actually, this may be an excellent time to set the inflation target, although it sounds as though we are drifting away from that.  But if I can argue for it for a few minutes here, I think it might have an important effect on the navigation through the recession during 2009.  Of course, in normal times, to undertake some action like that, we would want a lot of study, and we would want to have time to talk it through with the Congress and other interested parties, as we would for interest on reserves.  But we don\u2019t have that luxury right now.  We want to take the action now to help control the situation, and I think we could sell that as a work in progress, which can be modified later.  But we do want to keep these expectations under control in this very fluid situation.  Thank you", "  MR. WARSH.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Several quick points.  First, the latest leg of deterioration, which began in mid-September, is showing few signs of abating, as Governor Kohn suggested.  I think the November retail sales data look like a head fake.  Revisions to September and October, as the Greenbook suggested, make us think that November was probably worse and December worse still.  So in some ways I think our job is difficult because the weakness seems to be accelerating. Globally, the deterioration is found everywhere.  The data are playing catch-up.  I am less optimistic that foreign activity will perform as well as the Greenbook suggests and that foreign activity will respond in 2010 because of lags in policy response and less flexibility in their labor markets, their product markets, and their political markets.  The depth and the degree of the fall in data and policymakers\u2019 expectations overseas, particularly in Asia, are remarkable, shocking even, and I think we are likely to see policy responses there that are hard to judge but are likely to be changing pretty quickly. In terms of U.S. households, real household net worth has collapsed about 15 percent or so through the end of the third quarter\u2014more than in 2001 and more than in 1974.  Ongoing declines in financial markets and house prices are likely to depress wealth further in the fourth quarter and beyond.  So-called savings from lower energy prices look as though they pale in comparison to what else is happening to U.S. household balance sheets.  As we have discussed before, every asset everywhere in the world is being revalued, and households are feeling it. In terms of financial markets, I will underscore what Dan suggested and what Bill suggested yesterday\u2014the significant overall deterioration in conditions.  We all have a tendency at this point in the year to say, \u201cWell, there are a lot of year-end effects, and we are not going to really know until we get through this period.\u201d  We have had baby versions of year-end effects in the quarter-end effects in almost every meeting that we have had, and I have been a little dismissive of those.  I would say that there does appear to be more year-end stuff going on in these markets than there has been since this period of weakness began.   If you think about the two former investment banks that have balance sheets and year-ends that close at the end of November, this is the last quarter in which they will have that.  They have had more demands and more interest in, in effect, renting out their balance sheet as their customers\u2019 balance sheets end in December than they ever have had.  The prices that are being paid for them to rent their balance sheets\u2014to take exposures off the balance sheets of their clients\u2014suggest that maybe, just maybe, the year-end effects are more significant this time than they were in the previous six or seven quarters.  It doesn\u2019t give me a ton of optimism, but in January, market functioning could look a little better, and I think that would be the best news we have seen for a while.  You have heard me say before that, until we see market functioning improving and until we see these markets clearing, it is unrealistic to expect the real economy to turn.  I still think that is true. Turning to two final items, inflation and the fiscal package\u2014on the inflation front, although there are risks in this environment for prices to fall below those consistent with price stability, I still believe that these risks are not likely to materialize in the medium term.  So I take stock of, but ultimately discount, the Greenbook\u2019s deflation alternative simulation.  On the fiscal front, more, bigger, faster is what is going to happen inevitably to what I would describe as the first fiscal package of 2009.  The trillion dollar number over two years, which is now being bandied about, is larger than the Greenbook forecast and looks almost assured, with a greater share going to the states in my view than in the Greenbook forecast, more toward public infrastructure, perhaps less toward tax cuts on a relative basis than in the Greenbook, but bigger.  I would be surprised if that initial package isn\u2019t supplemented through larger annual appropriations and another stimulus package, if not by the end of 2009 then by 2010.  As a result, my own sense would be that the 2010 deficit is likely to be significantly larger than the Greenbook forecast.  Now, knowing the precise contours of this fiscal package is tough.  I would say the only good news is that the duration of the slowdown is likely to suggest that the fiscal package may end up being somewhat more permanent in its incentives and somewhat more permanent in its effects; and I suspect, because of that, it is likely to provide some good news to the economy.  But I wouldn\u2019t expect that to happen in the next twelve or eighteen months, other than perhaps a bit of benefit on the arithmetic.  In terms of changing the overall contour, pace, and strength of the resilient economy, I would say that is still quite a way off.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman", " MR. LACKER.  They do seem inconsistent, though, and I think it is something, Mr. Chairman, that we ought to consider", " MR. PLOSSER.  Just a follow-up on that.  I am a little confused that we don\u2019t set a target but we are operating under an interest on reserves scheme by which we pay a deposit rate, which in fact we just lowered.  Is there some kind of disconnect between what is in alternative A, paragraph 5\u2014lowering the discount rate and the interest rates on reserves\u2014and not noting a change in the target rate when, in fact, we have already established that the deposit rate is going to be the target rate.  So I am confused.  Maybe the markets will see through this, but I don\u2019t know.  I am not quite sure I understand what is going on and how this would work, in terms of communications or interpretations", " MR. PLOSSER.  I guess my trouble is that the Committee judged that it is not useful to set a specific target for the funds rate and yet this will be interpreted as that we reduced the target in effect", " MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think, at the end of the day, alternatives A and B really amount to the same thing in terms of policy.  So I could live with either, but on communication grounds, my own strong preference would be for B.  I think it is important at this juncture for the FOMC to state very clearly what it wants the federal funds rate to be, that we want it to remain close to zero, and I think we best do that by specifying explicitly a rate or, as it is, a range.  Both A and B eliminate the gap we have had between the target and the reality of where the funds rate is actually trading, but B eliminates that gap by embracing the current reality as desirable.   In contrast, it seems to me that A is saying that the Committee is all but helpless to affect the funds rate, so, after all, it would be a charade to set a target.  Then it kind of acknowledges, well, but, you know, the funds rate trading near zero is really not such a bad thing, given the weakness in the economy.  I think we have greater command over the funds rate\u2019s destiny than alternative A suggests.  If the Board and the FOMC really wanted to push the effective funds rate up above zero, say to 50 or to 100 basis points, the Board could choose to raise the rates paid on reserves and the discount rate, and we could get it up, even though we have all of this enormous quantity of excess reserves and even though interest on reserves isn\u2019t working in quite the way we expected.  I agree that it would be a bit odd to be setting the interest on reserves and discount rates above our target for the federal funds rate.  But it seems to me it could be done, and we are not powerless to accomplish it.  So I don\u2019t like the suggestion that we are just helpless to move the funds rate.  I think we should say that we don\u2019t want to move the funds rate up.  I don\u2019t want it to trade above the 0 to 25 basis point errange.  I certainly don\u2019t want that.  I think the forecast is grim.  I think we should go as low as we can as fast as we can without harming the functioning of money markets, so keeping the funds rate trading in the 0 to 25 range is desirable.  If it were to be the case, following President Lacker\u2019s earlier question, that we suddenly saw the interest on reserves floor working better and fed funds started trading above 25\u2014the funds rate could, for example, move up to 50 or so\u2014I would hope that the Board would actually lower the interest rate paid on reserves to hold the funds rate in the 0 to 25 range.  So I think we should go down and do it decisively in one step today.   On the other matters, in alternative B, paragraph 3, I favor including the bracketed language suggesting that we expect and are not happy to see inflation declining below levels we consider consistent with price stability.  I agree with President Evans on the merits of doing that.  I like the forward-looking language from A that has been added in bold to B concerning the odds that we will keep the funds rate low for some time.  On the Treasuries, I am worried about making an announcement or giving a hint that we are not going to follow through on them pretty quickly.  I am personally in favor of and support buying longer-term Treasuries, and I haven\u2019t heard a lot of opposition to it.  If we really are going to do it and do it pretty soon, I have no problem with including language to that effect.  But I don\u2019t think we should throw a hint out there unless we intend to follow through.  With respect to the wording of the directive, I am happy with it.  With respect to the issue about the monetary base and increasing the size of our balance sheet, I would endorse Governor Kohn\u2019s remarks on that topic", "   MR. DUDLEY.  We can do it, but we\u2019re under a strain.  As long as we don\u2019t start until sometime in January, I think we could manage, as long as you don\u2019t ask us to do it every day", " MR. LOCKHART.  I can confuse the matter by saying that I was thinking of it in alternative B, and Ms. Cumming has it in alternative A.  So somewhere in there", " MR. KROSZNER.  Thank you very much.  Obviously you have a bleak outlook.  It\u2019s very important to act quickly and decisively, and I think it\u2019s clear from the discussion that our choice is between A and B.  But as a number of people have mentioned, the economic substance is probably nearly identical in alternatives A and B.  Our exposition of it, though, can make a very big difference. There are an enormous number of moving parts, and there is a lot to digest.  We potentially have here, as I count them, seven new things that people have brought up.  That\u2019s just an enormous amount to deal with, and I think some of them we want to delay.  The inflation target is very important, but it brings up issues here, and I\u2019m not sure that we want to talk about something like that now.  So let me just quickly run through these. We have to think about the dynamic of what we are going to say next time.  What is this committing us to talk about.  First, the rate cut is one very big issue\u201475 versus 50 basis points.  Although some market participants think it will be 75, I think that will still be news, but I think it\u2019s very important for us to move there.  Second, just moving to a range is something new; I think that is something that is actually quite newsworthy in and of itself.  Going to no target at all is extremely newsworthy, maybe too newsworthy to include with all these other things.  I think of this and the discussions that we\u2019ve had as setting up an extremely valuable template for how we should be thinking about the statement and what we need to be explaining today as well as over the next few meetings.  So I would actually say that, given all of the moving parts and all of the changes, talking about a range either \u201cbetween\u201d or \u201cof\u201d zero to \u00bc percent would make a lot of sense.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re introducing any more ambiguity.  I think we\u2019re introducing a bit of ambiguity especially for people who are not that well informed by saying that we don\u2019t have a target anymore.  What President Yellen said was that it could easily be misinterpreted as \u201cgosh, we don\u2019t really have control over these things anymore anyway.\u201d  I don\u2019t think any of us believes that, and I think there\u2019s more of a chance of that misinterpretation, which I don\u2019t want us to have, if we do that today with all the other changes than if we waited a little.  I still think the range is a pretty big shift.  Expressing concerns about inflation being less than the level fostering economic growth\u2014again, I think that\u2019s something that I would prefer to wait on.  I like President Stern\u2019s edit about talking about the appreciable diminution of inflationary pressures, but I would wait on putting in the phrase about whether the level is too low to be consistent with fostering economic growth.  I mentioned the inflation target.  I think we should wait on that.  We\u2019re introducing conditionality, which I think is valuable to do, and I think the phrase there is fine.  We\u2019re talking about old and new programs as well as balance sheet issues.  As a number of people have mentioned, we have already talked about standing ready to expand the purchases of agency securities as conditions warrant.  So that\u2019s forward leaning already.  If we are committed to doing the Treasury securities fairly soon, I think we should just go along with that and feel comfortable with that.  But we do have to think a bit about the precedent of making concrete new policies that we\u2019ve generally talked about in this statement.  Is it something that we want to do going forward.  Does this commit us to doing that.  I don\u2019t think so, but I think we should just think about that. Then I think it\u2019s very important that we talk about the use of the balance sheet.  I agree with Governor Warsh that to be bold you don\u2019t say \u201ccontinue to.\u201d  But we are talking about some existing programs, so in some sense we are continuing.  I\u2019m not quite sure exactly where we want to go on this, but I just wanted to raise that ambiguity.  On the balance sheet, though, I go back to the Chairman\u2019s remarks from yesterday.  It is important to think about the composition of the balance sheet, not just the size in and of itself\u2014Governor Kohn also made reference to this\u2014so I would be very wary of focusing on the size here.  I think that just talking about ways to use the balance sheet is the appropriate way to go now.  If we have more experience and understand better how the size might evolve over time, how the different programs we have might fluctuate, I\u2019d feel more comfortable with that.  If we talk about the size or commitment to growth of that size or expecting it to be large, just as a number of people said, it could suddenly shrink, and we don\u2019t want people to think that we\u2019re changing monetary policy because of that.  Some of these things would just be changing over time.  Thank you", "\u201d MR. LACKER.  So the target is between", " MR. MADIGAN.  Yes", " MR. WARSH.  I apologize for the bad English that I offered before, but an alternative to the first sentence that you read that would, I think, be English to Jeff\u2019s fair point\u2014it would be to delete the word \u201ctarget.\u201d  So it says, \u201cTo establish a range for the federal funds rate between zero and \u00bc percent.\u201d  So those are your two options", " MR. FISHER.  Mr. Chairman, I can\u2019t support that, and I\u2019ll tell you why.  I do feel that we had an elegant solution in alternative A.  I firmly believe that if we target 0 to 25 basis points\u2014the effective funds rate we all know is trading at 1/16\u2014it is going to create enormous backlash.  It is unacceptable to me to say that the bankers will figure out how to deal with this.  They can\u2019t.  Second, as far as money market funds are concerned, the expense load is usually 30 basis points.  So for whatever it is worth, I will be a minority of one, but I cannot support that.  Alternative A was elegant in that it made no statement.  Then, and I think very important, by dwelling on this business of what our target rate is, we diminish what we\u2019re doing, and what we\u2019re doing is changing things fundamentally, which I fully support. So for whatever it\u2019s worth, I understand all the counter-arguments.  Janet and I have talked about this.  I know what people are going to say.  I think (a) it is an unnecessary distraction, (b) it creates a potential political backlash, and (c) it is counterproductive.  So I just want to state it myself straightforwardly and honestly\u2014I may be the only person at this table, but I\u2019ll vote against that.  If you give us alternative A, I\u2019ll vote for it.  I know I\u2019m one of 17 at this table\u2014there are more than 17 people at this table.  I apologize, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to make the funds rate clear.  It\u2019s implied in what we\u2019re doing, but alternative A gives people enough ambiguity to steer around it, and that\u2019s my opinion.  I apologize", " MR. KROSZNER.  I just want to underscore that, because that was my concern in moving toward B rather than A because I certainly agree that the economic substance is the same.  But I do think there\u2019s much more of an opportunity for misinterpretation by the market, and for us to say that we don\u2019t have control of the fed funds rate is the main concern that I have with A.  I think B is very clear.  The idea of talking about a range, including zero, is something that at least as far as I know the Fed has never done before, and I think that\u2019s an enormous shift.  That will be seen as a real shift.  But to go to A would have ambiguity and would be very difficult to explain to people who are not real aficionados that we\u2019re not saying, \u201cGosh, we really don\u2019t have the opportunity to fix the federal funds rate anymore.  That piece is broken", " MR. KOHN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  You should have gotten memos from the Subcommittee on Communications having to do with the longer-term projections.  In considering the trial run and also the current situation, in which the \u201909, \u201910, and \u201911 projections really weren\u2019t settling down and didn\u2019t look as though they would soon settle down into what would be consistent with where we would want things to be in the long term.  In these circumstances, the subcommittee thought it would be a good idea to go ahead with a quarterly extension of the projections to give the public a better idea of where we thought output, growth, employment, and inflation were expected to be over the longer run. We made four recommendations within that overall recommendation.  We recommended that we do it quarterly, not just once a year, and that the discussion be integrated with the rest of the quarterly projection process in the Summary of Economic Projections.  We also recommended that we continue to do this for total PCE inflation but, as we did in the trial run, not do it for core PCE to emphasize to the public that it was the total we were looking at over the long run and not the core.  We thought that the questionnaire should ask each participant to provide \u201cyour best assessment of the rate to which each variable would converge over the longer term (say, five to six years from now) in the absence of shocks and assuming appropriate monetary policy.\u201d  This would be something that didn\u2019t emphasize the fact that it was five or six years but where things would settle down and it might take five or six years to settle down.  So those are our recommendations.  Did I missing anything\u2014I\u2019m looking at the subcommittee members. After today\u2019s and yesterday\u2019s discussions, I think the subcommittee will also take another look at whether the Committee should move further in the direction of an inflation target and get some material to the Committee before the January meeting.  I think we are not looking for a vote on this today, but if anybody has any views about whether this is the appropriate direction in which to go, I would like to hear them", " MR. DUDLEY.  Yes", "   MR. LACKER.  In other words, I\u2019m saying that people who would provide funding also have a low demand or a low evaluation of the value of those securities.  This all amounts to a bunch of people out there putting a low value on these securities", " MR. LACKER.  What evidence do you have that their absence from the market doesn\u2019t reflect just adverse views about the value of the securities that we should treat the way we treat all other security evaluation decisions that market participants make", "  You are not bringing anything coherent that is\u2014 CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  There is an ongoing discussion about whether prices in markets are in some sense Pareto optimal prices or whether there is liquidity risk, other premiums, that the central bank could do something about.  I don\u2019t know any way to resolve it.  We have the same discussion each time.  President Hoenig", " MR. KOHN.  A comment and a question.  One comment, to follow up on your comment, Mr. Chairman, to President Lacker\u2014I think there\u2019s pretty good evidence that there are liquidity strains in the market, beyond just credit strains, impinging on the price of these securities.  One piece of evidence I would cite is the difference between on-the-run and the off-the-run Treasury security rates, which have gapped out by 40 or 50 basis points even from\u2014well, I\u2019m not even sure where they are relative to \u201998, but I think they\u2019re at record levels.  The unwillingness of people\u2014by \u201cpeople\u201d I mean market makers\u2014to take positions and to do trades\u2014their caution\u2014is affecting the pricing of all kinds of securities well beyond the credit risk, and obviously there\u2019s no difference in the credit risk in on-the-run and off-the-run Treasury securities", " MR. LACKER.  Excuse me.  The program doesn\u2019t exist yet.  Right now, today, is there anything that restricts a hedge fund in London from buying an asset-backed security", " MR. LACKER.  The reason I ask\u2014the point that I\u2019m making\u2014is that you can reference theories but, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not just those predictions.  It\u2019s the whole range of things about the theory.  We haven\u2019t, in this, seen many theories put on the table, and the ones that have been\u2014things like cash-in-the-market pricing\u2014just don\u2019t seem to match up well with the facts.  There\u2019s a gigantic, billions of dollars worth of investors out there who have the capability of buying any of this stuff.  In Treasuries, people are capable of arbitraging that on-the-run and off-the-run thing.  To explain this by appealing to some market segmentation seems really weak in this environment.  You know, I welcome discussing theories under which these are Pareto improving programs, but I haven\u2019t seen one that\u2019s convincing yet", " MR. ROSENGREN.  The loss of the securitization market is really important, so I think this facility is a very important innovation.  My question is, How important were the conduits to this market, and how confident are we that there will be structures to bring back the securitization market.  Or are we basically bridging to these things going on bank balance sheets or other types of financial intermediaries.  How do you see this.  I guess the question is, From your perspective, what is this a bridge to", "  [Laughter] MR. PLOSSER.  Excuse me, I read about it", " MR. LACKER.  I just want to raise two things that worry me.  One is that, when these programs are small, you subsidize X percent of the credit market.  The other 1 minus X percent, the effect on their rate of return, their borrowing costs, probably is small.  But when X gets near\u2014I don\u2019t know where it is now\u2014\u2153 or \u00bd, then our subsidization is raising borrowing costs for everyone who doesn\u2019t get money"]}
